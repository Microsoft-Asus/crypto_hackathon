While Generation X grew up with HTML5 platforms to build cities on, Millenials would clearly have the edge, as a company is fusing the best features of HTML5 with the futuristic blockchain technology. Massive City Building on The Blockchain\nLaunching on May 21, 2018, Mega Crypto Polis (MCP) is a fully featured, high-quality graphic, blockchain-based city builder game. Making use of decentralized, shared databases as its underlying technology, Mega Crypto Polis would allow users to run the game via any web browser, including those on a variety of mobile phone platforms while storing in-game assets on the Ethereum blockchain.\nUsing the Mega Crypto Polis platform, players from around the globe would be able to build the city of their dreams and utilizing the famed security and transparency features of the blockchain. Gameplay\nMoving a step above traditional city-building games, MCP players would be able to purchase land blocks on the decentralized city map using ETH, before proceeding to construct a range of buildings, such as commercial, production, or residential. Based on the type of building, “influence points” shall be generated, and this shall be in complete accordance to the building’s surrounding areas.\nAs per MCP’s White Book:\n“Influence defines a player position in the global and regional district leaderboards, as well as his share in taxes to be received on an Ethereum wallet each gaming circle (24 hours).”\nA salient feature of the game is that it is fully sustainable, and self-operating, meaning developers would not interfere in the game’s running after launch. Instead, the game very closely follows real-life, with each and every player action ultimately affect your own progress, thus, making it a competitive city-builder in its truest sense!\nFor example, building a residential building near a manufacturing facility would result in a lesser land value and subsequently lesser influence points. But, the presence of a commercial complex near a residential building would greatly increase the value of both types, as the game’s “residents” would enjoy a higher standard of living.\nThe initial cost for a single block will start from 0.015 ETH, with all blocks being hardcoded to rise up to 7.5 ETH – once all neighboring blocks are sold.\nIn short, MCP is arguably the world’s largest, and most impressive decentralized city-builder game, and only has one limit; of having no limits!\nIn essence, every completed block of land is represented as an ERC721 tоken on the blockchain, and this can be transferred and traded like a cryptocurrency, or integrated as a ‘block’ on external marketplaces. Furthermore, if a new player purchases an available land block or builds a mega-structure on a block around constructed blocks, a smart contract raises the price of the surrounding blocks of land. Taxes\nThe game enforces a tax on players based on the assets they own, and other key decisions, to fully simulate a one-of-a-kind city-building experience. Taxes are collected in the form of ETH.\nFurthermore, all collected taxes form an in-game district’s “Regional Budget,” and all regions together form the map-wide Federal Budget.\nShown below is the game’s algorithm for tax collections:\nWhere: Taxes ― player’s share in the overall taxes budget; ∑ABBP ― sum over all buildings owned by the player; Ip ― influence points of the exact building that belongs to the player during a calculated period; ∑BD ― total influence points in the district; Ib – the influence of a certain building in the total amount; DT – the sum of districts taxes for a calculated district; GTd – part of global taxes (in percent) from the district where the current building is located. Bounty Program\nA smart contract operated bounty is inbuilt to allow serious gamers to win exclusive land block areas, will be randomly distributed to registered users before the game’s launch.\nA time-limited incentivizing campaign will reward the most active members of the Mega Crypto Polis community.\nParticipants can increase their chances of receiving a bounty fulfilling a number of actions, such as joining MCP’s social channels, spreading the word on social forums, and writing about the game.\nThe Bounty Campaign can be registered here: https://megacryptopolis.com/bounty/\nMega Crypto Polis White Book: https://www.megacryptopolis.com/whitebook/MegaCryptoPolis.pdf\nYou can get in contact with the team via the following methods:\nBTCManager does not endorse any content or product on this page.

Price is on its way to the bottom around the $7,000 level.\nThe 100 SMA has crossed below the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the downside. In other words, the selloff could continue from here and support might even break. Note that the chart pattern spans $6,000 to $12,000 so the resulting downtrend could be of the same height.\nRSI is on the move down so bitcoin could follow suit while sellers have the upper hand. Stochastic is also moving down to signal that bearish pressure is in play. If support holds, though, bitcoin could make another move to the top at $9,000 or even attempt to break higher.\nInvestor sentiment appears to have turned sour as bitcoin has been unable to break out of its slump, drawing even more selling pressure. Traders could keep holding out for positive industry updates before reviving their long positions.\nMeanwhile, the dollar has been on a tear for the most part of the week, drawing strength from both fundamentals and risk sentiment. Geopolitical risk has supported the flight to safety while a few upside data points have supported tightening expectations and US bond yields, making the dollar the preferred safe-haven currency.\nFor now, it looks like bitcoin is still reeling from the selling of Mt. Gox units and the ongoing investigation into South Korea’s UPbit. This has revived regulatory concerns and once again put the trust of bitcoin exchanges to question.\nLooking ahead, this slump could go on until there’s another set of developments in the industry. For now, the focus seems to be on institutional investors looking to trade products based on digital assets as firms and exchanges prepare to include these in their offerings.\nBy Rachel Lee On May 18, 2018\nposted by David Ogden Entrepreneur\nAlan Zibluk Markethive Founding Member bitclub network bitcoin Price analysis Post navigation Hello, my name is Alan Zibluk.

Jack, en son yayınladığı dördüncü çeyrek mali bilanço tablosunda 39.9 milyar dolar kar elde ettiğini belirttiği ve trilyonlarca işlemlikticari hacmi olan Alibaba firması için güvenliğin en üst öneme sahip bir unsur olduğunu da vurguladı.\nMa, maalesef ki, ortaya çıkan blockchain endüstrisinin aldığı ilginin çoğunun, blockchaini devasa altın madeni olarak gören spekülatörlerden geldiğini de sözlerine ekledi. Ma, Bitcoin konusunda kripto paranın gelmiş geçmiş en iyi dönemini yaşadığı 2017 Aralık ayında bile temkinliydi:\nBitcoin hakkında hiçbir şey bilmiyorum. Birazcık kafam karıştı. Cidden işe yarasa bile küresel ticaret kuralları ve finansal sistemleri tamamen değişmek zorunda kalacak. Buna hazır olduğumuzu zannetmiyorum. Bu sebeple hala Alipaye, ABD dolarına ve Avroya dikkat ediyorum. Blockchain üzerine çalışmalar yapan bir takımımız var ancak Bitcoin peşinden gitmek istediğim bir şey değil. Bitcoin umurumuzda değil.\nBloombergin haberine göre, geçen sene Jack Ma, 41.8 milyar dolar net serveti ile Asya bölgesindeki en zengin adam unvanını elde etmişti. Alibaba üyesi Ant Financial tarafından yürütülen ve çok yoğun bir popülariteye sahip mobil ödeme uygulaması Alipay, tahmini olarak 450 milyon kullanıcıya sahip.\n2016 yazı gibi erken bir tarihte, Ant Financial, Çinli hayır kurumu endüstrisi ile olan işinin izlenebilirliğini ve güvenilirliğini arttırmak amacıyla blockchain teknolojisi kullanmaya başlamıştı. Bu duyurunun ertesi yılında firma, blockchain uzmanları işe almaya başlamıştı.\nBununla birlikte, Manın pozisyonuna paralel olarak, Alibaba Group, bünyesinde bulunan Alibaba Cloudun yeni piyasaya sürdüğü P2p Düğümleri ağının bir kripto para madencilik platformu olduğu iddialarını yalanlaması gibi örneklerle bir bakıma kripto paralara olan hoşgörüsünü kaybetti ve bunlara cephe aldı diyebiliriz. Bundan hemen sonra Nisan ayında ise Alibaba alt kuruluşu olan Taobao kendi platformundan bütün ICO ile ilgili reklamları yasaklama kararı almıştı.\n Kaynak: Coin Telegraph", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T03:21:25.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7dd30b82ccb6dec92037591d7722cf94c4f01d59", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQYTqNaU6JaODw5XoAnIogY0uVy2KQ06vya4QmfiLp1PHJmIlOXQ2rFSNsaxjNsYvW.cvmhP63Vw3.aASoune.Q9fn8FY0dyI86cRGFJYAdkA--", "site_full": "cyclingpeace.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://cyclingpeace.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Cycling Peace", "title": "Ethereum is top public blockchain, bitcoin No. 13 in China's new index | Reuters", "title_full": "Ethereum is top public blockchain, bitcoin No. 13 in China's new index | Reuters", "published": "2018-05-18T08:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7dd30b82ccb6dec92037591d7722cf94c4f01d59", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQYTqNaU6JaODw5XoAnIogY0uVy2KQ06vya4QmfiLp1PHJmIlOXQ2rFSNsaxjNsYvW.cvmhP63Vw3.aASoune.Q9fn8FY0dyI86cRGFJYAdkA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "F.A.

Bitcoin, the most mainstream cryptocurrency with the highest market capitalization, was ranked 13th in this report.\nThe rank was compiled and published by the China Center for Information Industry Development, which is directly under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China. The ranking assesses the technical strength, effectiveness and innovation of each public blockchain project.\nA blockchain is a shared database that is maintained by a computer network connected to the Internet and provides support for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.\nEthereum has a total score of 129.4 on the technology assessment index in the ranking. Ethereum has become the public blockchain for many initial coin offerings (ICO). An ICO is when a blockchain start-up issues and sells its own token to investors to raise funding for their project’s development.\nBitcoin, invented ten years ago, was only ranked 13th with a total score of 88, partly because Bitcoin has not provided a public blockchain that allows other applications or projects to be built upon it.\nSteem, Lisk, NEO, and Komodo was ranked second to fifth, with scores of 115.9, 104.8, 103, and 101.5 respectively. The index will be updated once a month, covering 28 public blockchain projects and their corresponding cryptocurrencies, according to Chinese state media reports.\nChina generally regards blockchain technology as an area of innovation. It is expected that public blockchain and dApps (decentralized applications) will become an important part of the economy of the future. However, since the second half of last year, the Chinese government has started cracking down on illegal ICO activities.\nAccording to the statistics of the World Intellectual Property Organization database, China was the most active country for blockchain patent applications last year globally.\nThere are more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies with a total market value of nearly US$380 billion currently, according to Coinmarketcap.com, a digital currency tracker.\nBitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency and the latest transaction price on the BitStand platform is US$8,153.39.

Some cryptocurrency entrepreneurs got to that point more quickly and voluntarily. By Jeffrey Kutler Cutting Costs Doesn’t Mean Cutting Corners (and Matters More Than Ever)\nMark Zuckerberg started Facebook in 2004. But it wasn’t until April 10, 2018 that he found himself sitting in the glare of a congressional hearing in Washington, D.C. Under fire for data policies - or lack of them - that resulted in the misuse of personal information for political ends, Facebook’s CEO conceded in one resounding soundbite : “I think that it is inevitable that there will need to be some regulation” of heretofore unfettered Internet services.\nCompare Zuckerberg's journey, leading a high-profile public company on an avowed mission to “bring the world closer together,” with that of his onetime Harvard-student partners Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. Their claims that Zuckerberg stole their ideas for Facebook, as dramatized in the 2010 film The Social Network, led to a reported $65 million legal settlement. They became Bitcoin investors and in 2013 said that they held $11 million in cryptocurrency, a hoard that would have been worth about $1 billion at the market peak late last year.\nBitcoin’s pseudonymous inventor — Satoshi Nakamoto — and early enthusiasts fell somewhere on the political spectrum between libertarian and anarchist, but the Winklevosses went into the cryptocurrency exchange business and chose not to go rogue. In 2014 they founded Gemini Trust Co. — “Gemini” because they are twins, “trust company” for the type of charter granted the following year by the New York State Department of Financial Services.\nAt www.gemini.com, the company proclaims its trading and custodial services to be “institutional grade” and, in stressing its fiduciary responsibilities, says, “we must meet the capitalization, compliance, anti-money-laundering, consumer protection, and cybersecurity requirements as set forth by the NYSDFS and protect the interests of our customers first and foremost.”\nGemini worked with Cboe Global Markets to launch the first Bitcoin futures contracts in December. In April, Gemini took a step common to many securities exchanges around the world, adopting SMARTS Market Surveillance technology, an offering of Nasdaq.\n“Since launch, Gemini has aggressively pursued comprehensive compliance and surveillance programs, which we believe betters our exchange and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole,” Tyler Winklevoss said in the announcement. SMARTS “will help ensure that Gemini is a rules-based marketplace for all market participants,” he said.\nZuckerberg and his frenemies ultimately found common ground in acceptance of regulation and compliance. Their convergence puts a favorable gloss on regulation at a time when deregulation is in vogue and Congress and the Trump administration are chipping away at the Dodd-Frank Act. Such roll-back initiatives are, by definition, retrospective. Issues surrounding digital currencies, initial coin offerings (ICOs), the underlying blockchain technology, and fintech as a whole force all parties to be forward-looking, and the dialogue is remarkably harmonious. Both Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair J. Christopher Giancarlo and Securities and Exchange Commission member Hester Pierce have expressed receptivity to innovation, or at least learning more about it.\nStill, there are uncleared hurdles. The Winklevosses have yet to win SEC approval for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, though they were awarded a U.S. patent on May 8 for “systems, methods, and program products for operating exchange-traded products holding digital math-based assets.” On May 14, New York State authorized their Gemini exchange to offer custody and trading services in three additional emerging currencies: Zcash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.\nAnd they are far from alone in pursuing a “within the system” strategy that welcomes and even embraces regulation.\n“It's hard to do this credibly if you're not part of the financial system,” says Charles Cascarilla, co-founder and CEO of Paxos Trust Co., whose company was chartered in New York State five months before Gemini, under the name itBit Trust Co., in May 2015. The bona fides of Paxos' blockchain settlement technology for capital markets and precious metals and the itBit Bitcoin exchange are underscored by the 80-employee company's board of directors, which includes former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chair Sheila Bair, ex-New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, and retired NYSE Euronext chief executive Duncan Niederauer.\nTo be sure, crypto and fintech regulation are works in progress, and it is only natural — even constructive — for there to be pro-and-con tension. Entities including the CFTC, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority, and several U.S. states have supported lightly supervised “sandboxes” to encourage safe experimentation by entrepreneurs. That contrasts with New York's bid to construct a regulatory framework; aside from the trust companies, the Empire State has since 2015 licensed four virtual currency operations.\nThe so-called BitLicense has been criticized in crypto circles as too onerous; KrakenFX CEO Jesse Powell recently tweeted, in reaction to a questionnaire from the New York attorney general's office, that the state is “hostile to crypto.” (Powell has said that SEC registration - currently optional but potentially mandatory for crypto platforms - is a more likely path for Kraken.)\nHowever, one BitLicensee, XRP II, is associated with Ripple, a blockchain company positioning itself as a partner of traditional banks. Former New York State financial services superintendent Ben Lawsky, architect of the BitLicense, is a Ripple director.\nAnother BitLicensee, Coinbase, responded positively to the New York questionnaire, saying it supports “action to bring further transparency to the virtual currency markets. We are happy to provide information about the policies and programs we have in place to help ensure our customers can safely transact and invest in virtual currencies.”\nPerhaps no one has stated it quite as directly as Eric Demuth, co-CEO of the Vienna-based Bitpanda exchange, in a May 7 Bloomberg article: “We'd be happy to have regulations, so we know where we stand.”\nJeffrey Kutler is editor-in-chief of Risk Professional magazine, published by the Global Association of Risk Professionals.

There is a major bearish trend line formed with resistance at $1,250 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is currently correcting higher, but it may face many barriers on the upside near $1,240-50. Bitcoin cash price is under pressure below $1,300 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD is likely to extend declines further if it fails to move above $1,250.\nBitcoin Cash Price Decline Recently, there was a minor upside correction above $1,300 in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price traded towards $1,340 where sellers appeared and protected more upsides. As a result, the price started a fresh downside move and declined back below $1,300. Sellers gained momentum, which pushed the price even below the $1,240 and $1,220 support levels.\nThe decline was such that the price almost tested the $1,150 level. A low was formed at $1,156 from where an upside correction is currently underway. It is currently testing the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,339 high to $1,156 low. However, there are many hurdles on the upside for buyers near $1,220-50. There is also a major bearish trend line formed with resistance at $1,250 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,339 high to $1,156 low is near $1,248 to act as a resistance.\nLooking at the chart , the price is clearly under bearish pressure below $1,250.

hovered above $8,000 as it struggled to hold gains, pressured by falling demand for cryptos.\nBitcoin fell 1.15% to $8,195.0 on the Bitfinex exchange as it gave up some of its gains after rising to a session high of $8,482.2.\nThe total market cap of cryptocurrencies fell to about $375 billion, at the time of writing, from about above $400 billion last week, pointing to a lack of investor demand in the wake of renewed regulatory pressures following last week’s raid on South Korea’s largest crypto exchange, Upbit.\nThe weakness in bitcoin also comes amid disappointment at the popular crypto’s failure to stage a rally during the annual Blockchain conference, Consensus, which took place earlier this week.\nIn the run up to the conference some analysts had claimed it would act as the touch-paper for a rally in bitcoin.\n“Bottom line: We expect BTC and cryptocurrencies to behave similarly to prior years and rally during Consensus,” Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors said prior to the Consensus conference.\nThe downward move in bitcoin was mirrored by other large-cap cryptocurrencies.\nRipple XRP fell 0.67% to $0.67792 on the Poloniex exchange, while Ethereum fell 1.10% to $689.87.\nBitcoin Cash fell 2.11% to $1,238.70, while Litecoin fell 2.23% to $135.13.\nRelated Articles\nBlockchain Conference Thought to Push Cryptos’ Prices Higher; Didn’t Happen\nBitmain Aspires to

report from Business Insider Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service. To learn more about Business Insider Intelligence, click here.Fintech broke onto the scene as a disruptive force following the 2008 crisis, but the industry's influence on the broader financial services system is changing. Fintech - Industry - Services - Proper - Finance The fintech industry no longer stands clearly apart from financial services proper, and is increasingly growing embedded in mainstream finance. We're now seeing the initial stages of this transformation.For instance, funding is growing more internationally distributed, and startups are making necessary adjustments to prove sustainability and secure a seat at the table. Most fintech segments in the ascendant a year ago have continued to rise and grow more valuable to the broader financial system. Meanwhile, several fintech categories have had to make adjustments to stay on top. New subsegments are also appearing on the scene — such as digital identity verification fintechs — as new opportunities for innovation are discovered. Incumbents - Influence - Fintech - Updates - Channels Significantly, incumbents are responding more proactively to the rising influence of fintech by making updates to their consumer-facing channels, back-end systems, and overall business operations. Most are realizing that the best way to adapt is to work alongside the fintechs that are transforming the financial services environment, either by partnering with them or acquiring the startups entirely. As fintech's power grows, incumbents will have no choice but to change in order to stay relevant and competitive. All around, fintech is becoming embedded in mainstream finance.Business Insider Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has written the definitive Fintech Ecosystem report that looks at the shifts in the broader environment that fintechs operate in, including funding patterns and regulatory trends; examines the adaptations that some of fintech's biggest subsegments have had to make to secure a foothold in the financial services system; and discusses...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "paypal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fintech", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "business insider intelligence", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T07:37:39.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "621fccf21b556dd2bc29c45d8745d7f964647af7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQujfav8g98PjRMi_ogV.5EwBTfg476RyQTDSgxkAAVMDzwBylHEwcvU_AfCP2pnt2Xq2Zw305fYIZ5L67_mG0s2_DXkg_XcAc_6_Q6zPGd5spekt8JmOpy", "site_full": "www.thelincolnianonline.com", "site": "thelincolnianonline.com", "site_section": "http://www.thelincolnianonline.com/feed", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "The Lincolnian Online", "title": "Bitcoin Fast (BCF) Trading Down 57.8% Over Last 7 Days", "title_full": "Bitcoin Fast (BCF) Trading Down 57.8% Over Last 7 Days", "published": "2018-05-18T07:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/747.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "621fccf21b556dd2bc29c45d8745d7f964647af7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQujfav8g98PjRMi_ogV.5EwBTfg476RyQTDSgxkAAVMDzwBylHEwcvU_AfCP2pnt2Xq2Zw305fYIZ5L67_mG0s2_DXkg_XcAc_6_Q6zPGd5spekt8JmOpy", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Stephan Jacobs", "published": "2018-05-18T07:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Fast (BCF) Trading Down 57.8% Over Last 7 Days", "text": "Bitcoin Fast (BCF) Trading Down 57.8% Over Last 7 Days Posted by Stephan Jacobs | May 17th, 2018\nBitcoin Fast (CURRENCY:BCF) traded 50.5% lower against the U.S. dollar during the 1 day period ending at 22:00 PM Eastern on May 10th.

In PoS-based cryptocurrencies, the creator of the next block is chosen via various combinations of random selection and wealth or age ( i.e., the stake). In contrast, the algorithm of proof-of-work -based cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin uses mining ; that is, the solving of computationally intensive puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks.\nWhy? Because by the time all the Bitcoin are mined...our planet will not have any more electricity for anything else...!\nBitcoin Mining Could Use 0.5% of World’s Electricity Energy in 2018\nA recently released peer-reviewed article by blockchain evangelist and financial economist Alex de Vries deployed a novel methodology to determine Bitcoin’s energy usage a few years from now, and the estimated results are certainly astonishing. Pay with Bitcoin or Power a Home? Published on May 16 on Joule , de Vries made use of complex economic models, coupled with publically available electricity costs and mining statistics, with the intentions of producing a scientific paper that companies and individuals can base their research on. According to de Vries, the worldwide minimum current requirement of Bitcoin is 2.55 gigawatts, equivalent to the electricity usage of Ireland, the world’s 118th largest country by landmass. The researcher also states that this amount equals to half a percent of the world’s total electricity usage. The report suggests that bitcoin mining power consumption this year could equal the usage of Austria. Furthermore, every transaction via the Bitcoin network uses up enough electricity to power an average home in the Netherlands. De Vries, who currently works with PwC Netherlands, believes that the world’s pioneer cryptocurrency may end up using 7.7 gigawatts to power its network by the end of this year, a figure equal to the electricity usage of Austria! Bad for Bitcoin, Bad For Climate The huge costs associated with Bitcoin mining – a process that “timestamps” transactions and performs extensive calculations – has been a subject of criticism since years. And with the increase in the network’s size, the costs are further poised to grow, possibly consuming 5 percent of the world’s total electricity in the future. De Vries notes: You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you’re using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there’s a big incentive for people to increase how much they’re spending on electricity and on machines. Applying economic principles to the Bitcoin protocol highly suggests the network reaching a point of equilibrium, which would see the miner’s bitcoin incentives become equal to the computing, hardware, and electricity costs involved. With that in mind, de Vries extrapolated present data to that of the equilibrium point, to determine electricity costs and economic implications in running the Bitcoin network during that period Sources May Have Skewed Results A telling point remains that of utilizing public data, which de Vries feels could be misleading. Mining companies like Bitmain are highly secretive operations, and official documents pertaining to their operations are largely unavailable. However, de Vries is confident of his prediction, and says: Sometimes the best information we’ve got is really shaky eyewitness accounts. That’s the stuff we have to work with. The researcher believes that his paper can be referred to by governments and regulatory bodies prior to placing restrictions or introducing laws, as its peer-reviewed, scientific nature supersedes that of anecdotal evidence and weakly researched publications.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex de

research report from Business Insider Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service. To learn more about Business Insider Intelligence,click here.Fintech broke onto the scene as a disruptive force following the 2008 crisis, but theindustry's influence on the broader financial services system is changing.The fintech industry no longer stands clearly apart from financial services proper,and is increasingly growing embedded in mainstream finance. We're now seeing the initial stages of this transformation.For instance, funding is growing more internationally distributed, and startups are making necessary adjustments to prove sustainability and secure a seat at the table. Most fintech segments in the ascendant a year ago have continued to rise and grow more valuable to the broader financial system.Meanwhile, several fintech categories have had to make adjustments to stay on top. New subsegments are also appearing on the scene ' such as digital identity verification fintechs ' as new opportunities for innovation are discovered.Significantly, incumbents are responding more proactively to the rising influence of fintech by making updates to their consumer-facing channels, back-end systems, and overall business operations.Most are realizing that the best way to adapt is to work alongside the fintechs that are transforming the financial services environment, either by partnering with them or acquiring the startups entirely. As fintech's power grows, incumbents will have no choice but to change in order to stay relevant and competitive. All around,fintech is becoming embedded in mainstream finance.Business Insider Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has written the definitive Fintech Ecosystem report that looks at the shifts in the broader environment that fintechs operate in, including funding patterns and regulatory trends; examines the adaptations that some of fintech's biggest subsegments have had to make to secure a foothold in the financial services system; and discusses how the continued rise of the fintech industry is pressuring incumbents to make fundamental changes to their business models and roles. It ends by assessing what a global economy increasingly influenced by innovative fintechs will look like.Here are some key takeaways from the report:The fintech industry is far more than a group of digitally native, consumer-centric startups, although they are, in many ways, becoming the new face of financial services. It's increasingly clear that fintech no longer stands apart from financial services proper, and is morphing into an integral part of the financial system.To secure their position in the mainstream economy, some of the main fintech subsegments have had to adjust their business models. These include neobanks, robo-advisors, and alt lenders. Other fintech categories, meanwhile, have instead found that current conditions are well suited to their original models, and are seeing largely smooth sailing, like regtechs, insurtechs, and payments fintechs. Innovation and dynamism is still alive in fintech too, with new categories still emerging.The rising influence of fintechs is having a dramatic effect on incumbents, from banks to insurers to wealth managers, pushing them to respond proactively to stay relevant.Incumbents are reacting to changes wrought by fintechs on three key fronts: the front end, the back end, and in their core business operations. As such, incumbents and fintechs are converging on a digital middle ground.As this happens, the fintech industry is on the cusp of becoming an integral component of the broader financial services ecosystem. But it will likely first have to go through a complete credit cycle, and survive an economic downturn like the one that set the stage for its arrival in 2008, for this to happen.In full, the report:Looks athow the environment in which the fintech industry operates is changing, and what that means for the digitization of financial services.Gives an overview of the main subsegments within the global fintech industry, and discusses which categories have had to adapt to survive, which have reaped benefits from their original game plans, and which new segments have come to the fore in the past twelve months.Outlines the adaptations that incumbent financial institutions have begun making to adjust to an economy that's inevitably shifting to digital, and in which tech-savvy fintechs are increasingly setting the standards.Discusses what the future of financial services will look like as fintech embeds itself into the financial mainstream.

So when major players in the space double down on one coin in particular, it's worth taking notice.On Tuesday, the Winklevoss twin's bitcoin exchange Gemini announced the addition of trading and custody for a coin called zcash, starting May 22. The price of zcash quickly shot up more than 40% on the news, from around $250 a coin to over $360. The US-based Gemini is small compared to other cryptocurrency exchanges, but it is also fairly selective. The exchange presently only lets users trade the two most popular cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and ethereum, so the addition of a new coin is a sign that it sees a future for zcash.Zcash is a lot like bitcoin in that it lives on blockchain technology and is designed to be used as digital money. But it has one key thing that bitcoin doesn't: privacy.Gemini's VP of engineering Eric Winer called it \"a truly innovative privacy coin that offers confidentiality for peer-to-peer transactions similar to those afforded\" by normal money.This is because unlike bitcoin, which keeps a permanent record of every single transaction in meticulous detail, zcash lets users choose when to hide their identity or the amount of currency being moved around.Here's what you need to know about zcash:Zcash is run by a venture-backed startup, but it's open sourceZcash (ZEC) is a decentralized cryptocurrency designed and maintained by theZerocoin Electric Coin Company, or Zcash Company, a venture-backed startup founded by Zooko Wilcox (that's his real name, though the Z in Zcash apparently stands for zero, not Zooko).Zcash Company built the platform and pays a team of engineers to maintain it, while the Foundation supportseducation and community efforts, like grants to grow the space.Down the line, the Foundation will take on a more active role, the company said.Because zcash is open source, anyone with the technical know-how can make changes to the code and create what's known in the space as a \"hard fork\"an update which splits the cryptocurrency into two different coins. But at the moment, it is Zcash Company which issues official updates to the network.Today, there are around 3.9 million zcash coins in the world. Like bitcoin, zcash transactions are processed by miners who volunteer their computer power in exchange for newly generated coins.But unlike on bitcoin, when a miner mines zcash, some of the newly generated coins go to the Zcash Company and Foundation.The company treats these coins as revenue, and use them to pay its engineers and leadership team, as well as investors.Zcash is like bitcoin but transactions can be made privatelyZcash is designed to be more practical than other cryptocurrencies.\"It's similar to bitcoin in most respects,\" said Jack Gavigan, chief operating officer at Zcash Company. \"The key difference is that with bitcoin, all details are transparently visible on the bitcoin blockchain, and with zcash you have the option of shielding the coin.\"Shielding the coin means that in any given transaction, the sender and receiver can hide their identities as well as the amount of currency being moved. The blockchain will record that a shielded transaction occurred, but it won't say what specifically happened.Gavigan believes this makes zcash more friendly to both consumers and privacy-focused regulations like Europe's GDPRtwo factors which could increase the chance of the cryptocurrency being used by businesses or by average people in their day-to-day lives.\"Privacy is a common requirement that people want and it's mandated by law in certain jurisdictions,\" Gavigan said. \"Would you like it if your credit card statements and bank statement were published on the internet'\"But zcash also lets people leave their transactions public, which may be useful in some case, such as auditing \"how foreign aid is distributed or paid.\" It means a single cryptocurrency can be used to privately pay rent or receive a salary, as well as publicly move money across borders.It also costs less money to make transactions on the blockchainOne concern that has emerged with bitcoin is that its price-per-transaction can get so expensive at times that it is impractical to make small purchases using the cryptocurrency. In December, for example, when bitcoin was at its peak price, it cost up to $55 in mining fees to make a single transaction. So if you bought a $1 item using bitcoin at that time, you paid $55 in fees on that purchase.But this isn't an issue with zcash since it has larger block sizes and blocks are created more frequently on zcash than they are on bitcoin, according to Gavigan. Zcash blocks are mined every 2.5 minutes, compared to every 10 minutes on bitcoin.But like bitcoin, it could also fork at any time. The code is open source, and it's possible that there will be disagreements in the zcash community which are so disruptive that two separate coins are created.You can read more about forks here.This has happened with bitcoin numerous times, which is how we ended up with both bitcoin and bitcoin cash. And while it could happen with zcash eventually, Gavigan doesn't foresee any major forks in the future.However, there are still upgrades coming. The zcash crew is preparing a new edition of zcash called Sapling, which it will release in September.Currently, transactions on zcash take 30 to 40 seconds to process since the cryptography associated with the coin is so intense. But Gavigan said the update with drastically reduce this processing time, \"bring more efficient transactions and open up the usability of zcash a bit more.\"SEE ALSO:Here's everything you need to know about blockchains, the ground-breaking tech that could be as disruptive as the internetJoin the conversation about this storyNOW WATCH: NBA ref explains why the James Harden step-back jumper isn't traveling", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.businessinsider.com/zcash-price-zec-gemini-mining-what-you-need-to-know-2018-5"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zcash", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "winklevoss", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T13:29:40.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7dddfac6d7fc5babe8820d686a0f0b346dc45143", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.XL1UWd_wAib9rSxIVUc3JPlRyJ7sqISPip4Upw0_ZlWZzYG6Bi5P.EMn0ftnF3XeujzWd70UgWXO7gGg1QqiN5.zGVwkf7E7a8wVOTM9Yiyeb6jIVXOi25KBd3DVRMC0-", "site_full": "www.zobo.co.za", "site": "zobo.co.za", "site_section": "http://www.zobo.co.za/feed/gauteng-news", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Gauteng News | Zobo.co.za:South Africa News, Updated Every Minute", "title": "Ekasi Bucks to launch ‘world’s first crypto-mall, bitcoin taxis for townships’", "title_full": "Ekasi Bucks to launch ‘world’s first crypto-mall, bitcoin taxis for townships’", "published": "2018-05-18T07:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7dddfac6d7fc5babe8820d686a0f0b346dc45143", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.XL1UWd_wAib9rSxIVUc3JPlRyJ7sqISPip4Upw0_ZlWZzYG6Bi5P.EMn0ftnF3XeujzWd70UgWXO7gGg1QqiN5.zGVwkf7E7a8wVOTM9Yiyeb6jIVXOi25KBd3DVRMC0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-18T07:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ekasi Bucks to launch ‘world’s first crypto-mall, bitcoin taxis for townships’", "text": "Ekasi Bucks to launch ‘world’s first crypto-mall, bitcoin taxis for townships’\nThe two services will be unveiled this Monday (21 May) by the startup in three launches in Gauteng, namely in Mabopane, Soshanguve and Soweto.

(example: 4.5)\nEach bitcointalk member is allowed one score per sports book. If you have already voted for a site in the past and have a change in heart and would like to change your score please post again saying you change your score from x to y so I can update the rankings accordingly. I will update the ranks often in this first post. This will only work with the help of the betting community and your honest score for each site that you have used. Thank you!\nI will include all relevant sports books. If I am missing any please feel free to say so and I will add them if I feel like it.\nNote: Some of the links above are referral links and I will receive commission if you make an account through them.

Yet, he outlines that there are two things that need to happen before that – better structuring as well as a comprehensive life cycle after Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Enhanced Structure – What Does it Mean? As for the first premise for a potential Bitcoin price surge, Masters outlines that the structure of cryptocurrencies has to continue to build. In his words: We need to see this [cryptocurrency] structure continue to build, […] We need to see the custody solutions come and be provided. We need indices and we need performance measures where we can actually start to understand what we’re talking about and measure our performance. With this, Masters hints that there are plenty of ways for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to go prior to reaching a state of maturity. In other words, the field is still in a rather early stage of its life cycle. To build on to that point, the Chairman of CoinShares says: We’re not even at the part yet where I’d say institutional investors even started in commodities. Because these things — indexation, custody and so on — aren’t there to bring in those bigger people just yet. A lot of things have to come together to solidify the structure of cryptocurrencies. For one, clear regulations have to be laid down. Cryptocurrencies need to be defined. Governments across the world seem to be torn in the way they see them. While some countries like Thailand have already stepped forward to regulate cryptocurrencies as digital assets, others are still to take serious legislative actions. ICOs – An Important Part Masters also stressed the importance of ICOs, and, most importantly, the way they turn out after the fundraising event is finished: We need to do more mature work around the ICOs, so that post ICO we have a token life cycle, […] And just give investors more clarity, better expectations, more transparency. The statements do have a lot of merit behind them. As it turns out, almost half of the ICOs didn’t have any development work done before the ICO itself. What is more, it also seems that the post ICO performance is also poor due to the lack of value of the assets which are being sold. In other words, the tokens people are investing in are not really needed for the system, as noted by a study from ICORating . With such improvements in the cryptocurrency sphere showing that the space is maturing, Masters believes that a rally in the price of Bitcoin will happen.

One major misconception is the notion that bitcoin will replace gold as a monetary instrument. Some analysts, once stanch precious metals advocates now turned crypto aficionados, believe in such theories that there is too much gold in the world to be used as money or that it is now just a barbarous relic. Just a year or so ago, these same supposed analysts were criticizing the Mainstream media financial network talking heads for calling gold as a barbarous relic, but now have jumped on the bandwagon.\nWell, in one small way, who can blame them. It has been frustrating holding onto gold and silver patiently waiting for their inevitable rise. So, when Bitcoin and the crypto prices moved up exponentially last year, promising investors vast riches in the future, it was easy for many to drop the precious metals and move into the crypto market. The mindset today is to make lots of money doing nothing. Thus, it’s not surprising to see many fall into this delusion and way of thinking .\nA few of the crypto aficionados tell their followers that gold can’t be a monetary asset because there are millions of tons of gold hidden in secret vaults or that there are billions of ounces locked away in the Grand Canyon. While this may sound like quite an interesting conspiracy, there is no sound evidence to back it up. To believe in these fanciful conspiracies defies all logic. However, with the logic being in short supply currently, I am not surprised that many believe in these fairy tales.\nOne of these ex-precious metals, now a highly qualified cryptoanalyst, suggested in a recent video that the “Gold is owned by the Bankers” so why would you want to own gold? Unfortunately, this is a false statement . While the Central banks own a lot of gold, it’s a lot less than what the private investors and jewelry owners hold. According to the World Gold Council, jewelry accounted for the largest stocks of above ground gold at 90,700 metric tons (mt), followed by 40,000 mt of private investment, 32,600 mt of Central bank holdings and 26,700 mt of Industrial usage and other:\nOf the total 190,000 mt of the world above ground gold stocks, jewelry consists of 48%, private investment 21%, Central bank 17%, and Industrial and other at 14% (Source: World Gold Council – Total above-ground stocks 2017 ) So, if we realize that nearly half of all above-ground gold stocks are in the form of jewelry, and then another 21% is owned by private investors, Central banks DO NOT own most of the gold. Even if we compare private investment to Official holdings, private investors own more gold than Central banks.\nNow, to the incorrect theory that there are millions of tons of gold in the world, can someone please tell me where all this additional gold came from?? If we understand that the increase in gold mine production paralleled the rise in silver and copper production, how could there be 10-20 times more gold than copper and silver???\nFirst, most of the gold ever mined was produced after 1900:\nAccording to the best data, we can get our hands on, 91% of all gold mined since 1493 was produced after 1900. Limited records of gold produced before 1493 suggest that wasn’t more than 10,000-15,000 mt.\nSecondly, if we look at historical world silver production, we see the same pattern:\nOf the total 48.5 billion oz of silver mined in the world between 1493 and 2016, 81% of it was produced after 1900. Also, the amount of silver mined annually compared to gold has been about 10 to 1. Assuming that total historical silver production was approximately 55 billion oz compared to 5.7 billion oz of gold, it turns out to be nearly a 10/1 ratio.\nFor there to be just 1 million tons of gold in above-ground stocks in the world, that would equal 32 billion oz of gold. Considering a 10/1 ratio of silver to gold production, then we should have mined 300+ billion oz of silver, not the 55 billion oz stated by the world authorities.\nSo, if we understand the logic here, why on earth do people continue to believe in the LOUSY CONSPIRACY that there are millions of tons of gold in the world?? Why, because lousy conspiracies sell a hell of a lot more newsletters and subscriptions than those that put out the facts and fundamentals.\nRegardless, Central banks own less gold than above ground jewelry stocks or private investors. While Central banks are controlling the gold and silver prices by funneling 99%+ of investors into stocks, bonds, real estate and cryptos, they cannot manipulate the price of precious metals too far below their cost of production.\nUnfortunately, the crypto aficionados do not understand energy or the cost of production as a FLOOR for the gold and silver prices. Which means, the Central banks cannot push the price of gold and silver anywhere they please. What the Central banks CAN DO, is that they can BAMBOOZLE the public in putting their funds into the biggest Ponzi Schemes in history. By funneling the public’s money into stocks, bonds, and real estate, this caps the gold and silver price. This is the manipulation.\nNow, the notion that Bitcoin will replace gold as the King Monetary Asset is patently false because Bitcoin fails several important tests. First, Bitcoin trading volatility is too high to be used as a currency. I have heard from several people that using Bitcoin as a payment method is very frustrating because the price can fluctuate $1,000 in a very short time, thus making it a very stressful transaction for both buyer and seller.\nIf we compare the volatility of Bitcoin versus gold and fiat currencies, Bitcoin is the clear loser:\nBitcoin’s 30-day volatility of 3.73% is nearly 9 times more gold and 10 times more than the USD/EUR (US Dollar-Euro). While Bitcoin’s volatility could continue to decline in the future, it still needs a very high-tech electronic system to allow trade and payment.\nSecondly, Bitcoin and cryptos will not function well as the EROI of energy continues to fall, destroying the ability to scale up or maintain high technology . I recently watched a documentary about the Dark Ages on the history channel. After the fall of the ancient western Roman Empire (5th century), people who lived around the once great city in the 6th and 7th century knew that life was better in the past because they saw all these massive buildings and structures, but were now living mostly a peasant’s life.\nIn just 3-4 generations, people no longer remembered what it was like to live in Rome during its heyday. The great culture, technology, food, and trade of the ancient Roman Empire were gone for good. Most Americans today have no idea what life is like after a collapse of society.\nNot only will Bitcoin and the cryptos not survive the coming Falling EROI energy collapse, either will most of the advanced technology. Sure, some technology will be around, but it will claim the same fate as the ancient Roman Empire. For this reason, gold will always remain the KING MONETARY METAL and asset.\nUnfortunately, the crypto aficionados do not understand the Falling EROI of energy as they mislead their followers into investing in just another fly-by-night bubble.\nCheck back for new articles and updates at the SRSrocco Report .

Even though there have been restrictions from the Chinese government to adopt digital currencies, cryptocurrencies are becoming globally accepted, and this App is a futuristic approach to use Bitcoin.\nThe Chinese based smartphone manufacturer has partnered with BTC.com, a subsidiary of Bitmain to roll out the mobile Bitcoin wallet. However, the App will come pre-installed in Huawei’s new devices which include the Huawei Honor models. For the older models, the App will be available in AppGallery for download. AppGallery is a proprietary store associated with Huawei that was launched early March. The AppStore was developed after restriction by the Chinese government to make the app available in Google Play AppStore and Apple’s iTunes store.\nMoreover, the Store will also be available in the form of a pre-install in modern Huawei devices, but it is expected that in the second quarter of 2018, it will be available for older Huawei versions.\nAccording to Huawei Mobile services Vice president Dr. Jaime Gonzalo, the use of digital currency has expanded how human perceive digital economies from a broader scope. Thus, the rolled out bitcoin wallet app to Buy Bitcoin should bring about extensive growth in the use of global cryptocurrencies.\nSimilar insights were given by BTC.com the giant Bitcoin mining Vice president Alejandro de la Torre. He said that the partnership would beef up the operations of BTC.com development of cryptocurrencies and blockchain.\nHuawei has been trying to keep up with blockchain developments and adoption of cryptocurrencies. Previously, the smartphone manufacturer had launched a platform a month ago that is similar to the blockchain, it is commonly referred to as Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS). The platform was built on Hyperledger Fabric 1.0 technology which is a development from Linux. Huawei is still a member of the consortium launched in 2016 which incorporates Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Blockchain.\nThe Bitcoin wallet app from AppGallery was reviewed and officially released to different countries for download not including China’s mainland. This is a result of China’s continued crackdown on cryptocurrency trading in local markets. Initially, the Chinese government banned all Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). The move followed a close down of all domestic BTC exchanges.\nWith Huawei being the largest mobile device provider in China, the adoption of the Wallet App is expected to bring growth to the market for cryptocurrencies. This is undoubtedly the best time for Huawei and BTC.com to roll out the partnership as most of Chinese are expected to spend most of their time on mobile devices. Nonetheless, mobile payments are becoming popular in China after major companies such as Alibaba are accepting digital currencies for their mobile payments. Other local companies are also providing financial services on digital payments irrespective of the continued crackdown on cryptocurrency trading in China.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://paxful.com/buy-bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin wallet", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "huawei", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "app store", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "app store huawei", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T12:38:26.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "10402daa3115dbe2140d4ea2a90fdffb7020d6de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYC9jl9sjpYm_QfrcNOfeKU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Do you think we should move away from Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Do you think we should move away from Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-18T06:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.03, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "10402daa3115dbe2140d4ea2a90fdffb7020d6de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYC9jl9sjpYm_QfrcNOfeKU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Crypdon", "published": "2018-05-18T06:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Do you think we should move away from Bitcoin?", "text": "It would be nice to move away from bitcoins and into better currencies like ethereum which has a better use.

(Reuters) A sessions court here today issued an arrest warrant against former Gujarat BJP MLA Nalin Kotadiya in a bitcoin extortion case, in which several police officials have been taken into custody so far. The case pertains to alleged extortion of the virtual currency worth crores from a Surat-based builder. Additional sessions judge P J Tamakuwala allowed the state CID-Crime’s plea for issuance of an arrest warrant under Section 70 of the CrPC. The CID-Crime had issued two summonses against the ex-MLA directing him to appear before it under section 160 of CrPC, but the latter didn’t oblige. The CID-Crime plea had said that Kotadiya has been evading arrest.\nIn its application, moved on May 14, the CID told the court that the former Dhari MLA need to be arrested as he allegedly played a significant role in the crime. Several police officials, including Amreli district superintendent of police Jagdish Patel and an inspector of the local crime branch, were arrested in the case. “Investigations clearly show that Nalin Kotadiya’s name has emerged in the said offences and (he) has played a vital role and was part of a conspiracy and has also received monitory gain,” judge Tamakuwala stated in his order issuing the arrest warrant.\n“There are evidence to substantiate the allegation that Nalin Kotadiya is an accused of a non-bailable offence and is evading arrest. There is sufficient material on record satisfying about the involvement of Kotadiya in the stated non-bailable offences,” the judge noted. The CID told the court that Kotadiya has been untraceable and could not be found by police teams that had visited his residence as well as a place in Amreli district where he was believed to be hiding. Though Kotadiya sent a fax on May 7 stating that he would appear before the investigators on May 12, he did not oblige, the CID told the court. “We have concrete evidence against Kotadiya.\nHe is a highly influential person with a political background. He is not cooperating in the investigation and is hiding which is delaying the investigation. “With a warrant under section 70 of CrPC, CID (Crime) can inform the Gujarat Police and other agencies, and take help of police and investigating agencies from outside the state to find and arrest him,” it said.\nAn FIR was registered against the accused in the case under various sections of the IPC. The case relates to a complaint filed with the CID (Crime) three months back by builder Shailesh Bhatt. Bhatt had alleged that Amreli policemen had kidnapped him, and his business partner Kirit Paladia, from Gandhinagar on February 9 and extorted bitcoins, which was in the possession of Paladia. Bhatt had alleged that Kotadia was also involved in this conspiracy of extorting bitcoins worth over Rs 9 crore. Bitcoin is a type of digital money that is issued and normally controlled by its developers and used and accepted among the members of the virtual community. The Centre has said it does not recognise bitcoin or any other crypto-currency as legal tender in India.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/FinancialXpress", "https://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jagdish patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j tamakuwala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nalin kotadiya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dhari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kotadiya", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gujarat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amreli", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T21:25:16.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c9bb072ee3a622be90262c623e60fa6f67f99a50", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSX6IWBOw15TPmUf0GnS1dXogBZNnjW6bll1XjKjEILkGbJbzYy9cJ6pmwK6tAwwxZDH5QmamIFUrsuwhtf7sGTYVZF6jLbadrfXcvt8NmDGhgWSB8DI_oIQmKDDX25TIh9GX3GOa0ZAiRu37_v2t905dj_Br0JPuT63rcMfKhkiw--", "site_full": "www.irishtimes.com", "site": "irishtimes.com", "site_section": "http://www.irishtimes.com/feeds/rss/breaking/business.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Irish Times - Business", "title": "Making money from bitcoin?

The largest coin has posted losses in last two consecutive days. This downside move is contrary to analyst’s predictions who were expecting a strong rally amid the New York consensus summit.\nIndeed, Tom Lee – who has predicted Bitcoin price to reach $25K by the end of this year – failed to predict the price movement during the consensus summit correctly.\nTom had anticipated bitcoin price to jump from 10% to 70% amid Coindesks conference.\nThe price movement in the last three days was also quite contrary to historical precedents . BTC coin grew almost $2,000 in the previous year’s conference call, and it had made similar strides in 2014 and 2015. Why Didn’t Bulls Push Prices Higher This Time?\nTwo consecutive days of downside strides pulled Bitcoin price to an almost four-weeks-lows on Wednesday before moving back to $8,300 today.\nAlthough several experts presented the bullish outlook for cryptocurrency market during the New York conference call, bearish remarks from the Federal Reserve President at the beginning of the call created the selloff in the crypto markets.\nSt. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said cryptocurrencies are operating like non-uniform currencies – which, at least historically, been discarded and replaced in global financial markets. The president also believes that Dollar is in the better position to work as the leader in currency markets.\nBullard said . “ The dollar, on the other hand, is backed by a stable government with direct and sensical monetary policy and persistently low inflation — because of that, it can better achieve the goals and meet the needs of the market .” Bing’s Ad Ban Supports Selloff\nThe selloff also received support from Bing’s cryptocurrency ad-ban policy. Powered by Microsoft, Bing is the second largest search engine in the world. Bing considers cryptocurrency ads to be harmful to their audience due to their unregulated nature.\nThe Microsoft policymaker said , “Because cryptocurrency and related products are not regulated, we have found them to present a possible elevated risk to our users, with the potential for bad actors participating in predatory behaviors or scamming consumers.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cryptocurrencynews.com/daily-news/crypto-news/consensus-summit-nyc/", "https://www.thestreet.com/investing/bitcoin/bullard-crypto-dollar-competition-14588655", "https://dcebrief.com/microsoft-bing-to-implement-crypto-ad-ban/", "https://cryptocurrencynews.com/daily-news/bitcoin-news/tom-lee-prediction/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "siraj sarwar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T06:33:05.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2d54f6f2bc9ce2763003845a1361e27771f5b2be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSghbzaZShxvIdmmSPJtCuN5VitQFuOl_Kt2UcSBY1fMvQYDdTUlo5u07qiLjn1c0VMOT_SoOPoNckrgoTdexa6gdUrdVSJ1I6uvkQpAcr1PQ--", "site_full": "it.toolbox.com", "site": "toolbox.com", "site_section": "https://it.toolbox.com/topics/innovation", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Innovation - Toolbox.com", "title": "Bitcoin Having No Value = False", "title_full": "Bitcoin Having No Value = False", "published": "2018-05-18T06:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 30691, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2d54f6f2bc9ce2763003845a1361e27771f5b2be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSghbzaZShxvIdmmSPJtCuN5VitQFuOl_Kt2UcSBY1fMvQYDdTUlo5u07qiLjn1c0VMOT_SoOPoNckrgoTdexa6gdUrdVSJ1I6uvkQpAcr1PQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "it.toolbox.com", "published": "2018-05-18T06:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Having No Value = False", "text": "One of the wrongest arguments against Bitcoin is that it has no value. This is essentially trying to argue that the Internet has no value. Bitcoin is not an empty husk with zero value. The entire infrastructure that it takes to make Bitcoin do its thing does not exist for free nor does it lack any real value. The number of people using cryptocurrency wallets has soared over 25,000,000 during Q2 of 2018 according to Statista. That is a significant and growing concern as adoption and reduced friction within cryptocurrency trading continues to gain popularity. Focusing on Bitcoin, you need to take into account that there are typically between 10,000 and 12,000 active operating nodes for Bitcoin connected to the internet in over 100 countries around the world. That shows the massive scale that has been reached to enable a global currency that should be accessible to everyone. Nodes in and of themselves do not need to be very expensive. A $300-500 PC with enough storage to maintain the ever-growing ledger is all it really takes to operate a node, so the node network probably only has a value of ~$6,000,000. Not insignificant, but not really registering as a major value for a global operation.\nBeyond the nodes, there are the miners. Mining on Bitcoin is the one element that has been scaling out of control. In the early days, Bitcoin was mined by CPUs and GPUs in normal everyday computers. Then the ASICs came and it has never been the same. The original gigahashs/sec of 2010 where quickly replaced by terahashes/sec, then petahashes/sec. Now it is estimated that the total mining power on Bitcoin has grown to over 35 exahashes/sec. With an average ASIC miner producing ~14 terahashes/s costing ~$1300 USD all in with power supplies etc., you are looking at a mining network value of approximately $3 Billion. So if you put it all together and consider the continuing growth of nodes and miners contributing the network, Bitcoin has a technologic value that is growing to over $4 Billion by the end of 2018.\nIn this case – the network matters. The infrastructure that makes all of this happens – it matters. If the internet didn’t matter, then we wouldn’t have global communications and cloud computing. The downside to Bitcoin is the ongoing toll of energy being consumed by those $3B in miners around the world.

Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I’m hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research,” says de Vries, who works at the Experience Center of PwC in the Netherlands and is the founder of Digiconomist (@DigiEconomist), a blog that aims to better inform cryptocurrency users.\nHis estimates, based in economics, put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland. A single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month . By the end of this year, he predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts–as much as Austria and half of a percent of the world’s total consumption. “To me, half a percent is already quite shocking. It’s an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,” he says. If the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, de Vries believes the network could someday consume 5% of the world’s electricity. “That would be quite bad.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T07:33:28.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "151b729293120c4ab12ceef2be20766bbc189d21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/Mx2PHH_4C23K3.oPKnGcgtJRk9qPbvPLN0BNYNwQW_yXoHQ5nvrMLiOT7iVqGjtQfg4g1zyXrBuri9jC1EROIwmVCdcE4Q1buOFnv9oA2Gw0NujfFcpQBP.2933unYxqvyTBEvBSixNrVqo8G3Z.8Q--", "site_full": "unlimited.zone", "site": "unlimited.zone", "site_section": "http://unlimited.zone/syndication.php", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Unlimited Zone - All Forums", "title": "Study claims Bitcoin uses as much energy as Ireland, but experts don't agree", "title_full": "Study claims Bitcoin uses as much energy as Ireland, but experts don't agree", "published": "2018-05-18T06:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "151b729293120c4ab12ceef2be20766bbc189d21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/Mx2PHH_4C23K3.oPKnGcgtJRk9qPbvPLN0BNYNwQW_yXoHQ5nvrMLiOT7iVqGjtQfg4g1zyXrBuri9jC1EROIwmVCdcE4Q1buOFnv9oA2Gw0NujfFcpQBP.2933unYxqvyTBEvBSixNrVqo8G3Z.8Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-18T06:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Study claims Bitcoin uses as much energy as Ireland, but experts don't agree", "text": "Study claims Bitcoin uses as much energy as Ireland, but experts don't agree Yesterday, 12:14 PM", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T08:45:46.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6f679dced369d16159948cd0dd8e954c5736718b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme0VjrLEbFxyaKCVs9yfEJ4-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Is bitcoin future assets ?", "title_full": "Is bitcoin future assets ?", "published": "2018-05-18T06:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6f679dced369d16159948cd0dd8e954c5736718b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme0VjrLEbFxyaKCVs9yfEJ4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The best one", "published": "2018-05-18T06:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is bitcoin future assets ?", "text": "Quote: from: mahibul49 on May 09, 2018, 08:01:56 PM hi its really interesting question.i think yes bitcoin is future asset and a king of crypto world.\nas many instituiton buying btc and holding bcz they consider btc as an asset.\nAs for me that Bitcoin will make asset in the future so there are two positions you can take on a futures contract: long or short. If you take a long position, you agree to buy an asset in the future at a specific price when the contract expires. When you take a short position, you agree to sell an asset at a set price when the contract expires.

We're now seeing the initial stages of this transformation.\nFor instance, funding is growing more internationally distributed, and startups are making necessary adjustments to prove sustainability and secure a seat at the table. Most fintech segments in the ascendant a year ago have continued to rise and grow more valuable to the broader financial system. Meanwhile, several fintech categories have had to make adjustments to stay on top. New subsegments are also appearing on the scene — such as digital identity verification fintechs — as new opportunities for innovation are discovered.\nSignificantly, incumbents are responding more proactively to the rising influence of fintech by making updates to their consumer-facing channels, back-end systems, and overall business operations. Most are realizing that the best way to adapt is to work alongside the fintechs that are transforming the financial services environment, either by partnering with them or acquiring the startups entirely. As fintech's power grows, incumbents will have no choice but to change in order to stay relevant and competitive. All around, fintech is becoming embedded in mainstream finance.\nBusiness Insider Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has written the definitive Fintech Ecosystem report that looks at the shifts in the broader environment that fintechs operate in, including funding patterns and regulatory trends; examines the adaptations that some of fintech's biggest subsegments have had to make to secure a foothold in the financial services system; and discusses how the continued rise of the fintech industry is pressuring incumbents to make fundamental changes to their business models and roles. It ends by assessing what a global economy increasingly influenced by innovative fintechs will look like.\nHere are some key takeaways from the report:\nThe fintech industry is far more than a group of digitally native, consumer-centric startups, although they are, in many ways, becoming the new face of financial services. It's increasingly clear that fintech no longer stands apart from financial services proper, and is morphing into an integral part of the financial system. To secure their position in the mainstream economy, some of the main fintech subsegments have had to adjust their business models. These include neobanks, robo-advisors, and alt lenders. Other fintech categories, meanwhile, have instead found that current conditions are well suited to their original models, and are seeing largely smooth sailing, like regtechs, insurtechs, and payments fintechs. Innovation and dynamism is still alive in fintech too, with new categories still emerging. The rising influence of fintechs is having a dramatic effect on incumbents, from banks to insurers to wealth managers, pushing them to respond proactively to stay relevant. Incumbents are reacting to changes wrought by fintechs on three key fronts: the front end, the back end, and in their core business operations. As such, incumbents and fintechs are converging on a digital middle ground. As this happens, the fintech industry is on the cusp of becoming an integral component of the broader financial services ecosystem. But it will likely first have to go through a complete credit cycle, and survive an economic downturn like the one that set the stage for its arrival in 2008, for this to happen.\nLooks at how the environment in which the fintech industry operates is changing, and what that means for the digitization of financial services. Gives an overview of the main subsegments within the global fintech industry, and discusses which categories have had to adapt to survive, which have reaped benefits from their original game plans, and which new segments have come to the fore in the past twelve months. Outlines the adaptations that incumbent financial institutions have begun making to adjust to an economy that's inevitably shifting to digital, and in which tech-savvy fintechs are increasingly setting the standards.

First, blockchain is not a bubble, but Bitcoin is a bubble. Bitcoin is just a tiny application of blockchain,\" Ma said. \"Blockchain is not a huge gold mine. At least inside Alibaba, blockchain must be a solution that addresses the privacy and security issues in the digital era.\"\nMa started his speech by sharing an anecdote. An engineer working at Alibaba’s financial services arm, Ant Financial, wrote his profession as a coder on a dating site. Nobody clicked his profile. After he changed his profession to blockchain engineer, he suddenly received over 360 love letters.\nAlibaba must conduct blockchain research and development because its platforms handle massive amount of transactions, which could be made more secure and efficient by utilizing blockchain.\n\"Alibaba has been working on blockchain for several years, and when Alibaba first started investing in the blockchain, I didn’t understand what blockchain was at that time, but I heard that it can solve data security and privacy issues, therefore Alibaba began to invest in blockchain,\" Ma said, adding that Alibaba has the most number of patented technology in blockchain globally.\nAn IPRdaily and incoPat Innovation Index Research Center report in February showed that China’s patent growth rate in the blockchain area far exceeds that of the United States. Among the top 100 companies, China’s list of companies accounted for 49%, followed by the United States, accounting for 33%. Alibaba ranked first with a total of 49 patent items in blockchain, ahead of Bank of American, which had 44.\nMa warns that people should not take blockchain as a method of making quick returns. Blockchain must provide another solution to issues in society, data and government. Only when someone spend time on research with great patience, will he or she receive returns.\nAlibaba started looking into blockchain earlier than other big Chinese tech firms. In 2016, Ant Financial Group first applied blockchain technology to the Alipay Love Donation Platform. At present, a total of 37 institutions and 304 projects participate in the Ant Blockchain platform. The number of donated users through the blockchain platform reached 629,000, and the number of transactions was 747,000, and the total amount exceeded RMB349 million.\nIn October 2016, Alibaba launched the world’s first mailbox-based authentication based on blockchain technology. After the product goes online, users can synchronize the characteristic data of important emails to authoritative third-party organizations. Once a dispute arises, the user can download the full-text of the email itself and send it to the judicial authentication agency for the characteristics of the original email. After the data is compared with the data stored in the previous documents, a corresponding certificate appraisal report can be generated. According to the report, users can effectively maintain their own legitimate rights and interests. After the data is compared with the data stored in the previous documents, a corresponding certificate appraisal report can be generated.

The commission encourages ways to raise capital, we don’t regulate the technology – we regulate the financial industry and the markets,” said SEC cyber division unit chief Robert Cohen. “Our mission is to foster financially sound markets, and we understand as a regulator that requires a certain amount of [flexibility] in our approach.

But transactions are never truly anonymous, as they are recorded and available on the Blockchain  the distributed ledger which keeps a record of every Bitcoin transaction. When you use Bitcoin to pay for goods and services, you need to provide your name and address to the seller for delivery purposes. This means that a third party can trace your transactions and find ID information. To avoid this there are services called crypto-mixers or tumblers.\nQ : What if you are scammers and want to steal my money?\nA : Internet services over years earn their reputation and loyal customers. We spent a lot of efforts developing this service. Only in the reserves we have invested more than $ 1 million and we highly value our reputation. We understand that our work is built on trust. It is much more important for us to keep a client than to get a one-time benefit. After all, fraud is easy to expose: we provide a digitally signed confirmation that this address has truly been generated by our server. You and everybody on the forum can verify our digital signature using Bitcoin-wallet.\nQ : I'm not doing anything illegal. Why do I need to use mixer?\nA : Blockchain technology allows not only trace any transaction, but view the amount of coins that is currently stored on your Bitcoin-address. Would you like to show publicly how much money do you have on your bank account? After all, it is dangerous: can you imagine what someone can do to you if they know how much money you have? That is why the laws of many countries protecting privacy, personal data, secrecy of correspondence and information about your finances.\nQ : Why should I use your service instead of Bitcoin Fog, Bitmixer, etc.?\nA : There are many mixing services on the web, however, CryptoMixer.io is the most user friendly one and has its own benefits i.e. mobile version of the website and affiliate program. It is always good for the market when there are several players. We believe that customers always win when they have a choice.\nQ : How long does the mixing process take?\nA : Due to the fact that our reserve is large and holds over 2000 BTC currently, you will not have to wait for someone else to send their coins and have your coins mixed. The mixing is often done instantly and the coins are sent back as soon as your coins come in. Ensure you send a decent amount in network fee along with the transaction to avoid coins not being sent any further due to miner rewards being low. Additionally, in order to ensure third parties do not look at fees to find similarities in the nature of transactions done by you, we permit a time delay for each forward address setup to receive the btc.\nQ : What personal data and logs do you keep?\nA : We do not track the source of funds. The one who has signed the transaction is considered to be a valid owner of the coins. Logs of any nature are not maintained. We do not store any information that can be used to identify the users either. The thing we are responsible for is providing you with good and secured mixing algorithms and making your experience fast and reliable. All logs are wiped out on a routine basis to add to organizational efficiency and security of the users that rely upon us to maintain their anonymity.\nQ : What is a CryptoMixer code?\nA : The first time you interact with our system and exchange coins, you are given a code. This code is then used to ensure your coins are not mixed with any of the previous coins sent to our reserves during future transactions. This is a key component of what allows us to ensure your privacy and anonymity.\nQ : How much do you charge?\nA : Our minimum fee is 0.5% plus 0.0005 BTC for every incoming transaction. But we advice you to set a custom fee to slow down amount-based blockchain analysis. You get a discount on service fee when you use CryptoMixer regularly with you CryptoMixer code. See \" Fees \" for details.\nWill be updated with your questions.

Bitcoins 10K resistance is certainly the most widely watched psychological level. The most popular cryptocurrency tested the $10K resistance in the continuation of the April rebound, but the failure to clear offers weighed on the short-term positive momentum across the board and sent the price of Bitcoin 20% lower from the peak. From a technical standpoint, the move below the $8,200-support (major 38.3% retracement on April May recovery) should encourage a further downside correction to $7,850. Some traders who have been left behind the April rebound are looking for an interesting price dip to jump on a rejuvenated rally which could eventually push Bitcoin past the 10K level. Nevertheless, the decline below the critical 8,200-support could dent the bulls' appetite in the short-run. On the other hand, we don't rule out a possibility of a sudden pick-up in positive momentum. A rising conviction that Bitcoin would break above the 10K level could easily generate a significant upside momentum. We maintain our three-month price target unchanged at $12,000. Ether Online: Online gaming and the blockchain technology Ether failed to consolidate above $800, but the ETH/BTC is rising steadily on the back of encouraging news for Ether-traders. Ether Online has recently launched the alpha testing of Pet Rush, the very first MMORPG (massive multiplayer online role-playing) game on blockchain, where players could buy, sell their assets and earn ETH. As such, Ethereum is becoming a pioneer in online gaming industry based on blockchain technology. Ether Online is scheduled to enter the beta stage on May 17th. Top players will be rewarded from the global jackpot every day, and early estimates show that the reward could go up to 4ETH, approximately $3000. Ether Online is one of the first of its kind, but the online gaming on blockchain has the potential to expand further. Time will show whether this could push Ethers price significantly higher, but the least we could say, Ethereums innovative and avant-gardist projects should pay back sooner rather than later. The million-dollar question: Currency, Commodity or Stock? The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) defined cryptocurrencies as commodities back in 2015 and even allowed the trading of futures on major cryptocoins such as Bitcoin and Ether. Only a couple of months ago, Judge Jack Weinstein, a New Yok district judge, also stated that virtual currencies are goods exchanged in a market for a uniform quantity and value and they fall well within the common definition of commodity. He concluded that therefore, cryptocurrencies can be regulated by CFTC as a commodity. In the meantime, the Financial Commission has launched ICC, a committee certifying new ICOs in the same way than the forex industry. But, as cryptocurrencies become increasingly known to investors and policymakers, it becomes obvious that many of them have stock-like properties. A quick glance to Ethereum, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash reveals that they indeed have company-like structures and operations. Therefore, lawmakers are now discussing whether the cryptocurrencies, or at least some of them, should be regulated as stocks rather than commodities. The latter reasoning makes sense. But more importantly, this consideration grants value to some of the major cryptocurrencies, which do have valuable underlying operating systems and products. Hence, it could be safe to say that at least a part of the April price recovery in some major cryptocurrencies, including Ether, has been fundamentally justified.

Answerable for ICON Nexus growth and different Sensible Contracts. MVP development v1. ICO 0 Ethereum blockchain smart contracts are written to control policy issuance, danger e-chat for ico assessment and claim processing. Anticipation that Binance shopping for REQ on the open market could trigger price appreciation has turned out to be largely unsubstantiated as REQ token costs proceed to fluctuate. Latin American blockchain startup Ripio (previously BitPagos ) launched the https://ico.echat.io/ ICO token-presale for its international lending network on Tuesday. If you have any questions pertaining to wherever and how to use echat for ico , you can contact us at our web site. Whereas the success of its ICO is sweet news for Bancor, it does increase serious questions concerning the scalability linkedin ico of the Ethereum community and has resulted in requires echat for ico a unique approach of doing ICOs. If we ignore the fact that these are utterly different initiatives for a second and assume that the ico average contributor\" in the Request ICO will utilize four.7ether or ~70% of their allotment (as we saw with Wanchain) then we'll see ~70k Ether value of REQ sold on day1. Short reply: Yes, anyone can use the Request Network and they do not need request tokens to make use of it. In follow all interactions with the Request Community will happen by way of the APIs. Protocol - The core protocol capabilities of the community: Core Request protocol, multi-foreign money (cross chain verification and fiat), extensions for builders (Escrow, down payments and so on.), financial flows mechanism, cross-forex settlement (Kyber partnership), charges, status and privacy & scaling. However, Web of Coins continues to be greater than a 12 months away from the release of their mainnet and isn't truly communicating throughout blockchains but instead transferring worth represented in hybrid tokens. An error with Binance resulted in REQ holders being credited 2 instances the REQ tokens they deposited into their Binance account (keep in mind that while you commerce on a centralised trade, what you're buying and selling is merely a representation of the actual tokens on the blockchain. The presale of the token MYST, token of Mysterium Network was accomplished in Dec 2016. We're using this technology to launch the Tierion Network, a universal platform for data verification that operates at huge scale. Second, as soon as the token sale begins, it is best to get distinctive tackle and data that you may ship Ethereum. My crew and I've been engaged on developing an software, based on a personal ethereum community, as a result of high gas price of our contracts on the main chain. As an investor the charge that one will obtain is proportional to the usage of the Request Community. Due to the quite a few ICOs and a feverish demand for brand spanking new tokens, the Ethereum rate has jumped greater than 40 fold for the reason that beginning of the 12 months. With the burning mechanism (Gateways) and staking (PoS) working hand in hand Request might cater to both developers who create Gateways and lay buyers who need to create a type of passive income for holding tokens. One solution that's being supplied up is called EOS , which aims to vary the way ICOs are performed to allow at some point home windows for token sales, amongst plenty of other technical changes to allow for simply deployable decentralized functions. As soon as the initial offering is over, SAT token holders will have the ability to commerce their tokens on listed cryptocurrency exchanges. As all transactions that use extensions require REQ tokens, the extra utilization the Request platform has, the extra valuable REQ tokens must be. On the core of each district is the d0xINFRA framework, a stack of Ethereum smart contracts and entrance-finish libraries distributed on IPFS which energy a district's basic functionalities. BitClave has unfolded the market potential for the Oracles Network's solution for the decentralized search engine: multiple sub-chains assigned to specific geographic areas enable localized search customization for its users. You do not have to worry about dropping ICX as a result of tokens are kept in the individual's Ethereum pockets. We had been selected by the World Economic Discussion board's Tipping Point report as the \"Shift in Motion\" for Good Contracts, for our work on allowing good contracts in the Bitcoin network to be robotically triggered by exterior knowledge. How it will all play out remains to be obscure until further developments on the Ethereum community are made. Cosmos has plenty of potential use cases derived from its utility as a decentralized alternate that is interoperable with any blockchain. Following the completion of the token sale Luu commented: I wish to thank the Kyber Network group members and advisors for getting the corporate to efficiently raise a superb round. The company is distributing RCN tokens-the platform's native foreign money-by means of an preliminary coin offering (ICO) that can start in October. We have looked at only one aspect of what the Request platform can do and but the breadth of the project begins to become evident.

One major misconception is the notion that bitcoin will replace gold as a monetary instrument. Some analysts, once stanch precious metals advocates now turned crypto aficionados, believe in such theories that there is too much gold in the world to be used as money or that it is now just a barbarous relic. Just a year or so ago, these same supposed analysts were criticizing the Mainstream media financial network talking heads for calling gold as a barbarous relic, but now have jumped on the bandwagon.\nWell, in one small way, who can blame them. It has been frustrating holding onto gold and silver patiently waiting for their inevitable rise. So, when Bitcoin and the crypto prices moved up exponentially last year, promising investors vast riches in the future, it was easy for many to drop the precious metals and move into the crypto market. The mindset today is to make lots of money doing nothing. Thus, it’s not surprising to see many fall into this delusion and way of thinking.\nA few of the crypto aficionados tell their followers that gold can’t be a monetary asset because there are millions of tons of gold hidden in secret vaults or that there are billions of ounces locked away in the Grand Canyon. While this may sound like quite an interesting conspiracy, there is no sound evidence to back it up. To believe in these fanciful conspiracies defies all logic. However, with the logic being in short supply currently, I am not surprised that many believe in these fairy tales.\nOne of these ex-precious metals, now a highly qualified cryptoanalyst, suggested in a recent video that the “Gold is owned by the Bankers” so why would you want to own gold? Unfortunately, this is a false statement. While the Central banks own a lot of gold, it’s a lot less than what the private investors and jewelry owners hold. According to the World Gold Council, jewelry accounted for the largest stocks of above ground gold at 90,700 metric tons (mt), followed by 40,000 mt of private investment, 32,600 mt of Central bank holdings and 26,700 mt of Industrial usage and other:\nOf the total 190,000 mt of the world above ground gold stocks, jewelry consists of 48%, private investment 21%, Central bank 17%, and Industrial and other at 14% (Source: World Gold Council – Total above-ground stocks 2017 ) So, if we realize that nearly half of all above-ground gold stocks are in the form of jewelry, and then another 21% is owned by private investors, Central banks DO NOT own most of the gold. Even if we compare private investment to Official holdings, private investors own more gold than Central banks.\nNow, to the incorrect theory that there are millions of tons of gold in the world, can someone please tell me where all this additional gold came from?? If we understand that the increase in gold mine production paralleled the rise in silver and copper production, how could there be 10-20 times more gold than copper and silver???\nFirst, most of the gold ever mined was produced after 1900:\nAccording to the best data, we can get our hands on, 91% of all gold mined since 1493 was produced after 1900. Limited records of gold produced before 1493 suggest that wasn’t more than 10,000-15,000 mt.\nSecondly, if we look at historical world silver production, we see the same pattern:\nOf the total 48.5 billion oz of silver mined in the world between 1493 and 2016, 81% of it was produced after 1900. Also, the amount of silver mined annually compared to gold has been about 10 to 1. Assuming that total historical silver production was approximately 55 billion oz compared to 5.7 billion oz of gold, it turns out to be nearly a 10/1 ratio.\nFor there to be just 1 million tons of gold in above-ground stocks in the world, that would equal 32 billion oz of gold. Considering a 10/1 ratio of silver to gold production, then we should have mined 300+ billion oz of silver, not the 55 billion oz stated by the world authorities.\nSo, if we understand the logic here, why on earth do people continue to believe in the LOUSY CONSPIRACY that there are millions of tons of gold in the world?? Why, because lousy conspiracies sell a hell of a lot more newsletters and subscriptions than those that put out the facts and fundamentals.\nRegardless, Central banks own less gold than above ground jewelry stocks or private investors. While Central banks are controlling the gold and silver prices by funneling 99%+ of investors into stocks, bonds, real estate and cryptos, they cannot manipulate the price of precious metals too far below their cost of production.\nUnfortunately, the crypto aficionados do not understand energy or the cost of production as a FLOOR for the gold and silver prices. Which means, the Central banks cannot push the price of gold and silver anywhere they please. What the Central banks CAN DO, is that they can BAMBOOZLE the public in putting their funds into the biggest Ponzi Schemes in history. By funneling the public’s money into stocks, bonds, and real estate, this caps the gold and silver price. This is the manipulation.\nNow, the notion that Bitcoin will replace gold as the King Monetary Asset is patently false because Bitcoin fails several important tests. First, Bitcoin trading volatility is too high to be used as a currency. I have heard from several people that using Bitcoin as a payment method is very frustrating because the price can fluctuate $1,000 in a very short time, thus making it a very stressful transaction for both buyer and seller.\nIf we compare the volatility of Bitcoin versus gold and fiat currencies, Bitcoin is the clear loser:\nBitcoin’s 30-day volatility of 3.73% is nearly 9 times more gold and 10 times more than the USD/EUR (US Dollar-Euro). While Bitcoin’s volatility could continue to decline in the future, it still needs a very high-tech electronic system to allow trade and payment.\nSecondly, Bitcoin and cryptos will not function well as the EROI of energy continues to fall, destroying the ability to scale up or maintain high technology. I recently watched a documentary about the Dark Ages on the history channel. After the fall of the ancient western Roman Empire (5th century), people who lived around the once great city in the 6th and 7th century knew that life was better in the past because they saw all these massive buildings and structures, but were now living mostly a peasant’s life.\nIn just 3-4 generations, people no longer remembered what it was like to live in Rome during its heyday. The great culture, technology, food, and trade of the ancient Roman Empire were gone for good. Most Americans today have no idea what life is like after a collapse of society.\nNot only will Bitcoin and the cryptos not survive the coming Falling EROI energy collapse, either will most of the advanced technology. Sure, some technology will be around, but it will claim the same fate as the ancient Roman Empire. For this reason, gold will always remain the KING MONETARY METAL and asset.\nUnfortunately, the crypto aficionados do not understand the Falling EROI of energy as they mislead their followers into investing in just another fly-by-night bubble.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/gold-mining/how-much-gold-has-been-mined"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve st angelo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T05:57:49.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4e300332d5562868da70fb0407ff586cad15a207", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeQZFUASVd36NyXqCSwn684-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin down, i buy Bitcoin or ethereum", "title_full": "Bitcoin down, i buy Bitcoin or ethereum", "published": "2018-05-18T05:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4e300332d5562868da70fb0407ff586cad15a207", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeQZFUASVd36NyXqCSwn684-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EHT7500", "published": "2018-05-18T05:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin down, i buy Bitcoin or ethereum", "text": "Buy on growth, not the fall of the market.

But then, isn't that what every other new ICO aims to do?!\nIf we ever chance upon a Proof-of-Work that is as satisfyingly rigorous and meticulous as is the case with Bitcoin, then and only then will Bitcoin depreciate to the status of 'toy money'.
