Or have you ever wished that you discovered an oil well in your back yard one day.\nBitcoin is that new Gold Rush, Crypto Currencies are the oil well you never discovered, and the best news is… You do NOT need to move to California to go panning for gold, and you do not even need to own a back yard.\nDid you know that in 2010, 1 Bitcoin was worth $0.39 cents at its peak. Then in December 2017 that same coin was worth a whopping $19,301.\nSo this means that if you invested even $39 in Bitcoin in 2010, just 7 years… ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T06:45:16.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "72324ba94c52aee89bf2844a2093ab3cacc49f92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjEW0T8moIzQKq1Z6Q1LGOtE0qShxof41SW.3hYx16dT5seqb7JfSnXNiWGgDYAeZDQ_aZtLEPVso424caDQGTuF2DNPsFDgSU5blMeLrQZQKsdsCdSFWGQc-", "site_full": "www.startup365.fr", "site": "startup365.fr", "site_section": "http://www.startup365.fr/feed/", "site_categories": ["job_fairs", "jobs", "hobbies_and_interests", "investors_and_patents"], "section_title": "Startup 365", "title": "#Blockchain A Brief History of Hidden Messages in the Bitcoin Blockchain", "title_full": "#Blockchain A Brief History of Hidden Messages in the Bitcoin Blockchain", "published": "2018-05-10T06:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bitcoin-messages-768x768.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "72324ba94c52aee89bf2844a2093ab3cacc49f92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjEW0T8moIzQKq1Z6Q1LGOtE0qShxof41SW.3hYx16dT5seqb7JfSnXNiWGgDYAeZDQ_aZtLEPVso424caDQGTuF2DNPsFDgSU5blMeLrQZQKsdsCdSFWGQc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Startup365", "published": "2018-05-10T06:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "#Blockchain A Brief History of Hidden Messages in the Bitcoin Blockchain", "text": "#Blockchain A Brief History of Hidden Messages in the Bitcoin Blockchain Posted on by Startup365\nPeople have been hiding messages in the bitcoin blockchain ever since the genesis block was mined.

The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been working on an online trading platform that would allow large investors to buy and hold Bitcoin, according to emails and documents viewed by The New York Times and four people briefed on the effort who asked to remain anonymous because the plans were still confidential. The news of the virtual exchange, which has not been reported before , came after Goldman Sachs went public with its intention to open a Bitcoin trading unit  most likely the first of its kind at a Wall Street bank.

All online poker sites offer a range of deposit options, including by credit card, cheque, bitcoin and many other options. You can even expect Sit-n-Gos in Bitcoin poker rooms and catch more satellites to poker events for the entire year. Four years from 2002 on a football scholarship at a university in New Jersey put me right in the heart of the poker boom.\nI liked getting inside people’s heads, I enjoyed problem solving, thinking two steps ahead of the opposition, and I loved winning money. While fortunejack.com is definitely a good poker site, luckily US poker players have more options available for playing online.\nAs well as their tidy 110% match deposit bonus ), you will find a bigger selection of Bitcoin poker games at fortunejack anywhere else. Legal online poker in New Jersey currently generates somewhere along the lines of just over $2 mm in revenue a month, and up to $2.5 mm when special tournament events are running.\nMost players either gave up or started playing in live games; a few took on extreme commutes so they could gamble in a country where online poker was still legal. Texas Hold’em is also the easiest to learn from all other poker variants, so there will always be plenty of fish to take advantage of..-</–", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

stain on Bitcoin of all of these people and companies coming out with their ways to make money on Bitcoin, mainly by targeting those people that want to get rich from Bitcoin. I had two fake \"cloud mining\" people contact me in the past week. I've had Bitcoin pyramid scheme people contacting me saying if I send .2 BTC today I'll get .4 BTC in 4 days.\nCome on people. Get a life. Invest in growing the Bitcoin ecosystem. Make it better, there are so many areas that need productive people to make it grow.\nWe need plug and play Point of Sale systems, we need amazing user interfaces for our wallets, we need Lightning Network in our browsers so server admins can use micropayments for things like captcha, login security (pay 1 bit when you log into a website so that a hacker attacking your login will have to come out of pocket to try to guess your password), we need wifi software so anyone can share their wifi at home, airports, public spaces and charge micropayments for use.\nGo business to business, set them up with bitcoin...take a commission to make money. Go on localbitcoins and buy/sell bitcoins to make it easier for people to get into Bitcoin.\nTake whatever your talents are in the real world and translate them into something useful for Bitcoin. Even if it's flipping burgers, sell the best burgers you can make on the weekend and only accept Bitcoin. Call them Bitcoin burgers.\nIf you're trying to scam people out of money because they don't fully understand the bitcoin ecosystem yet, re-evaluate your life choices and decide today to not be such an asshole.

The Chinese Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer had earlier announced plans for an IPO outside of mainland China. If successful, Canaan will become the first blockchain enterprise to be listed on the Hong Kong Bourse.\nHong Kong and Not the United States Reports emerged in April that Canaan Creative was eyeing an IPO. At the time, the available narrative indicated that the IPO would take place outside of China. Based on this, the United States and Hong Kong were the two most likely locations suggested.\nNow, unnamed insider sources say the company has tentatively settled on Hong Kong. The sources, however, say that the decision isn't yet final. Meanwhile, Canaan has yet to release any details concerning its listing plans. The company is reportedly expecting to raise $1 billion through the IPO.\nPrevious IPO Attempts The company will be hoping that its current attempt at an IPO is successful. In the last two years, Canaan has unsuccessfully tried obtaining listing status in China. The Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer decided to apply to the Chinese New Third Board Market. The company was looking to take advantage of the market's less stringent regulatory requirements for startup enterprises. However, for unknown reasons, the plan fell through.\nIn 2016, the company tried to use a back-door listing approach. Luyitong, the electric hardware manufacturer, planned to acquire the company for $485 million. The deal failed to sail through due to regulatory red flags over the deal reportedly being \"over-priced.\"\nCanaan Creative: The Bitcoin Mining Giant Canaan is one of the major players in the Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturing arena. Despite stiff competition from Bitfury and Bitmain, the company still posted revenue of $156 million (1 billion yuan) in 2017, which amounted to a 600 percent increase from 2016. Canaan's range of Avalon Bitcoin miners is one of the most popular units in the Bitcoin mining arena.\nAvalon 841 bitcoin miner\nThe Chinese government's crackdown on cryptos in the past year does not seem to have slowed down Canaan's growth. The company's plans for the future include some blockchain-powered home appliances that also have passive mining capabilities. Canaan also wants to create legacy AI chips that can mine altcoins like Litecoin .\nWill Canaan Creative be able to carry out a successful IPO in Hong Kong? Do you think the continued Chinese crypto crackdown will affect Canaan's profits? Let us know in the comments below.\nImage courtesy of Instagram Canaan Creative.

His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.\nIn the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: how much digital cash does it really hold?\nTwo Xapo clients said it houses roughly $10 billion of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoin’s price, after all, is hardly steady.\n‘Patient Zero’ Even in the colorful world of crypto the cache is remarkable — amounting to about 7% of the global Bitcoin supply. It would mean Xapo, just 4 years old, has more “deposits” than 98% of the roughly 5,670 banks in the US But as a custodian it’s regulated differently. The Swiss subsidiary is overseen by the self-regulating Financial Services Standards Association, which audits members to ensure they comply with anti-money-laundering rules. Xapo serves US customers through a Delaware corporation that’s registered with the US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and is licensed in several states.\nThe outsize holdings underscore the faith that Casares — a serial entrepreneur nicknamed “Patient Zero” for stirring Silicon Valley’s interest in Bitcoin — has garnered among his acolytes and at major crypto investment firms, such as Grayscale and CoinShares.\n“Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,” said Ryan Radloff of CoinShares, which has more than $500 million of Bitcoin stored at Xapo. “You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.”\nRead: Buffett, Gates are latest bitcoin critics, halting $10,000 push\nXapo’s billionaire backers include LinkedIn Corp. co-founder Reid Hoffman and former Wall Street trader Mike Novogratz, who’s in the process of setting up his own cryptocurrency merchant bank. Their bet is that Bitcoin is here to stay, and so is its biggest scourge, theft.\nThe first rule of owning Bitcoin is to securely keep your private key — the code that lets you spend your coins. If thieves get it, they can loot your holdings in an instant, with no hope of recovery. Putting keys on a device connected to the Internet is both convenient and perilous: Hackers have proven adept at obtaining them from afar.\nThe most popular alternative is called cold storage, keeping the key in an offline device such as a thumb drive. But risks remain: Hackers have also proven adept at setting traps on computers to access cold-storage devices the moment they’re online. More traditional criminals have committed home invasions and kidnappings. Some Bitcoin tycoons have resorted to hiding their identities, fortifying their homes and studying self-defense.\nTrading Desk Xapo’s solution is to bury a cold-storage device in a mountainside and layer on electronic safeguards.\n“They’re the first folks who recognised custodial and security functions would be key,” said Hoffman, whose venture capital firm Greylock Partners led a $20 million investment in Xapo in 2014, a couple of years after Casares persuaded him to buy his first Bitcoin. “He made the pitch in the morning and in the afternoon I called him with an offer.”\nAt Xapo, retrieving Bitcoin from the vault takes about two days. The company verifies a client’s identity and authenticates the request before manually signing the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations. Approval from three separate vaults is required for any transactions to be authorised. The company also offers customers a trading desk to buy and sell Bitcoin and created the first Bitcoin debit card to spend it.\nCasares, 44, declined to comment for this story. After a flurry of publicity at Xapo’s launch, he has drawn big audiences at crypto conferences but largely shunned media interviews.\nYet his persuasiveness is legendary. His evangelising of Bitcoin is so pervasive in Silicon Valley that when Hoffman asked his family office to buy some, his banker asked when he’d spoken to Casares. Xapo’s advisers now include former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, ex-Citigroup Chief Executive Officer John Reed and Visa International founder Dee Hock.\nSuch salesmanship has been critical to Xapo’s success. First Block Capital, Canada’s first fully registered crypto firm, picked Xapo as its custodian after months of due diligence, including touring the Swiss vault.\n“Every part of their DNA is geared to security,” said Sean Clark, First Block’s founder, who noted the vault’s fingerprint scanners were equipped with a pulse reader to prevent amputated hands from being used. “Whenever we make big transfers they FaceTime us, we have duress words, if it’s big enough they’ll fly out to see us.”\nXapo is doubling down on its pursuit of institutional clients, with President Ted Rogers enlisting Peter Najarian, a veteran of emerging-market trading at UBS Group and Royal Bank of Scotland Group, to oversee outreach to investors including pension funds, private banks, assets managers, family offices and hedge funds.\n‘Tidal Wave’ The perceived lack of an institutional-grade custodial solution for Bitcoin has been one of the sticking points for many money managers looking to try the asset class. Xapo says its already offering precisely that solution. If it persuades them of its merits, the implications for Bitcoin would be profound.\n“A fraction of that kind of institutional money flowing into the space would be a tidal wave,” Najarian said.\nCasares has made acceptance of Bitcoin his life’s mission. Born to sheep ranchers in Argentina’s remote Patagonia region, he experienced the impact of inflation throughout his youth.\nThat drove him to build a series of fintech startups that made him millions before he encountered Bitcoin. He sold 75% of Patagon, a Latin American financial-services website, for $529 million in 2000 and digital wallet startup Lemon for $43 million 13 years later to focus on crypto. By then, he was already a big holder of Bitcoin.\n“I am personally allocating a percentage of my net worth to this that is borderline irresponsible because I believe in it so much,” Casares told Lemon board member Eric O’Brien, according to “Digital Gold,” a book by Nathaniel Popper. Two years ago, he joined the board of PayPal Holdings.\n‘High Hurdle’ Bitcoin’s meteoric rise in recent years has spurred the proliferation of rival currencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple that also have multibillion-dollar valuations. Yet Xapo only safeguards Bitcoin because of Casares’s belief that it alone will succeed.

It was the largest announced acquisition in the blockchain space at that time in China.\nBut three months later, Shandong Luyitong announced the termination of its plans to purchase Canaan, without clearly stating the reason for the withdrawal. Zhang Nanjian, CEO of Canaan, said after the deal was terminated that the exercise has had positive impact on the company, making it more standardized and transparent.\nIn August 2017, Canaan applied for a listing on China’s New Third Board and disclosed the company’s financial information. Nearly 100% of the company’s revenue came from the sale of Bitcoin mining machines. In recent years, 95% of its sales revenue came from the domestic market. In 2017, the company’s revenue exceeded RMB1.2 billion and its profits exceeded RMB300 million.\nBut the New Third Board listing plan didn’t go as planned neither. The company took the initiative to abandon the listing after multiple times of receiving feedback from regulators that weren’t very supportive.\nThe turn of events came last month, when Jiang Yang, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, visited Canaan’s office and showed support of the company’s listing in China. The official had a positive view on the company because the Canaan is a chip company, an industry that Beijing is hoping to strengthen rapidly.\nAccording to public statistics, Canaan registered net profit of RMB300 million in 2017, 125 times more than its net profit of RMB2.24 million in 2015.\nThe predecessor of Canaan was a team led by Dr. Zhang Nanhao at Peking University. In 2011, the team was credited as having produced China’s first bitcoin mining machine, Avalon, which claimed to be the most powerful mining machine in the world at that time.\nIn 2015, Canna began the research and development of artificial intelligence chips. After two years, the company pre-released the world’s first artificial intelligence computing chip KPU in December 2017 for Bitcoin mining.\nIn May 2017, Canaan raised RMB300 million(US$47.1 million) in a series A round from Shanghai Baopu Investment Management Ltd., Jinjiang International Company Limited and Tunlan Investment, giving it a valuation of RMB 3.3 billion(US$518.4 million).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zhang nanjian", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ipo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new third board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shandong luyitong intelligent electric plc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shandong luyitong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T05:43:48.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ccf1201b5f4f8665d559162c7abd77965bdb1085", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg81SAGN1Rb5gUwdYWjMuIRXXogFuWYR9BazZCeLL40i7nEHpjeIPB1ntAKTXaR2IgZ7SdzmRFm2MSExUiWPX0nsBypUSAWGO7jLi8RmHSdE10UpRuLZtat.pCZHniwHQrAERJ9FcYggGB9U._cEldTl58lnT5D5SyYc_98wnLtJDL_g_km5YwrAxRzZ6HWQTRqGqHKRjYoLNvboIeMkDANKxszbWMejWbLf4XnamMHD8cNvmPhYzbpc", "site_full": "www.rolclub.com", "site": "rolclub.com", "site_section": "http://www.rolclub.com/money-exchange/", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "painting", "sports", "adult", "bodybuilding", "politics", "hobbies_and_interests", "scuba_diving", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Money Exchange", "title": "We have added new cryptocurrency  Bitcoin Cash (BCH)", "title_full": "We have added new cryptocurrency  Bitcoin Cash (BCH)", "published": "2018-05-10T05:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.905, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 37448, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ccf1201b5f4f8665d559162c7abd77965bdb1085", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg81SAGN1Rb5gUwdYWjMuIRXXogFuWYR9BazZCeLL40i7nEHpjeIPB1ntAKTXaR2IgZ7SdzmRFm2MSExUiWPX0nsBypUSAWGO7jLi8RmHSdE10UpRuLZtat.pCZHniwHQrAERJ9FcYggGB9U._cEldTl58lnT5D5SyYc_98wnLtJDL_g_km5YwrAxRzZ6HWQTRqGqHKRjYoLNvboIeMkDANKxszbWMejWbLf4XnamMHD8cNvmPhYzbpc", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "xmlgold.eu", "published": "2018-05-10T05:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "We have added new cryptocurrency  Bitcoin Cash (BCH)", "text": "We have added new cryptocurrency  Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\nShortly, What is Bitcoin Cash ?\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is a digital currency created in August 2017, arising from a fork of Bitcoin Classic. Bitcoin Cash increases the size of blocks, allowing more transactions to be processed.\nCreated upon the bitcoin model, Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency that is:\n- Decentralized. The network is spread out across many different computers all over the world;\n- Peer-to-Peer. Person A can send Bitcoin Cash directly to Person B from anywhere in the world without needing an intermediary, like a bank.\n- Secure. Bitcoin Cash uses strong encryption to prevent hacking, fraud, and cyber attacks.\n- Open. The history of all Bitcoin Cash transactions is logged on a publicly accessible blockchain that can be viewed and verified by anyone.\nThe biggest difference between bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash has to do with the size of blocks on the blockchain. By increasing block size from bitcoins 1MB up to 8MB, Bitcoin Cash allows many more transactions to be processed in one block. The idea is to process larger transaction volumes faster and for lower fees.\nIf you want to do exchange of cryptocurrensies, e-currencies now, just Visit XML Gold e-currency exchange platform and select the desired digital currencies exchange directions.

Bitcoin Cash increases the size of blocks, allowing more transactions to be processed.\nCreated upon the bitcoin model, Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency that is:\n- Decentralized. The network is spread out across many different computers all over the world;\n- Peer-to-Peer. Person A can send Bitcoin Cash directly to Person B from anywhere in the world without needing an intermediary, like a bank.\n- Secure. Bitcoin Cash uses strong encryption to prevent hacking, fraud, and cyber attacks.\n- Open. The history of all Bitcoin Cash transactions is logged on a publicly accessible blockchain that can be viewed and verified by anyone.\nThe biggest difference between bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash has to do with the size of blocks on the blockchain. By increasing block size from bitcoins 1MB up to 8MB, Bitcoin Cash allows many more transactions to be processed in one block. The idea is to process larger transaction volumes faster and for lower fees.\nIf you want to do exchange of cryptocurrensies, e-currencies now, just Visit XML Gold e-currency exchange platform and select the desired digital currencies exchange directions.

Unfortunately, failing to accept this currency is a mistake that is made by many Brisbane non-Bitcoin businesses. Here is why it is a good idea for your business to join the digital technology age and start to accept the exponentially growing Bitcoin.\nReason 1: Fiscal Freedom Simply put, consumers and business owners alike have total and full access to their Bitcoin accounts. No longer will money be inaccessible because of an unexpected bank closure, holiday, or other condition that would typically limit access to money. No money is lost through currency exchange if it must be sent overseas, since Bitcoins are worth the same in every country and locale.\nReason 2: Fees (or lack thereof) When hearing about a new way to transfer money, the first question of business owners is often whether there are fees, or how much the fees are. Some transactions are completely free, and there is no fee assessed. Users may pay to speed up Bitcoin transfers in Bitcoin Brisbane , but there is no obligation to pay otherwise. If fees do need to be assessed, users can count on them being far less than banks, PayPal, and credit card companies currently charge.\nReason 3: Lower Risk Merchants and consumers often worry about identity theft. Consumers are afraid that their money will be accessed without their consent by either the merchant or a malicious third party. Merchants are often worried that consumers will use someone else’s payment information, making the money no good. Fortunately, Bitcoin takes care of all of these worries. Due to a highly sophisticated encryption mechanism, the Bitcoin wallet owner is the only person who will ever be able to initiate transfers. Unlike credit cards, where malicious payment receivers may make unauthorized transactions, or which consumers can steal and use for their own purposes, Bitcoin transfers are completely trustworthy and secure.\nThere are also certain types of markets where the fraud risk is large. In these cases, merchants can now accept Bitcoin and do away with the risk. In short, Bitcoin transfers in Brisbane have never been safer or easier or cheaper. Compared to the current major payment options, it certainly is superior.\nReason 4: Security As alluded to above, security was a primary concern during the creation of Bitcoin, and it is also of concern to Bitcoin’s diverse range of users. One aspect of security not yet discussed revolves around personal information. One reason why consumers may not wish to purchase a product is because they may not yet trust the business with all of their personal information. While, unfortunately, this is a completely valid concern, accepting Bitcoins in Brisbane can help to put the consumer’s mind at ease, and allow him or her to make a purchase he or she otherwise would not be willing to make.\nBitcoin protects personal information insofar as it obliterates the need for it. Instead of relying on information like address, postcode, first and last name, and sometimes even identity numbers, it relies on cryptography. Of course, one reading this may think that because it’s only digital, it will be lost if the user’s computer suddenly crashes and becomes unusable. However, nothing is further from the truth. Many Bitcoin users take advantage of both cloud and local computer backup services to ensure that they will always have this open access to their money, making the Bitcoin market even more stable.\nReason 5: Owned by the People This final reason to accept Bitcoin is often overlooked. If one takes a look at the various major payment methods, it is quite obvious that they are all owned by major corporations. This makes alteration of information easy. There is essentially no transparency to how they are run, or how much of a fee is actually required to sustain the service versus how much of it serves as profit. Fortunately, there is no need to worry about any of this if you are accepting Bitcoin in Brisbane. It is literally impossible to control the Bitcoin market, even for the creators of it. In this sense, it is more secure. Also an important factor, all information anybody could possibly want about the Bitcoin market, including how many are in circulation, and even specific transactions, are all available publicly on what is called the “block chain.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://searchtempo.com.au/bitcoin-seo-for-long-tail-location-search/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "brisbane businesses home", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brisbane businesses bitcoin for brisbane businesses bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brisbane", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T08:27:09.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "beb2950cedb98abecec7420b7b67487021b24740", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXYBDItG6WSGiQSyytGvBCg-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "can bitcoin worth more than treasure?", "title_full": "can bitcoin worth more than treasure?", "published": "2018-05-10T04:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 16, "participants_count": 17, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.088, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "beb2950cedb98abecec7420b7b67487021b24740", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXYBDItG6WSGiQSyytGvBCg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mariksa", "published": "2018-05-10T04:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "can bitcoin worth more than treasure?", "text": "It depends on how the person sees bitcoin.

The street artist got the idea after developing an interest in bitcoin and cryptocurrency.\nSource: Reddit\nThe bitcoin QR code enables people impressed with the artwork to make donations to Boyart. The trend has caught on, and people have been making contributions up to the tune of $1,000 in bitcoin. This is another example of how bitcoin is changing the face of the art industry as well as the fundraising paradigm .\nThe Melding of Bitcoin and Art Bitcoin is becoming a prominent theme in the artistic and creative universe. There are artists all over the world who create art pieces that are inspired by the bitcoin revolution, incorporating elements from the crypto arena into their artworks.\nFor Boyart, part of his fascination with bitcoin is the solution it brings to the problem of securing patronage as an artist. Platforms like Patreon and Ulule have come to supplement the efforts of galleries, but it is still not enough to service the art industry. So many talented artists struggle through lack of patronage and are forced to do menial jobs to support their talent.\nDonations Received. Source: Blockchain\nBoyart has, however, found a way to secure patronage from a rapidly increasing user base using bitcoin donations. The artist has formed the habit of putting QR codes in his paintings, calling for donations. He came into some degree of prominence when one of his artworks became a trending topic on the Bitcoin subreddit. The consensus on the forum wasn't only that the mural was good but that the bitcoin QR code idea was novel.\nThe French street artist tries to also express the current crypto economic landscape in his paintings. The painting which became popular on Reddit was of Rembrandt, the famous 17th-century Dutch painter. Despite his incredibly undeniable talent, Rembrandt never achieved commercial success in his time, and he struggled throughout his career with mounting debt. He even had to sell his house at some point to pay his debts. In the painting, Rembrandt is seen holding a newspaper.\nDecentralization Will Disrupt the Creative Industry Boyart believes that the concept of decentralization being championed by bitcoin and other cryptos has the potential to disrupt the art industry. Commenting on the Rembrandt mural, he said that it wasn't the first time he had incorporated a bitcoin QR code in his work:\n\"I first included a Bitcoin QR code in my work in November 2017. I painted a street art piece of a child asking his father 'Dad, what is money?' And I placed a QR code at the side of my signature. I wasn't sure if someone had done this already, but I wanted to see if people could support street artists with donations. I did it as an homage to Andreas Antonopoulos' book The Internet of Money.\"\nDad, What is Money? Source: PBOY\nSince Boyart began collecting donations via bitcoin QR codes in his paintings, the artist has received 0.11 BTC (about $1,000). He believes that artists and those involved in the creative industry have a lot to benefit from adopting crypto and blockchain technology. Fellow French visual artist, Youl is also known for incorporating crypto themes in his artworks. In fact, \" the last bitcoin supper ,\" a fresco painted by Youl is considered to be one of the most iconic crypto-themed artworks.\nThe post Street Artist Makes 0.11 BTC By Incorporating Bitcoin QR Code in Artwork appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pascal boyart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boyart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patreon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "art bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boyart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T04:29:58.069+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "36b8014192df724b076b9e910604d478a05ec961", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyqeW_QjfMiNyMT2DgKEkvwcepSIJg35VxNvjEZDJScyhIZgAae30dHxSUUKlJzwf2XPSMUXUG0HdEnSXDh.EQ39jAhFv5KWnukwAXiFJ0xOpehdmIGTywokztHMKfy8FQ-", "site_full": "fakenewsmatters.org", "site": "fakenewsmatters.org", "site_section": "http://fakenewsmatters.org/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Fake News Matters", "title": "Ricky Williams says Uranus is pointing to bitcoin as a great investment", "title_full": "Ricky Williams says Uranus is pointing to bitcoin as a great investment", "published": "2018-05-10T04:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "36b8014192df724b076b9e910604d478a05ec961", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgyqeW_QjfMiNyMT2DgKEkvwcepSIJg35VxNvjEZDJScyhIZgAae30dHxSUUKlJzwf2XPSMUXUG0HdEnSXDh.EQ39jAhFv5KWnukwAXiFJ0xOpehdmIGTywokztHMKfy8FQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Fake News Desk", "published": "2018-05-10T04:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ricky Williams says Uranus is pointing to bitcoin as a great investment", "text": "Subscribe to Fake News Matters\nKeep up to date on the latest content, here at Fake News Matters.

The product battled JVC’s VHS format over which would become the dominant device consumers used to record and watch movies and other videos across the world.\nVHS would emerge the victor.

Okay? Cool, go ahead and spin up a Docker instance.\nIf that sounds intimidating, you’re not alone.\nBut as recently as January, using the lightning network, a layer-two technology for scaling bitcoin, on “mainnet”– ie, with real money – called for these rarified levels of technical expertise. Not to mention a strong stomach – bugs lurked in early implementations, threatening to part users from their funds (early adopters boasted of their prowess with the slogan #reckless).\nLuckily, the lightning network, which pushes transactions into off-chain payment channels, allowing the cryptocurrency to be received without waiting for a block to be mined or paying the associated miner’s fees, has moved ahead by leaps and bounds in the past few months.\nAs such, hopes are running high.\nFor instance, ACINQ, the company behind the “eclair” lightning implementation, unveiled an Android wallet app at the beginning of April that can be used to send mainnet lightning payments. But the app can’t receive payments yet.\nAnd Lightning Labs, the company behind the “lnd” implementation of the lightning network, recently published a blog post envisioning non-techy end-user Carol buying a pair of socks using lightning as easily as if she were swiping a credit card.\nIn short, lightning promises to bring bitcoin back to the days when it could be used to buy a pizza.\nIndeed, the newest beta version of Lightning Labs’ lnd is, in fact, ready for mainnet use, but the company recently tweeted, “we recommend that users experiment with only small amounts (#craefulgang #craefulgang #craefulgang)!” playing off a joke in John Oliver’s recent bit about cryptocurrency.\nTo minimize the risk for users, Lightning Labs has not released a mobile version, and the desktop app is still restricted to “testnet”– that is, fake money. Same with the lnd wallet for iOS called Zap; the lightning wallet, HTLC.me, developed by well-known developer Alex Bosworth; and another iOS wallet for lightning, called CoinClip, released by developer Kenneth Perry, aka thothonegan.\nStill, the frenzy of developer activity on lightning network will continue to push its rapid development, but for noobs – whom polite society calls “inexperienced users”– it’s still a waiting game.\nAlthough Jack Mallers, the developer behind a testnet lnd wallet for iOS called Zap, isn’t getting discouraged. With optimism, he told CoinDesk, lightning will soon be good enough for more non-technical users, adding:\n“One day it will be good enough for exchanges, one day it will be good enough for Amazon.”\nWith that said, though, there’s still no official launch date for a lightning network application that everyday people can use.\n“We’re so used to roadmaps of products where there’s a deadline,” Mallers continued, but lightning is “a protocol and not a product so there’s not a ship date.” Watchtowers and submarines?\nWould-be lightning wallet users will have to wait until several highly technical features – with strange names – are ironed out.\nOne of the most important, Mallers said, is “watchtowers.”\nIn the way that the lightning network’s smart contracts are designed, it is possible for one user of a channel to steal another user’s funds. While it is risky – since if the victim logs on before a given amount of time has passed and notices, they can then punish the would-be thief by taking all their funds in the channel – Lightning Labs is going a step further, building watchtowers.\nThese all-seeing nodes will watch the network and punish anyone who attempts to steal their counterparty’s bitcoin, in exchange for a small fee.\nBeyond that basic guarantee of safety, there are other improvements a wallet app would need to make before it’s ready for everyday use.\nFor instance, several developers are working on a mechanism called “splicing,” which would allow a user that wants to send more bitcoin than they have available in their channel to bring additional funds into the channel to make the payment. This mechanism is also being developed by Lightning Labs to enable bitcoin users without a lightning node to receive lightning-based payments.\nThen there are features that might not be totally necessary, but would certainly be nifty.\nBosworth, for instance, is working on a feature called “submarine swaps,” a version of atomic swaps whereby one side of the swap is being done on-chain and one side of the swap done off-chain.\nWith the use the lightning network’s ability to lock up funds in a smart contract, lightning network users could theoretically swap between bitcoin and litecoin, for example.\nThe technology could, Bosworth believes, could enable lightning use on decentralized exchanges as well, since even though users need a “swap provider,” that provider “can’t take your altcoins without giving you the bitcoin back because of that lock,” Bosworth told CoinDesk. The ‘usability challenge’\nAs important as this technical plumbing is, though, some argue that these are just the tip of the iceberg when compared to outstanding user experience issues.\n“Lightning has a ton of challenges ahead of it. I don’t want to be too negative. It’s amazing stuff,” said The Hebrew University assistant professor Aviv Zohar, adding:\n“But there’s this huge gap between what’s doable and what’s usable: the usability challenge.”\nCase in point, Zohar thinks there are a number of problems with the lightning network user experience that don’t have solutions yet.\nFor instance, when users create a channel, they need a certain number of confirmations to make sure its been accepted, and as such, the user needs to keep monitoring the channel. And while he admits the watchtower concept will improve this, that feature will likely take some time to be built into a sleek UX.\nPlus, Zohar continued, “If you drop a phone in the toilet or something, what happens with your lightning channel?”\nAn edge case, perhaps, but overall, lightning’s user interfaces are far worse even than bitcoin’s – though admittedly bitcoin’s had far more time – and even bitcoin’s user experience still isn’t that intuitive.\nThat will likely continue to be the case, Zohar believes, since there just aren’t a whole lot of people working on UX for cryptocurrency protocols and technologies.\nYet some, like Igor Cota, have noticed the problem and are working on it. For his part, Cota is working on a lightning wallet called Presto that would enable near-field communication (NFC) – the technology behind contactless payments which allow users to merely tap their mobile devices to payment terminals to initiate transactions.\nSpeaking to CoinDesk about the benefits of simple, seamless lightning use, Cota said:\n“I strongly believe that a focus on UX and general ease of use are what is going to bring lightning (and bitcoin) to mainstream.”\nAlyssa Hertig contributed reporting.\nLightning stickers via Felix Weiss Twitter\nWalletsBitcoinLightning Network ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "docker", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T13:41:54.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "13de571b3d996bdfe606cbedcb9bcca4f8c61496", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2j17Z4AyvqY98yD89JSe7m_1o3DL6PnJBxdGs2xawN7G6T_Aoamvba1et8PAZAFOncuU1SMLONPs_D3cPiwGTQOC1fUGyg2EEh", "site_full": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "http://TheBitcoinNews.com/rss/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "The Bitcoin News – Leading Bitcoin News and Cryptocurrency News", "title": "Chinese Bitcoin Mining Giant Set for $1 Billion IPO in Hong Kong", "title_full": "Chinese Bitcoin Mining Giant Set for $1 Billion IPO in Hong Kong", "published": "2018-05-10T04:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hong-kong-night-street.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "13de571b3d996bdfe606cbedcb9bcca4f8c61496", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2j17Z4AyvqY98yD89JSe7m_1o3DL6PnJBxdGs2xawN7G6T_Aoamvba1et8PAZAFOncuU1SMLONPs_D3cPiwGTQOC1fUGyg2EEh", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoinist", "published": "2018-05-10T04:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Chinese Bitcoin Mining Giant Set for $1 Billion IPO in Hong Kong", "text": "Chinese Bitcoin Mining Giant Set for $1 Billion IPO in Hong Kong May 10, 2018 356\nUnconfirmed reports indicate that Canaan Creative is gearing up for a $1 billion IPO in Hong Kong. The Chinese Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer had earlier announced plans for an IPO outside of mainland China. If successful, Canaan will become the first blockchain enterprise to be listed on the Hong Kong Bourse. Hong Kong and Not the United States\nReports emerged in April that Canaan Creative was eyeing an IPO. At the time, the available narrative indicated that the IPO would take place outside of China. Based on this, the United States and Hong Kong were the two most likely locations suggested.\nNow, unnamed insider sources say the company has tentatively settled on Hong Kong. The sources, however, say that the decision isn’t yet final. Meanwhile, Canaan has yet to release any details concerning its listing plans. The company is reportedly expecting to raise $1 billion through the IPO. Previous IPO Attempts\nThe company will be hoping that its current attempt at an IPO is successful. In the last two years, Canaan has unsuccessfully tried obtaining listing status in China. The Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer decided to apply to the Chinese New Third Board Market. The company was looking to take advantage of the market’s less stringent regulatory requirements for startup enterprises. However, for unknown reasons, the plan fell through.\nIn 2016, the company tried to use a back-door listing approach. Luyitong, the electric hardware manufacturer, planned to acquire the company for $485 million. The deal failed to sail through due to regulatory red flags over the deal reportedly being “over-priced.” Canaan Creative: The Bitcoin Mining Giant\nCanaan is one of the major players in the Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturing arena. Despite stiff competition from Bitfury and Bitmain, the company still posted revenue of $156 million (1 billion yuan) in 2017, which amounted to a 600 percent increase from 2016. Canaan’s range of Avalon Bitcoin miners is one of the most popular units in the Bitcoin mining arena. Avalon 841 bitcoin miner\nThe Chinese government’s crackdown on cryptos in the past year does not seem to have slowed down Canaan’s growth. The company’s plans for the future include some blockchain-powered home appliances that also have passive mining capabilities.

Baccarat that is easy to play online using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Punto Banco Punto meaning Player and Banco being Banker, this version is said to be the original Baccarat so similarities are expected. The Banker is sponsored by the Casino or Dealer. Two sets of two cards are handed to the Player and Banker, if neither have a natural 8 or 9 then the third card rule comes into action, with the same applying. Just like Baccarat, Punto Banco offers a tie option as égalité and too deducts commision for the wins on the Banker.\nUsing Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies\nThe online betting site of your choice will have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nIt is always recommended to use a Bitcoin wallet in order to ensure complete anonymity.\nSome exchanges allow one to connect to their bank accounts. The Bitcoin can be converted into the currency of your choice then transferred into your account in as little as 24 hours.\n- Aaron Goldstein, Gambling911.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/2GYokfZ"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "may/09/2018 punto banco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "punto banco using bitcoin online play punto banco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "punto banco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "punto banco punto", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "baccarat", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T05:00:30.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "159427071820cf1a08f7f371e272516df95fbbd1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS85jFjidQBhh0dPtJ2hgt5bArU0U5Y37xfY3VsXdUxQv7qxsfYLagRBj3IlWacO3gr4V6TVzLhOF3lTv.0vbGnTZw0e6szibYy0yG2YzBKfcfzhu6q448inHm5UMNLADrPzEB9pSftYKA2QWr84KcH0EvrZpXCyGZHJoHCi6HJJS6kWcMA2XS7HlgxywLKbeEIVbwLIGODWA--", "site_full": "www.smh.com.au", "site": "smh.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.smh.com.au/rss/feed.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Sydney Morning Herald - Latest News", "title": "The underground bunkers where 'Patient Zero' helps the ultra-rich hide billions in bitcoin", "title_full": "The underground bunkers where 'Patient Zero' helps the ultra-rich hide billions in bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-10T03:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_2.556830304165886%2C$multiply_0.7554296506137866%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_453%2C$y_40/t_crop_custom/t_sharpen%2Cq_auto%2Cf_auto/8c499687289b2afe5191de20a63b8fa7a6dd63c8", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1534, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "159427071820cf1a08f7f371e272516df95fbbd1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS85jFjidQBhh0dPtJ2hgt5bArU0U5Y37xfY3VsXdUxQv7qxsfYLagRBj3IlWacO3gr4V6TVzLhOF3lTv.0vbGnTZw0e6szibYy0yG2YzBKfcfzhu6q448inHm5UMNLADrPzEB9pSftYKA2QWr84KcH0EvrZpXCyGZHJoHCi6HJJS6kWcMA2XS7HlgxywLKbeEIVbwLIGODWA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-10T03:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "The underground bunkers where 'Patient Zero' helps the ultra-rich hide billions in bitcoin", "text": "By Tom Metcalf 10 May 2018 — 10:48am Behind the guards, the blast doors and down corridors of reinforced concrete, sit the encrypted computer servers -- connected to nothing -- that hold keys to a vast digital fortune.\nArgentine entrepreneur Wences Casares has spent the past several years persuading Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires that Bitcoin is the global currency of the future, that they need to buy some, and that he's the man to safeguard it.\nXapo chief Wences Casares is known as \"Patient Zero.\"\nPhoto: CNBC His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.\nIn the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security.

Their bet is that Bitcoin is here to stay, and so is its biggest scourge, theft.\nThe first rule of owning Bitcoin is to securely keep your private key -- the code that lets you spend your coins. If thieves get it, they can loot your holdings in an instant, with no hope of recovery. Putting keys on a device connected to the Internet is both convenient and perilous: Hackers have proven adept at obtaining them from afar.\nThe most popular alternative is called cold storage, keeping the key in an offline device such as a thumb drive. But risks remain: Hackers have also proven adept at setting traps on computers to access cold-storage devices the moment they're online.\nMore traditional criminals have committed home invasions and kidnappings. Some Bitcoin tycoons have resorted to hiding their identities, fortifying their homes and studying self-defense.\nKeep it cold Xapo's solution is to bury a cold-storage device in a mountainside and layer on electronic safeguards.\nAround $US10 billion worth of bitcoin is said to be stored in Xapo's vaults.\nPhoto: Bloomberg \"They're the first folks who recognised custodial and security functions would be key,\" said Hoffman, whose venture capital firm Greylock Partners led a $US20 million investment in Xapo in 2014, a couple of years after Casares persuaded him to buy his first Bitcoin. \"He made the pitch in the morning and in the afternoon I called him with an offer.\"\nAt Xapo, retrieving Bitcoin from the vault takes about two days.

After a flurry of publicity at Xapo's launch, he has drawn big audiences at crypto conferences but largely shunned media interviews.\nLoading Yet his persuasiveness is legendary. His evangelizing of Bitcoin is so pervasive in Silicon Valley that when Hoffman asked his family office to buy some, his banker asked when he'd spoken to Casares. Xapo's advisers now include former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, ex-Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Officer John Reed and Visa International founder Dee Hock.\nSuch salesmanship has been critical to Xapo's success.

Xapo says its already offering precisely that solution. If it persuades them of its merits, the implications for Bitcoin would be profound.\n\"A fraction of that kind of institutional money flowing into the space would be a tidal wave,\" Najarian said.\nCasares has made acceptance of Bitcoin his life's mission. Born to sheep ranchers in Argentina's remote Patagonia region, he experienced the impact of inflation throughout his youth.\nThat drove him to build a series of fintech startups that made him millions before he encountered Bitcoin. He sold 75 per cent of Patagon, a Latin American financial-services website, for $US529 million in 2000 and digital wallet startup Lemon for $US43 million 13 years later to focus on crypto. By then, he was already a big holder of Bitcoin.\n\"I am personally allocating a percentage of my net worth to this that is borderline irresponsible because I believe in it so much,\" Casares told Lemon board member Eric O'Brien, according to \"Digital Gold,\" a book by Nathaniel Popper. Two years ago, he joined the board of PayPal.\nThe bitcoin paradox Bitcoin's meteoric rise in recent years has spurred the proliferation of rival currencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple that also have multibillion-dollar valuations. Yet Xapo only safeguards Bitcoin because of Casares's belief that it alone will succeed. Such dogmatism has seen Xapo turn away customers looking to store rival currencies.\nOther purists say ventures such as Xapo have no place in the Bitcoin ecosystem, slowing down what's supposed to be a seamless transfer.\nXapo's top brass wrestle with that paradox, too.\n\"It's a subject we discuss a lot, and we believe Bitcoin won't reach the mainstream if people have to hold their own private keys,\" Rogers said. \"It's a pretty high hurdle technically to be your own bank with lots of security.\"\nBloomberg\nCryptocurrencies Bitcoin ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom me", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wences casares", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T04:14:30.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d8f9767025df9213fe8d8f87031739b120696a6f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS85jFjidQBhh0dPtJ2hgt5bArU0U5Y37xjTLrIQXQqmBu7hMgotoxpv5WM.J74HzRX9NXTKx7n9xSVVGoisbbhHYwN1gJQzngxktHwT7tZyoun6SSfRcQgIccGGmwcDgakR5xINslw35.Jk2p7J3HsCpigPTkgJoeglTqV697US5lhkBYvDk51QOFJnPJDreY-", "site_full": "www.smh.com.au", "site": "smh.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.smh.com.au/rss/business.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Sydney Morning Herald - Business", "title": "The underground bunkers where 'Patient Zero' helps the ultra-rich hide billions in bitcoin", "title_full": "The underground bunkers where 'Patient Zero' helps the ultra-rich hide billions in bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-10T03:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_2.556830304165886%2C$multiply_0.7554296506137866%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_453%2C$y_40/t_crop_custom/t_sharpen%2Cq_auto%2Cf_auto/8c499687289b2afe5191de20a63b8fa7a6dd63c8", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1534, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d8f9767025df9213fe8d8f87031739b120696a6f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS85jFjidQBhh0dPtJ2hgt5bArU0U5Y37xjTLrIQXQqmBu7hMgotoxpv5WM.J74HzRX9NXTKx7n9xSVVGoisbbhHYwN1gJQzngxktHwT7tZyoun6SSfRcQgIccGGmwcDgakR5xINslw35.Jk2p7J3HsCpigPTkgJoeglTqV697US5lhkBYvDk51QOFJnPJDreY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-10T03:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "The underground bunkers where 'Patient Zero' helps the ultra-rich hide billions in bitcoin", "text": "The underground bunkers where 'Patient Zero' helps the ultra-rich hide billions in bitcoin By Tom Metcalf Larger text size Very large text size Behind the guards, the blast doors and down corridors of reinforced concrete, sit the encrypted computer servers -- connected to nothing -- that hold keys to a vast digital fortune.

That drove him to build a series of fintech startups that made him millions before he encountered Bitcoin. He sold 75 per cent of Patagon, a Latin American financial-services website, for $US529 million in 2000 and digital wallet startup Lemon for $US43 million 13 years later to focus on crypto. By then, he was already a big holder of Bitcoin. \"I am personally allocating a percentage of my net worth to this that is borderline irresponsible because I believe in it so much,\" Casares told Lemon board member Eric O'Brien, according to \"Digital Gold,\" a book by Nathaniel Popper. Two years ago, he joined the board of PayPal. The bitcoin paradox Bitcoin's meteoric rise in recent years has spurred the proliferation of rival currencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple that also have multibillion-dollar valuations. Yet Xapo only safeguards Bitcoin because of Casares's belief that it alone will succeed. Such dogmatism has seen Xapo turn away customers looking to store rival currencies. Other purists say ventures such as Xapo have no place in the Bitcoin ecosystem, slowing down what's supposed to be a seamless transfer. Xapo's top brass wrestle with that paradox, too. \"It's a subject we discuss a lot, and we believe Bitcoin won't reach the mainstream if people have to hold their own private keys,\" Rogers said. \"It's a pretty high hurdle technically to be your own bank with lots of security.\" Bloomberg", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities":

enforce.\n“Dear @bill gates, there is a simple way to Shorten Bitcoin. You can shorten XBT, the CBOE Bitcoin Futures contract, and your words into actions! “ Dear @bill gates, there is an easy way to short bitcoin. You can short #XBT, the @CBOE Bitcoin (USD) Futures contract, and put your money where your mouth is! cc @CNBC @Warren Buffett https://t.co/4JIhF5vWsZ\n— Tyler Winklevoss (@Tyler winklevoss) May 7, 2018\nThe CBOE Futures contract was launched by Gemini, the crypto-exchange, the Winklevoss brothers, side-by-side with the Chicago Board Options Exchange.\nTyler Winklevoss and his brother Cameron Winklevoss were early investors in Bitcoin, and therefore had the opportunity to get hold of the currency with a reasonable price. According to Fortune, the brothers invested $ 11 million of the 65 million, the Two received won a lawsuit in 2011 by Facebook, in Bitcoin. Thanks to the spectacular price the two were billionaires, because their investment is now around 1.1 billion Dollar increase in value in the last few years. Bill Gates has forced his opinion out of the “group” changed?\nGates has always been known for his positive attitude towards crypto-currency. In 2014, the co-founder of Microsoft has said in an Interview with Bloomberg that the largest crypto-currency is better than Fiat currency.\n“Bitcoin is exciting because it shows how cheap [transactions] can be. Bitcoin is better than the [Fiat] currency, since you don’t have to be physically in the same place, and of course, Fiat] currency in major transactions may be quite impractical.“\nAs he sat in a round table with Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger of Berkshire Hathaway, both of which are for its critical view against crypto-currencies is known, seemed in his view to change from the positive to the negative. Some Internet users speculated that this Change comes from the fact that Gates wanted to share the opinion of the two gentlemen of Berkshire Hathaway. According to Redditor iExtrapolate1337 the Reputation of the Interviews, therefore, was “painful”.\nSource: Reddit\nCurrently, the price for Bitcoin is 9082 USD, which is, compared to the week high of 9.964 USD by almost 10% lower.

While most aren’t as famous as Satoshi’s Times headline of January 3 2009, each one will live for as long as bitcoin does, testaments to mankind’s obsession with steganography, spam, and unorthodox marriage proposals.\nAlso read: No, There Isn’t Child Porn on the Bitcoin Blockchain The Bitcoin Blockchain Is Riddled with Messages\nThere are six ways to encode messages in the bitcoin blockchain, using such fields as the coinbase parameter and OP_RETURN. Over the years, every single one of these has been used to encode cryptic messages, some frivolous, some practical, and some extremely dubious . For example, bitcoin miners have used this ability to signal support for protocol changes such as the acceptance of Segwit. The message that started it all\nYou don’t have to be running a bitcoin miner to encode your own messages in the blockchain for all eternity – or for as long as humanity exists, for even if bitcoin were to inconceivably die, copies of the blockchain would remain. With over 100,000 backups distributed around the world, someone’s bound to retain a copy. There are detailed guides to encoding your own messages in the blockchain. Alternatively, for those who don’t relish setting up a Bitcoin Core client, Eternity Wall does all the hard work to deliver “messages lasting forever”. It promises “Even if this site goes down or disappears, your message is guaranteed to persist [in the bitcoin blockchain] for generations to come.” Memorable Messages Buried in the Blockchain\nAs Nic Carter recently pointed out , there are at least six marriage proposals embedded in the bitcoin blockchain. In keeping with tradition, all appear to have been posted by men. Whether their significant others ever saw the messages while idly parsing hexed blockchain data is unknown. These inscriptions – plus many more – can be found simply by typing the desired keyword or phrase into Blockchair’s blockchain explorer .\nPredictably, adding profanities to the blockchain has proven more popular than marriage proposals. The N-word has appeared over 60 times to date, most of which surface in the bitcoin cash blockchain for some reason. The F-word appears over 1,000 times, around the same number of times as “Satoshi”. By default, messages that are encoded in the blockchain don’t stand out – the human eye isn’t programmed to decode hexadecimal – but a number of tools and projects have been developed to unshroud the mysteries that lie within the bitcoin ledger. Messages from the Mines\nA Florida design agency has created an interactive art installation for decoding blockchain messages and bringing them to life. Messages from the Mines reveals the “cryptic poems, ASCII art, signatures, eulogies and more” that form “a creative misuse of the Bitcoin transaction protocol, a form of digital graffiti…cultural artifacts forever embedded in one of the most contemporary digital technologies.” Ascii art revealed by Messages from the Mines\nReal world graffiti fades through time or is pressure washed into oblivion by killjoy municipal departments. But on the blockchain, every inscription, no matter how profound, political, or crude, remains forever, free from censorship, just as bitcoin was made to be.\nHave you ever encoded a message in the bitcoin blockchain?

Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The value of currencies may fluctuate and investors may lose all or more than their original investments. Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The leveraged nature of FX trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds and such may work against you as well as for you.

Xapo made headlines when it began storing Bitcoin in a mountainside vault in Switzerland after moving to the country from California. Now, storage requirements span five continents, handling coins from both private and institutional investors and even some other crypto offerings. CoinShares, a UK-based investment products and research firm, has deposited around $500 million of client funds with Xapo. “Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,” CEO Ryan Radloff said. “You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.” Bitcoin 70%+ Increase This Week? Those holdings could become all the more valuable in a matter of days. Bitcoin prices could benefit more than ever from the ‘Consensus Effect’ and pass $15,000 this week, Fundstrat Global Advisors cofounder Tom Lee has said. Ahead of the well-known cryptocurrency conference, which takes place in New York May 14 – 16, the infamous Bitcoin bull forecast price rises on the back positive sentiment could top 70% versus current levels. “Already one of the largest crypto conferences in the world, attendance this year is up dramatically and coming at a time when Bitcoin/Crypto is down YTD. Hence, we expect the Consensus rally to be even larger than past years,” he wrote quoted by various sources. CRYPTO: #Consensus2018 , organized by @Coindesk , impact on crypto market will be much larger in 2018, given the sheer increase in expected attendance. 2017 was +1,250 additional attendees but 2018 should see +4,250 additional. 3x the impact… next week an interesting week pic.twitter.com/J9z4o1COil — Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) May 8, 2018 In the four years Consensus has run, Bitcoin has gained in price around the time of the event, exhibiting similar behavior to its now traditional new year slumps Bitcoinist reported on in mid-January. Lee noted the pattern, which has seen varied gains from as little as 10% to as much as 70% since 2015, but thinks 2018 could break the mould. From circling $9000 May 9, BTC/USD could shift at least $4250 in the coming seven days, he claimed in a comparison for Fundstrat. What do you think about Xapo’s storage?

of traditional market figureheads taking stabs at Bitcoin is back. Statements given by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett over the past week has caused the cryptocurrency community to erupt in disbelief due to some outrageous statements. Bitcoin Under Attack Again? It seems that the good name of Bitcoin is back under attack by traditionalists who have constantly objected to the world-changing effects which cryptocurrency has. On an appearance on the Squawk Box segment on CNBC, Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft and one of the richest people in the world, said that he would short Bitcoin if “there was an easy way to do it.” It is a shame that Gates seems to have spent no time in researching the topic of shorting the world’s most prominent cryptocurrency. Tyler Winklevoss, a longtime supporter of cryptocurrency, quickly jumped on Gate’s statement given to the CNBC hosts. Winklevoss gave a statement on Twitter directed at Bill Gates. Tyler wrote: There is an easy way to short bitcoin. You can short #XTB, the CBOE Bitcoin Futures contract, and put your money where your mouth is. Dear @BillGates there is an easy way to short bitcoin. You can short #XBT , the @CBOE Bitcoin (USD) Futures contract, and put your money where your mouth is! cc @CNBC @WarrenBuffett https://t.co/4JIhF5vWsZ — Tyler Winklevoss (@tylerwinklevoss) May 7, 2018 This being quite a damaging set of words coming from one of the world’s largest Bitcoin promoters or “evangelists” as they are more well known. Tyler and his brother, has created quite a nest egg for themselves in the cryptocurrency space, founding the Gemini exchange along with gathering a hefty amount of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Most crypto users believe that they are actually one of the largest holders of Bitcoin , with some suggesting that they own over 100,000 bitcoins, worth over $900 million USD at current market prices. The Winklevoss twins decided that they would get themselves involved in the cryptocurrency space back in 2013, which some would remember as one of the big crypto years prior to 2017. They were quick to buy up stacks of Bitcoin with the $65 million USD they had received in a settlement with Mark Zuckerberg. CBOE Bitcoin Contracts: Adoption and Negative Price Action at The Same Time? The Bitcoin futures contracts which Tyler referred to was launched in late December 2017 in the midst of the largest run-up which Bitcoin had accomplished to date. In the short span of one year, the cryptocurrency ran from just around $1000 to just over $20,000 before the end of the year, which increased consumer demand for futures. The arrival of the CBOE ( Chicago Board Options Exchange) Bitcoin futures contracts introduced a new way in which more traditional investors could get themselves involved in the ever-growing space. An important point to note is that trading CBOE contracts do not allow you the option to actually own the cryptocurrency which you trade. This being a key step away from the decentralized nature which has been so tied to the identity of cryptocurrencies. Contrary to Gate’s statement, CBOE futures are actually widely accessible to the public through investment portals which a vast majority of brokers promote. Brokers such as TD Ameritrade, along with Interactive Brokers, a popular online brokerage, both offer a way which their user base can interact with CBOE Bitcoin futures. Although the introduction of these features was considered as helpful by many cryptocurrency users, it has become a way where Bitcoin critics can begin to weigh down the cryptocurrency with negative price action. A report by the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank has shown that they believe that Bitcoin futures will only continue to put negative pressure on the price of Bitcoin going into the future. Research conducted by the FRB of San Francisco shows that the announcement and subsequent release of the futures actually had a lot to do with the change in price for the popular cryptocurrency. The statement highlighted: The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence. Rather, it is consistent with trading behavior that typically accompanies the introduction of futures markets for an asset. It is hard to see whether this is an accurate statement seeing that volatility has become a staple to the cryptocurrency market. However, their research may have indicated that there was at least a glimmer of influence which the futures have caused. Not only did the release of futures trading have an effect, but so did the accessibility which institutions can now utilize to get their hands involved in the cryptocurrency space. Futures trading allow for institutions to have easier access to buying or short selling Bitcoin contracts. These futures could be a way in which anti-Bitcoin minded financial institutions can use their vast funds to hedge bets against the price of Bitcoin. Looking Into The Future Nothing has changed since the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) attacks experienced throughout the tumultuous past 6 months to which the cryptocurrency industry has had to go through. Not only did Bill Gates trash Bitcoin but so did Warren Buffett , who called the cryptocurrency “rat poison” earlier this week. Although this sentiment was expected from a more traditional mind like Buffett, it was unexpected that he was going to come out in such a virulent manner. It is highly speculated by the community that Buffett does not fully understand what exactly Bitcoin is and what it means for the future of technology and the financial world. Reports show that he has been slow to adopt new technology and still uses flip phones from the last decade. Hard to talk down on something you don’t understand, eh? It is unlikely that Gates or Buffett will have a change of heart unless there is something in it for them, whether it be the success of their respective firms or a position of power. For now, it is unclear whether the statements given by Buffett and Gates alike have had any impact on the frothy cryptocurrency market. But until more concrete numbers begin to show for Bitcoin, it will be hard to tell. The Bitcoin market has come roaring back recently with an over 60% gain in Bitcoin price and a 100% Ethereum gain over the past 6 weeks. Things may finally begin to be looking up for the market as we reach the dog days of summer. What do you think of financial tools like the CBOE Bitcoin futures? Will they help or damage the market going into the future? We would love to know, so please let us know in the comments below.

Roku provides streaming content to set-top devices and apps.

Crypto Shows Gaining Popularity The number of television shows featuring cryptocurrencies is growing. Last month, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the cable network Cheddar launching a 30-minute show about cryptocurrencies called Crypto Craze. In February, Krypton Capital announced the launch of Crypto TV which focuses on breaking crypto news, panel discussions and live interviews. Eight pilot episodes of this show are being produced. Regular TV shows have also featured cryptocurrencies in selected episodes. Award-winning CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory, for example, aired an episode in November called “The Bitcoin Entanglement.” USA Network’s Mr. Robot has also made many references to bitcoin. This week, HBO’s Silicon Valley featured an ICO while Showtime’s Billions featured a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet. What do you think of this crypto TV series?
