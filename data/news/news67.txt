He got all BIG blocker nutjobie, and at that time concluded (and still seems to hold such sentiments) that theymos was censoring his feelings too much, and he was going to take his marbles...\nYou or anyone else with the possible skills who wants to could program a chartbuddy, and I am sure that anyone would receive a lot of positive praise for such proactivity.. likely merits, but maybe if the bot performed well, even a few folks would donate some token amounts of BTC (no guarantees, of course)?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T02:32:19.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7058d05a99d359d24d50a92308928e2eeb873fed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRGFW5jFBpvikRpmCF0n58_eLkTigmZtzO.pTNUjf78V1B84v8bFC7l", "site_full": "investmenttotal.com", "site": "investmenttotal.com", "site_section": "http://investmenttotal.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Daily Investing Tips", "title": "Bitcoin Cash BCH Price Predicitons – How & Where to Buy Bitcoin Cash?", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash BCH Price Predicitons – How & Where to Buy Bitcoin Cash?", "published": "2018-06-02T05:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i1.wp.com/investmenttotal.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Bitcoin-Cash.jpg?fit=690%2C427&#038;ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7058d05a99d359d24d50a92308928e2eeb873fed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRGFW5jFBpvikRpmCF0n58_eLkTigmZtzO.pTNUjf78V1B84v8bFC7l", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Grace", "published": "2018-06-02T05:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash BCH Price Predicitons – How & Where to Buy Bitcoin Cash?", "text": "Bitcoin Cash BCH Price Predicitons – How & Where to Buy Bitcoin Cash? 1, 2018\nBitcoin Cash price predictions, tips, guides and ways to buy (how & where to buy) & sell BitCoin cash – a cryptocurrency market guide!

We also participate in Initial Coin Offerings ICO after we sell Bitcoin Cash. It is up you whether you will hold HODL BCH or not.

I and Derick came from California, USA! Thanks!”\nInvestentTotal.com Reply:\nIn InvestmentTotal.com we personally use Kraken and Bittrex. I do always use Kraken but I suggest if you buy in bulk (example 10 bitcoins), choose which exchanges that has high volumes of trades for BCH.\nAs a guide: Kraken Trading Platform review and Experience Store your Bitcoin or other coins and tokens in a hardware wallet like Ledger Nano S Secure your account in exchanges (create account with difficult or easy to guess password). use authenticator so your account can access easily by other people.\nIf the predictions of Wallet Investors.com for Bitcoin cash is true,and you have now at least 160 BCH, after 5 years you will become a millionaire. But investing 160,000 dollars is not easy. I would rather diversify my crypto portfolio by buying different coins or tokens.

Markets are spooked and looking to move lower, and expected a lower NFP number. The boost Friday to US share markets was more of an HFT play than real volume (as goes Apple, so goes the S&P). Be very careful on Monday if you have an open position. If you are in position through Aisa open to EU open, you may catch a bit more profit but risk is high. Use EU open to position for a reverse. Look to EU early moves to indicate early direction and be prepared to exit. RBA is releasing this week. Volatility in the ASX coupled with the AU real estate market falling will create fear. Add in trade war blowback and the whole Australian market may be making big moves in the near future (lower banks, higher mining and metals that have good China exposure - AL, rare earths, etc.). After Italian bonds scared market, look for bigger than expected moves every time an EU bond statistic is published. Use those releases to grab a couple of quick ticks on US T-notes - ZN - from big spreader orders and HFT risk hedging. Bitcoin My advice on bitcoin was a bit premature last week. I expected a move higher after the chart appeared to find a bottom of a \"fishing line\" move. Remember the best chart reading advice ever given was: \"Buy fishing lines, sell rhino horns.\" - Jim Sinclair. On the other hand, I was expecting a broader market move lower on NFP data, but that move started a bit early in the week (pre-ADP NFP). So perhaps the bitcoin move is starting a bit late this time. Direction and timing are the key to day trading. As such, I am still looking for a move higher from the $7500 level. Timing will be the challenge. Be aware that volatility in the currency markets is also putting pressure on cryptos. Spreads in FX markets are not as wide as those available in crypto, especially the majors like bitcoin. Thus, there are some odd volumes coming through crypto markets. Don`t be fooled into thinking that this volume is actual crypto volume when it is a currency spread trade. That trade, if you are good at math/programming, is a crypto sell on one currency side, buy on the other. Then close out in the opposite direction when price spread reverses against the FX market spread for an easy risk-free win (spread will revert to FX market price). Straight fiat FX price is stable compared to a crypto to fiat 5% wide spread. To FX markets, that is a massive move and an easy opportunity to an FX trader. Corn I like to trade long corn this time of year. However, trade-war BS has made price action uncertain. This has meant I didn`t get a big fill - only partial - on the dip (I am cheap and spread call buy orders wide for long term trades to get a better entry price). The political uncertainty has made me avoid chasing price higher. This uncertainty also has me looking for an exit because I will trade weather and season but loath to trade politics. That being said, I expected this year to be hard for wicking corn (corn breeding). The climate conditions of excessively hot temperatures this time of year are bad for yield (higher prices expected). It appears, it will be even worse than even I expected. June temperatures over 100 degrees F will be fatal to corn reproduction. So trade accordingly (I will be tempted to hold longer than I should when politics are involved, but not tempted to increase size). https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-05-31/wicked-weather-midwest-jumps-coldest-april-hottest-may-record DISCLAIMER: YOU ARE AN ADULT and must make your own decisions.

The hacker who called himself IsHakdz vandalized the site by replacing the website’s content with an image of Guy Fawkes from the film V for Vendetta along with the phrase “Your security down I’m not sorry.” The page also contained links to files allegedly containing customer information, prompting Eventbrite to temporarily shut down Ticketfly until the security situation could be assessed and resolved.\n“Following recent site issues, we determined that Ticketfly has been the target ofa cyber incident,” the company said in a statement. “To protect our clients and fans, and to secure the website and related data, we have temporarily taken all Ticketfly systems offline.”\nIn addition to breaching Ticketfly while keeping the site’s HTTPS certificate intact, the hack also affected Brooklyn Bowl, Pear Street Warehouse, and Lafayette Theater, according to The Verge . And because Ticketfly was unable to comment on what information may have been compromised during this attack, if you’ve recently made any transactions through Tickefly or any of the affected sites, you may want to keep an eye on your credit card statements and credit report. Motherboard was able to confirm that home addresses, emails, and telephone numbers of customers were part of the files leaked by the IsHakdz. Additionally, the hacker said that he may release more stolen information on his website, PCMag reported.\nThe hacker claimed to have initially warned Ticketfly about the site’s vulnerability that would allow him to take control of the site and all its database, but he demanded a payment of one Bitcoin to reveal the details. Ticketfly didn’t reply, and it appears that the hacker went ahead and put his knowledge to use in hacking Ticketfly’s site, Motherboard reported.\nIf you had purchased a ticket for an upcoming event from Ticketfly, a support page notes that these tickets may be available at the door.

They will launch support later today, with pairings for USD, Tether and TrueUSD.\nThis feature is being currently rolled out to corporate consumers for the time being due to regulatory concerns. The feature will be available for corporate customers in Washington, New York, California and Montana.\nThe bank that will manage the USD side of Bittrex’s operations is Signature Bank, based out of New York which according to various reports does $37.3 million in revenue. They are one of the other financial firms that Bittrex will choose to hold dollar-denominated funds.\nBittrex CEO Bill Shihara said that the move was indicative of banks being able to trust crypto, and was not just about Bittrex. He said:\n“It’s been a long path…And I think it’s really showing that crypto is turning the corner in terms of mainstream acceptance.”\nThe reluctance of big institutional names to move into the crypto market might be due to the lack of a regulatory framework, which comes with its own uncertainties. Government regulations on money laundering such as AML and customer information such as KYC are being enforced on crypto exchanges, as they associated with banks. The criminal connotations of dealing with Bitcoin also contribute to the hesitance of institutional investors.\nThis results in many exchanges being crypto-to-crypto, leaving customers to find complex workarounds to convert their crypto into fiat. Coinbase has found their banking partners in Cross River Bank, Metropolitan Bank and Silvergate Bank in the United States.

Mr. Hanyecz describes his dealings with Satoshi as having been “kind of weird.”\nAlso Read: Moon Missions and Custom Wallets: Bitcoin Community Celebrates Pizza Day Early BTC Developer Discusses Email Exchanges with Satoshi\nMr. Hanyecz, a programmer known in the bitcoin world for paying a man from Bitcointalk.org 10,000 BTC to order him two pizzas from Papa John’s in 2010, discussed his personal interactions with Satoshi Nakamoto in a recent interview .\nAfter mining bitcoins on his laptop for some time, Mr. Hanyecz reached out to Satoshi to express his desire to contribute to the development of bitcoin. “I thought bitcoin was awesome, and I wanted to be involved, but I had a regular developing job,” Hanyecz said. “Nakamoto would send me emails like ‘Hey, can you fix this bug?’ ‘Hey, can you do this?’” Mr. Hanyecz “Didn’t Want the Responsibility”\nDespite his enthusiasm for bitcoin, Mr. Hanyecz saw his contributions to the cryptocurrency as a side project of secondary importance to his career, and felt as though Satoshi had unrealistic expectations of his involvement.\n“He’d say, ‘Hey, the west side’s down,’ or ‘We have these bugs – we need to fix this.’ I’d be like, we? We’re not a team,” Mr. Hanyecz said. “I thought that it was approval from him, that maybe he accepted me as a member. But I didn’t want the responsibility. I didn’t really understand all of the forces that were going on at the time.”\nOn occasion, Mr. Hanyecz would express his dissatisfaction, recounting that he would say “Hey, you’re not my boss.” Despite the irritation, Mr. Hanyecz states that he “didn’t take it too seriously.” Interactions with Satoshi Consistently Gave Mr. Hanyecz “A Weird Feeling”\nMr. Hanyecz describes the majority of his interaction with bitcoin’s creator to be “kind of weird.”\nMr. Hanyecz found Satoshi to paranoid in many of their exchanges, stating “There were a few times when I got messages that seemed off-base. I brushed them off because I was like, who cares if this guy tells me to go pound sand and go away? This wasn’t my job or anything – it was a hobby. I was trying to be friends with him. He seemed very paranoid about people breaking the software. He kept calling it ‘prerelease,’ and I was helping him get it to release.”\nLooking back, Mr. Hanyecz can empathize with Satoshi’s apparent paranoia, stating that “If anything had happened to the code early on, we wouldn’t be having this conversation today.” Satoshi Weary of Mining Centralization\nAccording to Mr. Hanyecz, Satoshi Nakamoto was aware of the potential for mining to lead to centralization in bitcoin ownership, stating that Satoshi told him “Well, I’d rather not have you do the mining too much.”\nMr. Hanyecz stated that “[Satoshi] was trying to grow the community and get more commerce use cases. He fully recognized that mining would become a thing where a few people would get wealthy.”\nMr. Hanyecz also stated that Satoshi was careful to maintain anonymity, stating “He or she or whoever it was never told me anything personal. I asked a few questions, but he always dodged them. Those questions never got answered.”\nWhat’s your interpretation of the person behind the Satoshi Nakamoto enigma?

I actually searched through all the 100 other forks and nobody really did anything. So I basically really was doing something that had not been done before.\nI was able to change the majority of chain parameters and use different DNS seeds but for a reason I have not yet been able to determine, the peers on the other network refuse to grant auth to my modified gocoin node. I mean, it is significantly different, there is two PoW types in the network I am trying to join it to. The gocoin client doesn't even report the IP addresses in the interface of the nodes it's trying to connect to in the network section. I added extensive trace logging to many functions and these revealed the IP addresses but to be honest I don't know for sure if they were even correct from the DNS seed.\nI kinda had hoped that configuration would be more centralised but instead there is about 3 or maybe more different places in the source that have to be changed and those that I have identified, and changed to match the other network were not enough to get peers seeding blocks to my node.\nIt's not a complaint, per se, or a request or anything like that. It's just a very nice bitcoin client and I thought it would not be so difficult to make it talk to a network based very closely on bitcoin (parallelcoin) and really quite old, so old that building the binary is a maze of ancient dependencies.\nI understand that you build this mainly for your own benefit, so your needs are necessarily quite different being a well seasoned blockchain dev. Anyway, it's a very nice thing you made, just seems to be a bit too different for me to be able to figure out how to get it to connect to a different but basically bitcoin-based network.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T02:03:59.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5587e087a291d0d626e8eb6524964d3087060688", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYkgRLTDQR4Wl5z6iET7eNqxj3Awdw6NXU1LGdQgDyYwkQn_N4U_eIO08lZwyfTatWgjqCgMrP_7.UdFEzfX48pUg--", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://finance.yahoo.com/live/techcrunch", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco 2017", "title": "Today In Cryptocurrency: New $1 Billion Crypto Fund, Hedge Fund Manager Says Buy Bitcoin", "title_full": "Today In Cryptocurrency: New $1 Billion Crypto Fund, Hedge Fund Manager Says Buy Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-02T04:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5587e087a291d0d626e8eb6524964d3087060688", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYkgRLTDQR4Wl5z6iET7eNqxj3Awdw6NXU1LGdQgDyYwkQn_N4U_eIO08lZwyfTatWgjqCgMrP_7.UdFEzfX48pUg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Wayne Duggan", "published": "2018-06-02T04:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Today In Cryptocurrency: New $1 Billion Crypto Fund, Hedge Fund Manager Says Buy Bitcoin", "text": "The cryptocurrency market finished up another lackluster week on Friday, with most major cryptocurrencies trading lower by more than 1 percent. Here’s a look at some of the headlines that were moving the cryptocurrency market today — and which currencies were on the move.\nHeadlines\nBinance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, announced the creation of a $1 billion fund to back cryptocurrency and blockchain startup companies. Binance said its first incubation project will be blockchain-based Chinese ride hailing startup Dache Coin. Binance has also invested in MobilCoin, Oasis Labs, Certik and Republic.\nDan Morehead, founder of hedge fund Pantera Capital Management, says investors should be scooping up bitcoin after the price of the cryptocurrency has declined 45 percent year-to-date. Morehead said the majority of cryptocurrencies are cheap at the moment and advised investors to buy cryptos once they break their 230-day moving average and hold for at least one year.\nCryptocurrency trading platform Huobi is launching its own crypto-based ETF . The new ETF will replicate the performance of the recently-launched Huobi 10 index, which tracks a basket of 10 different crypto assets.\nPrice Action\nThe Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTC: GBTC ) traded at $12.14, down 1.1 percent.\nHere’s how several top crypto investments fared Friday. Prices are as of 3:45 p.m. ET and reflect the previous 24 hours.\nBitcoin declined 1.5 percent to $7,453; Ethereum declined 1.6 percent to $571; Ripple declined 1.6 percent to 61 cents; Bitcoin Cash declined 2.0 percent to $983; EOS declined 3.6 percent to $12.08.

Carboncoin: $2.2-million market cap, 95.2-percent gain. MagicCoin: $2.6-million market cap, 40.9-percent gain.

And given that bitcoin can replace the dollar, the growth will be very long.\nWhoever said that is wrong. Fools are those who know about such a great way of investing and yet fail to do so.

The firm kicked off its own bitcoin mining operations in December 2017, and has also slated in August as the deadline for the launch of its cloud mining service.\nThe tech giant said in the announcement that the hope is to encourage the public to become familiar with cryptocurrencies via the new app, since users will need to use their own digital wallets to receive and use the bitcoin.\nGMO indicated that, moving forward, it may include support for more cryptocurrencies within the app and also expand its integrations across other mobile games.\nThe new service comes just a week after GMO announced that it is launching the world’s first 7nm bitcoin mining chip, with a target shipment deadline set for the end of October 2018.\nMobile game image via Shutterstock\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Can this young upstart money challenge the global monetary order? Economist Saifedean Ammous traces the history of the technologies of money to seashells, limestones, cattle, salt, beads, metals, and government debt, explaining what gave these technologies their monetary role, what makes for sound money, and the benefits of a sound monetary regime to economic growth, innovation, culture, trade, individual freedom, and international peace.The monetary and historical analysis sets the stage for understanding the mechanics of the operation of Bitcoin, the reasons for its initial success, and the role it could play in an information economy. Rather than serving as a currency and network for consumer purchases, the author argues Bitcoin is better suited as a store of value and network for settlement between large financial institutions. With an automated and perfectly predictable monetary policy, and the ability to perform final settlement of large sums across the world in a matter of minutes, Bitcoin's true importance may just lie in providing a decentralized, neutral, free-market alternative to national central banks.

As societies evolved, the need for a more organized system arose as people started practicing monetary exchange. At this point, goods and services could be exchanged for money that had a prescribed value. Eventually, “middle men”, such as banks, became the go-betweens to validate transactions and record them onto ledgers. In our modern society, the advent of new and revolutionary technology has the potential to drastically change upon this system. Born and raised in Bozeman, Montana, Valerie loves being outdoors, especially in the mountains. Attending school in Deerfield, MA has further expanded her horizons. This emphasis on exploring limits has led Valerie to her interest in the blockchain.

First of all I would be glad to introduce myself, but yet, I have a feeling it is a little to early. Don't get me wrong, it is for my own security. Later you will understand.\n I live in Eastern Europe and most of my friends, co-workers, relatives, teachers, neighbors know me as an IT guy, as I am in this industry since I was a young boy. The funny thing is that what I have discovered related to the gambling thing is absolutely away of the programming area. I don't write scripts, trojans and other soft to get things cracked. It's something more like a discovery.\n Last year I started using Bitcoin in all it's possible ways, when it was still under the 2000$ mark, yearly in February or so. I bought some, I traded some, I gambled some and also used some for buying things. At the end I sold my coins when they reached 3000$ ( stupid me ). I, myself am an enthusiast so everything that is new, risky and blood-pumping should pass through me\n I played in Bitsler, Primedice, Freebitco.in and few other small websites. I managed to multiply from 1 to 4 ETH, lose 1 BTC in 10 seconds and play with tens of Litecoins as well. I have a vast experience in gambling with crypto and I lost a lot of coins until finally I realized there is no way to obtain a profit for a living here. I tried lots of strategies, scripts and was literally an addicted to this. Not as a gambling player and loser but as an enthusiast that could not believe it is made to leave you money-free and there is no way to take control over it. It's almost a year since I haven't played a coin on any of these platforms. It became one of my phobias. I feel uncomfortable when I even think of it. And I'm glad I learned an important thing here - luck isn't forever.\n There are several months since I woke up in the morning and I got slapped by a crazy thought. I wrote it, I remade it at least ten times and finally I tried it out. You know that situation when you are blown away by an idea and you feel it is an unique case which comes up only once in a few months or sometimes even years. Well, here it is.\n I don't drink alcohol, I don't smoke anything, I do sports a lot; I have a damn healthy lifestyle so I can call my idea - a genius one, born in a healthy brain. MENS SANA IN CORPORE SANO\n Do not worry, I am not here to scam anybody. All the information about me will be transparent: my identity, all my social pages, my real address, my connections, everything.\nIt will not be a long term event. I don't want to help gambling sites get bankrupt. I respect them; they created a strong chain of good-spending time places which sometimes bring fun and good money even to the players, if they aren't greedy.\n What I am about to offer to the limited number of you guys, is a small gap that the scripts on which gambling platforms are based - can not yet handle and understand. This will also help developers to work out the system and make it even stronger and bigger. When we are done, this post will disappear and the idea will be forgotten.\n Whom I am willing to deal with - are only people that want to add some profit to their bitcoins. It will not be an easy process, the stress will remain in you as long as the game will take place. I had a recent post in Bitcoin discussion section ( search in my profile info ) which helped me understand if there are many people that lost by trading BTC, especially when they purchased BTC for nearly 20k. I might help them out getting some money back. Honestly, this is one of the strongest reasons I selected the Nr.1 Bitcoin forum. This is not for those who tend to try it with 100k or 10 million satoshis only. This is for those who want to use adequate amounts like 1 BTC and up. Because the sum you will get from using this system once, will be maximum 35-40% of the bet amount, so no reason to waste your time and mine for few hundreds of satoshi. The second reason is that small amounts are very risky,because there are some minimums in terms of betting. For those who don't believe - I am absolutely fine with meeting you, doing all these things together. Especially if you are in Europe or Russia, the ticket cost will be a symbolic price comparing to what revenue will be caught using this thing. If you live in the US or Asia, and you are willing to put into action several bitcoins, even the round-trip ticket will have a tiny price comparing to the amount used in BTC.\n Don't try to analyze my Activity on the forum or the Merit level because it has nothing related to what I am doing here. I am using this forum since last year and only for reading. You are asking yourself why I am not using my money to multiply them in the system? Simple - I don't have a starting capital. And for the same account, it is 99% impossible to use this thing daily; the websites detect it and empty you out. The only way that it works is only once per account ( at least this is what I guarantee ). Doing it repeatedly is out of my \"jurisdiction\". If I put 100$ and try to multiply it, I will be bankrupt in 2 days maximum. The main idea is to use it only once and leave. Simple as pie!\nIf you still consider me a scammer, tell me why I don't ask for money in advance?\nHow did you test it and why are you so sure it's a working thing? - Simple - in different periods, each time on different accounts with different small amounts, in the last 2 months and it's always the same result range, getting even better every time I add or cut something.\nHow does it work? - Sorry, it's only me that knows it. Nothing recorded, nothing spoken to anybody. Human factor is involved in this small trick.\nWhat is your guarantee? - You decide. I don't bring guarantees, I don't make videos at least you request me to do some, just for fun. It's working and it will be working until I tell it to someone responsible for it. Remember - you can come visit me and we do this together. Or I can visit you of course. We are talking about tens of thousands of dollars, not hundreds. This is serious. I don't want to deal with dull people, please do not disturb. And the adequate guys will understand from my post and the conversations with me that I am not a scammer. No offence to anybody, sorry.\nYou will get in touch with me, you will tell me which gambling site you prefer ( if you tried any ), if you didn't, and just want to try this, be my guest. You tell me the amount you want to use and get those ~40% profit. I prepare the formula, give it to you with all the instructions and advises. You use it, you withdraw all the coins and decide whether use it again or not. Remember - a formula can be used only once. This is the only time I guarantee something. Using it the second time will 99% bankrupt you. Every round has its unique formula ( it is impossible to use it on different accounts as it is always unique and one-time, don't risk your money and my time ). This is because of the system, not me . Every round can last from 2-3 hours to 6-7 hours. In very rare cases, you can reach your target in less then 1 hour. This is luck. You will not lose a satoshi if you do everything exactly like I say. I repeat - these are not strategies and scripts, because any strategy leaves you empty sooner or later. We know that! This is something totally different and unique.\nWhat's the cost of this? - 10% of the amount you are putting in action. You get 30% and I get 10% of your bet.\n\"I lost everything, you bastard, give me my money back! \" - You can't lose anything. Show me the screen recording of the play. Even if 1 of 100 players will lose, I will have a good backup from those who won. I'm not worried at all.\nOk, guys. This is kind of it, for now. I will be editing the post everytime I consider adding something or modifying something else. I am thinking of a promotion, to give a free try to the first 2 people who want to try it out, but it is still a thought. I haven't decided yet, because it may not have the most positive impact on the future of this project.\nWrite comments, PMs. Let's discuss", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T14:52:17.035+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "158a429e3422ade126f5f6b28e46e07831701314", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbYTvbDDMYd0uj52pELtOuA-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "People are joking about Bitcoin", "title_full": "People are joking about Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-02T03:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "158a429e3422ade126f5f6b28e46e07831701314", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbYTvbDDMYd0uj52pELtOuA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Wahyud11", "published": "2018-06-02T03:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "People are joking about Bitcoin", "text": "Quote: from: Pearls Before Swine on May 31, 2018, 07:29:41 PM Have there actually been any tokens released that have come close to replacing bitcoin?

Sparks is a big believer in Bitcoin technology and thinks that someday in the future it will revolutionize the entire adult industry. Furthermore, Sparks is planning to film a few tutorials on how to use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but with a catch — Brenna plans on filming the educational videos naked. We decided to chat with Brenna about cryptocurrencies so our readers can get an in-depth view of how digital currencies like Bitcoin could transform the sex industry from someone who has a close perspective on how these business models operate. Cryptocurrency Will Solve All of the Current Problems in the Adult Industry\nNews.Bitcoin.com (BC): Can you tell our readers how you first got into bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?\nBrenna Sparks (BS): Silkroad! I lived in a boring old town with nothing to do, and I wanted to get weed but didn’t know any dealers. I heard about Silkroad and was guided to using Bitcoin like that, spending hundreds of Bitcoins like it was nothing. Back then I bought my Bitcoins from Silkroad members, using Greendot Moneypaks. I literally gave them money and hoped that I could trust this criminal to give me the Bitcoins! Ahhh…good times. At least, I wasn’t Goxxed.\nBC: You recently wrote a blog post about cryptocurrencies providing workers in the adult industry censorship resistance from payment processor discrimination. What prompted you to write that post?\nBS: It’s something that isn’t talked about often. Most of the people in the industry don’t really discuss how we can make our industry more advanced and safer from a tech perspective. Everyone, just sort of deals with it and has an “if it ain’t totally broke, it doesn’t need fixing” perspective. Also, because of the taboo nature of the adult industry, many of the industry issues have a hard time getting heard by the rest of the world, so problems have been slowly piling up in the background over the years.\nMy belief is that I should alert the world of potential opportunities, because if the current people in the industry don’t want to build it further, someone else will. The crypto industry is full of visionaries, so I believe sharing these problems with the crypto community will gain attention from one of these visionaries who could actually make these changes happen, because it’s become obvious that no one in the adult industry will do it. As time goes on, I’ll grow to be more elaborate on the matter.\nBC: What do you think about libertarian and free market views involved with cryptocurrencies?\nBS: This question reminds me of a time a while back when I thought to myself, “What if I could choose where my tax money went to? What if I could see exactly where it all went and when?” A few years later, this started becoming a clear reality with cryptocurrencies. The technology that exists today can completely turn the government upside down, and that would be a good thing. Technology is the way of the future.\nTechnology brings order, brings stability, brings growth, brings hope for a better future, not a government.\nI believe cryptocurrency provides many of the things a libertarian wish they could have. It’s a medium that allows us, merchants of the world, to exchange in a modern and reliable way that is free from the government, built on protocols that are open to the public to view and contribute to. Cryptocurrencies are changing the way we interact at an increasingly massive scale. We can fund whatever we wish to fund, we can raise money in ways and speeds that were never possible, and for things that we, as individuals, want or need. It provides visionaries the ability to test the most ambitious ideas that no investor would ever be able to fund, which in my opinion translates to an increase in technological growth rate.\nFinally, cryptocurrencies automate a giant list of tasks that we unnecessarily delegate to our government. In other words, the government is doing too many things that it doesn’t actually need to be doing. Humans may have various views on what is important to them, but we also share many as well. For example, a majority of human beings can agree that we need hospitals, we need proper health care, we need safe roadways and safe buildings. Even if some disagree, it doesn’t matter, it’ll get funded because that’s something a majority mass will agree with, we don’t need a government to “guarantee” that. Just as well, we don’t need a government to tell us what is legal tender, we can do that ourselves.\nWe don’t need a government producing that legal tender either, computers do a far better job at producing an acceptable medium of exchange. Finally, we don’t need a government deciding what matters on our behalf. I believe a country of millions is much more capable of making decisions than a small handful of “elected” individuals. Governments of the past and present serve as a means to an end, that’s all. The future is in less governing, and eventually no governing or autonomous governing that corresponds to a successful self-governed society (or societies). This is not to say that we don’t need a government, but rather that we need a lot less of it. Working at a Crypto-Friendly Establishment Felt Futuristic\nBC: What are your favorite cryptocurrencies right now?\nBS: Besides Bitcoin, I would say – SONM (SNM), Odyssey (OCN), Spankchain (SPANK), and Ark (ARK).\nBC: How do you envision cryptocurrencies helping individuals in the adult industry in the future?\nBS: I talk about this further below, but basically cryptocurrency will solve all of the current problems in the adult industry without creating major new problems in the process.\nBC: You recently tweeted that you planned on giving cryptocurrency lessons naked. Do you still plan on giving these lessons?\nBS: Yes, I’m in the process of filming it right now. At first, I thought about filming and releasing each video at a time, but I’ve decided to film multiple videos to ensure and schedule each release. My calendar is all over the place so I figured this is the best way to approach it.\nBC: When you work at clubs like the Legends Room how many tips have you gotten in cryptocurrency, and can you tell our readers what it’s like working at a crypto-friendly establishment like that?\nBS: I was tipped pretty often in cryptocurrency, mainly because the clients had crypto and wanted to actually use it.\nWorking at a crypto-friendly establishment felt futuristic, for lack of a better word. It really feels like you’re in a new world and it just feels right. When it came to using it, everything was straightforward and comfortable. Cryptocurrency Takes the Best Parts of Cash and Debit Cards and Removes the Other Junk\nBC: Do you still use the Bitcoin.com Wallet?\nBS: As of this moment, no. Reason being is that most of my coins are in deep cold storage.\nBC: Are there any other people you know that work in the adult film industry that also accept cryptocurrencies?\nBS: Yep! There is a growing number of talent, both male and female, like Shelby Paris, Holly Hawkes, and Kyle Mason. I also have directors approaching me for help regarding crypto on set and on my social media. It’s growing quietly, but noticeable. I believe camgirls and individual content produces will be the ones that utilize it the most though, especially in the early stages. I can only see it becoming a standard in the adult industry once a large number of people have become familiar enough with it.\nBC: Do you envision cryptocurrencies taking over the adult industry online in the future as far as payments are concerned for subscriptions, cam shows, pics, movies, and other services?\nBS: I definitely think so. For one, cam sites already use a token system so it’ll be quite easy for camgirls to pick up on it. Escorts can perform a transaction safely and discretely, especially when using a privacy-oriented coin like Monero or Bitcoin Private. Production companies can skip using checks and performers can get paid same day. Production companies won’t need to pose under different company names to get around bank etiquette. Performers don’t need to explain where their legally obtained funds came from. Individual content producers can easily set up a reliable payment method for their customers without running through a processor that will shut them down and take their money.\nThese are just common issues and aren’t even all that creative. This whole industry can be flipped around by cryptocurrency, for the betterment of it. Bottom line is, people love cash, but it’s becoming more and more inconvenient to carry it. If a company like Brazzers had to pay everyone on set using cash, it’d be a nightmare for whoever is responsible for distributing the money. Our evolving lifestyle is pushing us to move our cash into a bank account and turn it into digital money which we can then use with a debit card, but then that has its plethora of problems and limitations attached to it too, many of which severely impact the adult industry.\nCryptocurrency takes the best parts of cash and debit cards and removes the other junk. I think life has shown that humans are very flexible with what they consider is money and what isn’t. Cryptocurrency is just the natural step forward when it comes to using money in a modern society and I am convinced that that majority of us will adapt to it.\nBC: Since you got into bitcoin do you have a lot of cryptocurrency followers now on social media?\nBS: There has been a growing number of crypto followers on my twitter and it’s all been pretty gradual. One day I figured I’d start mentioning crypto in passing, which led to more and more engagement from the crypto community. Now I’m starting to think that the future of my social media will consist mostly of crypto fans, which I’m okay with!\nCheck out our podcast series ‘Humans of Bitcoin’ featuring Brenna Sparks below.\nWhat do you think about cryptocurrencies transforming the adult industry?

Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The value of currencies may fluctuate and investors may lose all or more than their original investments. Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The leveraged nature of FX trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds and such may work against you as well as for you.

Sparks is a big believer in Bitcoin technology and thinks that someday in the future it will revolutionize the entire adult industry. Furthermore, Sparks is planning to film a few tutorials on how to use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but with a catch — Brenna plans on filming the educational videos naked. We decided to chat with Brenna about cryptocurrencies so our readers can get an in-depth view of how digital currencies like Bitcoin could transform the sex industry from someone who has a close perspective on how these business models operate. Cryptocurrency Will Solve All of the Current Problems in the Adult Industry\nNews.Bitcoin.com (BC): Can you tell our readers how you first got into bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?\nBrenna Sparks (BS): Silkroad! I lived in a boring old town with nothing to do, and I wanted to get weed but didn’t know any dealers. I heard about Silkroad and was guided to using Bitcoin like that, spending hundreds of Bitcoins like it was nothing. Back then I bought my Bitcoins from Silkroad members, using Greendot Moneypaks. I literally gave them money and hoped that I could trust this criminal to give me the Bitcoins! Ahhh…good times. At least, I wasn’t Goxxed.\nBC: You recently wrote a blog post about cryptocurrencies providing workers in the adult industry censorship resistance from payment processor discrimination. What prompted you to write that post?\nBS: It’s something that isn’t talked about often. Most of the people in the industry don’t really discuss how we can make our industry more advanced and safer from a tech perspective. Everyone, just sort of deals with it and has an “if it ain’t totally broke, it doesn’t need fixing” perspective. Also, because of the taboo nature of the adult industry, many of the industry issues have a hard time getting heard by the rest of the world, so problems have been slowly piling up in the background over the years.\nMy belief is that I should alert the world of potential opportunities, because if the current people in the industry don’t want to build it further, someone else will. The crypto industry is full of visionaries, so I believe sharing these problems with the crypto community will gain attention from one of these visionaries who could actually make these changes happen, because it’s become obvious that no one in the adult industry will do it. As time goes on, I’ll grow to be more elaborate on the matter.\nBC: What do you think about libertarian and free market views involved with cryptocurrencies?\nBS: This question reminds me of a time a while back when I thought to myself, “What if I could choose where my tax money went to? What if I could see exactly where it all went and when?” A few years later, this started becoming a clear reality with cryptocurrencies. The technology that exists today can completely turn the government upside down, and that would be a good thing. Technology is the way of the future.\nTechnology brings order, brings stability, brings growth, brings hope for a better future, not a government.\nI believe cryptocurrency provides many of the things a libertarian wish they could have. It’s a medium that allows us, merchants of the world, to exchange in a modern and reliable way that is free from the government, built on protocols that are open to the public to view and contribute to. Cryptocurrencies are changing the way we interact at an increasingly massive scale. We can fund whatever we wish to fund, we can raise money in ways and speeds that were never possible, and for things that we, as individuals, want or need. It provides visionaries the ability to test the most ambitious ideas that no investor would ever be able to fund, which in my opinion translates to an increase in technological growth rate.\nFinally, cryptocurrencies automate a giant list of tasks that we unnecessarily delegate to our government. In other words, the government is doing too many things that it doesn’t actually need to be doing. Humans may have various views on what is important to them, but we also share many as well. For example, a majority of human beings can agree that we need hospitals, we need proper health care, we need safe roadways and safe buildings. Even if some disagree, it doesn’t matter, it’ll get funded because that’s something a majority mass will agree with, we don’t need a government to “guarantee” that. Just as well, we don’t need a government to tell us what is legal tender, we can do that ourselves.\nWe don’t need a government producing that legal tender either, computers do a far better job at producing an acceptable medium of exchange. Finally, we don’t need a government deciding what matters on our behalf. I believe a country of millions is much more capable of making decisions than a small handful of “elected” individuals. Governments of the past and present serve as a means to an end, that’s all. The future is in less governing, and eventually no governing or autonomous governing that corresponds to a successful self-governed society (or societies). This is not to say that we don’t need a government, but rather that we need a lot less of it. Working at a Crypto-Friendly Establishment Felt Futuristic\nBC: What are your favorite cryptocurrencies right now?\nBS: Besides Bitcoin, I would say – SONM (SNM), Odyssey (OCN), Spankchain (SPANK), and Ark (ARK).\nBC: How do you envision cryptocurrencies helping individuals in the adult industry in the future?\nBS: I talk about this further below, but basically cryptocurrency will solve all of the current problems in the adult industry without creating major new problems in the process.\nBC: You recently tweeted that you planned on giving cryptocurrency lessons naked. Do you still plan on giving these lessons?\nBS: Yes, I’m in the process of filming it right now. At first, I thought about filming and releasing each video at a time, but I’ve decided to film multiple videos to ensure and schedule each release. My calendar is all over the place so I figured this is the best way to approach it.\nBC: When you work at clubs like the Legends Room how many tips have you gotten in cryptocurrency, and can you tell our readers what it’s like working at a crypto-friendly establishment like that?\nBS: I was tipped pretty often in cryptocurrency, mainly because the clients had crypto and wanted to actually use it.\nWorking at a crypto-friendly establishment felt futuristic, for lack of a better word. It really feels like you’re in a new world and it just feels right. When it came to using it, everything was straightforward and comfortable. Cryptocurrency Takes the Best Parts of Cash and Debit Cards and Removes the Other Junk\nBC: Do you still use the Bitcoin.com Wallet?\nBS: As of this moment, no. Reason being is that most of my coins are in deep cold storage.\nBC: Are there any other people you know that work in the adult film industry that also accept cryptocurrencies?\nBS: Yep! There is a growing number of talent, both male and female, like Shelby Paris, Holly Hawkes, and Kyle Mason. I also have directors approaching me for help regarding crypto on set and on my social media. It’s growing quietly, but noticeable. I believe camgirls and individual content produces will be the ones that utilize it the most though, especially in the early stages. I can only see it becoming a standard in the adult industry once a large number of people have become familiar enough with it.\nBC: Do you envision cryptocurrencies taking over the adult industry online in the future as far as payments are concerned for subscriptions, cam shows, pics, movies, and other services?\nBS: I definitely think so. For one, cam sites already use a token system so it’ll be quite easy for camgirls to pick up on it. Escorts can perform a transaction safely and discretely, especially when using a privacy-oriented coin like Monero or Bitcoin Private. Production companies can skip using checks and performers can get paid same day. Production companies won’t need to pose under different company names to get around bank etiquette. Performers don’t need to explain where their legally obtained funds came from. Individual content producers can easily set up a reliable payment method for their customers without running through a processor that will shut them down and take their money.\nThese are just common issues and aren’t even all that creative. This whole industry can be flipped around by cryptocurrency, for the betterment of it. Bottom line is, people love cash, but it’s becoming more and more inconvenient to carry it. If a company like Brazzers had to pay everyone on set using cash, it’d be a nightmare for whoever is responsible for distributing the money. Our evolving lifestyle is pushing us to move our cash into a bank account and turn it into digital money which we can then use with a debit card, but then that has its plethora of problems and limitations attached to it too, many of which severely impact the adult industry.\nCryptocurrency takes the best parts of cash and debit cards and removes the other junk. I think life has shown that humans are very flexible with what they consider is money and what isn’t. Cryptocurrency is just the natural step forward when it comes to using money in a modern society and I am convinced that that majority of us will adapt to it.\nBC: Since you got into bitcoin do you have a lot of cryptocurrency followers now on social media?\nBS: There has been a growing number of crypto followers on my twitter and it’s all been pretty gradual. One day I figured I’d start mentioning crypto in passing, which led to more and more engagement from the crypto community.

The Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange (GBX) has introduced 300 retail account holders and a select number of institutional participants to its platform. GBX, a subsidiary of the Gibraltar Stock Exchange (GSX), aims to become one of the first licensed and regulated digital asset exchanges operated by an EU regulated stock exchange.\nAlso read: British Bank Says “No” to Crypto Firms from Gibraltar GBX Offers Exclusive Access to Selected Clients\nThe Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange ( GBX ), which will serve institutional crypto investors, has recently started operations on a limited scale. 300 retail account holders and a number of preselected institutional participants have been introduced to its platform. The announcement of the soft launch follows the recent addition of another sponsor, Blockchain Worx. The exchange now has 10 sponsor companies in its network.\nAt this early stage, the chosen users will be given full and exclusive access to the trading platform. The clients that have been invited to participate in the launch and start trading will also be asked to provide feedback on their experience. The goal: to better assess their needs in order to develop “the finalized user experience”.\n“This is a significant step in our journey to becoming a leading digital asset exchange and token sale platform,” said GBX CEO Nick Cowan, quoted by Banking Tech . “The soft launch of the platform will mean that we can continue as effectively as possible toward providing an institutional-grade token sales springboard for utility tokens and top-quality digital asset exchange for the global blockchain and trading communities,” he added.\nCowan said that GBX will be working to develop a robust token market and provide top-class service to all interested in trading or being listed on the exchange. He promised that the market on the platform will be fair, transparent, efficient, and safe. The chief executive officer also mentioned the successful launch of the GBX GRID token and spoke about two other token sales using the same platform – those of Strykz and Traceto tokens. Crypto Exchange Owned by a Stock Exchange\nGBX, which is a subsidiary of the Gibraltar Stock Exchange (GSX), plans to become one of the first licensed and regulated digital asset exchanges operated by an EU regulated stock exchange. This is possible thanks to a decision by the Gibraltar Parliament from December last year. The legislature voted unanimously to pass a bill to amend the Financial Services Act in order to regulate the crypto sector.\nThe mechanism aimed at protecting customers of cryptocurrency businesses in Gibraltar went into effect on January 1 this year. The regulation targeted crypto and blockchain companies by introducing a licensing regime implemented by the Financial Services Commission of the British overseas territory. The providers of distributed ledger technology services are now obliged to adhere to the regulatory requirements of the Financial Services Act.\nUndoubtedly, local authorities are trying to tap into crypto incomes and profits. Gibraltar, which is known for hosting huge businesses from the financial services sector and the online gaming industry providing a sizable portion of its domestic product, has been making efforts to present itself as an attractive destination for crypto and blockchain companies as well. The territory has also become the first jurisdiction in Europe to regulate Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).\nDo you think Gibraltar can be a global crypto trading hub in the future?

Date: in: Bitcoin 22 Views\nThe late 2017 was rightly termed as the Forks season, witnessing a range of junk copies of the mainstream currencies as well as successful forks like Bitcoin Gold (BTG). The BTG fork minimizes the impact of big miners like Bitmain, on the network and in general, is called “the backup copy of Bitcoin”. And one thing about the forks, is that people who have been holding tokens on main chain, can also get equal number of tokens on the forked blockchain as well. So, those holding Bitcoin before the BTG fork can claim an equal number of the new tokens. And, if you have not received your free BTG – this article is for you!\nThough Bitcoin Gold carries the popular word “Bitcoin”, it works using a completely different algorithm called Equihash. This algorithm is also used to mine another mainstream coin i.e. Zcash. Sponsored Links\nGetting Bitcoin Gold\nLike most hard forks of popular coins, the developers of Bitcoin Gold also announced that the Bitcoin community members would receive BTG tokens, equal to their BTC holdings as of October 25, 2017. While that’s public knowledge, many Bitcoin holders still don’t know how to split the BTG from their Bitcoin wallet.\nExtracting Bitcoin Gold from the eligible Bitcoin holdings is a simple process. It can be done using btgonline.info — an online service that allows people to extract BTG and then exchange it for Bitcoin or just hold it. To do that, they will have to include their Bitcoin wallet’s passphrase or private key and let the tool do its job*.\nChoosing a Bitcoin Gold Wallet\nUsers are free to decide which wallet they would like to use, based on their requirements. However, it is worth keeping in mind that this cryptocurrency has no problems with support and software, so supporters of any platforms can choose the appropriate application. The wallets are available as a usual desktop, and mobile, online or even hardware solutions.\nGetting a BTG – Step by Step The process starts with the authorization in the wallet. Go to the middle tab “SEND/RECEIVE BITCOIN GOLD” From the drop-down list on the left page corner, select your wallet type where your bitcoins were stored, for example: Blockchain.info.\nIn the next field, enter the passphrase that was given to you when opening a crypto-currency wallet. If, in paragraph 2, you chose, for example, “WIF Private key”, then instead of the passphrase you will be asked to enter the Private key; Click the orange “Next” button. Done, you are already in your Bitcoin Gold wallet and you can see your balance, which already should be same as the number of coins received from the hard fork.\nExchanging BTG Made Easier\nTransacting with btgonline.io is a straightforward procedure. Sending BTG is now convenient and simple, all transactions also are immediately visible on the BTG network.\nJust type the transfer amount, then paste the recipient address in the field “Bitcoin Gold Address” and send your transaction. That’s all!\nExchanging BTG to BTC\nAt first, go to the third tab “Exchange BTG to BTC”. Log in by selecting the wallet type and entering a passphrase or Private key. By the button “Next” we pass to the next tab, where you will see the balance of your wallet. Click “Send to BTC”. After that, actions are the same as sending BTG in the previous section: You specify the address to which you want to get bitcoin and select the type of commission. When you click on the “Send” button, our BTG will be converted to BTC and sent to the specified account.\nThe btgonline.io service is the only way to get and store BTG coins in the browser, and the easiest way to change them to bitcoin. If you still have not received BTG, then it’s the most convenient online service that allows you to do this in a minute.\nTo learn more about the service, visit https://btgonline.io/\n*Users are urged to transfer the existing bitcoin balance to another wallet before entering the existing wallet’s passphrase or private key on ANY online tool.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin gol", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin gold", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T06:31:25.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "588f0f87a43c24143a76ecdfaef975f39e9b6648", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS9yqgGFB0m0faNRyylRzcCM-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "title_full": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "published": "2018-06-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "588f0f87a43c24143a76ecdfaef975f39e9b6648", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS9yqgGFB0m0faNRyylRzcCM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nCryptoTab work is based on a smart system, which dynamically switches mining between several cryptocurrencies for increasing profit up to 4x relative to continued mining of the only one cryptocurrency.
