Quoted by author and philosopher Nassin Nicholas Taleb in his book Antifragile, the concept defines entities that can benefit and get better by sustaining shocks and chaos. In the words of the master himself:\n“Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile. Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better”.\nI’ve been very intrigued how the concepts of antifragility is manifesting in the digital currency ecosystem. Not only from the conceptual standpoint but in terms of the market impact. A few months ago, I published some of my initial thoughts about the nascent antifragile characteristics that we can observe in some digital currencies. The aggressive and coordinated regulatory crackdown of the last few days have offered a unique macro-perspective to analyze this phenomenon.\nThe antifragility of the digital currency market has manifested itself last year by adapting to shocking events such as China’s ban of cryptocoin trading, the aggressive position of the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission regarding initial coin offerings(ICOs) or the regular hacking attacks against digital currency exchanges. However, nothing impact more the cryptocurrency markets than the potential of a regulatory crackdown by governments across the world. In recent weeks we have seen an escalation in the measures that regulators are taking to control digital currency assets. Just yesterday, we had a series of events that can make the price of a market asset collapse. Let’s take a quick recap:\n· The South Korea Korea Customs Service (KCS), the statement alleges that a total of 637.5 billion won worth (or around $600 million) in foreign currencies have been exchanged illegally, including unrecorded capital outflow using cryptocurrencies.\n· Also, the South Korea Financial Services Commission (FSC) announced that, starting from Jan. 30, cryptocurrency investors in South Korea will have to use real-name bank accounts in order to continue trading.\n· The U.S Commodities and Futures Trading Comission issued subpoenas to cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and cryptocurrency provider Tether regarding their financial holdings.\n· Cryptocurrency company BitConnect was hit with another lawsuit alleging that the company has been operaring a Ponzi scheme with its investment vehicle.\n· The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is suing cryptocurrency banking company AriseBank with alleged fraud during its recent ICO.\nThat was just yesterday!!! Its impossible to find another market asset that can sustain a similar wave of recurrent bad news. And Bitcoin is Still Alive\nNot surprisingly, the price of Bitcoin dropped yesterday amid the wave of awful news and it triggered a drop in the price of other digital currencies across the board. However, the drop was only about 5% as of this morning which shows that Bitcoin, once again, is showing signs of antifragility.\nIs Bitcoin is able to get passed this wave of regulatory crackdowns, is not crazy to think that its price can raise towards new levels. So far, the $10,000.00 mark seems to the support territory. Regulation is Good\nIn the long term, I believe regulations will have a positive impact in the digital currency ecosystem. If goverments are able to established thoughtful regulatory framworks for digital assets, that will pave the way for new financial products based on cryptocurrency and will legitimize the use of crypto tokens within the mainstream population beyond the speculative means. In the short term, is obvious that regulatory are playing a pivotal role in the recent decline on the valuations of most digital currencies. However, don’t be surprised if the market is able to benefit from these shocks and keeps becoming more antifragile.

Pineapple finally Binds $55M in Bitcoin for Charities Posted by Cryptobble on May 13, 2018 2:31 amTags: Categories: Uncategorized\nRecently, the Pineapple Fund has finally accomplished its mandate by donation more than 5,000 BTC to non- profit organisations around the world. An estimate of around 60 Charities has been the beneficiaries of the Bitcoin Donations.\nThe completion of the bitcoin charity was published on Reddit on May 10 as a farewell post. The anonymous benefactor has gone to thank all the contributors and supporters of the projects for the successful accomplishment of the project and the funds donated.\nAccording to the estimates, the Pineapple Fund has accounted to donate 5,104 bitcoins to about 60 Charities all around the globe. However, due to a recent trend resulting in the decline of the value of the crypto since December 2017, the donations amount is estimated to be around $55.75 million. The beneficiaries of the projects include the Internet Archive, the Pencils of Promise, and the Open Medicine Foundation (OMF).\nThe OMF which received a total of $5 million in bitcoin donations from the funds collected are researching into chronic and complex diseases. On the other hand, the Pencils of Promise, an organisation whose focus points into improvement of the infrastructure of educational institutions of countries such Ghana, Guatemala and Laos, has received around $1.25 million worth of bitcoin.\nAs per the reports, the Internet Archives has received about $2 million in bitcoin between December 2017 and May 2018 from the fund. The Charity is an online library committed to provide software and books free of charge.\nVarious other charities including GiveDirectly and the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) has become the beneficiaries of the project. GiveDirectly supports and facilitate the transfer of money to people in need while on the other hand MAPS has focused on PTSD therapies using psychedelics.\nThe fund is reported to receive tens of thousands of applications from charities around the world, as pointed out by the reports by Pine.\nThe farewell message, as posted by the Pine into Reddit has gone onto express its gratitude to all the participants in the projects. It posts as:\n“I want to thank everyone for supporting this project. Thank you for all the charity suggestions, many of which were funded. Thank you for all the positive messages and love sent my way. And also, thank you, the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community, for turning a Sourceforge project into a $0.5T industry.”\nThrough the foundations Pineapple, the mysterious donor known popularly as Pine, has succeeded in demonstrating the positive impact that the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology could possibly have on the society. Where the technology is being portrayed in the mainstream as enablers of crimes, such news have positive role in changing the narratives.\nPreviously in December, the target promised by Pine was to donate 5,057 bitcoins to charities. Not only the donor succeeded in achieving the target, it even surpassed the mark (approximates by 47 bitcoins).\nThanks for reading! Let us know what you think.

There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,500 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may continue to find sellers on the upside near the $1,480 and $1,500 levels in the near term.\nBitcoin cash price declined towards $1,250 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD is correcting higher, but upsides remain capped by the $1,500 level. Bitcoin Cash Price Resistance\nThis past week, bitcoin cash price trimmed most of its gains and declined from the $1,700 level against the US Dollar. The price declined sharply and moved below the $1,500 and $1,300 support levels. It traded close to the $1,250 support and a low was formed at $1,276. At the moment, the price is correcting higher and is trading above the $1,350 level.\nIt also moved above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,677 high to $1,276 low. However, the price is facing a lot of sellers around the $1,475 level. It also represents a crucial pivot zone, acting as a barrier for buyers near $1,500. It was a support earlier and is now preventing gains above $1,500. The 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,677 high to $1,276 low is also around $1,475. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,500 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair.\nLooking at the chart , the price is clearly facing hurdles near $1,475 and $1,500. Moreover, the 100 hourly simple moving average is also near $1,475 to prevent gains. A break above the $1,500 level could open the doors for more gains towards $1,600.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n4-hours MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is slowly moving into the bullish zone.\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is currently just below the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $1,380\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,500 Bitcoin Cash Price Weekly Analysis – BCH/USD Upsides Remain Capped was last modified: May 13th, 2018 by Aayush Jindal ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "newsbtc bitcoin cash price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin cash price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T07:13:39.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cafd7930e7b0cf36e65c650e86bef67e1706b974", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSyjVVY7wS2bIW.Tbaoj9NZk-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cafd7930e7b0cf36e65c650e86bef67e1706b974", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSyjVVY7wS2bIW.Tbaoj9NZk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nUse your personal link to invite more people and increase your chances of winning.

The case has been listed for further hearing on May 17, 2018.\n“Banking is an essential service. How can one deny access to an essential service when I’m not doing anything illegal? You have not declared VCs ( virtual currencies ) illegal in the country,” said one of the petitioners requesting anonymity.\nThe Reserve bank of India on April 6, 2018 mandated banks, e-wallets, and payment gateway providers to withdraw support for cryptocurrency exchanges and other businesses dealing with virtual currencies in India.\nThe writ petition filed by a group of eleven different representatives from various crypto related businesses challenges the constitutionality validity of the RBI’s decision.\nThe petition came up for hearing before the court of the Chief Justice of India on May 11, 2018. The Supreme Court issued notices to the RBI and Union of India after hearing the petition. The matter has been listed for further hearing on May 17, 2018.\nA writ petition is usually filed for the speedy review of an issue. The RBI’s circular mandates financial institutions to block services by July 5, 2018 putting crypto-related businesses in a spot. In this case, the writ is primarily to see if the government action is constitutionally sound.\nThe writ petition - Rajdeep Singh v. Reserve Bank of India - is the fourth in the series of writ petitions against the RBI for blocking off banking services to cryptocurrency exchanges in India.\nOn April 6, 2018, Kali Digital Eco-systems Pvt. Ltd. which runs the exchange CoinRecoil filed a writ in the Delhi High Court on the grounds that the RBI circular infringes on their right to trade, that is guaranteed in our constitution.\nA while after, another exchange moneytradecoin.com approached the High Court of Delhi challenging the RBI Circular. The Delhi High Court has clubbed these two cases that will come up for hearing on May 24, 2018.\nOn May 8, another joint writ petition was filed by four cryptocurrency exchanges in the Supreme Court against the RBI circular.\nThe Indian government has set up a committee under Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs that is currently working on a framework to regulate cryptocurrencies. The committee is yet to come out with its decision.\n“The RBI has given an affidavit saying that there is a committee at the highest level in the Finance Ministry examining virtual currencies.. Coming up with a circular while awaiting a decision has a chilling effect on any kind of business dealing with virtual currencies,” the petitioner said.\nThe move by RBI has already resulted in the flight of many Indian blockchain startups and cryptocurrency exchanges. Many more are mulling the move to crypto-friendly nations like Australia, Estonia, Cayman Islands, Australia and the like.\nThe newest petition was tagged with two pending writ petitions filed in public interest.

Now the Localbitcoins organization has updated its terms of service agreement which comes with a few new guidelines concerning ID verification and data retention.\nAlso read: Markets Update: Cryptocurrencies Lose Steam During the Weekend Localbitcoins Updates its ToS, Highlighting ID Verification and the Organization’s Privacy Policy\nLocalbitcoins the peer-to-peer exchange founded in June 2012 in Helsinki, Finland has been a very popular trading platform for quite some time. For a while, users could trade in a fairly anonymous manner as it wasn’t required for traders to upload their identification. However a few years ago the organization added the ability for users to verify their state ID or license through a system called Jumio Netverify. A user could voluntarily upload their ID, adding more trust to the trading situation if the person is a real individual. Then this year traders who have been trading “significant” amounts of BTC volume reportedly were being asked to upload their ID to proceed to trade further using the platform.\nNow the business has updated its terms of service (ToS), and explains much of the changes are due to EU regulation, specifically the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation 2016/679) . Cryptocurrency enthusiasts thought that it was odd that Localbitcoins suddenly announced changing its ToS this month, due to this specific regulation which is supposed to actually limit data harvesting, and allow citizens ownership over their identity rights online. Localbitcoins new ToS highlights a few things users should know about identification requirements. Some Situations May Prompt ID Verification\nLocalbitcoins states the organization still does not enforce ID verification as a mandatory procedure for users but says there could be situations where you are required to submit an ID.\n“We don’t require ID verification for all users, but in some situations, you may be asked to verify your ID with us,” explains the website.\nThe following situations will prompt the company to ask the user to upload an ID such as trading over certain volume limits and when advertising, or if someone hacks your account, fraud investigations, and account recovery.\n“It is our top-most priority to ensure that Localbitcoins is a safe and secure bitcoin marketplace and that no one is able to use our service for money laundering or other unlawful activities,” the web page states.\nMost fraud on Localbitcoins stems from users attempting money laundering. We believe that taking a strict stance in this regard is in the interest of our users and important for our brand as a trustworthy marketplace. The Quest for Decentralized Exchanges Continues\nAs far as retaining user data and the organization’s privacy policy, Localbitcoins says they had to rewrite their entire policy. After people began to digest the latest Localbitcoins statements and how the ToS which will be enforced on May 25, many bitcoin enthusiasts again talked about platforms like Shapeshift, and decentralized exchanges like Barterdex, Bisq and others. Again, most cryptocurrency proponents understand the problem with Localbitcoins is the fiat exchange process, which is something you cannot do with Shapeshift.\nWhat do you think about Localbitcoins new ToS?

Aayush Jindal | May 13, 2018 | 6:28 am Bitcoin Price Weekly Analysis – Can BTC/USD Hold $8,000? Aayush Jindal | May 13, 2018 | 6:28 am Key Points Bitcoin price declined sharply after it failed to move above the $9,500 resistance against the US Dollar. There is a significant bearish trend line forming with resistance at $8,900 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may rise in the short term, but it is likely to face resistances near $8,900 and $9,000.\nBitcoin price is facing tough barriers around $8,900-$9,000 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD must stay above $8,200 and $8,000 to avoid any further losses in the near term. Bitcoin Price Support\nThis past week, there was a sharp bearish reaction from the $9,500 pivot level in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The price declined sharply and moved below the $9,000 and $8,500 support levels. The decline was such that the price traded towards the $8,200 level. It also broke a connecting bullish trend line at $9,000. A low was formed at $8,226 before buyers appeared. Later, the price started consolidating losses above $8,200 and is currently stable.\nIt tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $9,479 high to $8,226 low. It seems like the price is finding it hard to move above the $8,500 level, which is also a pivot level. Above the $8,500 level, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $9,479 high to $8,226 low is at $8,850. There is also a significant bearish trend line forming with resistance at $8,900 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. Therefore, the price is likely to face sellers near the $8,500 and $8,900 levels. Once there is a proper close above $8,900 and $9,000, there could be more gains towards $9,500.\nLooking at the chart , the current price action is slightly bearish below $8,900. On the downside, the $8,200 level is a decent support, followed by $8,000. If bitcoin fails to hold $8,000, it could decline below $7,500.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n4-hours MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is about to move into the bullish zone.\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently well below the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $8,200\nMajor Resistance Level – $8,900 Bitcoin Price Weekly Analysis – Can BTC/USD Hold $8,000? was last modified: May 13th, 2018 by Aayush Jindal ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitc", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "newsbtc bitcoin price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T15:35:57.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ecf3ad3ac820429694bbf8526b8342f4ef9c2ea2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTzW1XIcyCxIKJ78R_I43R_HKqCR94velkRbXWvMfblOI8mJ8yKDRw", "site_full": "news.ycombinator.com", "site": "ycombinator.com", "site_section": "https://news.ycombinator.com/rss", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Hacker News", "title": "German online bank uses Bitcoins to transfer loans", "title_full": "German online bank uses Bitcoins to transfer loans | Hacker News", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 18, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.258, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2232, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ecf3ad3ac820429694bbf8526b8342f4ef9c2ea2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTzW1XIcyCxIKJ78R_I43R_HKqCR94velkRbXWvMfblOI8mJ8yKDRw", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "germanier", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "German online bank uses Bitcoins to transfer loans", "text": "The title and article body claim that they hold a bank license but as far as I can see[0] they only have a license as a financial service provider ( FDI ) for investment brokering ( Anlagevermittlung ) and proprietary trading ( Eigengeschäft ).

This is roughly $200 higher than where it stood yesterday afternoon. Could the price be recovering following Mt. Gox’s latest sell-off?\nEarly this week, bitcoin was marred by two major actions . The first stemmed from South Korea, one of the largest bitcoin trading hubs in the world. Financial authorities raided popular cryptocurrency exchange Upbit after executives were alleged to have been illicitly moving customer funds to their own personal accounts. At press time, no additional information has been released on this story, and The Merkle will continue to provide coverage as it is received.\nThe second maneuver came by way of Mt. Gox, the now infamous Japanese crypto exchange responsible for losing nearly half-a-billion in bitcoin funds in 2014. Trustees of the platform have been selling off the company’s final bitcoin stashes since September of last year, and despite acknowledging that these moves could have negative consequences on the bitcoin price, these sell-offs have continued without restraint.\nLast Friday, word was received that a trustee had moved as many as 8,000 bitcoins to four separate wallets. At the time, bitcoin was already in a downward slump, having fallen to about $9,100 from its previous high of $9,800, though the move may have spawned its subsequent drop to $8,250, which is where bitcoin was trading during yesterday’s early morning hours.\nNow, roughly $400 later, it’s hard to say if the coin is truly recovering, or if this is just a minor correction in what could be a further downward spiral. One analyst suggests that while bitcoin’s price is down, its dominance rate is still near 40 percent in the cryptocurrency market – the first time since early April – and the asset is still attracting investor interest. More money will undoubtedly allow the price to bounce back up, though it’s difficult to say when this will occur.\nThus far, bitcoin has lost over 10 percent of its value in just a matter of days, and daily charts are still signifying bearish trends, though these are alleged to be in the short term. At the time of writing, the trading range for the currency lies between $8,000 and $9,000 – a solid $1,000 fall from where it stood earlier this week.\nAnother analyst is more positive in his sentiment. He suggests that bitcoin is ultimately bouncing back from its recent lows, and pushing through present resistance faster than other coins. He suggests that if the currency can keep this momentum going and sustain its position in the market, it could lead to what he calls a “meaningful rally.” In other words, bitcoin will continue to spike, and return to the price it so proudly bore at the beginning of the week.\nPrevious resistance – which was set at $8,450 – has already been surpassed. Granted bitcoin can move beyond the $8,700 mark, we may see prices return quicker than anticipated.\nIn addition, bitcoin is garnering further institutional praise and attention following Goldman Sachs’ plans to release its new bitcoin trading desk. The cryptocurrency market is witnessing a burst in legitimacy, and experiencing stronger and curiosity from both Wall Street players and corporate investors.

Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter Inc. and Square Inc was also one amongst the long list of speakers at the event. During the event, he spoke to a crowd of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, to show he was completely in sync with their view that digital currencies are the way of the future.\nDorsey, said on Wednesday at Consensus, a blockchain and cryptocurrency conference:\n“The internet deserves a native currency; it will have a native currency. I hope it will be Bitcoin”\nMany in the audience at Square were skeptical about the technology and making access to digital currencies much easier. Dorsey also mentioned that there are debates and even fights over the topic, and some of the company’s board members are resistant to cryptocurrencies.\nDorsey has spoken with great enthusiasm about digital currencies many times before and propagated the new technology. He also tweeted in 2016 that he would ‘love to see a digital currency thrive’. In his role at Square, he has promoted cryptocurrency many times. In 2014, the payments company started letting merchants accept Bitcoin. Since then, Bitcoin trading was available for almost all users of its Cash App, which lets users send money to friends and family.\nAs Dorsey was about the move not everyone at Square was as enthusiastic.\nHe said:\n“I’ll be frank, this was a pretty contentious move in the company.” Square Reported:\n“In first-quarter revenue from selling Bitcoin at the beginning of this month the company made $34.1 million , but it cost the company $33.9 million to buy the tokens, meaning we only made about $200,000.”\nDorsey said at the Consensus conference, the biggest of about two dozen events during New York’s Blockchain Week:\n“This technology is a fundamental shift in our world and can have so many positive outcomes. We have to do the work to educate regulators and educate the SEC why this technology is important.” Follow us on Telegram | Twitter | Facebook Related Topics: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "twitt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T17:12:07.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cef9d0fd272963da222b3de0305e4f8ef3925dd6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrvqxpYSj0qRVqy7jhkaZYuCbpeTt6.aZZh6zBeDn.WQcByrNdk62fTsMztdE.M9PaGrbRk1hyuWlWoGB9iX9U.us0TxgKoLCsHQivh1UB9PQ--", "site_full": "stocksmasters.com", "site": "stocksmasters.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Only 8.5% of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Traders Are Female - Stocks Masters", "title_full": "Only 8.5% of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Traders Are Female - Stocks Masters", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "http://stocksmasters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Female-Trader-1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cef9d0fd272963da222b3de0305e4f8ef3925dd6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrvqxpYSj0qRVqy7jhkaZYuCbpeTt6.aZZh6zBeDn.WQcByrNdk62fTsMztdE.M9PaGrbRk1hyuWlWoGB9iX9U.us0TxgKoLCsHQivh1UB9PQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Only 8.5% of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Traders Are Female - Stocks Masters", "text": "Only 8.5% of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Traders Are Female Only 8.5% of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Traders Are Female On May 13, 2018 Share\nA new demographic analysis of people trading in cryptocurrencies has brought up some intriguing results such as that only very few are female, most have little to no previous experience, and many are students or working in sales and marketing roles.\nAlso Read: Israel Tax Authority Hunts for Bitcoin Traders on Social Media Understanding Trading Demographics\nMarket analysts for the social investing network and multi-asset brokerage, Etoro, have conducted a research of their vast user base to help the company better understand exactly who are bitcoin and cryptocurrency investors. Looking at data from March 2017 to February 2018, they surveyed the public profiles of those investing in cryptocurrencies using their systems, and extracted demographic insights from age to gender to job sector.\nOne interesting point emerging from the data is that an absolute majority of traders are new in the business with regards to having any investing experience. A whopping 81.96% are at the Novice level, 10.66% are defined as Intermediate level, and just 7.38% qualify as having an Advanced level of experience in the market.\nLooking at the breakdown by occupation, it’s not surprising to see people working in the computer and IT services strongly represented at 15.05%, as well as the finance industry at 8.48%. Less expected is the high share of people working at sales and marketing involved in cryptocurrency trading at 14.49%. Additionally, about 30% of cryptocurrency traders are currently out of the job market, with 13.85% being students, 2.06% retired, and 14.74% just having no job. Crypto Gender Imbalance\nOne demographic issue that keeps coming up with relation to cryptocurrency developers is the lack of female representation, and the same statistics seem to be true for traders. In fact, the data shows that less than a tenth of crypto traders are women, with just 8.5% market share compared with men’s 91.5%. While there could be other factors at play, bitcoin is located at the intersection of technology and finance, both fields that suffer from a severe gender imbalance, so the results are not all that surprising in that context.\nInterestingly, the research also revealed that there are differences between the cryptocurrencies men and women prefer to trade, other than BTC which has 0% gender difference. It appears that Ripple’s XRP skews strongly into the female side, while ETC, BCH and LTC are firmly in male territory. In a note to investors, Senior Market Analyst at Etoro Mati Greenspan, summarized it all with a clear “Women Love ripple.”\nEarlier this year, Etoro was among seven leading cryptocurrency companies operating in the UK that formed an independent trade body tasked with developing self-regulatory standards for the cryptocurrency industry and engaging policymakers. The other founding members of Crypto UK are Coinbase, Cex.io, Blockex, Commerceblock, Coinshares, and Cryptocompare.\nHow cloud the bitcoin community attract more female users?

Xapo claims to have developed a new standard in bitcoin security that protects assets with “even a mountain to keep your money safe.” And they are not kidding.\nThe report says Xapo has a “network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.” The “three layers” of security are not just technical but very much bomb proof physical.\nApparently the profound security has paid off as Xapo, “has more “deposits” than 98 percent” of the more than 5000 banks in the US.\nRyan Radloff of CoinShares states;\n“Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.”\nXapo also caters to institutions by providing financial firms a management platform to handle BTC investments. Xapo views institutions a promising vehicle for growth.\nXapo believes Bitcoin is the one digital currency to rule them all. The company is betting that widespread adoption by consumers globally will eventually bring stability, and significant appreciation to the worlds most popular crypto.\nXapo expects Bitcoin to continue to dominate going forward.\n“the easier it is for someone to pay for a meal at a restaurant or send money to a friend in bitcoin, the more demand for bitcoin will increase. We are beginning to see signs of such adoption, but may still have a ways to go in reaching a point where bitcoin can sustain a relatively high, stable price over the long-term.”\nSponsored Links by DQ Promote You may also like...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jd alois bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan radloff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lawrence summers", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "index ventures", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fort knox of bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fortress investment group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "treasury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greylock partners", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin underground", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T01:07:08.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "65d9d492e1845a79b7ad64cefeb0303bddb0ba13", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWYeQ7j8epcUqYumFNcNqp5xK.JgUlw79UPR85JRev6d7QyLmaa1GstB", "site_full": "helpscoin.cryptograbber.com", "site": "cryptograbber.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Report: Wealthy Hoarding $10 Billion in Bitcoin Underground – Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and Fintech Headlines", "title_full": "Report: Wealthy Hoarding $10 Billion in Bitcoin Underground – Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and Fintech Headlines", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.523, "main_image": "https://i0.wp.com/helpscoin.cryptograbber.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/report-wealthy-hoarding-10-billion-in-bitcoin-underground.jpg?fit=600%2C600", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "65d9d492e1845a79b7ad64cefeb0303bddb0ba13", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWYeQ7j8epcUqYumFNcNqp5xK.JgUlw79UPR85JRev6d7QyLmaa1GstB", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Report: Wealthy Hoarding $10 Billion in Bitcoin Underground – Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and Fintech Headlines", "text": "by HELPSCOINADMIN · May 13, 2018\nBloomberg is out with a report that some wealthy investors are “hoarding” Bitcoin in bunkers deep underground the amount is said to be hovering … You may also like...

While bitcoin’s potential may not be fully realized by first world speculators, citizens of countries with weak economic systems have much to fear when their authorities decide to ban the peer-to-peer payment protocol. Zimbabweans Face Unfortunate Ban\nThe citizens of Zimbabwe were in for a grave shock on May 11, 2018, as the country’s central bank placed a blanket ban on the possession, trading, and transfer of bitcoin . While the move would hardly make an impact on the cryptocurrency trading markets regarding price action, a much deeper wound is inflicted on unfortunate Zimbabweans, whose highly-inflated currency can make buying bread a trillion (Zimbabwean) dollar affair. Source: CNN\nAccording to a report by NewsDay , the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe ( RBZ ) has also placed a mandatory shutdown in services meted by financial institutions to bitcoin businesses, stating that the institutions “must exit” any such relations in the next 60 days.\nNorman Mataruka, RBZ’s Chief Registrar, said in a circular:\n“As monetary authorities, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is the custodian of public trust and has an obligation to safeguard the integrity of payment systems.”\nThe circular further stated that the move was taken in “public interest,” in order to protect and safeguard the integrity of the country’s sound financial system.\nTo eradicate any allegations, Mataruka said that the 60-day period would be used by banks to clear any collateral arrangements, remittances, registrations, trading, and loans sought against digital currencies.\nMataruka further stated that cryptocurrencies operate on the same platform as traditional banking models, having “strong linkages and interconnectedness” to serve their trading and payment platforms, relying on the financial systems that serve the economy.\nA separate statement was issued by central bank governor John Mangudya, stating: Advertisement advertisement\n“The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has not authorized or licensed any person or entity or exchange for the issuance, sale, purchase, exchange or investment in any virtual currencies/coins/tokens in Zimbabwe. Exchanges such as Bitfinance (Private) Limited (Golix) and Styx24 are not licensed or regulated by the Reserve Bank.”\nThe RBZ’s move also follows a recent warning against cryptocurrencies from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), which issued a circular last month on the risks associated with crypto trading, such as fraud, hacking, and loss of data. The Bitcoin Ban Irony: A BTCManager Take\nAgainst the backdrop of a global financial crisis in 2009, far away from the bustling streets of Harare, an anonymous creator/s mysteriously introduced the world to a digital, cryptographic form of money; Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer payments network that operated without the need of a central authority.\nAdding to the protocol’s decentralized ethos was its deflationary nature, that aimed to precede over the inflationary characteristics of fiat money.\nAfter countries like Zimbabwe, South Sudan, and Venezuela quickly adopted the use of bitcoin, whose payment method proved to be highly beneficial and surprisingly less volatile than the native fiat, corrupt regulators and authorities viewed the digital money with suspicion, presumably due to realizing that bitcoin may restore monetary power to the average person.\nZimbabwe’s bitcoin ban comes across as humorous for anyone remotely following global news, as the country’s citizens are victim to an extreme instance of hyperinflation since the year 2000.\nReportedly, walking around with billion dollar wads of cash in the local currency means little to locals, as the purchase of basic supplies can run into several trillions of Zimbabwean dollars. Hence, RBZ’s claim of a “sound and secure” financial system is completely unsubstantiated.\nIn great economic irony, bitcoin’s popularity in the country shot up as citizens found new avenues to store their money and savings, as the volatile fiat currency in bank accounts was no longer a significant store-of-value.\nAs a result of this, bitcoin traded at a massive premium in Zimbabwe, compared to the rest of the world, as the demand of the digital asset surged to unimaginable heights. The Zimbabwean premium even superseded the famous “ kimchi premium ” by a longshot, with the price of bitcoin reaching $30,000 on the country’s crypto exchanges while the world rejoiced on the $20,000 mark.\nThe digital currency proved to remain out of the clutches of the local government until the ban of May 2018 and provided the citizens a respite from the economic and political turmoil. While the cryptocurrency market is still viewed with cynicism from global authorities and banks, the digital money sector for Zimbabweans is a far safer bet than most of their other options.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shaurya malwa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reserve bank of zimbabwe bans the country", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reserve bank of zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newsday", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rbz", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T02:01:58.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "39190daa7a00d1f742d609313a43eb8e98ba4368", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjEW0T8moIzQKq1Z6Q1LGOtEa8wT3xcrfA_rXcoE9.DHtrEiWMBqUaMOmqaGlCRR0wIu9IqfXGvvhCkZGevbrAIq6xnAaHRiOZJfc4m3zeJ6b", "site_full": "www.startup365.fr", "site": "startup365.fr", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["job_fairs", "jobs", "hobbies_and_interests", "investors_and_patents"], "section_title": "", "title": "#Blockchain 5 Years Ago You Should Have Bought Bitcoin, Not Altcoins - Startup 365", "title_full": "#Blockchain 5 Years Ago You Should Have Bought Bitcoin, Not Altcoins - Startup 365", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_1041920776-768x768.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "39190daa7a00d1f742d609313a43eb8e98ba4368", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjEW0T8moIzQKq1Z6Q1LGOtEa8wT3xcrfA_rXcoE9.DHtrEiWMBqUaMOmqaGlCRR0wIu9IqfXGvvhCkZGevbrAIq6xnAaHRiOZJfc4m3zeJ6b", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "#Blockchain 5 Years Ago You Should Have Bought Bitcoin, Not Altcoins - Startup 365", "text": "#Blockchain 5 Years Ago You Should Have Bought Bitcoin, Not Altcoins Posted on by Startup365\nWith seemingly endless new altcoins claiming that they will change the world whilst generating exorbitant returns for investors, it can be highly informative to sometimes get a bird’s eye view of longer-term altcoin performance by digging through the annals of Coinmarketcap’s historic snapshots. When looking at a historic snapshot from May 12th, 2013, by far the best cryptocurrency purchase one could have made was bitcoin.\nAlso Read: Markets Update: Cryptocurrencies Lose Steam During the Weekend BTC Top Performing Market Since May 12th, 2013\nAccording to the snapshot , bitcoin had a market capitalization of just 1.293 billion on the 12th of May, 2012. Back then, the circulating supply was just over half of it maximum total, with approximately 11.14 million coins in circulation.\nThe price was just $116.07 USD, however, had just gained by approximately 40% in ten days – with the bounce comprising a recovering rally following the fallout from the early-2013 bubble that saw many Cypriots charge into the bitcoin markets seeking refuge from the harsh structural adjustment policies imposed by the European Union and International Monetary Fund.\nOf all fourteen cryptocurrency markets listed on Coinmarketcap on May 12, 2013, bitcoin has since far outperformed its rivals, gaining by approximately 7175% in the last five years. LTC Only Altcoin Still Ranked in Top Ten by Market Capitalization\nOf the markets listed on the 2013 snapshot, Litecoin is by far the altcoin with the largest market capitalization today (approximately $7.94 billion as of this writing). At the time of the snapshot, the then second largest cryptocurrency had a total market capitalization of just $59.1 million, and a circulating supply of roughly 17.5 million.\nAt the current prices of roughly $140.55, LTC has made gains of 4,083% during five years. Whilst Litecoin’s market dominance has since eroded, LTC is still the sixth largest cryptocurrency by market cap – making it the best performing altcoin from May 12, 2013. Only 50% of Crypto Markets Are More Valuable Today Than They Were 5 Years Ago\nThe third highest performing crypto market since the snapshot is the then twelfth largest by market cap, Ixcoin . At the time of the snapshot, Ixcoin was priced at approximately $0.015. With IXC current trading for $0.193096, Ixcoin’s value has inflated by 1177% in the last 5 years. IXC’s capitalization has grown from $191,294 to approximately $4 million, ranking it 677th by market cap.\nAt the time of the snapshot, Peercoin was the third largest market by capitalization (approximately $4.72 million), with PPC trading for roughly $0.25. Currently priced at $2.56, PPC has since gained 924%. Peercoin has been among the most enduring of May 2013’s crypto markets, currently comprising the 198th largest market with a capitalization of $63.3 million.\nThe then fourth largest cryptocurrency, Namecoin , has offered investors a modest return of approximately 130% since the snapshot, gaining in price from $0.853 to $1.96. NMC’s is now the 309th largest market, having grown from a capitalization of $4.70 million to $28.8 million today.\nFeathercoin , the then ninth largest cryptocurrency market, has gained from $0.1256 to $0.169727 – a meager 35.1% increase in five years. Feathercoin is now the 278th largest market, with FTC’s capitalization growing from to $821,341 to $34 million.\nThe then seventh largest market, Novacoin , has gained by only 15.5% in five years, increasing in value from $3.54 to $4.09. NVC is now the 550th largest market with a capitalization, growing from almost $1 million to roughly $8.5 million. 46% of Altcoins Have Lost More Than 80% of Their Value\nNearly half of the altcoins included in the snapshot – many of which promised that they would change the world whilst making investors rich – have since lost more than 80% of their value.\nThe then fifth largest cryptocurrency market, Terracoin , has dropped nearly 81% from $0.4 to 0.164. It is ranked 694th by market cap, after gaining from approximately $1 million to $3.74 million.\nAt the time of the snapshot, Freicoin was the eighth largest crypto market with a capitalization of $882,374. Since then, FRC’s capitalization has actually shrunk to a meager $203,719 (approximately 24 BTC) – ranking it 1,152nd by market cap. The price has also decreased by 84.5%, falling from $0.0424 to $0.00658.\nThe market cap of the then eleventh ranked market, Mincoin , has also shrunk – dropping from $230,012 to $169,379 (approximately 20 BTC). Now ranked 1,170th, MNC has also shed nearly 83% of its value, with prices falling from $0.220779 to $0.037906. 23% of Altcoins Trading on the 12th of May, 2013 Now Appear Dead\nNearly a quarter of the altcoins included in the snapshot now appear dormant.\nData for the then sixth largest crypto market, Devcoin , stops on November 24th, 2017 – with the last recorded price of $0.000023 comprising an approximately 90% drop from $0.000223.\nThe most recent price for then tenth ranked market, CHNCoin , was recorded on boxing day last year – CHNCoin having then dropped by nearly 99% in five years, falling from $0.1 to just $0.001222.\nAnd lastly, but certainly not least, data for then thirteenth ranked market, BBQCoin , also ended on the 24th of November – with BBQ’s final price of $0.000458 comprising a 95% loss in value from $0.0091.\nWhat was your opinion of cryptocurrency in 2013?

(Photo Illustration by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images) The Breakdown You Need to Know The legitimacy bar for digital currencies has been raised now that Goldman Sachs is going to facilitate the institutional trading of Bitcoin.\nThey’re proceeding cautiously and will not trade actual Bitcoin initially. Instead, the bank will use its own money to trade Bitcoin futures contracts for clients.\nIt will also trade non-deliverable forward futures where trades will be settled in the regulated currency it’s quoted in. Bitcoin had been on a rebound the past couple of months.\nInterest in the currency increased over the course of 2017, which also caused volatility to skyrocket. The price of the digital currency tripled in the second half of last year, topping out at $20,000 before dropping to $8,000 in February of 2018.\nThe cryptocurrency traded as high as $9,300 before South Korean officials raided South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, sending prices to $8,650. While Goldman Sachs dips its toes in the cryptocurrency markets, CultureBanx found BitMEX is way ahead of the game.

When looking at a historic snapshot from May 12th, 2013, by far the best cryptocurrency purchase one could have made was bitcoin.\nAlso Read: Markets Update: Cryptocurrencies Lose Steam During the Weekend BTC Top Performing Market Since May 12th, 2013\nAccording to the snapshot , bitcoin had a market capitalization of just 1.293 billion on the 12th of May, 2012. Back then, the circulating supply was just over half of it maximum total, with approximately 11.14 million coins in circulation.\nThe price was just $116.07 USD, however, had just gained by approximately 40% in ten days – with the bounce comprising a recovering rally following the fallout from the early-2013 bubble that saw many Cypriots charge into the bitcoin markets seeking refuge from the harsh structural adjustment policies imposed by the European Union and International Monetary Fund.\nOf all fourteen cryptocurrency markets listed on Coinmarketcap on May 12, 2013, bitcoin has since far outperformed its rivals, gaining by approximately 7175% in the last five years. LTC Only Altcoin Still Ranked in Top Ten by Market Capitalization\nOf the markets listed on the 2013 snapshot, Litecoin is by far the altcoin with the largest market capitalization today (approximately $7.94 billion as of this writing). At the time of the snapshot, the then second largest cryptocurrency had a total market capitalization of just $59.1 million, and a circulating supply of roughly 17.5 million.\nAt the current prices of roughly $140.55, LTC has made gains of 4,083% during five years. Whilst Litecoin’s market dominance has since eroded, LTC is still the sixth largest cryptocurrency by market cap – making it the best performing altcoin from May 12, 2013. Only 50% of Crypto Markets Are More Valuable Today Than They Were 5 Years Ago\nThe third highest performing crypto market since the snapshot is the then twelfth largest by market cap, Ixcoin . At the time of the snapshot, Ixcoin was priced at approximately $0.015. With IXC current trading for $0.193096, Ixcoin’s value has inflated by 1177% in the last 5 years. IXC’s capitalization has grown from $191,294 to approximately $4 million, ranking it 677th by market cap.\nAt the time of the snapshot, Peercoin was the third largest market by capitalization (approximately $4.72 million), with PPC trading for roughly $0.25. Currently priced at $2.56, PPC has since gained 924%. Peercoin has been among the most enduring of May 2013’s crypto markets, currently comprising the 198th largest market with a capitalization of $63.3 million.\nThe then fourth largest cryptocurrency, Namecoin , has offered investors a modest return of approximately 130% since the snapshot, gaining in price from $0.853 to $1.96. NMC’s is now the 309th largest market, having grown from a capitalization of $4.70 million to $28.8 million today.\nFeathercoin , the then ninth largest cryptocurrency market, has gained from $0.1256 to $0.169727 – a meager 35.1% increase in five years. Feathercoin is now the 278th largest market, with FTC’s capitalization growing from to $821,341 to $34 million.\nThe then seventh largest market, Novacoin , has gained by only 15.5% in five years, increasing in value from $3.54 to $4.09. NVC is now the 550th largest market with a capitalization, growing from almost $1 million to roughly $8.5 million. 46% of Altcoins Have Lost More Than 80% of Their Value\nNearly half of the altcoins included in the snapshot – many of which promised that they would change the world whilst making investors rich – have since lost more than 80% of their value.\nThe then fifth largest cryptocurrency market, Terracoin , has dropped nearly 81% from $0.4 to 0.164. It is ranked 694th by market cap, after gaining from approximately $1 million to $3.74 million.\nAt the time of the snapshot, Freicoin was the eighth largest crypto market with a capitalization of $882,374. Since then, FRC’s capitalization has actually shrunk to a meager $203,719 (approximately 24 BTC) – ranking it 1,152nd by market cap. The price has also decreased by 84.5%, falling from $0.0424 to $0.00658.\nThe market cap of the then eleventh ranked market, Mincoin , has also shrunk – dropping from $230,012 to $169,379 (approximately 20 BTC). Now ranked 1,170th, MNC has also shed nearly 83% of its value, with prices falling from $0.220779 to $0.037906. 23% of Altcoins Trading on the 12th of May, 2013 Now Appear Dead\nNearly a quarter of the altcoins included in the snapshot now appear dormant.\nData for the then sixth largest crypto market, Devcoin , stops on November 24th, 2017 – with the last recorded price of $0.000023 comprising an approximately 90% drop from $0.000223.\nThe most recent price for then tenth ranked market, CHNCoin , was recorded on boxing day last year – CHNCoin having then dropped by nearly 99% in five years, falling from $0.1 to just $0.001222.\nAnd lastly, but certainly not least, data for then thirteenth ranked market, BBQCoin , also ended on the 24th of November – with BBQ’s final price of $0.000458 comprising a 95% loss in value from $0.0091.\nWhat was your opinion of cryptocurrency in 2013?

CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release.\nBitcoin Press Release: Decentralised token swap site Swap.Online release details of their upcoming protocol.\n11th May 2018, Tallinn, Estonia – Decentralization is the basis for blockchain technologies. Decentralization ensures the security, transparency and integrity of all transactions in the network. But are the popular cryptocurrency exchanges really decentralized, and safe? Most DEX’s are not able to accept BTC without using an unreliable gateway between the two blockchains.\nExploring the Token Swap Ecosystem\nThere are several different types of DEX (Decentralised Exchange) such as pseudo-decentralized, working in the Ethereum network only, for example projects that link blockchains to each other using their own tokens, and decentralized exchanges that use “Hashed Timelock Contracts”.\nEarlier, it was common knowledge that a crypto exchange that did not store user keys, and was decentralized and therefore safe. However, most of these exchanges are built on a single blockchain, which makes them vulnerable – in order to get funds from the Bitcoin network to such a crypto exchange for example, one needs to use a gateway, which takes bitcoin and produces a “holding” kind of bitcoins in another network in return. A similar principle lies with Ethereum-based exchanges, for example, EtherDelta.\nSecurity: Paramount\nDevotees of centralization believe that storing private keys on a secure server is safer than storing encrypted keys in the user’s browser. However, if a central server is hacked, everything will be stolen (as it was with a million bitcoins), and paranoids can remove signing of transactions from the browser into the application on the computer and encrypt it.\nSince all code is executed in the user’s browser, the greatest risk is the intrusion of extraneous scripts into the code. It is likely to be made by the extensions the user installed in the browser, or by a hosting provider.\nTo prevent such attacks, Swap.Online will use cloudflare.com together with Workers, a solution that, in response to any request to the domain, sends a “Content Security Policy” header with the hash of the JS code allowed for execution in the user’s browser. Thus, server hacking and most attacks based on the introduction of malicious code will be eliminated. To understand how this works, see the video of the system operation below, or try to make an exchange yourself at https://alpha.swap.online .\nThe Swap Online Platform\nBy using Bitcoin.js, web3.js, and the libp2p library in IPFS, Swap.Online created a cross-blockchain swap system directly in the browser. The full details of the system can be found below: The solution operates on an average 2 to 10 times faster than the existing stock exchanges (taking into account the time to deposit and withdraw funds). On average, the exchange takes 2 to 3 minutes. Swap Online does not store secret user keys. Moreover, even messages between users do not pass through our servers (we use IPFS ). The exchange works right in the browser – users do not need to download or install anything. The platform already works between the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, with Tether, and Lightning Network planned. Theoretically, Swap Online is able to work with most cryptocurrencies, except for those where there is no scripting language. Even for currencies like Monero, solutions will be created over time.\nThe source code of the exchange is published in GitHub , and the protocol is distributed as Open Source. The AirDrop is scheduled for June 30th.\nThe Swap.Online team is also engaged in commercial implementation and release of related products: For the B2C market (swap.online) : Exchange solution for BTC -> ERC20 (with an orderbook and a reputation system) For the B2B market (b2b.swap.online) : Widget in the form of html code, which allows accepting any cryptocurrencies directly in the wallet of the site owner by sending tokens in return.

Historically, cryptocurrencies have seen enormous gains during Consensus , a blockchain technology conference in New York taking place this week. This article will look into the current price of Bitcoin , Ethereum , Litecoin , Ripple and Bitcoin Cash using technical analysis tools.\nDisclaimer: This article is not meant to constitute trading/investment advice. Please use extreme caution when trading any cryptocurrency.\nFor the purposes of this article, we will be using a handful of terminology that non-technical traders may not be familiar with. These terms are at the end of this article under “Glossary.” If you would like to read those terms now, click here . Bitcoin\nStarting off, we have Bitcoin , which saw a drop from $9,900 to $8,300 in under six days. This volatility is not anything we haven’t seen before, but was a surprise to many after the upward trend looked to be continuing. Plenty of wicks at the local bottom indicating indecision.\nOn the 1-day, Bitcoin is currently sitting inside the cloud, below the Tenkan and Kijun Sen. These lines are sloping towards each other, indicating high momentum and a possible TK cross. While the TK Cross hasn’t formed yet, crosses inside the cloud are a bearish signal. The Tenkan-Sen is the faster-moving average and is currently on top, so if price starts moving back up the cross can be avoided.\nAs far as RSI goes, we see the same bearish divergence that we saw last week before this drop. Possible TK cross is forming inside of a bearish cloud. Ethereum\nEthereum saw a violent drop too, going from its local high of $820 to a low of $640. On a 4-hour time frame, we have local resistance starting in the red area. Price has been rejected three times and could again. To capitalize on basic support and resistance bounces, use lower time frames such as 1-hour charts. Ethereum is headed back up to the resistance.\nEthereum is still above the cloud, which shows that its upward trend might not be over. The lagging span could be making an appearance soon with a cloud break. The other conditions for a valid cloud break are all met.\nEthereum’s price is currently touching the Tenkan-Sen and bounced off the Kijun-Sen a few days back. Keep an eye out for how it reacts to the Tenkan-Sen for a possible trade opportunity. Ethereum is getting ready for a cloud break. Litecoin\nLooking at the 1D LTC/USD chart, we see that Litecoin also saw a pretty serious drop from $180 down to $130. It found support before the local support level that we highlighted last week and has bounced to its current price of $145. Succesful bounce off the first local support level.\nAdding Ichimoku Clouds to the chart, we start to see the bigger picture. It turns out, Litecoin’s bounce off $130 was the exact bottom of the cloud. Litecoin is still inside the cloud and is headed towards the Tenkan-Sen and Kijun-Sen, which seem to be twisting bearish.\nNo major RSI indicators are there besides the bearish RSI divergence highlighted last week. The cloud is here to save the day! Bitcoin Cash\nAfter being last weeks largest gainer, Bitcoin Cash saw one of the lowest drops of the group this week. It failed to break out of the resistance level highlighted last and seems to have found local support in the light green area. Bitcoin Cash looks to be consolidating sideways. No huge indicators yet.\nBitcoin Cash bounced off the Tenkan-Sen and is floating between the Tenkan-Sen and Kijun-Sen. BCH recently experienced a cloud break and saw upside. The signals for an upward trend are still there, so given enough time, it will become more clear how to trade Bitcoin Cash.\nAgain, no Major RSI indicators are there besides the previous bearish RSI divergence. Kijun-Sen bounce created a trade opportunity. Ripple\nRipple dropped from $0.90 and reached local support at $0.67. It currently is sitting at $0.74. Ripple is currently in a class action lawsuit revolving around Ripple potentially being an unregistered security. This case could have a serious impact on the price of Ripple, so we will be keeping an eye out for this over the next months. Ripple found support at $0.67.\nUsing Ichimoku Clouds , we see a flat Kumo and a bearish TK Cross. Flat Kumo’s are pretty strict resistance levels and usually act as price magnets. This is because if the top of the cloud is flat, then there is little to no trend over a time period. The TK cross that formed is not too significant as it occurred above the cloud in bullish territory. Ripple’s latest drop caused the lagging span to go under the cloud. Conclusions\nAfter seeing such a large drop in a short period of time, there is a growing concern about the state of cryptocurrency markets. In the past, Consensus has done a lot for cryptocurrency leading to increases after the event. #bitcoin and altcoins have rallied hard every Consensus event. Will this year continue the trend? $crypto $btc pic.twitter.com/KZm3AVKFCC\n— Collin Crypto (@CollinCrypto) May 12, 2018\nThe overall market cap is still higher than the previous month, which supports the conservative upward trend line we have seen over the past year. The next few months should give a good idea of what the rest of the year will bring for cryptocurrency markets. The cryptocurrency market cap over the past year.\nTechnical analysis is a very useful tool for making educated guesses but is never a guarantee. Consider using a mix of both technical and fundamental analysis to increase your odds of success when trading.\nFollow Austin on Twitter to see more cryptocurrency related content. Glossary\nHere are the definitions for each of the technical analysis terms used in this article. Senkou Span A – an indicator that is used to measure momentum, as well as future areas of support and resistance. Senkou Span A is always drawn in relation to Senkou Span B – together, they form the cloud. Senkou Span B – forms the cloud along with Senkou Span A. Traditionally when Senkou Span B is located below Senkou Span A, it is a symbol of bullish price movement. Senkou Span cross – The cloud is an area of uncertainty. Most traders do not make a move until price closes above or below the cloud – although, when the Senkou Spans cross one another, many traders use the indicator to predict the reversal of a current price trend. Kumo Twist – The Ichimoku Cloud is a Japanese trading strategy, and ‘Kumo’ means cloud in Japanese. The Kumo Twist is just a nickname for a Senkou Span cross. Tenkan-Sen – The Tenkan-Sen is used in conjunction with the Kijun-Sen to predict long and short positions. The formula for the Tenkan-Sen’s calculation takes the highest high and the lowest low and divides it by two over the last seven to eight time periods. Kijun-Sen – Similarly to the Tenkan-Sen, the Kijun-Sen is calculated using the same formula, but it usually includes the last 22 time periods. The Tenkan-Sen highlights short-term price movement, while the Kijun-Sen gives a better idea of long-term price movement. TK crossover – When the Tenkan-Sen crosses above the Kijun-Sen, it is an indication of bullish price movement. Conversely, the Tenkan-Sen crossing below the Kijun-Sen is a bearish sign. Both of these signals are known as a TK crossover. The location of the TK crossover impacts the strength of the signal. For example, a bullish TK crossover below the cloud is in bearish territory, and therefore a weak signal. On the other hand, a bullish TK crossover above the cloud is a strong signal. Chikou Span – Otherwise known as the Lagging Span, Chikou Span shows where the price was 26 periods before the most recent closing price. An upwards Lagging Span above price shows bullish momentum, while a Lagging Span below price shows bearish momentum.

So, you know, I had to get a little piece of that action,” Williams adds.\nThat little piece, says the former football player, amounts to an investment of no more than $50,000 of his own money in the volatile cryptocurrency.\n“I didn’t want to go crazy,” he says.\nWilliams also isn’t overly concerned about the ups and downs the cryptocurrency markets have experienced in recent months. Bitcoin , in particular, has lost more than 50 percent of its value since reaching an all-time high near $20,000 in mid-December.\n“Especially with the planet Uranus and change, [it’s] always going to be volatile in the beginning,” he says. “But, still, it’s more of a conscious choice to contribute to the change. If I do well, then great. If not, I’ll still feel like I did my part to contribute to things moving forward.”\nWilliams bills himself as a professional astrologer, and he even has a website where you can book a personal astrology reading with the former NFL star (at $300 for a 90-minute session). Williams also turned his passion for holistic medicine into a post-NFL career with the launch of Real Wellness, a line of cannabis-based products, in March.\nMeanwhile, Williams’ astrology-backed faith in Bitcoin puts him at odds with the opinions of some notable investors — including billionaires like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates , who have publicly bashed the cryptocurrency.\nBuffett, for instance, has called Bitcoin “rat poison” while arguing that it is an asset that is “creating nothing” of value.\n“All you’re counting on is the next person is going to pay you more because they’re even more excited about another next person coming along,” Buffett told CNBC on Monday.\nInvestor and star of ABC’s “Shark Tank” Kevin O’Leary and CNBC’s Jim Cramer have even likened investing in Bitcoin to gambling.\nBut Williams also isn’t the only person who turns to astrology for financial forecasts. Kaye Shinker was a financial astrologer who wrote books on the subject of using astrology as an investment guide.

Korea’s Financial Services Commission has joined an ongoing investigation into country’s crypto exchanges, called for “international discussion” of regulations. South Korea’s top financial regulator the Financial Services Commission (FSC) joined the ongoing probe into local cryptocurrency exchanges Sunday, May 13.\nThe FSC will now be taking part in the anti money laundering investigation , hitherto led by the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), in order to help expand its scope, news outlet Korea Times reports.\nCommenting on the agency’s move, Vice Chairman of the FSC Kim Yong-beom has urged regulators worldwide to coordinate their regulatory policies on cryptocurrencies .\nFollowing a request from the FSS, the FSC will now check bank accounts belonging to Korean crypto exchanges on compliance with anti-money laundering ( AML ) standards and other fraud prevention measures. According to Korea Times’ report, the main subject of the expanded audit would be Bithumb , the country’s largest crypto exchange which revealed plans to launch its own crypto token back in April.\nAccording to Korea Times, Kim Yong-beom has said that despite the investigation into crypto exchanges, the FSC does not oppose the use of blockchain in banking and financial services and is currently evaluating the usefulness of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment.\nFSC’s chairman has further noted the need to communicate a coordinated global approach to regulatory policies on crypto, arguing that “international discussion” is “necessary.” “We are seeing a steady development of blockchain technology thanks to its greater accessibility and efficiency. Because this technology has the potential to shake up today’s regulations on securities, regulators have to respond to such a looming challenge.” On May 6, the newly appointed FSS governor Yoon Suk-heun took a favourable stance towards crypto, noting its “positive aspects” and claiming that the agency is responsible for providing “remedies to help crypto trading and blockchain technology get better.”\nEarlier this week, Cointelegraph reported that South Korean police have started an investigation into Upbit, one of the top crypto exchanges in the country, for alleged fraud. The event has triggered a downward trend on the crypto markets.

This new crypto exchange roundup features four platforms located in South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Contents 4 The Philippines’ Coinvil South Korea’s Coinbit\nSouth Korean game developer Axia Soft Co. Ltd. has recently launched a crypto exchange called Coinbit. For its grand opening, the exchange is offering zero commission trades until the end of May.\nCoinbit says 50 cryptocurrencies will be listed initially and more than 100 coins will be listed by the end of the year. Among supported cryptocurrencies are bitcoin, ether, ripple, bitcoin cash, ethereum classic, litecoin, waves, stox, eos, vechain, omisego, qtum, and neo. Thailand’s Jibex\nCryptocurrency exchange Jibex has recently opened its doors in Thailand. The exchange is backed by IT company J.I.B. Computer Group Co. Ltd, a distributor and seller of computer hardware and IT trading products with 150 stores nationwide.\nInitially, only five cryptocurrencies will be supported: bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, litecoin, and ripple. More will be added in the future, according to Jibex CEO Thuntee Sukchotrat. The exchange also offers a wallet supporting those five cryptocurrencies.\nFor the grand opening, Jibex is waiving its commission of 0.24%. No trading fee will be charged for 45 days ending on June 26.\nJibex Chairman Dr. Thantharaksuk Chotirat commented:\nThe partnership with J.I.B. Computer Group (JIB) will give users peace of mind and confidence in their investment. The service is good, fast and attentive to all customer needs. Vietnam’s Kenninex\nKenninex crypto exchange has recently launched in Vietnam, headquartered in Ho Chi Minh City.\nThe exchange claims to be “the first live cryptocurrency exchange in Vietnam…[and] the first e-money trading platform in Vietnam to have a trading office where investors can experience our services as well as receive effective investment advice,” according to its website.\nCustomers can currently convert bitcoin and ether into VND and vice versa. The transaction fee is usually 0.4% but has been reduced to 0.2% for the first month of launch, according to local media. The Philippines’ Coinvil\nWhile Coinbit, Jibex, and Kenninex have already launched, this next exchange has not. South Korean blockchain technology and services company Glosfer and Coinvil have agreed to collaborate to build and launch a cryptocurrency exchange in the Philippines. Glosfer will build the platform while Coinvil will operate the exchange. Coinvil CEO Park Rae-hyun commented:\nThe Philippines will become the largest cryptocurrency trading market that connects Europe and Asia.\nDo you think the number of new cryptocurrency exchanges will keep growing?

Per Sputnik’s source:\n“It all began after Vinnik’s extradition to the United States was blocked. There people who are extremely interested in him not coming to Russia. The assassination was ordered by some unknown person from Russia.”\nThe murder plot, the source added, isn’t connected to any special services, as it is “linked to the criminal world.” It added that it all began when Vinnik’s extradition to the United States was blocked, as there are individuals who are “extremely interested in him not coming to Russia.” Per his words, the assassination plot was ordered by someone in Russia.\nNotably, Vinnik reportedly wrote an acknowledgement of guilt in Russia, and is set to testify in the country to assist investigators. This, after he admitted to knowing about crimes “committed in the sphere of financial technologies.”\nThe Russian national’s lawyers, in response to the situation, stated:\n“Such statement should be investigated via a proper procedure, rather than through public statements and discussions.”\nAs covered by CCN, Vinnik was arrested at the request of the US government. At the time, it was believed he was BTC-e’s chief executive, but the exchange soon denied he was even an employee there, while Vinnik claimed innocence.\nFor a time, Vinnik’s future was thrown into turmoil, as he and his lawyers argued he should stand trial in Russia, while a Greek court agreed to a US extradition request. His fate was in the hands of Greece’s Minister of Justice, Nikos Paraskevopoulos.\nAt the time of Vinnik’s arrest, BTC-e’s domain was seized and taken down. The embattled exchange managed to come back online, and rebranded to WEX. WEX has, as covered, seen its share of controversy as some of its users’ funds were stuck in limbo, while the company blamed a third party.

Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system. Get started and learn How to sign up for your Bitcoin account payment system.\nBitcoin is one of the world’s most popular crypto-currencies, with a very high value and importance in the stock exchange market. It is basically an electronic form of currency that could neither be seen or touched but its value keeps appreciating. We are going to discuss just how you can create your Bitcoin account payment system right in this post. How to Create Bitcoin Account Payment System\nTo open a Bitcoin account, you must register with a Bitcoin wallet provider and follow the steps below: The first step is to have an email. Log on to info and Click on “wallet” and then click on “create your wallet”. You will be presented with a form, fill it accordingly and submit. You will be sent a verification mail via the email address that you filled on the form. Log into your email account and verify your blockchain account. Then log in with your wallet ID and password. After opening a blockchain account and logging into it, click on the request, you will see your blockchain receive address under “copy and share address”. If you use a Smartphone, install the blockchain app from playstore. Send your blockchain receive address to a bitcoin merchant after negotiating the price and rate with the merchant. The bitcoin merchant will simply send the agreed amount of bitcoin to your bitcoin wallet via your blockchain receive address Now you already have a bitcoin wallet and bitcoin in your account. You are free to do whatever you chose to do with your bitcoin but most times you might need to send bitcoin to someone or some business of your choice. Sending a bitcoin is quite easy, just hit the “send” icon, you will see a form where you will fill the recipients receive address and the quantity of bitcoin you wish to send and then you hit the ‘send’ button. It’s just like sending an email or a text message. How to Secure Your Bitcoin Account\nSecure your Bitcoin via the steps below: Write down, and safely store your “backup phrase” that was given when you installed the wallet software. It is advisable not to display your backup phrase. Because it may be used to gain access to your wallet and steal your Bitcoins. And equally, do not screenshot or copy and paste your backup phrase onto your PC or another device. Don’t allow “remote access” to your PC (if running a full node, for example) to receive technical support. They may ask you to run the software and type in commands that may expose your private key and steal your Bitcoins. It is advisable not to store all your Bitcoins on a mobile device or with an online service if you have a significant amount of funds. Consider “cold storage” like a paper wallet which may be stored in a safe deposit box or a safe inside your home or once. Watch out for scams. They seem to be directed at those who are not entirely familiar with Bitcoin, or those who are fooled by getting rich quick scams, or who believe claims that seem too good to be true. So never you send Bitcoins to unknown sites that claim to reward you with large amounts of Bitcoins at some point in the future or ask you to install a browser plugin or other software. These are almost certainly scams, and it is surprising that even those who understand Bitcoin very well and are active in the Bitcoin economy have been fooled out of a lot of Bitcoins.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nweke chiemerie", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T13:14:20.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1b8ed69574b169f1b672ddc59562b2aa7ab5d75a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS2K4Mwd.ySIk9vJJu9Ty4Xo-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b8ed69574b169f1b672ddc59562b2aa7ab5d75a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS2K4Mwd.ySIk9vJJu9Ty4Xo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\n Become a part of a huge mining pool!

But while that acquisition is still awaiting regulatory approval, that isn’t stopping BitGo from bolstering its offerings.\nBitGo head of product Tracy Olson indicated that the launch – which finds BitGo stratifying its service into three offering tiers – is about framing the company as a full spectrum provider of security solutions, one that can now scale from consumer to institutional needs.\nOlson told CoinDesk:\n“We’re definitely seeing a lot of bigger names interested in digital currencies. But there are other customers like smaller hedge funds, they just don’t want to have to hold custody themselves. They’re looking to have the security and compliance and storage solutions that they can outsource to, and that’s what BitGo is really delivering.”\nThe three services tiers include “qualified custody,” in which BitGo offers secure storage and custody through Kingdom Trust; “institutional custody,” a solution that enables clients to manage wallets connected and disconnected from the Internet; and self-managed custody.\nAs such, Olson positioned the full offering as one that can appeal to the risk-tolerance of all types of clients, from those who want to set up and manage wallets themselves, to those that want others to manage the sensitive cryptographic keys required to access funds.\n“These are really targeted at different market segments. The market is really demanding these three different solutions,” Olson continued.\nAs for customer details, Olsen indicated that BitGo would not reveal the total value of the assets it helps custody, though she said 15 percent of bitcoin transactions now occur through the company’s wallet offerings. Multi-asset upgrade\nStill, that’s not to say there isn’t work to be done on BitGo’s offering.\nOlsen indicated that BitGo now provides its custody solutions to over 20 cryptocurrencies, but that the company is “absolutely” looking to increase that number in 2018.\n“We see a lot of demand of customers for a wide variety of coins. We evaluate each of them for viability in the market and then we prioritize them accordingly,” he said.\nWhile BitGo primarily started as a bitcoin-only firm, it steadily increased the number of coins it supported over 2017 in line with a jump in the number of crypto hedge funds, as well as wallet and exchange providers that began moving to support multiple protocols.\nNotably, however, Olsen hinted that interest at larger institutional firms mirrors this trend, with many indicating an interest in the wide variety of crypto assets on the market today.\n“They see it as a compelling asset class and want to diversify their portfolios with ethereum, ripple and other digital currencies,” she said. Wall Street ambitions\nOverall, the announcement also serves to potentially recast BitGo as a rare cryptocurrency startup ready to appeal to those seeking to do business on Wall Street.\nPropelled by announcements such as Goldman Sachs’ coming launch of a dedicated crypto trading desk, others are entering the market. Still, investment in security and custody has arguably lagged over the years, as evidenced by the fact that there are only a handful of such providers today.\nAmong them are Ledger and Coinbase , two companies that have also sought to raise big funding rounds to serve custody products to an institutional clientele.\nHowever, as Olsen indicated, the nascent state of the market today means that all entrants are competing against the sometimes negative perception of the technology.\nOlsen concluded:\n“There’s a reputation out there for digital currencies that they may be associated to the underworld, but I believe they are coming around and are seeing the value in investing in this asset class.”\nBank deposit boxes via Shutterstock\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

That’s the view of Siacoin lead developer David Vorick, who’s published his thoughts on the monopoly enjoyed by manufacturers such as Bitmain and Halong Mining. In “The State of Cryptocurrency Mining”, Vorick also accuses manufacturers of using the machines themselves, before passing them on to the public once they’re no longer profitable.\nAlso read: Cryptocurrency Projects Aiming to be ‘ASIC Resistant’ Have Little Success The Absolute State of Cryptocurrency Mining\nSiacoin’s David Vorick knows more than most when it comes to cryptocurrency mining. In addition to overseeing the development of decentralized file storage coin SIA, which uses a Proof of Work algorithm, Vorlick operates his own ASIC manufacturing firm. Obelisk was founded around 18 months ago, and with their first ASICs scheduled to ship in eight weeks, Vorick has decided to lay bare his thoughts on the industry. “ The State of Cryptocurrency Mining ” is a revelatory blog post that pulls no punches.\nIn it, Siacoin’s lead developer repeats claims he has heard that “Bitmain plays dirty”. Vorick was allegedly told that Bitmain would use its power to stop other ASIC companies from manufacturing in China. Despite going to great pains to conceal Obelisk’s involvement in such a deal, the Chinese manufacturer backed out suddenly in a move that reportedly cost Obelisk $2 million. There is no proof that the manufacturer was leaned on by Bitmain, but David Vorick leaves no doubt as to where his suspicions lie. The new Obelisk SC1/DCR1 ASIC miner. ASICS Are Money Printing Machines\nThe most explosive part of Vorick’s blog concerns allegations of ASIC manufacturers secretly mining with new units before selling these to the public once they’re no longer profitable. These claims aren’t new, and can be traced as far back as Butterfly Labs and its ill-fated ASIC miner. David Vorick is the most senior and well-connected figure within the mining industry to go public with these allegations, however, writing:\nIn the case of Halong’s Decred miner, we saw them “sell out” of an unknown batch size of $10,000 miners. After that, it was observed that more than 50% of the mining rewards were collecting into a single address that was known to be associated with Halong, meaning that they did keep the majority of the hashrate and profits to themselves.\nHe continues: “Our investigation into the mining equipment strongly suggests to us that the total manufacturing cost of the equipment is less than $1,000, meaning that anyone who paid $10,000 for it was paying a massive profit premium to the manufacturer, giving them the ability to make 9 more units for themselves.” It has been alleged that prior to Bitmain shipping its Monero Cryptonight miners this year, an unknown entity had been mining with them for months. Vorick concurs:\nMy sources say that they had been mining on these secret ASICs since early 2017, and got almost a full year of secret mining in before discovery. The ROI on those secret ASICs was massive, and gave the group more than enough money to try again with other ASIC resistant coins.\nAt the time of the Cryptonight ASICs becoming public knowledge, a war of words erupted between Bitmain and senior Monero figures. Monero’s Fluffypony wrote that the huge leap in Monero’s hashrate in 2017 had originally been attributed to botnets using hijacked computers to mine XMR. This assertion had been revised in the wake of Bitmain unveiling its Monero-specific X3s. David Vorick adds fuel to the fire, writing: “It’s estimated that Monero’s secret ASICs made up more than 50% of the hashrate for almost a full year before discovery, and during that time, nobody noticed. During that time, a huge fraction of the Monero issuance was centralizing into the hands of a small group, and a 51% attack could have been executed at any time.”\nSecret ASICS Are Rumored to Exist\nSecret ASICs that have the power to attack existing hashing algorithms far more effectively than anything on the market are rumored to exist. David Vorick is convinced of this, and if he is correct, these units are the mining equivalent of a zero-day exploit – highly lucrative and highly protected. He speaks of “mining farms that are willing to pay millions of dollars for exclusive access to designs for specific cryptocurrencies” and “an informal underground industry” that has sprung up around secret mining.\nBecause no entity, be it a mining pool or hardware manufacturer, is going to put their name to such activity, it is very hard to provide concrete proof of these allegations. What is beyond dispute is that ASICs are money printing machines for those who make them at scale. Vorick finishes: “At the end of the day, cryptocurrency miner manufacturers are selling money printing machines. A well-funded profit maximizing entity is only going to sell a money printing machine for more money than they expect they could get it to print themselves. The buyer needs to understand why the manufacturer is selling the units instead of keeping them for themselves.”\nDo you think some ASIC manufacturers engage in dirty tricks and underhand practices?

Businesses dealing in decentralized currencies have 60 days to comply.\nAlso read : I ndia’s Supreme Court Keeps Ban on Banks’ Crypto Services, For Now Zimbabwe Bans Crypto\nIssued 11 May, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, the country’s central bank, laid out seven points in ordering the shutter of things crypto within the southeast African nation. Referencing two previous circulars going back as far as three years ago, the notice explains “’banking institutions’ attention is once again drawn to the risks involved with virtual currencies and the need to ensure strict adherence to sound risk management. Our investigations have revealed that the major cryptocurrency exchanges facilitating the trade of virtual currencies in Zimbabwe are Bitfinance (Private) Limited (Golix) and Styx24. Golix has gone further to set up an ATM machine through which cryptocurrency transactions are facilitated.”\nIndeed, these pages first reported on the Golix crypto ATM last month, highlighting how “‘Since we got the machine, lots of people have come to check it out, to touch it,’ Golix representative Tawanda Kembo told Bitcoin.com. ‘At least 10-20 people walk in every day, since we launched it last Friday.’”\nCrypto was widely thought to be something of a saving grace for the population, as we explained how the nation has a notorious relationship with monetary policy. “There is an acute liquidity crisis In Zimbabwe,” News.Bitcoin.com reported, “and so getting physical US dollars is both cumbersome and expensive (and illegal, the cash has to be bought on the black market).”\nFall of last year, another Golix spokesperson insisted , “there is currently more demand than supply of bitcoins… Interest in bitcoin has peaked as people cannot send money outside or pay for international transactions using formal banks. People have had to look for alternatives and bitcoin has been a useful solution which can be used to purchase goods on Amazon or to pay for vehicles from international suppliers and traders.” A Government Known for Monetary Nonsense Unironically Fears Cryptocurrency\nFamous for their many thousands of percent hyperinflation, Zimbabwe’s central bank unironically feared this week of how financial “regulators around the world have identified the dangers and risks presented by virtual currencies to financial stability which include risk of loss due to price volatility, theft or fraud, money laundering and other criminal activities. Further, cryptocurrencies can be used to facilitate tax evasion as well as externalization of funds in violation of a country’s laws.”\nThe order requires “all financial institutions … ensure that they do not use, trade, hold and/or transact in any way in virtual currencies; ensure that they do not provide banking services to facilitate any person or entity in dealing with or settling virtual currencies; and exit any existing relationships with virtual currency exchanges within sixty days of the date of this Circular and proceed to liquidate and restitute existing account balances.”\nPrior to using a haunting turn of phrase, at the end of the order, to be “advised accordingly,” the country’s monetary authority hammered home the point by attempting to cover all the possible permutations of crypto business. The ban includes “maintaining accounts, registering, trading, clearing, collateral arrangements, remittances, payment and settlement accounts, giving loans against virtual tokens, accepting them as collateral, opening accounts of exchanges dealing with them and transfer / receipt of money in accounts relating to purchase / sale of virtual currencies.”\nWhat do you think the future holds for Zimbabweans with regard to crypto?

He did not invest in Tech companies during the Nasdaq bubble as they were in hyper-growth and priced in PEG terms.

Lots of cash (hundreds of Billion$), a consumer market that is borderline addicted to the product (think KO) and Apple pays out dividends.\nBuffett and Munger may not be tech-savvy, but they know money and banking. Berkshire has about $67B invested in banking stocks. They are also very old and even if they work hard at it, they cannot spend enough of the yearly income they receive from their investments.\nImo, they understand bitcoin very well. Yes, bitcoin is a threat to their investments in banking stocks and it is not something they can control and manipulate along with their powerful friends as it's decentralized, but read previous paragraph and you'll see that I don't think that's the reason they hate it.\nPonzi, tulip, rat-poison squared, turd, harvested baby brains - these are hateful words that people with such riches and status should not be using on an insignificant asset. Why do they even take the time to discuss bitcoin as the short time they have left in this world is so valuable? My answer is: Peer-pressure\nYes, unbeknownst to most people they are humans and have human emotions. They may very well be out of .1 percent of the world population's league, but they have people they consider to be their equal, or even people they consider to be better than them.

Nevertheless, it is one of the most misunderstood and controversial subjects for the majority of the people. In many people minds, The topic is attached to terms as “Black market”, “gambling” and “Speculations”. The truth is, that Block chain technology is the future. For every person that is searching to be updated in what’s happening in the world around him, it is time to understand better the subject and its applications.\nIt is true that in the last year the value of Bitcoin and other Cryptocoins has gone up and down and that many scams have been connected to its activities. This trend have been seen previously with new technologies reaching the market. As the internet of things allow easier and faster access to all in our new global era of investments, it is natural that the flunctation in early stage will be bigger . To start understanding a bit better the subject, here are a few important facts that you need to know: Bitcoin is the first, most known and valuable Cryptocurrency in the market. With a total value of $169,452,298,312 (with a value per coin of $9,958.11 at the 5.5.2018) At the moment the top 5 Currencies are – (from the top down) – Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple and Litecoin Bitcoin is based on a technology called “Block-Chain”. Bitcoin is only the tip of the iceberg of this technology. The Block chain Technology is an innovative system and a disruptive innovation which will enter into all the domains of our life and is going to change the way we operate the majority of our current systems.\nIn many conversation with professionals, Bitcoin and the Technology behind it the moment are compared to the Internet boom of the 90’s. For those of you that are to young to remember, When the internet have been introduced to the mass market in the 90, there was an hysteric moment of investment around it. Firms have emerged everywhere, creating a mania of investment and numerous amount of scam. T he term “Dot-Com bubble” was a historic economic bubble and period of excessive speculation that occurred roughly from 1997 to 2001, a period of extreme growth in the usage and adaptation of the Internet . Nevertheless, following the crash and the end of the speculators the internet (which was in the time the new disruptive technology), has survive and became a tool we cannot live without.\nHere is the Nastaq index of that period:\nTo understand how similar the Block chain technology is to this market, here is the chart of the price of Bitcoin in the last year: (Can you see the similarity)\nIt is important to notice that the value of bitcoin and any other Cryptocurrency is based on the amount of transaction made in the market. To make it simple, more people buy and sell or transfer it one to another the more value it gets. It is very similar to any currency in that manner. The crazy increase in the price of Bitcoin last winter is easy to explain. When the price start to go up and the awareness have picked, many people saw the opportunity to make profit and start buying, Creating a “Mania “. The values started to rise nothing to do with the actual technology behind it. In the moment the value have served its investors, they started to sell their bitcoin out, which immediately made the price go down. At this moment, th e majority of the people that were following the trend (without really understand why) saw the drop of price and start selling their bitcoin as well. In economic term it is called a “Panic”. at the low point of the panic in February the value of a bitcoin has been 7,023$, which was still higher than its value in November 2017 before the mania (5,976$). This is an important point.\nI will publish a series of post in the subject to cover the subject and give you a better understanding of the subject in simple terms. For now it is important to hold in mind a few points: These coins are reflecting the entrance of a new technology called “Block chain” into our lives. This technology will affect governments, banks, insurance companies and working places. Like many other disruptive innovation, the current market is trying to do everything in his power to block its entrance. The price of the Cryptocurrencies will continue to go up in the long run.\nBe Aware: The stage of development of Cryptocurrency and Block chain is far from being mainstream. It means, it is open to manipulation as people do not fully understand it. This post is not in any way giving a professional analytic overview for investment. Before investing in anything, please make sure you fully understand what are you investing in and how to do i t.\nShare with me you opinion in the subject.

When looking at a historic snapshot from May 12th, 2013, by far the best cryptocurrency purchase one could have made was bitcoin.\nAlso Read: Markets Update: Cryptocurrencies Lose Steam During the Weekend BTC Top Performing Market Since May 12th, 2013\nAccording to the snapshot , bitcoin had a market capitalization of just 1.293 billion on the 12th of May, 2012. Back then, the circulating supply was just over half of it maximum total, with approximately 11.14 million coins in circulation.\nThe price was just $116.07 USD, however, had just gained by approximately 40% in ten days – with the bounce comprising a recovering rally following the fallout from the early-2013 bubble that saw many Cypriots charge into the bitcoin markets seeking refuge from the harsh structural adjustment policies imposed by the European Union and International Monetary Fund.\nOf all fourteen cryptocurrency markets listed on Coinmarketcap on May 12, 2013, bitcoin has since far outperformed its rivals, gaining by approximately 7175% in the last five years. LTC Only Altcoin Still Ranked in Top Ten by Market Capitalization\nOf the markets listed on the 2013 snapshot, Litecoin is by far the altcoin with the largest market capitalization today (approximately $7.94 billion as of this writing). At the time of the snapshot, the then second largest cryptocurrency had a total market capitalization of just $59.1 million, and a circulating supply of roughly 17.5 million.\nAt the current prices of roughly $140.55, LTC has made gains of 4,083% during five years. Whilst Litecoin’s market dominance has since eroded, LTC is still the sixth largest cryptocurrency by market cap – making it the best performing altcoin from May 12, 2013. Only 50% of Crypto Markets Are More Valuable Today Than They Were 5 Years Ago\nThe third highest performing crypto market since the snapshot is the then twelfth largest by market cap, Ixcoin . At the time of the snapshot, Ixcoin was priced at approximately $0.015. With IXC current trading for $0.193096, Ixcoin’s value has inflated by 1177% in the last 5 years. IXC’s capitalization has grown from $191,294 to approximately $4 million, ranking it 677th by market cap.\nAt the time of the snapshot, Peercoin was the third largest market by capitalization (approximately $4.72 million), with PPC trading for roughly $0.25. Currently priced at $2.56, PPC has since gained 924%. Peercoin has been among the most enduring of May 2013’s crypto markets, currently comprising the 198th largest market with a capitalization of $63.3 million.\nThe then fourth largest cryptocurrency, Namecoin , has offered investors a modest return of approximately 130% since the snapshot, gaining in price from $0.853 to $1.96. NMC’s is now the 309th largest market, having grown from a capitalization of $4.70 million to $28.8 million today.\nFeathercoin , the then ninth largest cryptocurrency market, has gained from $0.1256 to $0.169727 – a meager 35.1% increase in five years. Feathercoin is now the 278th largest market, with FTC’s capitalization growing from to $821,341 to $34 million.\nThe then seventh largest market, Novacoin , has gained by only 15.5% in five years, increasing in value from $3.54 to $4.09. NVC is now the 550th largest market with a capitalization, growing from almost $1 million to roughly $8.5 million. 46% of Altcoins Have Lost More Than 80% of Their Value\nNearly half of the altcoins included in the snapshot – many of which promised that they would change the world whilst making investors rich – have since lost more than 80% of their value.\nThe then fifth largest cryptocurrency market, Terracoin , has dropped nearly 81% from $0.4 to 0.164. It is ranked 694th by market cap, after gaining from approximately $1 million to $3.74 million.\nAt the time of the snapshot, Freicoin was the eighth largest crypto market with a capitalization of $882,374. Since then, FRC’s capitalization has actually shrunk to a meager $203,719 (approximately 24 BTC) – ranking it 1,152nd by market cap. The price has also decreased by 84.5%, falling from $0.0424 to $0.00658.\nThe market cap of the then eleventh ranked market, Mincoin , has also shrunk – dropping from $230,012 to $169,379 (approximately 20 BTC). Now ranked 1,170th, MNC has also shed nearly 83% of its value, with prices falling from $0.220779 to $0.037906. 23% of Altcoins Trading on the 12th of May, 2013 Now Appear Dead\nNearly a quarter of the altcoins included in the snapshot now appear dormant.\nData for the then sixth largest crypto market, Devcoin , stops on November 24th, 2017 – with the last recorded price of $0.000023 comprising an approximately 90% drop from $0.000223.\nThe most recent price for then tenth ranked market, CHNCoin , was recorded on boxing day last year – CHNCoin having then dropped by nearly 99% in five years, falling from $0.1 to just $0.001222.\nAnd lastly, but certainly not least, data for then thirteenth ranked market, BBQCoin , also ended on the 24th of November – with BBQ’s final price of $0.000458 comprising a 95% loss in value from $0.0091.\nWhat was your opinion of cryptocurrency in 2013?

Although they may not expose clients to cryptocurrency directly, Bitcoin offers benefits other tools do not provide. Bitbond, a rather new German ban, is using Bitcoin to let clients transfer loans anywhere in the world. The world’s leading cryptocurrency borderless nature allows for some innovative business models.\nGerman banks have always been interesting creatures. They often tend to embrace innovative technologies. Some banks do so faster than others. Bitbond is a relatively new player in this industry, but it’s making big waves pretty quickly. Founded by Radoslav Albrecht, the firm is embracing Bitcoin for a big part of its day-to-day operations. A Popular Service by Bitbond\nWhile traditional banks use Swift to transfer value across the world, Bitbond relies on Bitcoin. Lending money on a global scale is often encumbered by solutions such as Swift. Additionally, it is rather expensive to do so when using traditional methods. Bypassing all of these drawbacks is not easy by any means. It even warrants an unorthodox and somewhat controversial approach.\nFor Bitbond, Bitcoin is the only viable solution in this regard. The new bank lets clients hold loans in digital tokens for a short amount of time. Afterward, the loan is turned into the currency of the country they wish to receive funds in. By tapping into Bitcoin, a lot of new opportunities are created in quick succession. Payments work independently of where customers are. It is a feature no traditional bank can offer as of right now.\nAs one would expect, this service has gotten a lot of attention. Clients loan close to $1m a month, most of which is transferred using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. All loans are pretty small in size, but the number of loans is rising gradually. Bitbond officially obtained its banking license back in 2016. It will be interesting to see whether other banks will follow this example in the near future.\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "binance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "radoslav albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T20:51:32.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9832ca6d7f75882846c02608d5b0de500d72f62b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8.W3OWbVkf9TITyl3GTFOVI5lN24VMGG3W7HtUvGqMwfp.hQYLuBgGAllovdBrXaUIzuwh3zWWc1eJh0D2xqCC39dzJaiLgq6Y_E89d7YZQ--", "site_full": "ohiobitcoin.com", "site": "ohiobitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Lightning CEO Elizabeth Stark on Bloomberg, Future of Bitcoin", "title_full": "Lightning CEO Elizabeth Stark on Bloomberg, Future of Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://ohiobitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Oa6GNU.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9832ca6d7f75882846c02608d5b0de500d72f62b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8.W3OWbVkf9TITyl3GTFOVI5lN24VMGG3W7HtUvGqMwfp.hQYLuBgGAllovdBrXaUIzuwh3zWWc1eJh0D2xqCC39dzJaiLgq6Y_E89d7YZQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Lightning CEO Elizabeth Stark on Bloomberg, Future of Bitcoin", "text": "Log in to Reply\nA real world example: If you route a all of Starbuck’s 2016 $20bn in sales through LN to a super liquid node so that they don’t need millions of individual customer channels, and assume they’d close their LN channel as frequently as possible (every 10 mins) in order to keep the amount they need to commit to a payment channel as low as possible, then they’d only need to commit around $200,000 to the LN Channel, which is essentially their equivalent average sales revenue every 10 minutes (although, it’s likely they’d need multiple open LN channels that overlap opening/closing times). Amazon’s 2016 $136bn would equate to around a $1m commitment to a similar LN channel. If the principle of these calculations is correct (albeit very simplified), then LN maybe does have potential. But who knows if retailers would be happy to commit this kind of capital – it would need to show savings over standard payment processing. So while I’m semi-convinced that there may be upside for retailers, I admit I am still a touch skeptical as the other end of the LN channel eventually comes back to me… and I do to not fully understanding why I personally would want to tie up capital in a LN channel to buy coffee when the bitcoin I buy my coffee with today could buy me either 5 coffees or 0 coffees tomorrow… Think I’d stick with the USD for now – same price every single day. Safe. Predictable. Manageable. So to all those that are blinded by the \"think of a car in traffic\" oversimplification (go research why your car is stuck in traffic in the first place), I invite you to do a thought experiment about LN’s real life application.

Looking at data from March 2017 to February 2018, they surveyed the public profiles of those investing in cryptocurrencies using their systems, and extracted demographic insights from age to gender to job sector.\nOne interesting point emerging from the data is that an absolute majority of traders are new in the business with regards to having any investing experience. A whopping 81.96% are at the Novice level, 10.66% are defined as Intermediate level, and just 7.38% qualify as having an Advanced level of experience in the market.\nLooking at the breakdown by occupation, it’s not surprising to see people working in the computer and IT services strongly represented at 15.05%, as well as the finance industry at 8.48%. Less expected is the high share of people working at sales and marketing involved in cryptocurrency trading at 14.49%. Additionally, about 30% of cryptocurrency traders are currently out of the job market, with 13.85% being students, 2.06% retired, and 14.74% just having no job. Crypto Gender Imbalance\nOne demographic issue that keeps coming up with relation to cryptocurrency developers is the lack of female representation, and the same statistics seem to be true for traders. In fact, the data shows that less than a tenth of crypto traders are women, with just 8.5% market share compared with men’s 91.5%. While there could be other factors at play, bitcoin is located at the intersection of technology and finance, both fields that suffer from a severe gender imbalance, so the results are not all that surprising in that context.\nInterestingly, the research also revealed that there are differences between the cryptocurrencies men and women prefer to trade, other than BTC which has 0% gender difference. It appears that Ripple’s XRP skews strongly into the female side, while ETC, BCH and LTC are firmly in male territory. In a note to investors, Senior Market Analyst at Etoro Mati Greenspan, summarized it all with a clear “Women Love ripple.”\nEarlier this year, Etoro was among seven leading cryptocurrency companies operating in the UK that formed an independent trade body tasked with developing self-regulatory standards for the cryptocurrency industry and engaging policymakers. The other founding members of Crypto UK are Coinbase, Cex.io, Blockex, Commerceblock, Coinshares, and Cryptocompare.\nHow could the bitcoin community attract more female users?

There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,500 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may continue to find sellers on the upside near the $1,480 and $1,500 levels in the near term.\nBitcoin cash price declined towards $1,250 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD is correcting higher, but upsides remain capped by the $1,500 level. Bitcoin Cash Price Resistance\nThis past week, bitcoin cash price trimmed most of its gains and declined from the $1,700 level against the US Dollar. The price declined sharply and moved below the $1,500 and $1,300 support levels. It traded close to the $1,250 support and a low was formed at $1,276. At the moment, the price is correcting higher and is trading above the $1,350 level.\nIt also moved above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,677 high to $1,276 low. However, the price is facing a lot of sellers around the $1,475 level. It also represents a crucial pivot zone, acting as a barrier for buyers near $1,500. It was a support earlier and is now preventing gains above $1,500. The 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,677 high to $1,276 low is also around $1,475. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,500 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair.\nLooking at the chart , the price is clearly facing hurdles near $1,475 and $1,500. Moreover, the 100 hourly simple moving average is also near $1,475 to prevent gains. A break above the $1,500 level could open the doors for more gains towards $1,600.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n4-hours MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is slowly moving into the bullish zone.\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is currently just below the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $1,380 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin cash price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capped bitcoin cash price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T10:32:55.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "19679f9bd7c19ef7fab4044e05387cc7dd761191", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tf_GoKIj2f2g.DOvcdxw1Q9637BDzU3sGHegI2SGAQXuHUvykatnmyzLZZnUh.JiDNuCinH277ec8WDp08ft8qar2hsuZTB.LuJm.W9fTSCESlCiq9xN.UOU-", "site_full": "www.ccn.com", "site": "ccn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "", "title": "This German Bank Uses Bitcoin to Make Low-Cost Int'l Loan Payments", "title_full": "This German Bank Uses Bitcoin to Make Low-Cost Int'l Loan Payments", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.01, "main_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/germany-bitcoin-cryptocurrency.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "19679f9bd7c19ef7fab4044e05387cc7dd761191", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tf_GoKIj2f2g.DOvcdxw1Q9637BDzU3sGHegI2SGAQXuHUvykatnmyzLZZnUh.JiDNuCinH277ec8WDp08ft8qar2hsuZTB.LuJm.W9fTSCESlCiq9xN.UOU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "This German Bank Uses Bitcoin to Make Low-Cost Int'l Loan Payments", "text": "German Online Bank Dismisses Swift, Favors Bitcoin for International Money Lending Advertisement Join our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nBitbond, an online bank founded in Germany in 2013 by German Radoslav Albrecht, has found an innovative use case for bitcoin’s borderless nature: international loan payments.\nIt was the first to use bitcoin to transfer credit in currency internationally, not only as loan collateral, and it’s currently processing about $1 million in loan payments per month.\nAs the company explains on its website:\n“By innovating in the fields of payments and credit scoring, Bitbond makes financial inclusion a reality around the world. All payment transactions on Bitbond are conducted via the bitcoin blockchain. Therefore our service is available worldwide via the internet and is independent of banks.”\nWhile many outsiders (and even hodlers) see bitcoin as only a highly speculative asset , Bitbond has found a business model that competes with traditional systems. Using bitcoin came as a smart move for Albrecht as an alternative to the Swift payment system, which is slower and more expensive.\n“Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,” Albrecht told Reuters TV in his office in Berlin’s fashionable neighborhood Prenzlauer Berg. “With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.” Source: Shutterstock\nThe downside, according to Albrecht, is the coin’s volatility.\nAs CCN reported in December, businesses are reluctant to accept bitcoin as payment because of its wildly shifting exchange rates. Bitbond avoids this issue because clients only posses the tokens for their loans for a few seconds or minutes until it’s ready to be exchanged to the national currency that they prefer.\nBitcoin’s core premises of cheap transfer and low fees drive the business’ success.\nSince 2013, Bitbond has grown in popularity. The company has been mentioned in Forbes and Lend Academy. The news has been stayed positive, with VC funding Currently, Bitbond employs 24 people from 12 countries. The lean team takes care of the bank’s 100 clients, which bring in $1 million each month.\nThe clients are mostly made up of small businesses and freelancers who do not exceed loans over $50,000. The company also became officially licensed as a bank in 2016, solidifying its longevity and successful track record\nGermany is a global forerunner in Bitcoin adoption. While other countries remain skeptical and enact anti-crypto regulation, such as India, Germany, along with the United States, is open to crypto-related businesses. Germany is second to the United States, according to Bitnodes, a service that tracks the transfer information broadcast by Bitcoin nodes.\nImages from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "radoslav albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitbond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "favors bitcoin for international money lending advertisement joi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank uses bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitbond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T20:03:11.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e94f072bf3f56e22e84d5bb3017cf5f7d43bbc3b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AHBCJPlITjfI7oa0io6ihljzPiyPtgp7CcelSrnHNJjh69N8XKqjp6SAZBkCQo4DNVTRg.Jt1BnVg-", "site_full": "markets.financialcontent.com", "site": "financialcontent.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "Benzinga's Bulls & Bears Of The Week: Apple, Bitcoin, Macy's, Verizon And More", "title_full": "Benzinga's Bulls & Bears Of The Week: Apple, Bitcoin, Macy's, Verizon And More", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.01, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 86243, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e94f072bf3f56e22e84d5bb3017cf5f7d43bbc3b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvQboY7on5a1l9L3GcBODsgg0QtL0JzN42dstbhyvXj.vUh0ZQBk_AHBCJPlITjfI7oa0io6ihljzPiyPtgp7CcelSrnHNJjh69N8XKqjp6SAZBkCQo4DNVTRg.Jt1BnVg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Benzinga Via", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Benzinga's Bulls & Bears Of The Week: Apple, Bitcoin, Macy's, Verizon And More", "text": "May 13, 2018 at 10:03 AM EDT Benzinga's Bulls & Bears Of The Week: Apple, Bitcoin, Macy's, Verizon And More Benzinga has featured looks at many investor favorite stocks over the past week.

The bitcoin conference that began with 400 attendees three years ago is now the centerpiece of a full-blown \"Blockchain Week NYC,\" an event run in partnership with the New York Economic Development Corporation.\nConsensus conference attendance growth over the years\nSource: CoinDesk\nLast year's conferences helped drive the surge of attention on cryptocurrencies.\nAround Consensus 2017 last May, Bitcoin accelerated its gains above $2,000, and was bolstered by the first TokenSummit and Ethereal Summit.\nPrices then skyrocketed over the rest of the year, drawing Wall Street's interest and topping $10,000 for the first time after the \"Consensus Invest\" conference in November. Since then, however, Bitcoin has lost more than half its value since topping $19,000 in December, but it remains more than 4 times above where it was last May.\nThis year's speaker lineup also reflects significant inroads made by the cryptocurrency industry into the mainstream. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey , whose mobile payments company Square launched bitcoin trading this year, is set to speak at Consensus on Wednesday. Other conference panelists range from government officials to start-up leaders.\nConsensus \"does have a reputation of, if you speak at that event you're on the map,\" said Michael Oved, co-founder of a token marketplace called AirSwap, and organizer of a blockchain conference called Fluidity, which took place Thursday.\nHe said he purposely under-priced his conference – tickets ran from $150 to $250 – because he saw it as \"an opportunity for us to talk about the things we've been working on.\" About 700 people attended the Brooklyn event, Oved said. That would bring ticket sales to about $140,000.\n\"Clearly there's a lot of money to be made in the enterprise IT world, and blockchain seems to be the flavor of month.\" -Bill Barhydt, CEO of Abra Other events charge at least several hundred dollars for admission, including:\nThe two-day Ethereal Summit run by ConsenSys sells tickets for $1,300 each; TokenSummit on May 17 is sold out of regular $649 tickets, and a \"very late ticket\" costs $979; The \"Women on the Block\" conference held on Mother's Day charges $299 for general admission, and $599 for VIP access to a reception and a lounge. Childcare for children ages 5 to 11 costs $80; General admission to the May 18 NYC Blockchain Tech & Invest Summit is $899, while investors and VIP tickets are $1,299, according to Eventbrite. The ADI Cryptocurrency Mining Summit charges $499 to $699. \"Clearly there's a lot of money to be made in the enterprise IT world, and blockchain seems to be the flavor of month,\" said Bill Barhydt, CEO of Abra, which runs a mobile-based cryptocurrency storage app.\n\"This represents an opportunity for companies that are trying to jump on that bandwagon to take advantage of that confluence of factors at the same time,\" he said. \"Obviously there's a lot of money moving around in terms of sponsorships. We're getting requests every day to sponsor.\"\nGetty Images Founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin However, not everyone in the cryptocurrency world is happy about the massive conference industry.\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin tweeted on April 26 that he is boycotting Consensus this year partly because of the high ticket price.\n\"The conference costs $2-$3k to attend. I refuse to personally contribute to that level of rent seeking,\" Buterin said. He added that CoinDesk \"is recklessly complicit in enabling giveaway scams,\" and called their coverage of an ethereum split \"highly sensationalist.\"\nTweet\nIn a statement, CoinDesk responded that it was \"disappointed to learn of Vitalik's tweet today regarding a CoinDesk reporting error, for which we apologize. One of our reporters included an unverified link in an article; we quickly identified the error and fixed it. We strive to maintain the highest level of unbiased, ethical journalism in order to provide the best possible coverage of the blockchain industry.\"\nAmber Baldet, former head of blockchain at J.P. Morgan , also criticized the increasingly costly cryptocurrency events.\n\"The irony of high-priced conferences is they're the ones least likely to be paying speakers within the community, who care the most & need the platform to share new work,\" she tweeted on April 28. \"Corporate expense accounts subsidize people who rarely say anything novel, 'celeb keynotes' extract high fees.\"\nShe is a speaker at two of the primary events of the week, Ethereal Summit and Consensus. \"I'm not getting paid for either,\" she said in another tweet, adding that their livestreams \"are a great way to democratize access.\"\n'So many conferences...it's crazy' With all the hype and partying that conferences bring, it's also unclear whether they ultimately help start-ups progress along a planned production schedule — especially when many can struggle under inexperienced management.\n\"There are so many conferences now,\" Oved said. \"It's crazy. In the Bay Area alone, there's a conference every week on blockchain. It's easy to get distracted by conferences.\"\nHowever, some are betting that the conferences will be the catalyst for bitcoin prices eventual recovery.\n\"The rally post-Consensus has been strong and more supportive of our view that bitcoin has already bottomed for the year,\" Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Research said in a May 7 note. \"Bitcoin has rallied 10 to 70 percent during each of these conferences.\"\nLee added: \"We think alt-coins could similarly rally given the sizable increase in attendance.\"\nClarification: The Fluidity conference took place on Thursday, May 10.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael nagle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill barhydt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vitalik buterin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city with", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T14:27:11.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d7004229d18fe4cb2de645a31121d89bc1616f47", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS84xh91n1pNjSfVpoE_RhxQ-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "The Rise of Bitcoin and Cyber-Terrorists", "title_full": "The Rise of Bitcoin and Cyber-Terrorists", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.109, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d7004229d18fe4cb2de645a31121d89bc1616f47", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS84xh91n1pNjSfVpoE_RhxQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "darknetmarketstoday", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Rise of Bitcoin and Cyber-Terrorists", "text": "The Rise of Bitcoin and Cyber-Terrorists\nhttp://darknetmarkets.today/2018/05/10/the-rise-of-bitcoin-and-cyber-terrorists/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T08:45:43.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ea797498dac46f72b720aa3ba79acff6e3aa56c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQQUfcOKWcsr0V0Ky63VKcg8_xtNeMiMrtpUbCd_ugCjNN03fKzrQURNzfLnTV_KTY1Bry1zTBMgjXQA9I1GO4UudG4__7lZMBTitK26Tdj_g6c3HzqzU12XbmPWjt1GM6RbYq4dLhhYziFu2Qzid40D3iS3vKAhoamva8HcJMq7Q--", "site_full": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/rssfeeds/2146842.cms", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Stocks-Markets-The Economic Times", "title": "bitcoin: Bitcoin faces 'death cross' after falling below $9,000", "title_full": "bitcoin: Bitcoin faces 'death cross' after falling below $9,000 - The Economic Times", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-64145282,width-672,resizemode-4,imgsize-217235/bitcoin-afp-2.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 208, "comments": 0, "shares": 208}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1ea797498dac46f72b720aa3ba79acff6e3aa56c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQQUfcOKWcsr0V0Ky63VKcg8_xtNeMiMrtpUbCd_ugCjNN03fKzrQURNzfLnTV_KTY1Bry1zTBMgjXQA9I1GO4UudG4__7lZMBTitK26Tdj_g6c3HzqzU12XbmPWjt1GM6RbYq4dLhhYziFu2Qzid40D3iS3vKAhoamva8HcJMq7Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "published": "2018-05-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin: Bitcoin faces 'death cross' after falling below $9,000", "text": "By Luke Kawa\nBitcoin’s plunge back below $9,000 has the cryptocurrency facing a dreaded death cross .

This has cut Ethereum’s market capitalisation to US$68.5 billion.\nThe Ripple (XRP) price has crashed 15% lower over the last 24 hours to 68 U.S. cents, leaving it with a market capitalisation of US$26.6 billion.\nThe Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price has plunged almost 17% over the period to US$1,381.36 per token, reducing its market capitalisation to US$23.6 billion.\nThe EOS (EOS) price is also down almost 17% during the last 24 hours to US$15.08. EOS now has a market capitalisation of US$12.8 billion.\nOutside the top five the declines have been just as severe.\nLitecoin (LTC) is down 10%, Cardano (ADA) is off 18%, Stellar (XLM) has fallen 17%, IOTA (MIOTA) has tumbled 17.5%, and TRON (TRX) has dropped almost 17%.\nWhat happened?\nOne potential catalyst for this decline appears to be speculation that South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, UPbit, has been targeted by regulator on charges of fraud.\nProsecutors are believed to be alleging that UPbit has been transferring funds from customer accounts to a separate account belonging to an executive of the company. UPbit has not yet responded to the speculation.\nConsidering how big the South Korean market is, it comes as little surprise to see the market selloff in a panic today.

Vitalik Buterin, the Founder of Ethereum has been caught up in controversies recently as witnessed by the social media.\nThe net market capital of the cryptocurrency is $386 billion which has fallen from $450 billion a few weeks back. The crypto-market is close to reaching the half-trillion marker. The leading coins, Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] have experienced a sudden jolt three days back and ever since the prices are falling.\nThe price of ETH was trading at a soaring price of $835 on the 6th of May. In the last 7-day period the price has fallen by 18%. At the time of writing, the ETH trading price is staked at $664. In the last 24 hour mark, the overall remark is negative as prices have dropped more than it has increased. The current market capitalization is $66 billion as depicted on Coinmarketcap.\nManoj, a crypto-analyst responded the bear-fall of Ethereum and other currencies:\n“I say when Bitcoin falls no matter what the currency is all will fall. Ethereum is ranked number two but the net worth is not even close to that of Bitcoin. The Ethereum market will hopefully be on a bull-run by tomorrow evening. The RSI is depicting a major decline in the market as it is indicating a downward movement. The amount of tokens sold is more than the buy rate. There is no way that the bear trend is going to disappear soon, because the market has not experienced something this huge in the recent times.”\nA Redditor says:\n“Not sure that there is any value in Ethereum without the existence of Bitcoin. But there is nothing in Bitcoin tech that Ethereum Can’t handle. Not a fan because that’s a convoluted strategy. They have the ame technology yet dependent.”\nA Twitterati says:\n“The market is a major pump and dump right now.

Looking at data from March 2017 to February 2018, they surveyed the public profiles of those investing in cryptocurrencies using their systems, and extracted demographic insights from age to gender to job sector.\nOne interesting point emerging from the data is that an absolute majority of traders are new in the business with regards to having any investing experience. A whopping 81.96% are at the Novice level, 10.66% are defined as Intermediate level, and just 7.38% qualify as having an Advanced level of experience in the market.\nLooking at the breakdown by occupation, it’s not surprising to see people working in the computer and IT services strongly represented at 15.05%, as well as the finance industry at 8.48%. Less expected is the high share of people working at sales and marketing involved in cryptocurrency trading at 14.49%. Additionally, about 30% of cryptocurrency traders are currently out of the job market, with 13.85% being students, 2.06% retired, and 14.74% just having no job. Crypto Gender Imbalance\nOne demographic issue that keeps coming up with relation to cryptocurrency developers is the lack of female representation, and the same statistics seem to be true for traders. In fact, the data shows that less than a tenth of crypto traders are women, with just 8.5% market share compared with men’s 91.5%. While there could be other factors at play, bitcoin is located at the intersection of technology and finance, both fields that suffer from a severe gender imbalance, so the results are not all that surprising in that context.\nInterestingly, the research also revealed that there are differences between the cryptocurrencies men and women prefer to trade, other than BTC which has 0% gender difference. It appears that Ripple’s XRP skews strongly into the female side, while ETC, BCH and LTC are firmly in male territory. In a note to investors, Senior Market Analyst at Etoro Mati Greenspan, summarized it all with a clear “Women Love ripple.”\nEarlier this year, Etoro was among seven leading cryptocurrency companies operating in the UK that formed an independent trade body tasked with developing self-regulatory standards for the cryptocurrency industry and engaging policymakers. The other founding members of Crypto UK are Coinbase, Cex.io, Blockex, Commerceblock, Coinshares, and Cryptocompare.\nHow cloud the bitcoin community attract more female users?
