According to a recent interview by CNBC, he believes Bitcoin [BTC] is still an investment and a good buy.\nThe Bitcoin market has fallen immensely in the past weeks. However, Spencer Bogart had given an outline of a bullish act when looked at in long terms.\nHe said:\n“The long-term thesis is very much intact… The institutionalization of Bitcoin is absolutely occuring…Every major bank is trying to do something in the space. Either they’re going to be offering Bitcoin to their clients, they’re working on a custody platform or they’re opening up a trading desk.”\nHe even went to the extremes of saying that BTC is the only coin investors and traders should buy, as it peaks into the mainstream.\nThe Venture Capitalist partnered at Blockchain Capital said:\n“Every major bank is trying to do something in the space.”\nHe further added:\n“Either they’re going to be offering bitcoin to their clients, they’re working on a custody platform or they’re opening up a trading desk. A deeper institutionalization of bitcoin is overall positive.”\nCurrently, there are negative performances in the cryptocurrency market and it’s continuing on that path. It surged around $19,500 last December and has fallen to more than 50% since the January 2018. Bitcoin is trading at $7471 with an increase of 2.58% in the past 24-hours and has seen a downfall of 9% in the past week, at the time of writing.\nHe is known as the first analyst of Wall Street to cover and analyze Blockchain and Bitcoin Technology. Bogart had recommended the investors to sell the coins – Tron, NEO, and IOTA.\nHe added:\n“A lot of those tokens are overvalued. They could go up significantly, but they also have a significant headwind.”\nHe also suggests investing in alternative coins such as Ripple [XRP], Ethereum [ETH], EOS, and Bitcoin Cash [BTCH], those which he had called neutral. He advised the investors to HODL those coins at the present, stressing on the cons of relative valuation.\nHe further mentioned that he is careful with the coin, Ethereum. He said that it has overhangs due to plenty of ICOs.\nBogart forecasted that BTC will end at least above $10,000 by December 2018, mentioning that the large-cap coin will face turbulence in the market.\nquasim ali, a cryptozoologist on Twitter commented:\n“Bcash is on a losing streak as well. How about we FODL that and HODL btc.”\nRobert Almeida commented:\n“I’m HOFO-DLING.”\nShawn replied:\n“HODL is a term created by whales. If I had simply hoddled Id be where everyone else is. No thanks. I’m not a sheep and that’s why I move my BTC in and out of Fiat. I’ve pulled 10s of thousands in cash out while still buying back in and ending up with more BTC. #", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spencer bogart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spencer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "goldman bogart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockchain capital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T08:54:46.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "52a6a9cb5095b5e380a42a0ac38ad0b2935c5194", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9SjFKWdfb2eOTHnXBFuthwPev3LG8m6uoWntPvaD.cHVQ.VbhzT2.QxA4cJuCtUwIhfoIlrBYk5okoZm7hPiX6c.ilPgauxhJGtdUPGcIS8yUbyzLKsFbnT08ITsLlwYdNSsPpuvOVtw--", "site_full": "www.cointalk.tv", "site": "cointalk.tv", "site_section": "http://www.cointalk.tv/feed/atom", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Coin Talk", "title": "If Satoshi Nakamoto Didn’t Register Bitcoin (BTC) as a Trademark … – GlobalCoinReport", "title_full": "If Satoshi Nakamoto Didn’t Register Bitcoin (BTC) as a Trademark … – GlobalCoinReport", "published": "2018-05-30T05:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "52a6a9cb5095b5e380a42a0ac38ad0b2935c5194", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9SjFKWdfb2eOTHnXBFuthwPev3LG8m6uoWntPvaD.cHVQ.VbhzT2.QxA4cJuCtUwIhfoIlrBYk5okoZm7hPiX6c.ilPgauxhJGtdUPGcIS8yUbyzLKsFbnT08ITsLlwYdNSsPpuvOVtw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-30T05:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "If Satoshi Nakamoto Didn’t Register Bitcoin (BTC) as a Trademark … – GlobalCoinReport", "text": " Trademark … …", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://ebuys.tv/buy-search/?wbsearch=bitcoin", "http://e-coins.tv/", "http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&fd=R&ct2=us&usg=AFQjCNETbSqmuFGNhc1fjADZGKSQPe4bmA&clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331&cid=52779915100512&ei=pAgOW7DONJm9hgH6xJH4Cg&url=https://globalcoinreport.com/if-satoshi-nakamoto-didnt-register-bitcoin-btc-as-a-trademark-who-did/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T09:09:10.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d45b2a494aead784b45d7aadacd322c43622be88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhOl7sHPuliq2eUvdbtBNOX4-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-30T05:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d45b2a494aead784b45d7aadacd322c43622be88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhOl7sHPuliq2eUvdbtBNOX4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-30T05:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 30, 2018 NEWS Crypto Markets Make Slight Rebound After Bitcoin Touched Monthly Lows Cointelegraph Last week, blockchain venture capitalist Spencer Bogart predicted that Bitcoin will be trading \"at least\" above $10,000 by the end of 2018.

It has already seen patients who are totally consumed with trading in the currencies - including some who were not already suffering other forms of addiction. Dr - Mark - Griffiths - Professor - Behavioural Dr Mark Griffiths, Professor of Behavioural Addiction at Nottingham Trent University, said the addictions were “a subtype of online day-trading addiction. I see these as akin to a gambling addiction”.Castle Craig gambling therapist Chris Burn told news.com.au cryptocurrency trading was a fast growing activity. Form - People - Kinds - Things - Cryptocurrency “It is a form of gambling [and] people gamble on all kinds of things which makes cryptocurrency trading exciting. Compulsive gamblers like it - it’s mysterious, not really regulated and you can make huge gains - and huge losses - in a single day.”And that’s where the havoc begins. People - Thing - Money - Consequences - Reality “People dive in because they don’t want to miss out on a good thing and they start putting money in without thinking about the consequences. But the reality is [cryptocurrency] trading is a fascinating idea, but it can do a great deal of harm.”In that regard, it wasn’t surprising people were taken in by the bitcoin craze. Escape - Reality - People - Excitement - Hours “I think it’s an escape from reality. People like the excitement and that you can do it 24 hours a day and [sit there] and watch the screen and watch making a profit - or not - and that goes on and on. That’s what a compulsive gambler wants.”There were parallels with pokie machines, and Mr Burn predicted there would be a rise in the number of bitcoin addicts in the months and years ahead.

Now cryptocurrency miners are gobbling up the cheapest electricity they can find, which is concerning to municipalities worried about electricity rates rising for everybody due to the activity of a few nerds.\nThe city of Plattsburgh in New York State recently opted to temporarily ban new Bitcoin mines while it conducts research on energy usage, and in Washington State power authorities are following electricity spikes only to find apartments full of humming servers mining digital money. The latter report led to some jokers on social media gabbing about how, if growing marijuana were completely legal, police might raid a house expecting to find an unregistered Bitcoin mine and instead find a bunch of totally fine pot.\nIndeed, electricity consumption records are an investigative tool for police trying to bust grow ops and utilities often voluntarily give information to the police. Last year, a Canadian court ruled that police must get a warrant before obtaining hydro records, but did not exclude the evidence collected using that information even though it was obtained without a warrant.\nAccording to that 2014 NPCC report, indoor cannabis production can consume 4,000 to 6,000 kilowatt hours (kWh) of energy per kilogram of product, or just over two pounds. In January of 2018 the CBC, reporting on Canada’s booming pot business, reported that it takes about 2,000 kWh to produce one pound of product, which is about the same as NPCC’s estimate.\nYou Can Use a Weed Grow Tent to Cool Your Bitcoin Mining Rig Going by these estimates, let’s do some quick math that shows how costly it is, electricity-wise, to grow bud. In New York area, electricity cost 19.8 cents per kWh in February.

Investors can then use their newly-acquired Bitcoin or Ethereum to buy Bitcoin Green using one of the aforementioned exchanges.\nnew TradingView.widget({ “height”: 400, “width”: 650, “symbol”: “BITGUSD”, “interval”: “D”, “timezone”: “Etc/UTC”, “theme”: “White”, “style”: “1”, “locale”: “en”, “toolbar_bg”: “#f1f3f6”, “enable_publishing”: false, “hideideas”: true, “referral_id”: “2588”}); Receive News & Updates for Bitcoin Green Daily - Enter your email address below to receive a concise daily summary of the latest news and updates for Bitcoin Green and related cryptocurrencies with MarketBeat.com's FREE CryptoBeat newsletter .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.savebitcoin.io/", "http://twitter.com/share", "https://www.twitter.com/btc_green", "https://www.marketbeat.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin-green/", "https://www.coinbase.com/join/52afc5ac562b15091600001d", "https://www.marketbeat.com/newsletter/default.aspx", "https://www.marketbeat.com/cryptocurrencies/newsletter/?symbol=CURRENCY:BITG&utm_source=MarketBeatPopup&utm_medium=MarketBeatPopup"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cardano", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin green", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ada", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wanchain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin green", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T23:44:17.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5841bd061ae336af52d08402fee5dd830db2b2ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_I6WqyKS3KtmoKfb5Gu7Nd58obgBFploOwzM05V82_5ryMj1K05Ud", "site_full": "www.youtube.com", "site": "youtube.com", "site_section": "http://bits.aihosting.com/rss", "site_categories": ["television", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "BTC News Aggregator", "title": "A Bitcoin ATM Could Be Coming To A Gas Station Or Vape Store Near You (HBO)", "title_full": "A Bitcoin ATM Could Be Coming To A Gas Station Or Vape Store Near You (HBO)", "published": "2018-05-30T04:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M7VvbM04qnM/maxresdefault.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5841bd061ae336af52d08402fee5dd830db2b2ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_I6WqyKS3KtmoKfb5Gu7Nd58obgBFploOwzM05V82_5ryMj1K05Ud", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-30T04:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "A Bitcoin ATM Could Be Coming To A Gas Station Or Vape Store Near You (HBO)", "text": "The interactive transcript could not be loaded.

Published on May 29, 2018 When bitcoin's price skyrocketed last year, suddenly a bunch of people wanted to get in on the action but didn't know how. But the currency's shady origins and digital only echo-system isolated it from a whole swath of interested investors. Soon start-ups set about trying to bridge the gap between the digital and physical world, and a few stumbled on a common contraption: The ATM.Today, Bitcoin's price is well below it's historic high, but interest in the currency remains strong, and companies are trying to bring it to more investors.Brandon Mintz is the CEO of Bitcoin Depot, an Atlanta company that distributes Bitcoin ATMs across the country. Machines like his are the only places where you can use paper money to purchase digital currency.Mintz’s Atlanta-based company operates Bitcoin ATMs across the country. The machines are the only places where you can use paper money to purchase digital currency. There’s no wait time like there is online, where an exchange can take weeks to verify your identity and banking information. All you have to do is enter your name, phone number, and scan a photo ID if your purchase is more than $2,000. There are now more than 3,000 according to Coin ATM Radar, a website that maps them. But in the U.S., there is almost no federal or state monitoring of Bitcoin ATM transactions — which makes it hard to get a clear picture of who is feeding cash into these machines and why. So far, New York is the only state that requires Bitcoin ATM operators to have a license. Companies like Bitcoin Depot self-report suspicious activity to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau within the U.S. Treasury Department created to, “determine emerging trends and methods in money laundering and other financial crimes.” But they do so without independent oversight.In a statement to VICE News, Bitcoin Depot said, “Bitcoin Depot has outstanding compliance policies and strives to go above and beyond all know your customer (kyc) and monitoring requirements at its ATMs.”The ATMs themselves cost as much as $10,000, compared to a few thousand for a regular ATM. Some let you sell Bitcoin and take cash out; most don’t. Mintz estimates that his customers put tens of millions of dollars into his machines every year. Host stores can expect to make an average of a few hundred dollars a month.

We make our money if its volatile.\n“If it goes up, if it goes down, if you have Bill Gates calling it a fraud, great. Short it. I don’t care.”\nThe digital currency has faced criticism by banks and finance experts, with billionaire Bill Gates telling CNBC he would bet against the cryptocurrency and short bitcoin if he could.\nThe Microsoft co-founder said: “As an asset class, you’re not producing anything and so you shouldn’t expect it to go up.

Last Tuesday was the birthday of the 8th Pizza Day, the day the crypto community celebrates the first Bitcoin transaction for a consumer product, which in this case were two pizzas.\nOn May 22, 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz posted a request on Bitcointalk to trade 10.000 Bitcoins for two pizzas. It was unlikely he knew how Bitcoin would unfold!\nIn Quito, Ecuador, the group of CriptoAsesores invited the PURA community to celebrate this important day at a local pizza restaurant. Six local crypto startups presented their projects to the audience. “We had expected about 50 people to attend the event, but the community came with 120 people. Consequently, this shows the big interest in cryptocurrencies in the Latin American markets”, said Jimmy Romero of CriptoAsesores.\nOne of the startups, CRIPTEC, presented their first dispenser machine, the Crypto Dispenser CT one-way ATM. The participants bought Bitcoin at the machines and paid with cryptocurrencies over the integrated POS system. Furthermore, many guests paid for their pizzas and drinks at the machines and were very excited about the technology made in Ecuador. The dispenser machines are ready to sell Bitcoin and PURA, as well as to receive PURA in the POS System. “The crypto dispenser is ready to sell PURA to all PURA lovers. The first five machines have already been sent to Europe for testing in the markets there. We are working towards mass adoption of PURA with our one-way and two-way machines. Now we are just waiting for the PURA Aurora mobile wallet. We will then start to sell PURA with the ATMs”, said David Coloma, Technical Director of CRIPTEC. PURA for the Common Good\nPURA is a cryptocurrency to provide you and society as a whole with a foundation to practice decentralized social responsibility and contribution.

This is what I think was the best way but im not sure\n1. Download latest BTC client\n2. move to a pc not connected to the internet.\n3. Create an address on that PC without internet.\n4. Send fund to address created on PC with no internet access.\n5. Save keys in safe place\nAlso I was wondering if there are any 100% safe third party wallets that enable quick access if needed ?\nSorry if my question has been covered many times, but I just don't want to make a big mistake.\nThanks\nRick\nonline wallet BlockChain\nOffline wallet Nano Sl egder", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T01:50:12.036+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dbbc0075af7758a8e7f44b02613aa00221330627", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.svJy.c9KZ9ZAEpq_0hFLIs9kbmA6i5kmDUIUKiHsdSGfvJCF3PfN9zwq7pUmIKOkig--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Right about now would be a good time to convert your euro's into bitcoin.", "title_full": "Right about now would be a good time to convert your euro's into bitcoin.", "published": "2018-05-30T03:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dbbc0075af7758a8e7f44b02613aa00221330627", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.svJy.c9KZ9ZAEpq_0hFLIs9kbmA6i5kmDUIUKiHsdSGfvJCF3PfN9zwq7pUmIKOkig--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-30T03:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Right about now would be a good time to convert your euro's into bitcoin.", "text": "Right about now would be a good time to convert your euro's into bitcoin.\n/u/phlogistonical\nCertainly if your are living in Italy\nItaly could be the next Greece — only much worse\nsubmitted by /u/phlogistonical\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T04:00:06.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7cf6d60775e17171d5202d9c2e8e89320bb053c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqanfhR8YdEtFPGPrTxxCEvuh9NaiFiZN82poKCNj8Y7hiZAQrbYfi7wcGyALKc1jep", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Monero -

I strongly believe that there is something fundamentally wrong with OKCoin and Huobi, and it has been the case for a long time (years now). If China ever is going to only allow one or two exchanges to operate, just to stay well positioned in terms of control, then it will be the aforementioned ones for sure. If we look back at how everything has been going with these exchanges, then it's safe to say that the Chinese government was very (suspiciously) mild towards the two giants. In order to come back strong, these exchanges need to build on their brand and position in this market, and that's exactly what they are doing.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

Staff - Leave a Comment\nBitcoin donations are an excellent way for charities to encourage more donors to participate. For donors, sending funds in Bitcoin is easy, as long as the charity has an online wallet set up. And for charities, they can receive funds from around the world, from a modern type of donor, who prefers this payment method.\n“Bitcoin is an exciting, new digital currency that allows for global payments to happen 24/7, 365 days a year with nominal fees,” says Christopher Moussa, Chief Investment Officer at Crypto Capital Investments. “Charities are beginning to realize the many potential benefits in accepting Bitcoin donations. Being at the forefront of accepting Bitcoin donations opens your organization up to a new community of donors that prefer to deal exclusively with Bitcoin.”\nSounds awesome, right? And it is. But, like anything else in life, you should read the fine print first. If you’re a charity, and you want to accept Bitcoin donations, there are a few things you should know . You don’t let issues such as tax compliance, volatility, and security of your bitcoin donations put you off. But do your research first.\nOnce you’re aware of the possible risks and know how to process bitcoin donations correctly, accepting this type of funding can have major benefits for your charity. Let’s take a look at a few of them here. A Wider Donor Pool\nCharities are up against some pretty stiff competition when it comes to attracting donors. Not only do they have to convince donors to hand out money from their own pockets, but they have to compete with thousands of other causes as well.\nIn the United States alone there are 1.5 million registered nonprofits. Convincing donors to choose yours over the rest is no easy feat.\nAccepting Bitcoin donations not only opens up the potential donor pool, but it gives you a leg up on the competition who don’t accept cryptocurrency. It’s easier for international donors to send money as well. And for donors who prefer complete anonymity, sending Bitcoin is an added incentive.\nJust think about the Pineapple Fund that donated $55 million worth of Bitcoin to charities anonymously. That wouldn’t have been possible without Bitcoin.\nNonprofit consultant , Paul Lamb points out, “One clear benefit is that, as more and more individuals become aware of and comfortable using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the greater the ability of charities to capture new funding streams.” Appealing to the Millennial Demographic\nStartup charities have it particularly hard trying to catch donors’ attention. They usually don’t have the funds to market themselves and aren’t well known to the public. When most people donate, it’s to the biggest charities and the go-to names they’re used to seeing in the media.\nAppealing to millennials should be part of any charity’s priorities. Millennials are more passionate about causes and more altruistic than generations before them (the average millennial donates almost $600 a year to charities). Millennials also happen to be the most active generation using Bitcoin. They’re willing to donate to your cause if you make it as easy for them as possible.\nThere are several crowdfunding platforms that make it easier for small charities to make themselves known, including bitgive and bithope . Once you get your charity in front of the right audience and make it simple for them to donate by accepting Bitcoin, you widen your appeal.\n“Millennials are the demographic most actively using Bitcoin,” says Lamb, “and as charities attempt to recruit younger donors, cryptocurrency is an unprecedented and growing fundraising opportunity area. Also, the ability to accept Bitcoin carries with it a kind of ahead-of-the-times cache, which can capture the attention of the modern and more innovation-oriented donor.” A Substantial Global Revenue Stream\nIn March, Ripple donated $29 million to DonarsChoose.org so that they could donate to every teachers’ request on the site. This is just one example of cryptocurrencies getting more proactive in philanthropy .\nIt’s not only beneficial to charities but helps blockchain companies address some of the negative press around cryptocurrency and the accusations that most people in it are criminals or only out for personal gain. Charities are primed to take advantage of this goodwill to drive more donations. Getting the Whole Benefit of the Donation\nWhile charities accepting donations through traditional means, such as credit card or PayPal, are subject to fees, with Bitcoin donations, those can be substantially reduced. While transaction fees still exist, they are significantly lower.\n“This allows the nonprofit to realize the full benefit of the donation and it significantly cuts down the processing time,” Moussa explains. “Donations with Bitcoin can be accepted from individuals around the world. The benefits of Bitcoin donations are that the transactions happen quickly, usually within 15 minutes.”\nAccepting bitcoin donations means that you don’t have to pay capital gains, which allows charities to get the whole benefit of the donation–so long as charities understand the volatility of Bitcoin value and the potential tax implications.\nThe main takeaway is that you must be compliant. So don’t accept donations and then recklessly HODL. “For charity organizations,” Moussa advises, “it is important to note that holding Bitcoin donations as an investment may require them to pay unrelated business income tax on any income that may be realized. Tax professionals are increasing their focus on Bitcoin taxation and will be able to help organizations navigate this new frontier.”\nJeromy Spence, Director of Finance at iComply Investor Services Inc. adds, “In the U.S. where capital gains use the first in first out method, it would be beneficial to donate sooner rather than later so that they could get a tax receipt on their most taxable crypto. There are extra benefits for first-time donors which should also be noted.”\nHowever, he concludes that “Ultimately charities should be excited and learn how to market to those interested in crypto-donation so that it can be a win-win for the donor and the charity.” Closing Thoughts on Bitcoin Donations\nThere are plenty of benefits from accepting Bitcoin donations for your charity. Especially if you want to widen your donor pool and make it as easy as possible to give.\nAccepting Bitcoin gives your charity greater possibilities, which can have untold impact on the work you do. Be smart about it, be compliant, and open the door to more funding and a brighter future.\nChristina Comben Christina is a B2B writer and MBA, specializing in fintech, cybersecurity, blockchain, and other geeky areas.

Views\nBitcoin’s lightning network may be just starting to send transactions over the blockchain, but already its developers are looking to rearchitect the technology.\nThat’s because, while touted as a way to significantly boost bitcoin’s capacity, the network itself does require users to store a significant amount of data, which makes it difficult to download and run. As such, several lightning developers – Lightning Labs co-founder ‘Laolu’ Osuntokun and Blockstream’s Christian Decker and Rusty Russell – have published a new proposal which imagines an alternative, “simplified” way of making off-chain transactions called eltoo.\nBut the new proposal isn’t only about condensing the amount of data users need to store, it’s also about keeping users’ cryptocurrency safe.\nFor instance, all this data poses another problem in that if users accidentally broadcast older data, they might lose money. As such, this data has been coined “toxic information.”\nEltoo, on the other hand, only stores the most recent off-chain transaction data, solving the well-known “information asymmetry” problem – that is if something happens to the device you’re running your lightning app on – say your smartphone – you might lose access to the whole history of data.\n“With eltoo, we reduce the risk of funds being swept away. We remove this toxic information,” said Decker, who noted that the proposal’s name is a joke of sorts – the phonetic spelling of “L2,” which stands for layer-two, what many people call technology like lightning that pushes transactions off-chain.\nAnd this is something Decker is very interested in since he’s experienced the problem personally.\n“This actually happened to me,” he said, adding:\n“I had an old lightning node on my laptop. I restored it. I didn’t know I didn’t have the newest state. The guy closed the connection because they knew it was an old state! Because he could steal it. Which he did, by the way.” All about revoking\nDevelopers have long been trying to come up with a way for users to make a bunch of transactions using bitcoin, without bloating the blockchain with unnecessary data.\nThat’s really what most of the scaling debates are all about.\nBut the first attempt to do this was way at the beginning of bitcoin’s history when off-chain transaction capabilities were experimented with using so-called “sequence numbers” to keep track of which off-chain transaction is the most recent.\nThe idea was simple – if Alice has $10 and sends a $1 transaction to Bob, obviously her balance dwindles to $9.00. This then gets a sequence number “1.” If later, she sends Bob $4, her balance is now $5, and this most recent transaction gets a sequence number “2.”\nBut according to Decker, the mechanism “didn’t work out,” because miners didn’t have any reason to enforce the rules and replace old transactions with the more recent ones.\nMiners could just broadcast the one transaction where Alice’s balance drops to $9 (even though she had made another transaction that dropped her balance to $5). While it’s unclear why a miner might want or decide to not revoke a transaction for another one, they could decide to do so since there was no enforceability.\nIn this way, revoking old transactions in crucial otherwise Bob might not get the second transaction and Alice could run away with the money.\nThis “lack of enforceability” is a problem that wasn’t solved until 2015.\nAnd the lightning network is the best-known solution to this problem so far. Today, revoking old state is accomplished with the “L2-penalty” model – whereby a lightning wallet or node stores all of these intermediary states, then, if someone tries to broadcast an earlier, now-invalid state, this is detected and the cheating user is punished by losing money. Eltoo and L2\nBut, three years on, the researchers are, in fact, going back to the idea of using sequence numbers to revoke old transactions.\nUnlike bitcoin’s old code, which didn’t have an enforcement mechanism for these sequences, eltoo adds a procedure that makes every state update prescribed. Every state update – Alice sending Bob money, for instance – is composed of two transactions, each of which both parties store and which totally replace the prior update transaction.\n“Only the last settlement transaction can ever be confirmed on the blockchain,” the introductory blog post explains.\nThe tangential advantage of this system is that it increases lightning’s scalability. With eltoo, each lightning node doesn’t need to store all the intermediary states, rather, it stores only the most recent version and some information about the transaction itself, such as it’s corresponding settlement transaction and potentially the HTLCs that spend from that settlement, the post notes. Lightning diagram from eltoo announcement blog post: http://blockstream.com/2018/04/30/eltoo-next-lightning.html\nWhat’s perhaps the most beneficial part of the proposal, though, is that it isn’t built on a “winner takes all” model.\nInstead, eltoo and older L2 penalty schemes can be used side-by-side.\n“Eltoo has quite different tradeoffs. I’m not implying it’s better in all senses,” Decker told CoinDesk, pointing to some arguments on the bitcoin developer mailing list about the technology increasing waiting times for transactions to be settled.\nStill, overall, he’s pretty excited about eltoo and the simplicity it brings, adding:\n“We don’t know which one is nicer, but I would like eltoo as the better option. I think eltoo is easier to explain and to extend later on.” Code obstacle\nNot only are developers still discussing the proposal’s merits, but there’s another thing standing in the technology’s way – “sighash_noinput.”\nThis long-anticipated code option needs to be added to the bitcoin codebase for the cryptocurrency to be able to support eltoo (at least in an efficient form).\nTo understand why, it’s important to know what the basic sighash function does. It works as a flag of sorts that specifies what part of the transaction data needs to be signed when it’s transferred over to someone else. Users can choose from a range of options – for instance, the default flag, sighash_all, indicates that all parts of the transaction need to be signed, meaning that none of these parts can be changed throughout the process.\nThe proposed “sighash_noinput” function could flag that the “input” data going into a transaction doesn’t need to be signed. And in turn, that the input data can change over time, from when the transaction was created to when it’s written to the blockchain.\nAnd this is exactly what eltoo needs, since the concept is that all the state in between the beginning and final transaction will be deleted, meaning the input will be different from the start and the end.\nWhen asked whether he thinks the sighash_noinput proposal will get merged into the bitcoin codebase, Decker laughed and said, “Ever since SegWit, I stopped making these predictions.”\nHe’s pointing to the fact that Segregated Witness (SegWit) had broad support from the bulk of bitcoin’s most active developers, but ended up stirring up a years-long battle within the community. The code change was only added to bitcoin last August, even though it was proposed more than two years prior.\nStill, even though it’s early, the sighash_noinput function is a relatively easy change to make to bitcoin’s codebase, Decker said.\nPlus, it’s been theorized for some time that the change would have many positive implications for developers, he continued. Because of these potential benefits, a handful of Twitter users have begun adding the code change to their profiles to express their support, much like Twitter users did during the scaling debate (with #No2X becoming popular among those who were opposed to the Segwit2x initiative).\nRemaining hopeful, Decker concluded:\n“Every day new use cases join the sighash_noinput front.”\nElectricity warning box image via Shutterstock\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The device, christened “sweetbit,” works by listening for incoming bitcoin transactions through blockchain.info and dispenses equivalent amount of candies.\nThe dispenser is supported by Arduino Micro, a micro-controller which allows the device to be controlled through USB. You can watch it at work here: Its creator, David Knezić, says that he created the device to demonstrate how easy it is to integrate bitcoin payments.\nHe has made the code public on Github. While it is exciting to see everyday payments being powered by bitcoin, there are still multiple shortcomings that make btcoin a less than ideal form of payment for small transactions.\nSmaller transactions with bitcoin currently incur massive transactions fee and take too long too process. I, for one, won’t want to wait forever just to get my candies.\nBut Knezić says he is working on another device that will powered by Bitcoin’s Lightning Network (LN) instead. Lightning Network, while still in nascent development, is seen as a solution to Bitcoin’s scalability problems. The network sits as a ‘second-layer’ on top of bitcoin’s blockchain and allows for faster and cheaper transactions.

It has already seen patients who are totally consumed with trading in the currencies - including some who were not already suffering other forms of addiction.\nDr Mark Griffiths, Professor of Behavioural Addiction at Nottingham Trent University, said the addictions were \"a subtype of online day-trading addiction. I see these as akin to a gambling addiction\".\nCastle Craig gambling therapist Chris Burn told news.com.au cryptocurrency trading was a fast growing activity.\n\"It is a form of gambling [and] people gamble on all kinds of things which makes cryptocurrency trading exciting. Compulsive gamblers like it - it's mysterious, not really regulated and you can make huge gains - and huge losses - in a single day.\"\nAnd that's where the havoc begins.\n\"People dive in because they don't want to miss out on a good thing and they start putting money in without thinking about the consequences. But the reality is [cryptocurrency] trading is a fascinating idea, but it can do a great deal of harm.\"\nIn that regard, it wasn't surprising people were taken in by the bitcoin craze.\n\"I think it's an escape from reality. People like the excitement and that you can do it 24 hours a day and [sit there] and watch the screen and watch making a profit - or not - and that goes on and on. That's what a compulsive gambler wants.\" A UK hospital has begun offering treatment specifically\nThere were parallels with pokie machines, and Mr Burn predicted there would be a rise in the number of bitcoin addicts in the months and years ahead.\n\"It provides excitement and an escape from reality...It's a classic bubble situation and the way we see that developing, it could well [get worse] quite soon.\"\nIt was relatively easy to start bitcoin trading which was dangerous for young people in particular.\n\"It's relatively easy...you go through the motions...you don't know who you are dealing with but anyone can get on and it's relatively easy.\"\nBitcoin was particularly dangerous because people were being seduced by the idea of making it rich quick online, where they believed there was a fortune to be made.\nThere are around 13 million people across the world trading in the system.\n\"A lot of people hear about something like this [and] they go for a gamble because they don't want to miss out on the next good thing - a lot of addictive behaviour comes from computers and the internet. This is another specific example that is really, really dangerous.\"\nThe situation \"just goes bad\" from there.\nThe patients he had worked with had been desperate and on the verge of suicide.\n\"They are in desperate need of help and are isolated. People don't realise if you spend 14 hours or so a day on a computer doing this sort of thing it has really negative consequences on other aspects of your life.\"\nBitcoin trading therefore was a very modern take on an old problem. That means often people had no idea they were at risk until it was too late.\n\"Anybody who is involved with cryptocurrency trading who thinks they could have a problem, chances are they probably do.\"\nThe moment of realisation was depressingly familiar.\n\"It's usually when they run out of money and realise there is no way forward. Until then, people convince themselves the next bet would make it okay. We would all do that with any sort of addictive behaviour if there were no consequences.\"\nCastle Craig has treated over 10,000 patients for various addictions since it opened in 1988, and claims the majority have gone on to achieve long-term abstinent recovery.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrew koubaridis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "castle craig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris burn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark griffiths", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nottingham trent university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "castle craig hospital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T12:56:29.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bdd4f53688f004e6a8889455d5104b3d30f43e6d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKXRU2OpTFfNT_SvMGRqybqICMs781jedXRZelMnQJSCqcMMhHre6YQ3397kq9oocP0KUcQzQpJdkSe64PTw9FeSvHr2pEdSmi", "site_full": "www.newsbtc.com", "site": "newsbtc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Signaling Bullish Reversal | NewsBTC", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Signaling Bullish Reversal | NewsBTC", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.069, "main_image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/04/17062358/techanalysis-btc3.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40893, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bdd4f53688f004e6a8889455d5104b3d30f43e6d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKXRU2OpTFfNT_SvMGRqybqICMs781jedXRZelMnQJSCqcMMhHre6YQ3397kq9oocP0KUcQzQpJdkSe64PTw9FeSvHr2pEdSmi", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aayush Jindal", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Signaling Bullish Reversal | NewsBTC", "text": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Signaling Bullish Reversal Aayush Jindal | May 30, 2018 | 8:48 am Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Signaling Bullish Reversal Aayush Jindal | May 30, 2018 | 8:48 am Key Points Bitcoin price formed a strong base around $7,050 and moved higher against the US Dollar.

The crowds blowing the hotel, luxury cars all over the place, the chauffeur was too busy parking too much cars. People coming from all over the world speaking languages ​​of various countries have packed the lobby of the hotel. The high-end hotel was crowed like a busy shopping mall on festival day. On the 6th floor of the hotel，here held the “International Blockchain Economic Conference” . Thousands of seats were full. People from all over the world have spent a lot of money on air tickets and hotels. Many people crowded on the aisle, as if they didn’t want to miss the wealth that would sweep the world this time. Dozens of cameras and media workers, as well as celebrities’ presence highlighted the importance of this conference. CEO of blockchain, rich Dubai businessman, JP Morgans, Citibanks and other business giants were impressive, but one of them was even more eye-catching: black hair, energetic, fluent English and talking with great confidence and power. His name is Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry. For this purpose, we made a special interview with him. Right side is Liao Wang Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry, comes from Jiangxi Province, China. He went to Dubai at 24 years old, when he was as poor as church mouse and used to sleep on corridor as he could not afford paying bed space . He founded “Atomic Properties LLC” at age 25, turning from extremely poverty to boss in a year time. Later he invested hundreds of properties in Dubai and became a self-made billionaire. He is a living legend of people becoming rich in Dubai, the famous luxury city. Now he is the CEO of Atoshi(a blockchain company ) and the initiator of International Monetary Freedom Organization. Selected below are some of Liao Wang’s speech: “China only banned exchanges and haven’t banned the legitimacy of OTC transactions and owning of Bitcoins, indicating that the government is still relatively friendly and open. The people of the world do not have to panic because of Chinese government’s ban on cryptocurrency exchanges. The Chinese government has adopted foreign exchange control policies to promote Chinese economy. If the existence of an exchange is allowed, many capitals and illegal money will flow out of China through cryptocurrency, thereby increasing the difficulty of foreign exchange control and affecting economic development. The Chinese government also controls US dollars in China. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be more restricted than what the government has done now. “Bitcoin may fall to $1 after rising $1 million per coin. Bitcoin has all the merits of gold and can be more easily easier divided into small pieces than gold, which makes it better for transactions than gold. At the same time, it also has all the advantages of the US dollar, but better than dollars. Limited at only 21million coins, Bitcoin will continue to go up to 20,000 US dollars, 100,000 US dollars, and even 1 million US dollars, but at the same time due to the rise of many new cryptocurrencies, Bitcoins dominance in all crytos will be reduced to below 5% .Because bitcoin technology was a decade ago, the rise of new cryptocurrency, technological upgrading and some mining pools have more than 51% of whole computing power, which may lead to the risk of attacking the bitcoin network. It will gradually decline, even less than 1 US dollar.” “The cryptocurrency 3.0 is still a baby in mama’s stomach. 3.0 should have a faster transaction speed, lower transaction cost, and be more decentralized. At the same time, it can run Dapp on a large scale and implement ipfs. He is leading atoshi team to do that. “Foreign reserves will gradually shift from US dollar to cryptos, because US dollar can be printed at almost 0 costs, and the wealth of countries that hold US dollar as foreign reserves is constantly diluted and devalued. People of the world are not happy with that and demand a change now. “Dubai’s blockchain business environment is very good: Dubai ruler HH Sheik Mohammad Al Maktoum himself said: “The adoption of blockchain technology will help Dubai for the future challenges.” Dubai’s Crown Prince HH Sheik Hamdan launched “Dubai Blockchain Strategy” project and established Smart Dubai Office. Dr. Aisha Bin Bashr, Director of the Smart Dubai Office, said: “A lot of countries are still arguing about the advantages and disadvantages of the blockchain. We have already embraced blockchain to make Dubai the capital of blockchain.” “Dubai has a 2020 paperless city plan. By 2020,50% of the government will adopt blockchain, saving an estimated 77 million man-hours per year and 440 million sheets of paper. Departments including the Immigration Department, the Ministry of Finance, DEWA, and Land Department must all use blockchain technology, such as real estate registration……” Liao Wang’s speech was straight to the point. He had a very eyes-opening understanding of the crypto currency. Huge applauses came like waves after his speech. We wish Liao Wang and his Atoshi blockchain a big success on the world’s stage.

The investigating agency has also started probe into the digital wallets and bank accounts associated with the firm.\nAccording to CID officials, questioning of Nikunj Bhatt, Shailesh Bhatt’s nephew, revealed how the cryptocurrency exchange functioned. The firm was managed in Surat by Divyesh Darji and Satish Kumbhani whereas Dhaval Mavani was looking after transactions. Bitconnect has its registered office in London in the UK. Primary probe, however, has revealed that the address was just a front and there is no office on the said address.\nCID has recovered 12 Bitcoins from Nikunj out of the 2,000-plus Bitcoin haul which, along with the Bitcoins recovered so far in first phase, will be converted into Indian rupees and will be transferred to a nationalized bank.\n“Apart from India, the firm has its presence in Indonesia, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Singapore and the US. We have identified a few accounts associated with the transactions and have intimated the respective banks about it,” said an official.\nTalking about how the firm functioned, officials said that the promoters were active in sale and purchase of cryptocurrency since 2016 where they aggressively promoted Bitcoins as a good investment option in Diamond City and elsewhere. The firm is suspected to have formalized in beginning of 2017 and soon after they started Ponzi scheme of very high returns on investment.\n“The promoters used to mention a special software that used to decide on low and high points of Bitcoin for purchase and sale respectively. The difference used to be earning and the firm had promised 365% annual return or 1% daily,” said an official.\nIf the lure was not enough, the firm also had investment slabs. If the investor gets cryptocurrency worth up to $1,000, he would get the volatility benefit. If the investment was between $1,000 and $5,000, the person would get 0.1% extra on the earning. Likewise, the investment of $5,000-$10,000 and $10,000-$100,000 would get the person 0.2% and 0.25% additional returns on volatility. For all the schemes, the person had a lock-in period of 120 days (4 months).\nLike other Ponzi schemes, where the new entrants’ money is used to pay the earlier investors, the cycle went well till beginning of 2018. However, many investors got the idea of trouble ahead in December 2017 and had started pulling back their investment. The firm slowly found it difficult to sustain the cycles after which the firm went bust.\n“Shailesh Bhatt was one such investor who dreamed of good returns after investing in 0.1% scheme. However, when the company showed inability to pay his money back, he along with eight others extorted the cryptocurrency from Mavani in a farmhouse. Bhatt was picked up by a team of Amreli police a month later from near Gandhinagar,” said an investigator.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitconnect", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "satish kumbhani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dhaval mavani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nikunj bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "divyesh darji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shailesh bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ahmedabad news - times of india ahmedabad", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitconnect", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitconnect", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vietnam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nikunj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T06:18:20.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c82d574e8ccb637a5a9e73b6a56a8f7f5023aa22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwr2YV2isIWcyCvtfw.53FdTtybSSeGe1AeCT1Wx9RcjgOhhY1ae0TwtB0vQl6PcpoVa8c.LSWVBvls_2L_3HJbI9q6J_m9gck-", "site_full": "freealt.co.in", "site": "freealt.co.in", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["contests_and_freebies", "shopping"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Broke Key Resistance - Free Altcoins", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Broke Key Resistance - Free Altcoins", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.035, "main_image": "http://freealt.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin-Cash25.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c82d574e8ccb637a5a9e73b6a56a8f7f5023aa22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgwr2YV2isIWcyCvtfw.53FdTtybSSeGe1AeCT1Wx9RcjgOhhY1ae0TwtB0vQl6PcpoVa8c.LSWVBvls_2L_3HJbI9q6J_m9gck-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Broke Key Resistance - Free Altcoins", "text": "Key Points Bitcoin cash price jumped higher and broke a key resistance at $950 against the US Dollar. There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $960 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may correct a few points in the short term, but downsides remain supported above $950.\nBitcoin cash price is back in a bullish zone above $950 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD has to gather pace above $1,040 for more gains in the near term. Bitcoin Cash Price Trend\nThere was a decent support formed around the $870 level in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price started a solid upside move and traded above the $900 resistance level. It opened the doors for more gains and the price broke the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,010 high to $870 low. During the upside move, the price also managed to clear a major barrier near $950.\nA break above the stated $950 resistance is a positive sign for buyers. More importantly, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $960 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair is now placed nicely above the $960 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The recent high was around $1,030 and the price is currently consolidating gains. On the downside, an initial support is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $970 low to $1,030 high.\nLooking at the chart , the previous resistance near $950 is likely to act as a strong support. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $970 low to $1,030 high is near $950 to provide support.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is now back in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is currently near the 65 level.\nMajor Support Level – $950 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T09:05:12.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "303a32eabd996f0ccab6c9979b9f59bd3299fc78", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSwO8CZSl7pv_VM.ppS9NkGeGgzP__SGcmFNpuAFKAUa_IBNH6AM2r7DwNLWe1eDj9tL26aVMNgRzGJTw02aseDUcW2IAAcjkGDk3J_jcUz_Q--", "site_full": "everythingbtc.com", "site": "everythingbtc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "$7,560: Bitcoin Bulls Fight Back, But Too Early to Call Reversal - Everything Bitcoin", "title_full": "$7,560: Bitcoin Bulls Fight Back, But Too Early to Call Reversal - Everything Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.008, "main_image": "http://everythingbtc.com/wp-content/plugins/rss-post-importer/app/classes/front/app/assets/img/03-04-feedsapi-api.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "303a32eabd996f0ccab6c9979b9f59bd3299fc78", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSwO8CZSl7pv_VM.ppS9NkGeGgzP__SGcmFNpuAFKAUa_IBNH6AM2r7DwNLWe1eDj9tL26aVMNgRzGJTw02aseDUcW2IAAcjkGDk3J_jcUz_Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "$7,560: Bitcoin Bulls Fight Back, But Too Early to Call Reversal - Everything Bitcoin", "text": "Notify me of follow-up comments by email.

The crowds blowing the hotel, luxury cars all over the place, the chauffeur was too busy parking too much cars. People coming from all over the world speaking languages ​​of various countries have packed the lobby of the hotel. The high-end hotel was crowed like a busy shopping mall on festival day. On the 6th floor of the hotel，here held the “International Blockchain Economic Conference” . Thousands of seats were full. People from all over the world have spent a lot of money on air tickets and hotels. Many people crowded on the aisle, as if they didn’t want to miss the wealth that would sweep the world this time. Dozens of cameras and media workers, as well as celebrities’ presence highlighted the importance of this conference. CEO of blockchain, rich Dubai businessman, JP Morgans, Citibanks and other business giants were impressive, but one of them was even more eye-catching: black hair, energetic, fluent English and talking with great confidence and power. His name is Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry. For this purpose, we made a special interview with him. Right side is Liao Wang Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry, comes from Jiangxi Province, China. He went to Dubai at 24 years old, when he was as poor as church mouse and used to sleep on corridor as he could not afford paying bed space . He founded “Atomic Properties LLC” at age 25, turning from extremely poverty to boss in a year time. Later he invested hundreds of properties in Dubai and became a self-made billionaire. He is a living legend of people becoming rich in Dubai, the famous luxury city. Now he is the CEO of Atoshi(a blockchain company ) and the initiator of International Monetary Freedom Organization. Selected below are some of Liao Wang’s speech: “China only banned exchanges and haven’t banned the legitimacy of OTC transactions and owning of Bitcoins, indicating that the government is still relatively friendly and open. The people of the world do not have to panic because of Chinese government’s ban on cryptocurrency exchanges. The Chinese government has adopted foreign exchange control policies to promote Chinese economy. If the existence of an exchange is allowed, many capitals and illegal money will flow out of China through cryptocurrency, thereby increasing the difficulty of foreign exchange control and affecting economic development. The Chinese government also controls US dollars in China. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be more restricted than what the government has done now. “Bitcoin may fall to $1 after rising $1 million per coin. Bitcoin has all the merits of gold and can be more easily easier divided into small pieces than gold, which makes it better for transactions than gold. At the same time, it also has all the advantages of the US dollar, but better than dollars. Limited at only 21million coins, Bitcoin will continue to go up to 20,000 US dollars, 100,000 US dollars, and even 1 million US dollars, but at the same time due to the rise of many new cryptocurrencies, Bitcoins dominance in all crytos will be reduced to below 5% .Because bitcoin technology was a decade ago, the rise of new cryptocurrency, technological upgrading and some mining pools have more than 51% of whole computing power, which may lead to the risk of attacking the bitcoin network. It will gradually decline, even less than 1 US dollar.” “The cryptocurrency 3.0 is still a baby in mama’s stomach. 3.0 should have a faster transaction speed, lower transaction cost, and be more decentralized. At the same time, it can run Dapp on a large scale and implement ipfs. He is leading atoshi team to do that. “Foreign reserves will gradually shift from US dollar to cryptos, because US dollar can be printed at almost 0 costs, and the wealth of countries that hold US dollar as foreign reserves is constantly diluted and devalued. People of the world are not happy with that and demand a change now. “Dubai’s blockchain business environment is very good: Dubai ruler HH Sheik Mohammad Al Maktoum himself said: “The adoption of blockchain technology will help Dubai for the future challenges.” Dubai’s Crown Prince HH Sheik Hamdan launched “Dubai Blockchain Strategy” project and established Smart Dubai Office. Dr. Aisha Bin Bashr, Director of the Smart Dubai Office, said: “A lot of countries are still arguing about the advantages and disadvantages of the blockchain. We have already embraced blockchain to make Dubai the capital of blockchain.” “Dubai has a 2020 paperless city plan. By 2020,50% of the government will adopt blockchain, saving an estimated 77 million man-hours per year and 440 million sheets of paper. Departments including the Immigration Department, the Ministry of Finance, DEWA, and Land Department must all use blockchain technology, such as real estate registration……” Liao Wang’s speech was straight to the point. He had a very eyes-opening understanding of the crypto currency. Huge applauses came like waves after his speech. We wish Liao Wang and his Atoshi blockchain a big success on the world’s stage.

The broad-based rally across the wider cryptocurrency markets in April only added to the bullish sentiment.\nSince May 24, however, EOS has been restricted to a narrow trading range of $10–$13, according to Bitfinex data.\nThe fizzling out of investor enthusiasm may be linked to the identification of security flaws in the EOS platform. On Tuesday, Qihoo 360, a China-based internet security firm, said it had informed developers of potentially serious vulnerabilities in the platform, which now appear to have been patched.\nIn response, the price of EOS fell from $12 to $10.70, but soon regained the lost ground alongside a $400 rally in bitcoin prices.\nFurther, the company’s lack of responsiveness to issues such as general confusion over the voting procedure for block producers (validators) may have taken the shine off the June 2 launch for investors.\nAll that said, EOS is still up more than 200 percent from its March low of $3.87 and could shine against bitcoin in the near-term, the technical charts indicate.\nEOS/USD daily chart\nThe above chart shows that EOS is stuck inside a falling channel – a bearish pattern. Further, its failure to retake the rising trendline on May 28 is an encouraging sign for the bears.\nHowever, the outlook would turn bearish only below $10.33 – the low of last Thursday’s bullish outside-day candle.\nIn such a case, EOS will likely find acceptance below the rising channel support (seen today at $9.60) and drop to $9.72 (76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement).\nOn the higher side, only a convincing move above the rising trendline hurdle (currently seen at $13.45) would revive the bullish outlook and open doors for $20.\nWhile the EOS/USD market looks indecisive, its bitcoin-denominated exchange rate looks all set for a big move higher.\nEOS/BTC daily chart\nThe bull flag breakout seen on April 24 signals a resumption of the rally from the April 17 low of $0.0010 BTC and has opened the doors to 0.0029 BTC (target as per the measured height method, i.e. pole height added to breakout price).\nOnly a move back inside the flag would abort the bullish view.\nEOS image via Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "eos cryptocurrency lacks price direction ahead of launch eos cryptocurrency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eos cryptocurrency lacks price direction ahead of launch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitfinex", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T22:43:00.034+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f84b98ad6f0680739623649033ed0f4c16e47e2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVDkRECSJNKTsUHbMmn6JaWhq8bwZDqVqM5m6OG_o0JW7oDPzAVmxYqxEWt_62qoc6gdCVXQW2DKoYeBO1XKYS3lLy4VgECz1X", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitbay Exchange Moves to Malta After Last Polish Bank Stops Service - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Bitbay Exchange Moves to Malta After Last Polish Bank Stops Service - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.784, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/leaving-poland.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f84b98ad6f0680739623649033ed0f4c16e47e2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVDkRECSJNKTsUHbMmn6JaWhq8bwZDqVqM5m6OG_o0JW7oDPzAVmxYqxEWt_62qoc6gdCVXQW2DKoYeBO1XKYS3lLy4VgECz1X", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Avi Mizrahi", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitbay Exchange Moves to Malta After Last Polish Bank Stops Service - Bitcoin News", "text": "Bitbay Exchange Moves to Malta After Last Polish Bank Stops Service – Bitcoin News\nExchanges\nHostile or just overly cautions countries keep losing cryptocurrency-related businesses to more attractive jurisdictions, along with the jobs and tax money that go along with them. The latest example comes from Poland, which Bitbay has been forced to leave for Malta.\nAlso Read: Dominance of Big Banks in UK Means London Might Miss the Boat on Bitcoin Farewell Poland\nPoland-based international cryptocurrency exchange, Bitbay , has announced its decision to suspend the activity of the trading platform in Poland. Founded in 2014 in Katowice, the company is said to have over 200 employees and 800,000 users. The reason for the exit from its home market is that Bitbay can no longer receive banking services in the country.\n“The activity of the Bitbay exchange in Poland requires cooperation with Polish bank. Unfortunately the last Polish bank ready to provide bank services undertook unilateral decision to finish the cooperation with Bitbay with the effect at the end of May. In those circumstances the continuation of providing high quality services by Bitbay exchange in Poland is no longer possible,” the company stated.\nThe move will occur in a couple of phases. After May 31 st, access to PLN accounts will not be possible, but all other functions of the exchange in Poland will still be active. After the expiry of the notice period, September 18 th , users will only be able to withdraw funds, and trading on the Bitbay exchange in Poland will be completely suspended. The exchange operations will be conducted by a new supplier in Malta with the same software that was used by the exchange in Poland, based on the domain bitbay.net under the Bitbay trademark. Welcome to Malta\nIn explaining the specific location it is moving the exchange operations to, the company’s team say they have been conducting analysis for many months in order to find the most cryptocurrency-friendly place in the European Union. “Productive discussions with the government of Republic of Malta and friendly business environment provide Bitbay assurance that the choice of Maltese jurisdiction is the best solution.”\nAs we previously reported, the Maltese government’s has successfully focused on bringing in more international cryptocurrency business to booster the local economy this year. Back in March, Binance revealed that it would be moving its operations and starting to recruit 200 people to work on the island. In April, Okex announced it is also establishing its own entity in Malta.\nShould exchanges move to friendlier locations or try and fight in the local courts?

The mainnet launch is supposed to undergo severe testing schedules from May 31 st – June 24 th ; meanwhile, the community shall seek independence.\nOdyssey 2.0 is a secure and reliable milestone in the history of blockchain technology. TRON’s core development team now has a global community of 2000 commits, merged over 500 forks, covering 384 unit tests. The developers of Odyssey 2.0 have built over 15 TRON blockchain explorers and 102 new features including wallet apps on their testnet.\nThe major differences between events taking place on the 31 st of May and that of June 25 th lie on the technicality of the developers and how the TRON community as a whole prepare themselves for the “lift-off”. Currently, the TRON community has more than one million supporters, including more than 19 exchanges, namely Bitbns, Bit-Z, Binance, Bithumb, Bitpie, and Bitfinex among the major cryptocurrency exchanges.\nUsers are required to download and sync their system with Odyssey 2.0. The guidelines following this version of the mainnet will be announced on TRON’s official website. Participants including blockchain explorers and dApp developers need to configure their systems to Odyssey 2.0. Justin Sun referred to the strategic conference, as “A CALL FOR INDEPENDENCE”, prepared to launch at 11 AM UTC+8, May 31 st , 2018.

Bitcoin.com does not endorse nor support this product/service. Bitcoin.com is not responsible for or liable for any content, accuracy or quality within the press release.\nHere’s ten reasons why Essentia has the potential to break the internet of fragmentation and propel us towards mainstream blockchain adoption.\n1: Essentia is not just an application or a simple platform, it’s a protocol. Essentia does front itself with a user-friendly interface to navigate across multiple blockchains and decentralized apps. But its open-source code also means that developers can tuck into the back end and create customized experiences, for anyone to use.\n2: Essentia automates the unnecessary digital admin, meaning you can get back to working on what really matters. Buying or selling crypto/assets? Simply set the value parameters to your preferred prices and Essentia will scan over your exchanges. By doing all the manual work instantly, Essentia ensures you get the best value.\n3: Essentia is creating two brand new application classes, cross-chain apps (cApps) and multi-chain apps (mApps). As we have all begun to realize the world of blockchains are painfully fragmented. The lack of integration is exactly what Essentia has aimed to eliminate, with this new protocol, decentralized apps can function across chains and work simultaneously on multiple chains.\n4: As a personalized operating system, Essentia allows us to interact with the new decentralized Internet. It’s like a bridge between the past and the future. For newcomers and tech experts alike, accessing and managing the web of decentralized entities has never been easier. Essentia can be thought of as a customizable OS which enables us to transport our data from centralized platforms to infinitely more secure decentralized services.\n5: Essentia cannot own or access your personal data, nor will the (de)centralized services you use. Imagine no centralization, it’s easy if you try. No data thieves below us, above us only sky… Doesn’t really flow, but you get the gist. There is no supreme commander with access to swathes of personal data. Everything done within Essentia remains completely in the users’ hands, we can thank blockchain technology for that.\n6: Essentia automatically interoperates with DApps in their native token, you’ll never need to carry multiple tokens again. Requiring a single token for each DApp you use is incredibly unpractical considering the time and cost in acquiring them. The ESS token may be the last token you ever have to obtain, that’s because it enables you to access your favourite decentralized services in one. How convenient!\n7: On top of Essentia you can build applications in whatever language you want. Essentia is language agnostic. We wanted to make sure any developer around the world has the ability to use Essentia as their tool to create next generation blockchain based decentralized facilities. It’s a way of ensuring we build this community together, spread the blockchain love and speed towards mainstream adoption.\n8: Essentia has integrated the best of the best applications, so you can natively interact with one convenient point of access. One seed to access your digital life, in its entirety or just sections. Our hard work partnering with and integrating the next best apps and services means it’s finally possible to have your entire crypto life secure and accessible only to you, from anywhere in the world.\n9: Decentralized passwordless logins. It has finally become a possibility! Forget insecure passwords that are likely to be forgotten and vulnerable to be hacked. Essentia has adopted state of the art eLogin technology to ensure your accounts are only accessible to you.\n10: Important for us investors out there — buy-sell crypto instantly. Ever checked the price of crypto then gone onto your exchange and it’s already changed for the worse? Never miss out on a good deal again. Not only can you automate the process but you could even use Amazon Alexa to voice command trades across the various exchanges to get the best price. Not a single button needs to be pressed!\nThe extent of possibilities is by no means limited to ten examples, but we can already see why investors are getting excited about the upcoming ICO. The private sale recently closed which reached the hard cap of over $20m and offers for over $70m. It’s not too late to register in the whitelist so head over to Essentia.one and have a look around!\nTo be a part of their growing community join their Telegram channel https://t.me/essentia_one/ .\nContact Email Address www.essentia.one\nThis is a paid press release.

China Confiscates ¥1.7 Billion From Onecoin Scheme\nAccording to reports from the region, a local Chinese procurator’s office has prosecuted 98 people and recovered 1.7 billion yuan (about $270 million) in an alleged Onecoin pyramid scheme. The case is thought to involve up to 15 billion yuan, and had been under investigation since July 2016, supervised by the Ministry of Public Security.\nThe Onecoin scheme involved twenty provinces in the country, according to South China Morning Post . Details of the case are “complicated,” and the amount involved is “huge”, and the final four suspects in the case had been prosecuted, the reports said. Around the end of 2017, 33 defendants were sentenced to four years in prison and fined between 10,000 and 5 million yuan. 85% of Germans Have Heard of Cryptocurrencies The majority of Germans have heard about bitcoin and even think they understand the term. This according to an online survey conducted by YouGov Deutschland GmbH, in which 2051 persons participated between 11/05/2018 and 14/05/2018. The results were weighted and said to be representative of the German population over 18 years of age.\nThe stats show that 85% of Germans have heard of cryptocurrencies and say they know what the term means. 38% believe that their importance will increase and 21% foresee a loss of significance. 8% percent even say that they would invest all or the larger part of their available money in cryptocurrencies rather than in equities. 53% believe that cryptocurrencies would become more attractive, and 25% do not. Ramadan Kareem\nThe Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, East London, UK has reportedly decided to accept cryptocurrencies as charity. “For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,” said consultant Lukasz Musial. “For the donor, it’s just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque’s perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,” he added. Greenhouse Mining United American Corp, a Florida-based company, has announced it completed the construction of its first “ Blockchain Dome Heat Station” and greenhouse in the Canadian province of Quebec and that all 1,000 mining rig heat generation modules are in full service. Heat coming out of the rigs is used to warm the facility instead of letting that energy go to waste.\n“The Blockchain Dome was built on budget, on-time and to our specification. The results we can see and measure are overwhelming and beyond our expectations,” said CEO Benoit Laliberte. “We will provide further information to the market soon, but we can already state that we have set new efficiency and performance standards for this type of operation going forward,” he added.\nThe sustainable use of mining-generated heat has been a hot topic for a while now. Earlier this year we reported about a similar venture after a photo of ‘Cryptomatoes’ went viral. Crypto Champ Strikes Again\nOn Monday, we reported that Rory MacDonald, the current Bellator MMA Welterweight World Champion, has shared a clip of himself training in a BCH shirt.

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

Will Bitcoin Be Here in a Century? Speaking on CNBC’s ‘ Trading Nation ,’ the Yale professor argued that the cryptocurrency won’t look anything like it does today, and that if it does it’ll go by a different name. “There will have been many hard forks changing it and changing it. And, it’ll be a matter of dispute whether it exists or not,” Shiller added. With Bitcoin’s value continuing to fluctuate, Shiller states that one scenario that could take place is similar to what occurred in 2013 when it reached $1,000 only to lose 80 percent of its value. He added: ‘It looked like Bitcoin was just fading away. It’s so hard to predict these things.’ Yet, while he may have a doomsday opinion of the future of Bitcoin, the economist said that he doesn’t mean to be dismissive of the cryptocurrency. Even though he claims that it looks like it’s in a bubble , with the more than 1,350 digital currencies on the market, with a market cap value, he said ‘something good may come out of this.’ Shiller is known for voicing his opinion on the cryptocurrency market. Earlier this month, he was reported as saying that the digital currency industry was copying some of history’s most failed monetary experiments . He also added that no one outside of computer science is able to explain how cryptocurrencies work. In October, he commented on the ‘strange enthusiasm’ for Bitcoin, calling it a ‘ fad .’ The professor is not alone in his negative estimations regarding Bitcoin. Legendary investor Warren Buffett to JPMorgan head Jamie Dimon have cast views on the cryptocurrency in the past. In response to Buffett’s ‘rat poison squared’ remarks regarding Bitcoin, cryptocurrency mining firm Genesis Mining tweeted a picture that asked whether Buffett had got it wrong about Bitcoin , after getting it wrong about Google and Amazon. In Shiller’s case, though, even though he may not be as optimistic on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, he hasn’t resorted to baseless name calling when it comes to the cryptocurrency market. For now, whether Bitcoin survives the next 100 years remains to be seen. While it may be struggling with its price at the moment, for now it doesn’t look as though it’s going anywhere anytime soon.
