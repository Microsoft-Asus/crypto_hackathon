In a recent issue of the Gold Goats ‘n Guns Newsletter I described Bitcoin as “The Mutation That Saved Money.” In that piece I argued that Bitcoin was born out of the extreme fraud of the financial system under Greenspan and Bernanke. Leverage - Levels - Fiat - Capital - System Leverage ratcheted up post-Y2K to levels which could only be supported through legislative fiat. It walled off capital from fleeing the system.And the response was a group of folks applied the teachings of Austrian Economics and Ludwig von Mises’ Regression Theorem to create a digital asset which became less resistant to fraud the more it was adopted. Result - Bitcoin The result was Bitcoin.Bitcoin was a catastrophic mutation. A thing born out of necessity to free human beings from a central issuing authority of new monetary units. That relationship needs to be broken if we are going to free ourselves from the cycle of tyranny of the few at the expense of the many. Bitcoin - End - Story - Fact - Beginning This isn’t to say that Bitcoin itself is the end of the story. No, in fact, it’s simply the beginning of the next story in human development. But it shows us where we are headed.The ebb and flow of the human generational cycle and its relationship to natural cycles is at the heart of the economic cycle with its booms and busts. They create the interplay of how the rate of wealth generation proceeds. Business - Cycle - Marxists - Brethren - Keynesians It’s not possible to end the business cycle, like the Utopian Marxists and their economic brethren the Keynesians believe.The business cycle is tied to forces far beyond the control of any one person. Control - Money - Accelerant - Sides - Cycle The central control of money is an accelerant of both sides of the economic cycle, the boom and the bust.Excess credit creation, an inevitability during boom times, without underlying assets pull forward production from the future.

This raises the regulatory ambiguity. If abuse or crime happens on behalf of bitcoin then nobody can be held accountable and only end up with the losses suffered by the bitcoin users themselves.\nThere is no leadership. The community cannot seem to agree on even the smallest decisions. There is no clear business plan mapping out Bitcoins future. There are no laws and regulations. Bitcoin profits can be used for tax evasions. When there is such a huge spotlight on an activity that is known for tax evasion, it is obviously something that law enforcement takes notice of. Mining is another problem. The longer Bitcoin exists, the more difficult it becomes to mine, or create new coins.

It walled off capital from fleeing the system.\nAnd the response was a group of folks applied the teachings of Austrian Economics and Ludwig von Mises’ Regression Theorem to create a digital asset which became less resistant to fraud the more it was adopted.\nThe result was Bitcoin.\nBitcoin was a catastrophic mutation. A thing born out of necessity to free human beings from a central issuing authority of new monetary units. That relationship needs to be broken if we are going to free ourselves from the cycle of tyranny of the few at the expense of the many.\nThis isn’t to say that Bitcoin itself is the end of the story. No, in fact, it’s simply the beginning of the next story in human development. But it shows us where we are headed. What Goes Around …\nThe ebb and flow of the human generational cycle and its relationship to natural cycles is at the heart of the economic cycle with its booms and busts. They create the interplay of how the rate of wealth generation proceeds.\nIt’s not possible to end the business cycle, like the Utopian Marxists and their economic brethren the Keynesians believe.\nThe business cycle is tied to forces far beyond the control of any one person.\nThe central control of money is an accelerant of both sides of the economic cycle, the boom and the bust.\nExcess credit creation, an inevitability during boom times, without underlying assets pull forward production from the future. It does this by cheating the slower formation of capital through industry and savings.\nThe risk associated with that credit is almost certain to be under-priced via the loan’s interest rate because the lender didn’t earn the money it is lending.\nThe result is a high probability that the loan will not be repaid as the project was unsupported by the pool of real savings within the economy. Gene Callahan’s excellent book, “ Economics for Real People ” covers this brilliantly in the first few chapters.\nExcess credit creation thanks to the imperfect knowledge of all economic actors accelerates the boom and exacerbates the subsequent bust as the credit money is destroyed and the assets it was supporting fall in price. Misaligned Incentives\nCentralized money issuers have a vested interest in selling more monetary units. Because they make their wealth on the arbitrage between the price of what they buy now versus the higher price later.\nThey institutionalize the underpricing of capital risk by issuing money at lower interest rates than the economy can support. The result is a shift of the demand for money farther out in time because the most interest rate sensitive projects are the most capital intensive with the longest time horizons to completion.\nThis not only subsidizes uneconomic capital spending building roads to ghost cities but also crowds out investment in the projects the society actually needed because that capital was bid away from those projects.\nOnce the pool of real savings is exhausted because borrowers can’t generate enough revenue to cover the cost of the loans the whole system starts to collapse. Borrowers miss payments, the banks get caught short of cash and liquidations and bankruptcies rise.\nThe banks are leveraged up, having lent up to ten times the amount of money they have in their ‘vaults.’ Once the borrowers stop paying, the savers have to be paid their part of the interest on the loan and the bank runs out of cash.\nWelcome to a bank run. The Lobster Trap\nInflation is the result of more money chasing the same number of goods. And prices are a reflection of the knowledge of the two participants in the transaction. There is a mismatch between the two if there is a central issuer of new currency.\nFor example, say I’m a central banker who whips up $1000 for my weekly lunch tab. I know that $1000 will inflate prices later. New money gets spent at today’s prices because the restaurant owner doesn’t know where the money came from.\nHe just knows business is good and that I buy the most expensive lunches he offers. This gives him the false signal to up the price of that dish, say lobster. He knows he can then outbid his competition for lobsters, driving up the price.\nI’ll always pay the new, higher market price for the lobster.\nBecause why the heck not? I’m printing money out of ‘thin air’ and sticking taxpayers with the bill.\nThis form of income, unearned through honest labor, is called rent.\nAnd so on. With each transaction the new money raises prices along the way. The closer you are to the issuer of the new currency, the more of the total arbitrage between the original price and the final higher price you receive.\nThis is why wealth inequality is accelerating in the Age of Central Banking at an exponential rate.\nAs the central banker pay off Congress, the banks, the lawyers, the media and everyone else with my new money first to ensure I can continue foisting the costs of my life off on the taxpayers.\nThe old system was simply debasing the coinage by cutting down the amount of gold or silver in the coins. The modern system is to issue new money units as debt against someone else’s labor, i.e. the taxpayers.\nBitcoin and the blockchain say nuts to all that. They say new money units should be divorced from human desires and their capacity for corruption. Let’s have math govern that and let the humans figure out how to earn wealth through the system itself. Tying Risk Down\nSovereign consumers are always looking for ways to grind out arbitrage by bidding as little as possible for what they buy. Enforcers of control are always looking to earn rent by keeping prices higher than consumers want.\nBankers love inflation, consumers love deflation.\nBitcoin, alongside gold, is the ultimate weapon against the rent-seekers because its supply is not governed by humans. This small difference changes everything. There is certainty as to what the supply of money will be tomorrow or next week.\nAnd as such demand for it can be more predictably forecast by market actors. There is no guess work as to what the central bankers are going to do at the next meeting. There are no gonzo gold deposits that could radically change the supply of it on the horizon.\nWhile market forces guide the hands of the central bankers and the gold miners to some extent, nothing is changing how many Bitcoins will be available tomorrow. Yes, there is loss due to attrition and small, uneconomical balances lying around in wallets all over the world. But, there is a known maximum of coins, governed by math, that removes the human element from money creation.\nAnd because of that eventually Bitcoin, or some other suitable cryptocurrency or basket thereof, will form the reserve asset pool against which all other assets are measured. Because that stability of supply and its growth will grind out opportunities to collect rent created by the uncertainty and unfairness of the current system.\nIt simply costs too much to regulate dollars, euros, etc. Those lowered costs will now be passed to consumers who retain ownership over the value of their money.\nBitcoin returns sovereignty back to the consumer, the rights-holder, which is exactly where it belongs. It distributes (in theory) the ownership of the transaction network and pays them to maintain it. Consumers are the ones who have money to convert into goods. They should be the sole arbiters of their money’s exchange rate, not a President, Board of Directors or Banker.\nIf the market needs more money in the short term it will create it. Banks can issue credit based on its Bitcoin balances. But, they will be constrained in how they do this because no Federal Reserve stands behind them ready to bail them out.\nSo, be good at risk assessment or be driven out of business.\nHard forks and other blockchains can create new cheaper currency units and keep the owners of the older network honest through competition and potentially better service, e.g. Bitcoin Cash, Zcash, Litecoin, etc. And So it Begins…\nAnd that’s why consumers will over time choose to do business in cryptocurrencies over debt-based ones. The value of their money is based on the operational excellence of the owners of the network not the needs of corrupt bankers and politicians.\nThe miners/witnesses/notaries update and improve it to meet consumers’ needs rather than sitting behind a wall of laws and dictating that inflation is too low and dumping a bunch of euros on the market, devaluing your wages and your savings.\nThe costs of paying the network operators will be regulated by the market far more efficiently than the current system. And those cost advantages will translate up and down the financial services industry to steal market share from traditional banks over time.\nThat arbitrage is what is fueling the growth of the cryptocurrency markets now. We’ll still see all the same things that happen today happen in a world governed by cryptocurrencies – bank runs, bad loans, too much or little credit, etc.\nBut all of those things will not be institutionalized and protected by laws. They will be isolated and far better contained as long as they are allowed to develop as companies free from government interference. The discipline of a crowded market will inspire innovation in risk management.\nAs we approach the moment in history when the confidence we have in central banks will be tested to the extreme, the timing of cryptocurrency adolescence couldn’t be better. When the monetary system seizes up and people look for new solutions the ‘cryptos’ will be there to keep things flowing.\nThose that are have cryptos in their portfolio of assets now are holding them as savings, hedging against this very risk. And in the process they are becoming their own central bank holding reserves to protect their wealth unwittingly ushering in the inevitable.\n* * *\nTo support more work like this and get access to exclusive commentary, stock picks and analysis tailored to your needs, join my more than 100 Patrons on Patreon and see if I have what it takes to help you navigate a world going slowly mad.

They should be the sole arbiters of their money’s exchange rate, not a President, Board of Directors or Banker.\nIf the market needs more money in the short term it will create it. Banks can issue credit based on its Bitcoin balances.

And those cost advantages will translate up and down the financial services industry to steal market share from traditional banks over time.\nThat arbitrage is what is fueling the growth of the cryptocurrency markets now.

It looks as if we will continue to go lower, and I suspect that rallies at this point will continue to respect the resistance at the $8000 level. I think eventually we will go to the $7000 and then possibly even $6000 after that. If we break down below the $6000, things get ugly rather quick. We have seen a bit of the range for some time, but I would point out that the highs are getting lower, almost certainly assigned of increasing bearish pressure, or perhaps in this case simple apathy. I think a lot of the hype around bitcoin has finally died, and a lot of the “hot money” has vacated. We are now seeing this market mature a bit, which means pricing is going to be much more realistic. I suspect the sellers return repeatedly. \\n\\n\n\\n\\n BTC\\/JPY \\n\\n\nBitcoin went back and forth against the Japanese yen during trading on Thursday, forming a relatively neutral candle. It looks as if we are trying to form some type of support in the general vicinity, but I think at this point rallies are to be sold. Unlike the BTC\\/USD pair, this market did not reach the highest of the overall consolidation which was much more well-defined. Because of this, I suspect that this market may struggle, and we could very well break down below the vital ¥700,000 level. I believe that ultimately this market will continue to be one that you can sell rallies, because quite frankly Bitcoin can’t get out of its own way. It’s not necessarily that we are melding down, I think very few people care. \\n\\n\n\\n\nOriginal Source DailyForex provides daily fundamental and technical analysis and signals for those looking to trade based on trends in the currency markets.

But, they will be constrained in how they do this because no Federal Reserve stands behind them ready to bail them out.\nSo, be good at risk assessment or be driven out of business.\nHard forks and other blockchains can create new cheaper currency units and keep the owners of the older network honest through competition and potentially better service, e.g. Bitcoin Cash, Zcash, Litecoin, etc. And So it Begins…\nAnd that’s why consumers will over time choose to do business in cryptocurrencies over debt-based ones. The value of their money is based on the operational excellence of the owners of the network not the needs of corrupt bankers and politicians.\nThe miners/witnesses/notaries update and improve it to meet consumers’ needs rather than sitting behind a wall of laws and dictating that inflation is too low and dumping a bunch of euros on the market, devaluing your wages and your savings.\nThe costs of paying the network operators will be regulated by the market far more efficiently than the current system. And those cost advantages will translate up and down the financial services industry to steal market share from traditional banks over time.\nThat arbitrage is what is fueling the growth of the cryptocurrency markets now. We’ll still see all the same things that happen today happen in a world governed by cryptocurrencies – bank runs, bad loans, too much or little credit, etc.\nBut all of those things will not be institutionalized and protected by laws. They will be isolated and far better contained as long as they are allowed to develop as companies free from government interference. The discipline of a crowded market will inspire innovation in risk management.\nAs we approach the moment in history when the confidence we have in central banks will be tested to the extreme, the timing of cryptocurrency adolescence couldn’t be better. When the monetary system seizes up and people look for new solutions the ‘cryptos’ will be there to keep things flowing.\nThose that are have cryptos in their portfolio of assets now are holding them as savings, hedging against this very risk. And in the process they are becoming their own central bank holding reserves to protect their wealth unwittingly ushering in the inevitable.\n* * *\nTo support more work like this and get access to exclusive commentary, stock picks and analysis tailored to your needs, join my more than 100 Patrons on Patreon and see if I have what it takes to help you navigate a world going slowly mad.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.patreon.com/goldgoatsnguns", "https://tomluongo.me/2018/05/22/the-necessity-of-bitcoin-as-reserve-asset/", "https://mises.org/library/economics-real-people"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom luongo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernanke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ludwig von mises", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenspan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "zerohedge", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T02:22:42.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b6b5af390712ad7c7804c881ee828891467d18c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jNjYEZ.W3oa8rNRlBty8krnKV__KQmmrMnv1.FSI7ZiMIzqj2tk.nyw.mfWFAkattWpSc1hotAKKik4Cv.hjW9RMvm44jDlwiZWQyT.YvmOTISuPWxqgjllxWoiZE7Rkfhnz1ZoL8.s4-", "site_full": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "http://TheBitcoinNews.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "The Bitcoin News – Leading Bitcoin News and Cryptocurrency News", "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano, Stellar, TRON: Price Analysis, May 25", "title_full": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano, Stellar, TRON: Price Analysis, May 25", "published": "2018-05-26T01:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/05d5a0b59477063561185e1e74fd530e.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b6b5af390712ad7c7804c881ee828891467d18c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jNjYEZ.W3oa8rNRlBty8krnKV__KQmmrMnv1.FSI7ZiMIzqj2tk.nyw.mfWFAkattWpSc1hotAKKik4Cv.hjW9RMvm44jDlwiZWQyT.YvmOTISuPWxqgjllxWoiZE7Rkfhnz1ZoL8.s4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cointelegraph", "published": "2018-05-26T01:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano, Stellar, TRON: Price Analysis, May 25", "text": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano, Stellar, TRON: Price Analysis, May 25 May 26, 2018 123 The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nLarger players always have an unfair advantage over the retail traders as they have the money and the resources to manipulate prices. Many crypto investors have been complaining against the manipulation in the markets, which hurts small investors. If the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) can identify and nail the culprits , it will immensely benefit the cryptocurrencies in the long-term. Many other traders also agree that these crackdowns will have positive influence on the markets. A study by Weiss Ratings showcases that if the US Federal Reserve dilutes the “Volcker Rule”– which restricts the banks from indulging in risky assets to earn profits – Americans are likely to turn to cryptocurrencies. Considering the flow of positive news in cryptos, we have been bullish for a while but are waiting for the opportune time to buy. Due to the highly volatile nature of digital currencies, we want to identify our risk before buying. Let’s see if we get some low-risk buy setups today? BTC/USD Bitcoin is sliding towards its lower target objective of $7,000. The attempt by the bulls to pull back on May 24 could not find buyers at higher levels, and prices have turned down once again. Currently, the digital currency is trying to hold the trendline support. If successful, a relief rally to $9,000 is probable. If the trendline breaks, the next major support zone is between $6,075.04-$7,000, which will be strongly defended by the bulls. Due to the strong support just beneath the trendline, we are disregarding the formation of a symmetrical triangle. Any sharp decline below $7,000 can offer the traders a good buying opportunity for the long-term. If purchased, the position should be protected with a stop below the February 06 lows of $6,075.04 because if this level breaks, we may see some panic selling. Traders should avoid buying when the BTC/USD pair is plummeting. The purchase should be made when it shows signs of stabilizing in the 4-hourly chart. We are suggesting a buy because we believe that the virtual currency will remain range bound between $6,075.04-$12,12172.43. ETH/USD Ethereum fell to the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the recent rally on May 24. The bulls attempted a rebound from this level, but it fizzled out at the 50-day SMA. If the bears break below the intraday low of May 24, a decline to $464 will be on the cards. If the bulls hold the supports, the ETH/USD pair can rally to the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern, which also coincides with the resistance line of the descending channel. Aggressive traders can attempt this trade, but the risk-averse traders should wait until a new buy setup forms. XRP/USD Ripple is taking support at the bottom of the range at $0.56. On May 24, it attempted to bounce off the supports but met with selling pressure at higher levels. Currently, the XRP/USD pair is again retracing the previous day’s pullback. If the $0.56 level breaks down, a fall to $0.45 is likely. If the support holds, aggressive traders can take a long position above $0.65 with a stop just below the recent lows. This is a very risky trade because the moving averages will offer a stiff resistance on any rally. Hence, the trade should be attempted only with about 30 percent of the usual position size. A fall to the bottom of the range should be purchased when it shows signs of a rebound, hence, we believe that this trade can be attempted if the buy levels are reached. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash has completed a breakdown from a head and shoulders pattern that has a lower pattern target of $650. However, for the past two days, the bulls are trying to provide support at the $1,000 levels. If this level holds, the digital currency can pull back to the $1,200 levels, which is a major hurdle as both the moving averages are located close to this level. If the BCH/USD pair breaks below $950, it should slide to $750, which is the next minor support. We suggest waiting for the decline to end and a new setup to form before initiating any long positions. EOS/USD EOS is trying to rebound from the $10 levels but is facing stiff resistance at the top trendline of the descending channel and the 50-day SMA. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of these overhead resistances, long positions can be initiated. Traders can wait for the price to scale above the moving averages and the recent swing high of $14.19 on May 20. Positions can be initiated above $14.25 with a suitable stop loss. The target objective of this trade is a rally to $18.67. On the other hand, if the bears force a breakdown below $10, the EOS/USD pair can sink to $7.8 and below that to $5.961. Long positions should not be attempted inside the channel. LTC/USD Litecoin has formed a bearish descending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakdown and close (UTC) below $107. This level has not been breached since December 09 of last year. Therefore, we consider this to be strong support. On May 24, the bulls tried to pull back from the immediate support of $115 but could not break above the overhead resistance of $127. Below $115 the LTC/USD pair will slip to $107. The first sign of strength will be when prices sustain above $127. Until then, it is best to take no action. ADA/USD Cardano is looking weak because the pullback attempt from the $0.19 support level on May 24 did not sustain the higher levels. If this support level breaks, a fall to $0.13 is likely. If the price slides to $0.13 and holds, it will confirm the formation of a large range, which can be traded by buying on a rebound from the lows and selling close to the upper end of the range. A break above the descending channel will be the first sign of a probable change in trend. Currently, the ADA/USD pair is falling. We shall wait for prices to stabilize and turn around before proposing any buys. XLM/USD For the past few days, we have been watching a probable head and shoulders top in Stellar . However, after the previous two days of price action and realigning the trendlines, we find a falling wedge pattern developing. This is a bullish setup that will complete on a break out of the upper resistance line. As traders, we should be quick to identify any new setup and change our opinion according to the charts. Considering the overall negativity, we suggest waiting for the price to break out and close (UTC) above the 20-day EMA before buying. The minimum price target is $0.44, which is close to the overhead resistance of $0.47766719. Traders should keep a close stop loss, preferably below the recent lows because if the break out fails to find buyers at higher levels, the digital currency can slump to $0.184 levels. If the XLM/USD pair moves contrary to our expectation and breaks down, instead of breaking out, traders should not initiate long positions. They should remain on the sidelines until a new buy setup forms. TRX/USD The bulls are trying to hold the 50-day SMA on TRON while the bears are defending the 20-day EMA. The price has been stuck between these two moving averages for the past two days. We believe that the zone between $0.0565 and the 50-day SMA will act as strong support. However, we want to see buying emerge at the critical support levels before recommending a long position because if the support zone breaks, the TRX/USD pair can plunge to $0.04 levels. On the upside, the small downtrend line may act as a resistance. The digital currency might remain range-bound for a few more days before making a decisive move.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

The executive board member of the German company which provides services for derivative markets and equity trading, in an event on Wednesday, talked about adopting cryptocurrency.\nCurrently, there are a lot of financial institutions taking a dip into cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, with benefits like cheaper trade fees and peer to peer network. This is due to the total and obsolete emergence of Bitcoin in people’s lives and economic trades companies are adopting the technology.\nAccording to the market report the company has been battling with other derivative companies such as Cboe Global Markets Inc. and CME Group Inc. He believes that there have not been much of regulatory effects from the regional authorities as the market is nascent.\nThe event was held in London which was organized by the Association for Financial Markets in Europe.\nJeffrey Tessler during the event says:\n“Before we move towards the Bitcoin market, we want to make sure we understand the underlying transaction which isn’t the easiest thing to do.”\nHe also said that the company is working with the cryptocurrency.\nLater in the event, he added that:\n“We want to understand the volatility and make sure clients are in line and make sure regulators are in line.”\nGarisson a Redittor says:\n“Crank up and cramped up banks are the way to be behind the crypto-game. The involvement of institutions is a bad sign as more regulatory standards will be I posed…making it further non-decentralized.”\nSara a Redittor says:\n“I believe that derivative and equities are dropping into the cryptocurrency and blockchain game because of the emergence of this new industry. Goldman has to lead the way for the stock market to follow now everyone is gonna adopt the new technology of crypto. I believe that the ones who reject to evolve will have a major market collapse.”\nWesley Willam Cryptocurrency enthusiast tweeted:\n“Bitcoin is gonna pop like a big bubble as it is observed that the market is not volatile and is falling at the steep rate.

This hard fork of Bitcoin had some high ambitions at first. Several months down the line, it seems things look a lot worse for wear. With one individual controlling most of the network, the ecosystem is facing a serious threat. Solving this matter has proven to be rather difficult. \\n The Bitcoin Gold Network Issues \\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, several key issues can affect any network. The so-called 51% attack is perhaps one of the worst scenarios for developers to deal with. It effectively means someone controls the majority of the blockchain’s processing power. As such, transactions, payments, and day-to-day operations are all severely affected. \\n\nIn the case of Bitcoin Gold, the person controlling the network has nefarious intentions. Being able to tamper with transactions can cause all sorts of problems. This is especially true for mining pools, exchanges, and wallet providers dealing with Bitcoin Gold. So far, it remains unclear how much damage has been done in the process. \\n\nThe end result is how all BTG users are at risk during this time. Any transaction broadcast over the network can be tampered with. In the worst case, the transfer will not even be accepted by the network. This would immediately make it impossible to sue Bitcoin Gold, potentially crashing the price in the process. Whether or not that is the objective of the assailant(s), remains unclear at this time. \\n Not The First Major Problem \\n\nAlthough this recent issue is of grave concern, it is not the only one. Ever since the release of BTG, there have been numerous concerns and technical issues. Double-spending attacks go back almost a full week, and things are not looking up. In the past, there have been issues with the mining difficult adjustments as well. Despite hard forking Bitcoin, BTG has not inherited the robustness of Bitcoin in this regard. \\n\nFor the time being, exchanges need to be very careful. Any platform accepting Bitcoin Gold deposits without additional verification will be targeted by these criminals in the coming days. Ensuring all deposits are accounted for and legitimate is the only course of action. Unfortunately, it may also lead to trading platform suspending BTG trading until further notice. \\n\nIt is not the first time smaller cryptocurrencies are affected by such attacks. Verge has been dealing with multiple attacks in recent months. Monacoin and Electroneum have seen their fair share of issues as well. Bitcoin and Ethereum are unlikely to suffer from issues like these anytime soon. Their networks have a lot more mining support, making it nearly impossible for one entity to control the majority of processing power. \\n\n \\n Image from Shutterstock \\n\nThe post Bitcoin Gold Network Still Suffering Over a Week After Attack ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T17:25:18.051+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ba0cfc19c2d67ec86682e6f9b4ebd02ce21e9866", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYD0w5FwnR0FhxUmhYtdcE0H", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp; Finance - 4chan", "title": "Hey biz, It's me again.

SegWit Adoption and Importance of Xapo\nEarlier this month, Tom Metcalf at Bloomberg reported that Xapo’s cold wallet stored in its underground bunkers in Switzerland oversees more than $10 billion worth of bitcoin, an amount that is larger than 5,670 banks in the US. Xapo manages more deposits than 98 percent of the banks in the US.\nRyan Radloff, the founder of CoinShares, an investment company that has more than $500 million worth of bitcoin stored in Xapo’s cold wallet, stated that the vast majority of large-scale investors that do not hold or manage their own private keys have their bitcoin stored in Xapo’s vaults.\n“Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,” said Radloff.\nBillionaire investor and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman echoed a similar sentiment as Radloff and stated that Xapo is the first and one of the very few successful companies to have commercialized custodial and security functions in the cryptocurrency industry.\n“They’re the first folks who recognized custodial and security functions would be key. He made the pitch in the morning and in the afternoon I called him with an offer,” said Hoffman, who invested more than $20 million in Xapo in 2014. Xapo offers services for retail bitcoin users, but it has become most famous for its institutional-grade cold storage vaults.\nWhile Coinbase and Blockchain have significant influence over the consumer market and individual investors, Xapo has dominance over the institutional market within the cryptocurrency sector, directly dealing with institutional investors and retail traders.\nLarge-scale investors who have their funds in cryptocurrency stored in Xapo’s vaults do not tend to move small amounts of bitcoin on a regular basis. Because it takes around 24 hours for Xapo to transfer bitcoin stored in its vault to the hot wallet of users and the process requires a higher fee than normal bitcoin transactions, investors prefer to move large sums of bitcoin in and out of Xapo’s vaults.\nBy eliminating unnecessary transactional data and moving additional information outside of the transactional data, SegWit optimizes transactions and decreases the amount of fees users are required to pay to miners to have their transactions broadcasted to the bitcoin blockchain network.\nXapo’s integration of SegWit will enable large sums of bitcoin to be processed on the bitcoin blockchain network as SegWit-enabled transactions, drastically decreasing costs and burden on the main blockchain network. Bitcoin’s Scalability\nEthereum and other smart contract-based blockchain networks that are required to process larger chunks of data in comparison to bitcoin are developing innovative solutions like sharding and plasma that divide the blockchain network into chunks and allow for a more efficient method of information processing.\nThe bitcoin blockchain network is currently experimenting with Lightning Network as the second-layer blockchain solution to process smaller transactions in a larger capacity and SegWit as a scaling solution for its first or base layer. The adoption of SegWit as a scaling solution by widely utilized cryptocurrency platforms like Xapo and Blockchain will enable SegWit to evolve into a technology that transforms bitcoin from a store of value to a scalable currency.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/bunkers-for-the-wealthy-are-said-to-hoard-10-billion-of-bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ted rogers", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "radloff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom metcalf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan radloff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reid hoffman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin core", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linkedin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T07:34:19.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ac283a31d0feb9e950b8843770d5a4b880aab390", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWAkegs2rOAr0jIp4l.5u8Q-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=240.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Tokens (Altcoins)", "title": "🔥🚀🚀[ANN][Pre-ICO] Bitcoin Crown - Cryptocurrency for online game lovers🔥🚀🚀", "title_full": "🔥🚀🚀[ANN][Pre-ICO] Bitcoin Crown - Cryptocurrency for online game lovers🔥🚀🚀", "published": "2018-05-26T01:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.085, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ac283a31d0feb9e950b8843770d5a4b880aab390", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWAkegs2rOAr0jIp4l.5u8Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kejodak", "published": "2018-05-26T01:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "🔥🚀🚀[ANN][Pre-ICO] Bitcoin Crown - Cryptocurrency for online game lovers🔥🚀🚀", "text": "Hi, my brothers everywhere.

We have heard from central banks in Japan, South Korea, India, The United Kingdom, The United States, Zimbabwe, Norway and Thailand to name but a few. This makes one thing clear, cryptocurrency is spreading across the world, and banks are starting to think about it. By Thomas Ramsay\nEach bank has had a slightly different idea with regards to cryptocurrencies, I suppose this lends itself to the versatile nature of how cryptocurrencies may be perceived. This latest statement from The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) provides an interesting perspective to say the least.\nAccording to multiple reports, the SARB are refusing to refer to cryptocurrencies as currency, stating that they shall be referred to as cyber-tokens, due to their lack of currency-like features. Essentially, the SARB do no believe that cryptocurrencies are steady enough to be referred to as currencies, so are therefore taking a new approach towards speaking about the industry. Considering many cryptocurrencies are used as widely accepted forms of currency worldwide, I’m not sure what the SARB wish to gain from this, as I have said though, its an interesting perspective to take.\nAccording to CCN, Deputy Governor Francois Groepe has said:\n“We don’t use the term ‘cryptocurrency’ because it doesn’t meet the requirements of money in the economic sense of the stable means of exchange, a unit of measure and a stable unit of value…We prefer to use the world ‘cyber-token’.”\nOverall, this does not help to clarify the South African stance on cryptocurrencies, rather it just sticks a bit of a spanner in the works. Are they for cryptocurrencies, or cyber-tokens… or are they against them?\nSouth African authorities have recently established a taskforce which will continue to investigate cryptocurrencies, perhaps as a result of this we expect to hear an official statement from this authority sooner, rather than later, to ease off any confusion the SARB’s statement may have caused.

We have heard from central banks in Japan, South Korea, India, The United Kingdom, The United States, Zimbabwe, Norway and Thailand to name but a few. This makes one thing clear, cryptocurrency is spreading across the world, and banks are starting to think about it.\nEach bank has had a slightly different idea with regards to cryptocurrencies, I suppose this lends itself to the versatile nature of how cryptocurrencies may be perceived. This latest statement from The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) provides an interesting perspective to say the least.\nAccording to multiple reports, the SARB are refusing to refer to cryptocurrencies as currency, stating that they shall be referred to as cyber-tokens, due to their lack of currency-like features. Essentially, the SARB do no believe that cryptocurrencies are steady enough to be referred to as currencies, so are therefore taking a new approach towards speaking about the industry. Considering many cryptocurrencies are used as widely accepted forms of currency worldwide, I’m not sure what the SARB wish to gain from this, as I have said though, its an interesting perspective to take.\nAccording to CCN, Deputy Governor Francois Groepe has said:\n“We don’t use the term ‘cryptocurrency’ because it doesn’t meet the requirements of money in the economic sense of the stable means of exchange, a unit of measure and a stable unit of value…We prefer to use the world ‘cyber-token’.”\nOverall, this does not help to clarify the South African stance on cryptocurrencies, rather it just sticks a bit of a spanner in the works. Are they for cryptocurrencies, or cyber-tokens… or are they against them?\nSouth African authorities have recently established a taskforce which will continue to investigate cryptocurrencies, perhaps as a result of this we expect to hear an official statement from this authority sooner, rather than later, to ease off any confusion the SARB’s statement may have caused. According to CCN:\n“At the fundamental core, central banks represent the very basis of a traditional financial system that cryptocurrencies are meant to disrupt. No surprise then that most central banks and their officials offer a sceptical take with many, like the SARB, refusing to classify cryptocurrencies as money.”\nWhat now for South Africa?\nWe expect regulation to come into play soon enough, with a taskforce working hard on their research, and the central bank seemingly resistant to the idea of cryptocurrencies, harsh and strict regulations will come as no surprise.

Reddit users have lamented the difficulty of finding the bitcoin, with one commenting, \"I'm better equipped to sell a kidney for $9k.\" Happy hunting.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ccn.com/theres-1-bitcoin-hidden-in-this-puzzle-and-whoever-solves-it-wins/", "http://www.szgs.gov.cn/art/2018/5/25/art_74_59352.html", "https://www.coindesk.com/bank-of-spain-governor-cryptocurrencies-pose-more-risks-than-benefits/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniels", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "thestreet bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T02:23:05.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "444d127146db8ed8bb603d08e4b5b9c4fcb19280", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54G3C9DMPgG4RWPD6hf6fUSCnugkqWvgeXVEzRzpkUJR4af5nZElsqGoXl.xOXTq0EkgQOXKXoECUR3UwJL_8cdO0bVVnTxDhOo2njaw9YB73im6JwFV2Badrs.Kb8iPc3A--", "site_full": "bitcoinist.com", "site": "bitcoinist.com", "site_section": "http://www.xbt.money/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "XBT.MONEY", "title": "Bitcoin as a Store of Value Could be Worth $40K Within the Next Decade, Says Matt Hougan", "title_full": "Bitcoin as a Store of Value Could be Worth $40K Within the Next Decade, Says Matt Hougan", "published": "2018-05-26T01:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.xbt.money/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/matt-hougan.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "444d127146db8ed8bb603d08e4b5b9c4fcb19280", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54G3C9DMPgG4RWPD6hf6fUSCnugkqWvgeXVEzRzpkUJR4af5nZElsqGoXl.xOXTq0EkgQOXKXoECUR3UwJL_8cdO0bVVnTxDhOo2njaw9YB73im6JwFV2Badrs.Kb8iPc3A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "xbt.money", "published": "2018-05-26T01:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin as a Store of Value Could be Worth $40K Within the Next Decade, Says Matt Hougan", "text": "Bitcoin as a Store of Value Could be Worth $40K Within the Next Decade, Says Matt Hougan Osato Avan-Nomayo · May 25, 2018 · 9:00 pm · Views: 2,488 News teaser\nMatt Hougan of Bitwise Asset Management believes that the price of Bitcoin could increase by 500 percent in the next ten years. Hougan hinges his prediction on the cryptocurrency becoming an actual store of value and the blockchain permeating several facets of human life. Is Bitcoin a Store of Value?\nFinding a consensus on any argument related to Bitcoin is almost a futile effort at this point. There’s the bubble argument , the economic definition argument, and of course, the store of value argument. Matt Hougan, in a recent op-ed for Forbes , examines the store of value debate for Bitcoin, drawing some interesting parallels with gold.\nRight from inception, the virtual currency has been compared with gold. Some proponents are even in the habit of calling the crypto “ digital gold .” Critics, however, dispute this idea, saying that the cryptocurrency cannot be compared to gold because it is highly volatile and, as such, cannot be a store of value.\nOne of the most basic definitions of a store of value is an asset that is both tradable and can be stored for future use. By this definition, a store of value must maintain some stability over a reasonable period. Bitcoin is a volatile asset, no arguments there. However, is the volatility exhibited by the number one crypto a misnomer in the finance world? It turns out the answer is no, and Hougan provides hard evidence. A Little Bit of History Featuring the Post-1971 Gold Market\nToday, gold is not only solid based on its physical form, but as an asset, it maintains some level of price rigidity. However, it wasn’t always so. In 1971, U.S. President Richard Nixon dropped the gold standard for the USD. The price of gold and the value of the dollar was no longer tethered together. What happened next? Well, the table below gives an idea of the wild volatility in prices of gold in the decade following 1971.\nToday’s crypto critics would be bellowing that gold isn’t a store of value if they examined these figures. However, today, it is universally accepted that the precious metal is indeed a store of value. So, what has changed? The answer isn’t utility as some might point out. Gold has some industrial application use cases but that it is not enough to justify its current price. According to Hougan:\n[Gold] is worth $1,300 per ounce because people are willing to pay $1300 per ounce for it as a store of wealth. Bitcoin Mirrors Post-1971 Gold\nBitcoin is less than a decade old, which means it isn’t yet a fully formed asset. Hougan believes that expecting the cryptocurrency to behave like a fully matured asset is an argument that lacks economic merit. According to the cryptoanalyst, Bitcoin is passing through the two-stage process of rapid appreciation and declining volatility over time.\n2017 saw a parabolic rise in prices that seem to have plateaued in 2018. The Bitcoin volatility, while still considerably high, is declining over time. This pattern exhibited by the number one crypto bears striking similarities to gold after 1971. Speculative Investment Will Give Way to Real World Use\nIf Bitcoin follows the pattern set by gold, then it is well on its way to establishing itself as a store of value . Right now, the crypto is held as a speculative investment, but within the next decade, as blockchain utility increases, Bitcoin will become an even more significant part of global finance. The current market capitalization for the virtual currency is $130 billion , which is approximately two percent of the $7.5 trillion gold market cap.\nIn ten years, Bitcoin could comfortably hold 10 percent of the value of gold, which would mean a conservative price estimate of $40,000. A lot of this depends on how quickly real-world utility applications can be implemented for the cryptocurrency and the assumption that it continues on a similar trajectory to gold.\nDo you agree with the argument that Bitcoin is like gold, and as such, a store of value? Will an increase in real-world utility drive the price of Bitcoin higher?

A request for comment by Reuters sent to an email address listed on the website as belonging to Twain received no response.\n“Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by agents of BTC Global,” the police said in a statement.\n“Some of the investors got paid in terms of the agreement. However, the payments suddenly stopped.”\nLocal technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than $50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global.\n“This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they’ve lost money,” police investigator Yolisa Matakata said.\nThe investigation follows a case this week where kidnappers demanded a ransom in bitcoin of nearly $120,000 to release a South African teenage boy.\nOn Thursday South Africa’s central bank said it was in the process of determining whether cryptocurrencies complied with its financial surveillance and exchange control regulations.

Ülkede enflasyonun oranı yüzde 16.000e ulaşmış durumda. Bütünüyle bir kaos ve kargaşa ortamı bulunuyor.\nAçlıkla savaşan Venezuela halkı, Bolivarın olağanüstü değer kaybı sonrası kripto paraları kullanmaya başladı. Öte yandan halktan bazıları, çareyi kripto para madenciliği yapmakta buldu.\nBloombergde yer alan bir haberde, Caracastaki neredeyse her evde kripto para madenciliği yapıldığı öne sürülüyor.\nKara borsada 900.000 Bolivar 90 cent ediyor. Bu parayla da yalnızca bir kafede pasta yiyebiliyor, kahve ya da meyve suyu içebiliyorsunuz. Bununla birlikte halk, yaklaşık 300.000 Bolivar ile elektrik, su, gaz, internet ve telefon faturalarının tamamını ödeyebiliyor. Yani sadece 30 cent ya da 1.3 TLye.\nHal böyle olunca elektrik neredeyse ücretsiz. Bazıları kripto para madenciliği yapan cihazlara yatırım yaparak aylık 1000 dolar gibi Venezuela koşullarında oldukça iyi bir miktar kazanabiliyorlar. Bazılarıysa ekipmanın el verdiği kadarıyla günde 6 dolar kazanıyor.

SegWit Adoption and Importance of Xapo\nEarlier this month, Tom Metcalf at Bloomberg reported that Xapo’s cold wallet stored in its underground bunkers in Switzerland oversees more than $10 billion worth of bitcoin, an amount that is larger than 5,670 banks in the US. Xapo manages more deposits than 98 percent of the banks in the US.\nRyan Radloff, the founder of CoinShares , an investment company that has more than $500 million worth of bitcoin stored in Xapo’s cold wallet, stated that the vast majority of large-scale investors that do not hold or manage their own private keys have their bitcoin stored in Xapo’s vaults.\n“Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,” said Radloff.\nBillionaire investor and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman echoed a similar sentiment as Radloff and stated that Xapo is the first and one of the very few successful companies to have commercialized custodial and security functions in the cryptocurrency industry.\n“They’re the first folks who recognized custodial and security functions would be key. He made the pitch in the morning and in the afternoon I called him with an offer,” said Hoffman, who invested more than $20 million in Xapo in 2014. Xapo offers services for retail bitcoin users, but it has become most famous for its institutional-grade cold storage vaults.\nWhile Coinbase and Blockchain have significant influence over the consumer market and individual investors, Xapo has dominance over the institutional market within the cryptocurrency sector, directly dealing with institutional investors and retail traders.\nLarge-scale investors who have their funds in cryptocurrency stored in Xapo’s vaults do not tend to move small amounts of bitcoin on a regular basis. Because it takes around 24 hours for Xapo to transfer bitcoin stored in its vault to the hot wallet of users and the process requires a higher fee than normal bitcoin transactions, investors prefer to move large sums of bitcoin in and out of Xapo’s vaults.\nBy eliminating unnecessary transactional data and moving additional information outside of the transactional data, SegWit optimizes transactions and decreases the amount of fees users are required to pay to miners to have their transactions broadcasted to the bitcoin blockchain network.\nXapo’s integration of SegWit will enable large sums of bitcoin to be processed on the bitcoin blockchain network as SegWit-enabled transactions, drastically decreasing costs and burden on the main blockchain network. Bitcoin’s Scalability\nEthereum and other smart contract-based blockchain networks that are required to process larger chunks of data in comparison to bitcoin are developing innovative solutions like sharding and plasma that divide the blockchain network into chunks and allow for a more efficient method of information processing.\nThe bitcoin blockchain network is currently experimenting with Lightning Network as the second-layer blockchain solution to process smaller transactions in a larger capacity and SegWit as a scaling solution for its first or base layer.\nThe adoption of SegWit as a scaling solution by widely utilized cryptocurrency platforms like Xapo and Blockchain will enable SegWit to evolve into a technology that transforms bitcoin from a store of value to a scalable currency.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/bunkers-for-the-wealthy-are-said-to-hoard-10-billion-of-bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ted rogers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "radloff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom metcalf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan radloff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reid hoffman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin core", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linkedin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T01:42:24.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0493b125ef5791c7f6992ae690a038b6b989ecbe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQlUAzC69kbPW4NLfnk9bdk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "bad news hit bitcoin, will bitcoin die?", "title_full": "bad news hit bitcoin, will bitcoin die?", "published": "2018-05-26T00:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.017, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0493b125ef5791c7f6992ae690a038b6b989ecbe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQlUAzC69kbPW4NLfnk9bdk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kasurnya", "published": "2018-05-26T00:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "bad news hit bitcoin, will bitcoin die?", "text": "If bitcoin falls and dies then this will affect the value of altcoin, altcoin will go down and it will be difficult for them to stabilize the price to bounce back.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T21:24:32.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5b5e2e4b371b07b9ea4dacd05f0f132d699b6480", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbcPwyPlglJxqDJzS0wiu5E-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin price effect on Altcoin", "title_full": "Bitcoin price effect on Altcoin", "published": "2018-05-26T00:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.01, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5b5e2e4b371b07b9ea4dacd05f0f132d699b6480", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbcPwyPlglJxqDJzS0wiu5E-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "NoSkyLimit", "published": "2018-05-26T00:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin price effect on Altcoin", "text": "Hi.

It is the only form of money which can reliably be sent across the world without having to deal with currency conversions or country borders. Argentina’s Banco Masventas has acknowledged this, as the institution now relies on Bitcoin to settle cross-border transactions.\nThere is a good reason why banks have opposed Bitcoin for many years. This form of money is capable of doing something that’s currently impossible to do using the traditional banking system. More specifically, Bitcoin and similar currencies are capable of sending value across borders without any real restrictions, whereas fiat currencies are not.\nEven so, banks around the world are looking for ways to provide this functionality. To that end, innovative features will need to be experimented with. In the case of Argentine bank Banco Masventas, the focus lies on using Bitcoin as a way to complete cross-border payments. That is rather intriguing, as it is the first time that a bank has acknowledged the potential of cryptocurrencies in this regard.\nThis change, which came into effect Monday, was made possible through a partnership with Bitex, a startup focusing on bringing cryptocurrency services to Latin America. This development is interesting for many reasons, including the fact that this solution will compete with the likes of Swift.\nConsidering that consumers have showed increased interest in mobile payment solutions in recent years, incorporating cryptocurrencies makes a lot of sense. It is also a smart move by Banco Masventas, as the company wants to lower its costs and expand its presence in the market. With Bitex on board as a strategic partner, that should be doable in the long run.\nFor customers of Banco Masventas, very little will change on paper. They will go through the same process of sending cross-border transactions, but the service will work very differently behind the scenes. Bitex will conduct cross-border transactions for the bank with Bitcoin, speeding up the process and reducing overhead costs in the process.\nGiven Argentina’s struggles with inflation and financial hardship, embracing cryptocurrencies is of the utmost importance. It is one of the few solutions which can make a positive impact on the country’s financial system. Even so, embracing the likes of Bitcoin for this purpose remains a big risk, as cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile.\nMt.

Justice has officially launched an investigation into the price manipulation of Bitcoin and Ethereum. It was all good just a week ago....May 24, 2018 -- ADVFN Crypto NewsWire -- It just might finally be true that the “Wild West” of Crypto is coming to an end. Bloomberg, Coin Telegraph, as well as other news outlets, reported today that the U.S. Department of Justice has officially launched an investigation into the price manipulation of Bitcoin and Ethereum.Many of us might be saying that it’s been a long time coming. It’s true that the only ones who should be afraid are those who have been skirting the rules including people who have been joining “Pump and Dump” groups on Telegram and other apps like Discord.The first outlet to break the news about the investigation was Bloomberg, which cited four specific critics who chose to remain nameless, though they made sure to state that they believe that skirting the law is a normal state of the Crypto market.It should be made clear that the investigation is meant to be wider reaching than simply looking into “Pump and Dump” groups. Reports state that it will look into just about any activities that could affect market prices, in theory All those Bitconnect scammers going down too.

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but manipulating an unregulated market is not illegal. That's the whole unregulated bit, right?I'm for regulations in the market, but what's the point of an investigation if there were no regulations to break?

Anonymous Coward Re: U.S. Department of Justice has officially launched an investigation into the price manipulation of Bitcoin and Ethereum. I used to pretend when I was young too Lily so sweet and fair User ID: 76583620 It was all good just a week ago....May 24, 2018 -- ADVFN Crypto NewsWire -- It just might finally be true that the “Wild West” of Crypto is coming to an end. Bloomberg, Coin Telegraph, as well as other news outlets, reported today that the U.S. Department of Justice has officially launched an investigation into the price manipulation of Bitcoin and Ethereum.Many of us might be saying that it’s been a long time coming. It’s true that the only ones who should be afraid are those who have been skirting the rules including people who have been joining “Pump and Dump” groups on Telegram and other apps like Discord.The first outlet to break the news about the investigation was Bloomberg, which cited four specific critics who chose to remain nameless, though they made sure to state that they believe that skirting the law is a normal state of the Crypto market.It should be made clear that the investigation is meant to be wider reaching than simply looking into “Pump and Dump” groups. Reports state that it will look into just about any activities that could affect market prices, in theory [", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T19:17:23.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "384d1aa2b7c19479ada06e96d349824ddec9f82d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFdUjJ_gRyW5pV0GqlRMykZcA3slxRa4YwnDXcRIRcv4VkJULYtkH0ex2lz0W0UNXS5oYDH3ry9un", "site_full": "www.youbrandinc.com", "site": "youbrandinc.com", "site_section": "http://www.youbrandinc.com/feed", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "You Brand, Inc.", "title": "Bitcoin Scammers Are Demanding Ransom for Lost Dogs", "title_full": "Bitcoin Scammers Are Demanding Ransom for Lost Dogs", "published": "2018-05-26T00:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.youbrandinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/basset-hounds-1024x683.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "384d1aa2b7c19479ada06e96d349824ddec9f82d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFdUjJ_gRyW5pV0GqlRMykZcA3slxRa4YwnDXcRIRcv4VkJULYtkH0ex2lz0W0UNXS5oYDH3ry9un", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Scanlon", "published": "2018-05-26T00:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Scammers Are Demanding Ransom for Lost Dogs", "text": "Bitcoin Scammers Are Demanding Ransom for Lost Dogs by 0\nOnline scams demanding bitcoin currency are far from unusual, but in a new stunt, scammers are preying upon the devoted owners of lost dogs in North Carolina. On Sunday, Patricia Howell’s basset hound, Happy, went missing in Granville county.\nShe immediately posted her phone number to Facebook, as well as on pet finder site, Pawboost. Soon after, Howell received a threatening text message demanding $600 worth of bitcoin in exchange for the safe return of the lost dog — only one problem, Happy was already home.\nThe bitcoin scammer, who told Howell he was using a burner phone to avoid identification, claimed to have the lost basset hound. Howell would need to send the bitcoin ransom within five days, otherwise they would “sell it or kill it or whatever.” “I knew it was a scam because I had Happy, but it was heartless and cold and it was so mean-spirited,” Howell told CBS 17.\nHowell filed a report with Granville County Sheriff’s Office for investigation. While this was the first reported case of this particular scam he’d personally encountered, the sheriff told CBS 17 news that he was familiar with similar bitcoin scams around the country.\nHowell and Happy weren’t the only ones in North Carolina to encounter the lost dog bitcoin scam. Fuquay-Varina county resident Raymond Brunet and his two lost dogs were also targeted by a similar scam.

Scott, CEO of Outlier Solutions , moderated a panel of experts that spoke about the energy issue as part of a discussion on the topic of proof of work (PoW) vs. proof of stake (PoS).\nScott told Bitcoin Magazine that there was a lot of discussion at the conference about the new energy report in part due to the attention it's currently receiving in the press.\n\"This is an area where there is a spectacular amount of FUD [fear, uncertainty and doubt],\" she noted. \"This is in part because it's a nuanced issue that can't be summed up in simple statements about net energy consumption.\n\"I think that part of the reason that Bitcoin has been a 'target' in this respect is that there are relatively straightforward calculations in terms of power consumption in conjunction with the underlying value not being well understood or widely accepted. For instance, few people question the utility costs of a bank or ATM, and the energy consumption cannot be calculated in a straightforward way,\" she added.\nScott Howard, CEO and co-founder of Toronto-based ePIC Blockchain Technologies , told the conference audience what many there were already saying: that the energy consumption issue is \"fake news\" and has been oversimplified to suit Bitcoin opponents.\nHigh Energy and Environmental Costs of Traditional Fiat and Banking Traditional banking and fiat creation have their own high energy costs, noted a number of conference panelists, including Alex Petrov, CIO of Bitfury ; Jan Čapek, CEO of Slush Pool ; Samson Mow, CSO of Blockstream ; and Howard.\nThey talked about the high infrastructure costs, in terms of both energy and the environment, associated with traditional banking systems, including ATMs, security and servers.\n\"There are 3.6 million ATMs deployed in the U.S. Each of them are using 7 to 800 watts just in standby mode,\" said Petrov. \"This alone generates huge numbers of electricity usage, slightly higher than the Bitcoin network.\n\"If you add … internal banking systems, CTVs, communicating with other banks, additional protection … you get higher costs than the cost of Bitcoin,\" he added.\n\"Gold mining consumes enormous energy. Portions of the electricity crypto mining consumes come from power generation and distribution originally built to supply ore and precious metals extraction or processing,\" said Howard.\n\"Where traditional energy consumers like gold mines really fall down is all the other negative externalities of the 'wealth' they create. Gold mining during and after is one of the most toxic and destructive operations on the planet.\"\nHoward talked about the use of abandoned industrial sites for Bitcoin mining, like pulp and paper mills that had been closed due to dwindling forestry supplies and increased concerns about energy use and toxic waste pollution.\n\"Lots of crypto mines are sitting in old industrial sites with a 100-megawatt transformer sitting next to them,\" he said.\nBy way of example, in the Q&A session that followed the panel, one conference participant talked about his mining operation in British Columbia in a partly abandoned manufacturing site where water is pumped through his mine for cooling and then recycled into a warm-water fish farm.\nMining Doesn't Create New Hydro Infrastructure: Power Is Produced Even If Unused After the panel, Howard reiterated to Bitcoin Magazine what other conference panelists had said: that large energy mega-projects like hydro dams produce electricity whether they're used or not.\n\"To my knowledge, no one has built out any net-new power generation to supply a crypto mine. Power generation stations are major pieces of infrastructure that take years to put in place and in the range of a decade to pay off. Most power generation is done, certainly in the western world, by publicly owned and/or regulated utilities. Those stations run 24/7, 365 for decades. The energy goes onto the grid no matter what and, until we figure out storage, is a perishable commodity.\n\"Crypto mining takes full advantage of this, typically sucking up energy at very low prices. The prices are low because the energy can't find more productive use, often taking over abandoned industrial sites far away from urban centers,\" he added.\nČapek told the conference that \"China has been overinvesting in hydro power and has large amounts of power that is not being used\" as a result of overbuilding hydro dams in anticipation of industrial needs (principally aluminum manufacturing) that never materialized.\n\"Cheap hydro power has helped China dominate the world's Bitcoin mining business, and this power would be generated with or without Bitcoin mining,\" said Čapek, who recommended a recently released study on the energy costs of mining in China.\nČapek said a rough estimate of global Bitcoin mining energy use is 25 terawatt hours per year, only a fraction of the amount of energy used in manufacturing aluminum globally.\nPoW vs. PoS The panelists mostly agreed that proof of work's higher energy use is necessary for real security and that proof of stake is not likely to happen soon. They noted that PoS would not give the Bitcoin network the security it needs, even if it was more energy efficient.\n\"The more energy that's expended, the more security you have,\" noted Mow. \"The system has to be nuclear-proof.\"\nPetrov defended the possibility of a hybrid model of both PoW and PoS, saying, \"Proof of stake may work for some specific purposes, not necessarily in the financial area but inside private blockchains.\"\nMow responded that using both PoS and PoW \"brings out the worst of both worlds,\" while Howard noted that Dash is using a hybrid model with some success, though it's very expensive to use.\nHoward concluded: \"It [Bitcoin mining] is a positive economic activity, typically in places where it is needed, as well as meaningful revenue to the utilities which are major employers and usually profit centers for governments.

Scott, CEO of Outlier Solutions , moderated a panel of experts that spoke about the energy issue as part of a discussion on the topic of proof of work (PoW) vs. proof of stake (PoS).\nScott told Bitcoin Magazine that there was a lot of discussion at the conference about the new energy report in part due to the attention it's currently receiving in the press.\n\"This is an area where there is a spectacular amount of FUD [fear, uncertainty and doubt],\" she noted. \"This is in part because it's a nuanced issue that can't be summed up in simple statements about net energy consumption.\n\"I think that part of the reason that Bitcoin has been a 'target' in this respect is that there are relatively straightforward calculations in terms of power consumption in conjunction with the underlying value not being well understood or widely accepted. For instance, few people question the utility costs of a bank or ATM, and the energy consumption cannot be calculated in a straightforward way,\" she added.\nScott Howard, CEO and co-founder of Toronto-based ePIC Blockchain Technologies , told the conference audience what many there were already saying: that the energy consumption issue is \"fake news\" and has been oversimplified to suit Bitcoin opponents.\nHigh Energy and Environmental Costs of Traditional Fiat and Banking Traditional banking and fiat creation have their own high energy costs, noted a number of conference panelists, including Alex Petrov, CIO of Bitfury ; Jan Čapek, CEO of Slush Pool ; Samson Mow, CSO of Blockstream ; and Howard.\nThey talked about the high infrastructure costs, in terms of both energy and the environment, associated with traditional banking systems, including ATMs, security and servers.\n\"There are 3.6 million ATMs deployed in the U.S. Each of them are using 7 to 800 watts just in standby mode,\" said Petrov. \"This alone generates huge numbers of electricity usage, slightly higher than the Bitcoin network.\n\"If you add … internal banking systems, CTVs, communicating with other banks, additional protection … you get higher costs than the cost of Bitcoin,\" he added.\n\"Gold mining consumes enormous energy. Portions of the electricity crypto mining consumes come from power generation and distribution originally built to supply ore and precious metals extraction or processing,\" said Howard.\n\"Where traditional energy consumers like gold mines really fall down is all the other negative externalities of the 'wealth' they create. Gold mining during and after is one of the most toxic and destructive operations on the planet.\"\nHoward talked about the use of abandoned industrial sites for Bitcoin mining, like pulp and paper mills that had been closed due to dwindling forestry supplies and increased concerns about energy use and toxic waste pollution.\n\"Lots of crypto mines are sitting in old industrial sites with a 100-megawatt transformer sitting next to them,\" he said.\nBy way of example, in the Q&A session that followed the panel, one conference participant talked about his mining operation in British Columbia in a partly abandoned manufacturing site where water is pumped through his mine for cooling and then recycled into a warm-water fish farm.\nMining Doesn't Create New Hydro Infrastructure: Power Is Produced Even If Unused After the panel, Howard reiterated to Bitcoin Magazine what other conference panelists had said: that large energy mega-projects like hydro dams produce electricity whether they're used or not.\n\"To my knowledge, no one has built out any net-new power generation to supply a crypto mine. Power generation stations are major pieces of infrastructure that take years to put in place and in the range of a decade to pay off. Most power generation is done, certainly in the western world, by publicly owned and/or regulated utilities. Those stations run 24/7, 365 for decades. The energy goes onto the grid no matter what and, until we figure out storage, is a perishable commodity.\n\"Crypto mining takes full advantage of this, typically sucking up energy at very low prices. The prices are low because the energy can't find more productive use, often taking over abandoned industrial sites far away from urban centers,\" he added.\nČapek told the conference that \"China has been overinvesting in hydro power and has large amounts of power that is not being used\" as a result of overbuilding hydro dams in anticipation of industrial needs (principally aluminum manufacturing) that never materialized.\n\"Cheap hydro power has helped China dominate the world's Bitcoin mining business, and this power would be generated with or without Bitcoin mining,\" said Čapek, who recommended a recently released study on the energy costs of mining in China.\nČapek said a rough estimate of global Bitcoin mining energy use is 25 terawatt hours per year, only a fraction of the amount of energy used in manufacturing aluminum globally.\nPoW vs. PoS The panelists mostly agreed that proof of work's higher energy use is necessary for real security and that proof of stake is not likely to happen soon.

The new MIT pilot is not just limited to manage millions of transactions but to make it possible with added complexity. Sponsored Links Scaling the Bitcoin Network\nThe MIT test envisages a mechanism wherein transactions would occur automatically when certain defined conditions are met such as when the U.S dollar value meets a predefined price.\nTo make it possible, DCI’s Research Scientist Tadge Dryja and Head of Strategic Partnerships Alin S. Dragos developed “oracles” that would relay data to smart contracts. The demo is built as an independently operating feature of the Lightning Network software, first proposed in summer 2017.\nFor the demo, Dryja and Dragos used these oracles to broadcast the value of U.S. dollars in satoshis, and the data could be used by anyone for their smart contracts. Dryja is the creator of the Lightning Network, the second layer payments protocol, which is viewed as one of the most promising scaling solutions for Bitcoin.\nAs per Dragos, the demo is at present in its experimental stage and is not to be tested with monetary transactions. The “oracle” is trusted and cannot be tampered with, but in the future, there could be a way to diminish the trust. Therefore, researchers are developing a prototype where oracles are unaware of who is using the data. Bitcoin Has the Same Potential as Ethereum, With Some Tweaks of Course!\nDCI’s researchers view Lightning Network as a promising solution to overcome Bitcoin’s scalability issue and scale to the level envisioned by its creator Satoshi Nakamoto.\nResearchers at DCI believe Bitcoin has the same capabilities as Ethereum when it comes to smart contracts. According to Dragos, Bitcoin can achieve the same with some add-on protocols; although, the network was not initially designed for that purpose, and hence it is necessary for developers to develop workarounds.\nDCI aims to develop a prototype that would clearly define how the underlying technology can work. However, after forming a working model, the research seeks to pass the technology to big companies that would know how the technology can help benefit a wider audience.\nThe system developed by MIT researchers are a step forward highlighting how Bitcoin could scale to new levels, but would still need a lot of work to make it user-friendly.\nWill these second layer protocols help Bitcoin scale?
