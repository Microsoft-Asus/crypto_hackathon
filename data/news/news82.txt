The underlying technology that powers this immutability and security is cryptographic hashing.\nA cryptographic hash function is a mathematical function that, simply put, takes any input and maps it to a fixed-size string.\nHowever, there are four special properties of these functions that make them invaluable to the Bitcoin network. They are:\nDeterministic —  for any input into the cryptographic hash function, the resulting output will always be the same. Fast  — Computing the output of the hash function, given any input, is a relatively fast process (doesn’t need heavy computation) Unique —  Every input into the function should result in a completely random and unique output (in other words, no two inputs result in the same output) Irreversible —  Given an output of a hash function, the original input is unable to be obtained These rules provide the foundation that enables Bitcoin mining to secure the network.\nIn particular, the creator of the Bitcoin protocol, Satoshi Nakomoto, chose to use the SHA-256 hash function as the basis for Bitcoin mining. This is a specific cryptographic hash function that has been mathematically proven to hold the above properties. It always outputs a 256 bit number (the most basic unit of computation), which is usually represented in the hexadecimal number system with 64 characters for human-readability.\nThe output of the SHA-256 function is usually referred to as the hash of its input.\nA hash function’s input results in a completely unique output Here is an example of a SHA-256 function input and output (you can try it out yourself here ):\nInput to SHA-256:\n<Bitcoin Transaction>\nOutput to SHA-256:\n77077b1f4c3ad44c83dc0bdb8d937e9b71c0ef07a35c2664bb7da85be738eacf\nInterestingly enough, in the majority of places where hashing is used in the Bitcoin protocol, double hashing is used. This means that the output of the original SHA-256 function is then put right back into the SHA-256 function to obtain another output. Here is what that process looks like:\nInput to SHA-256(first round):\n<Bitcoin Transaction>\nOutput (first round):\n77077b1f4c3ad44c83dc0bdb8d937e9b71c0ef07a35c2664bb7da85be738eacf\nInput to SHA-256 (second round):\n77077b1f4c3ad44c83dc0bdb8d937e9b71c0ef07a35c2664bb7da85be738eacf\nOutput (second round and final result):\n3c6c55b0e4b607b672b50f04e028a6951aed6dc97b91e103fb0f348c3f1dfa00\nDouble hashing is used to safeguard against birthday attacks. A birthday attack is a scenario where an attacker is able to produce the same hash as another input by using a completely different input (called a collision ). This breaks the third property of uniqueness. Without it, two completely different Bitcoin blocks may be represented by the exact same hash, allowing attackers to potentially switch out blocks.\nWith the SHA-256 function, the probability of this attack happening is infinitely small. If it wasn’t close to impossible, SHA-256 would be considered broken.\nHowever, other hash functions have been “broken” in the past. In order to safeguard against this happening to SHA-256 in the future (and effectively breaking the security model of Bitcoin) it’s best to hash the hash . This halves the probability of a collision occurring, making the protocol that much more secure.\nAt a very high level, Bitcoin mining is a system in which all Bitcoin transactions are sent to Bitcoin miners. Miners select one megabyte worth of transactions, bundle them as an input into the SHA-256 function, and attempt to find a specific output the network accepts. The first miner to find this output and publish the block to the network receives a reward in the form of transaction fees and the creation of new Bitcoin.\nLet’s take things a step further and dive into the Bitcoin blockchain itself to see what exactly it is that miners do to make the network secure.\nBitcoin Mining: A Technical Introduction Mining was introduced as the solution to the double-spend problem. If I have 1 Bitcoin and I send it to Bob, and then try sending that same Bitcoin to Alice, the network ensures that only one transaction will be accepted. It does this through the well-known process called mining.\nBefore diving into the technical details, its important to understand why mining is necessary to secure the network. As fiat currency exists now, the currency we hold is created and validated by a federal reserve. Because Bitcoin operates under the rigid assumption of decentralization and consensus, no central authority can exist that validates and time-stamps the issuance of that currency and validation of any transactions that occur with that currency.\nSatoshi Nakamoto proposed the only known solution at the time to solving this validation problem in a consensus-oriented system. Titled in the Bitcoin whitepaper as proof-of-work , this scheme elegantly justifies that transactions are validated by those who are willing to expend enough physical computational energy and time to do so, while simultaneously introducing an incentive to induce market competition. This competition enables the property of decentralization to emerge and thrive organically within the ecosystem.\nA Look Inside a Block A Bitcoin block consists primarily of two components:\n1. Transactions, in the form of a merkle tree Mining computers collect enough transactions to fill a block and bundle them into a merkle tree.\nA merkle tree is a relatively simple concept: transactions lie at the bottom of the tree as leaves and are hashed using the SHA-256 function. The combination of two leaf transactions are hashed again using the SHA-256 function to form a parent of the leaves. This parent is continuously hashed upwards in combination with other parents of hashed transactions, until a single root is created. The hash of this root is effectively a unique representation of the transactions that are underneath it.\nA visualization of how a merkle tree is built — the leaves at the very bottom of the tree are transactions The root of the merkle tree is a combination of the hashes of every transaction in the tree.\nRecall that for any any input to a hash function, the output is entirely unique. Therefore, once most nodes on the network receive a mined block, the root of the merkle tree hash acts as an unchangeable summary of all the transactions in that given block.\nIf a malicious actor were to try and change the contents of a transaction in a block, its hash would be changed. This change of a hash would be propagated up the transaction’s merkle tree until the hash of the root is changed. Any node can then quickly catch this malicious act by comparing the root of the changed block’s merkle tree to that of a valid block’s merkle tree.\n2. The block header The block header is a summary of the contents of the block itself. It contains the following six components :\nThe version of software the Bitcoin client is running The timestamp of the block The root of its containing transactions' merkle tree The hash of the block before it A nonce The target Remember that the root of the transaction merkle tree acts as an effective summary of every transaction in the block without having to look at each transaction.\nThe hash of the previous block before it allows the network to properly place the block in chronological order. This is where the term blockchain is derived from — each block is chained to a previous block.\nThe nonce and target are what make mining tick. They are the basis for solving the SHA-256 puzzle that miners need to solve.\nPlease note that all of this data in the block header is compressed into 80 bytes using a notation called little-endian , making the transfer of block headers between nodes a trivially efficient process. For the purposes of this explanation, we’ll ignore this compression and assume data is in its original form.\nExplaining the Mining Problem The target stored in the block header is simply a numeric value stored in bits. In traditional base 10 notation, this target ranges anywhere between 0 to somewhere in the range of 2²²⁴ (a 67+ digit number), depending on how many miners are competing to solve this problem at the same time.\nRecall that the output of SHA-256 is just a number. The goal of a miner is to take the current block’s header, add a random number to it called the nonce , and calculate its hash. This numeric value of the hash must be smaller than the target value.\nThat’s all there is to it. But it’s much easier said than done.\nRecall the first property of SHA-256: an input into a hash function will always result in the same output. Therefore, if the miner took the block header, hashed it, and realized that the hash value wasn’t less than the target, they would have to change the input somehow in order to try finding a hash below the target value.\nThis is where the nonce comes in.\nThe miner adds a number (starting from 0), called the nonce , to the block header, and hashes that value. If the hash value isn’t less than the target, the miner will increment the nonce by 1, add it again to the block header, and hash that changed value. This process is repeated continuously until a hash less than the target value is found.\nA Mining Example Here’s a rough approximation of what made up the first block header:\nThe merkle root of the transaction in the Genesis block: Merkle Root:\n4a5e1e4baab89f3a32518a88c31bc87f618f76673e2cc77ab2127b7afdeda33b\nThe first known Bitcoin version: 0.1.0 The timestamp of the block: 2009–01–03 18:15:05 The target (this is also the highest the target will ever be): Target:\n0x\nNo previous block hash — this was the first block, and so this is a unique case The final block header after adding its components together:\nThe Genesis block data (this includes the nonce, but lets pretend it doesn’t), source: bitcointalk Let’s take this large header and compute the double-hash:\nSHA-256 of header:\n7d80bd12dfdccbdde2c41c9f406edfc05afb3320f5affc4f510b05a3394e1c91\nSHA-256 of the previous result (final result):\nc5aa3150f61b752c8fb39525f911981e2f9982c8b9bc907c73914585ad2ef12b\nBoth the target and the output hash are incredibly large numbers when converted to base 10 (remember, over 67 digits long). Instead of trying to demonstrate the comparison of the two here, the following Python function handles the comparison instead:\ndef isBlockHashLessThanTarget(blockHash, target):\nreturn int(blockHash, 16) < int(target, 16)\nTrue is returned if the hash is less than the target, false otherwise.\nHere is the result with our target and block hash:\nNow we take the original block hexadecimal value and add 1 to it. Here is the following result:\nNotice how the very last digit is now 1, due to the addition of the nonce We then run the same hashing algorithm and comparison on this changed data. If its not below the target, keep repeating.\nOnce a successful hash is found, the latest nonce used to find this solution is saved within the block.\nThe listed nonce on the Genesis block is 2,083,236,893.\nThis means Satoshi Nakomoto iterated through this process over 2 billion times before he found a hash that was acceptable.\nI’ve written a small Python implementation of this Genesis block mining process that can be found on my GitHub .\nSee how long it would take for you to successfully mine the Genesis block!\nA Caveat: extraNonce The nonce value in a block header is stored as a 32-bit number. This means that the highest nonce anybody is able to achieve is 2³² (approximately 4 billion). After 4 billion iterations, the nonce is exhausted, and if a solution is not found, miners are once again stuck.\nThe solution to this is to add a field to the coinbase (the transaction contents of a block, stored as the merkle tree) called the extraNonce. The size of this extraNonce is only limited by the size of block itself, and so it can be as large as miners wish as long as the block size is within protocol limits.\nIf all 4 billion possible values of the nonce are exhausted, the extraNonce is added and incremented to the coinbase. A new merkle root and subsequently new block header are calculated, and the nonce is iterated over once again. This process is repeated until a sufficient hash is found.\nIt’s best to avoid adding the extraNonce until the nonce is exhausted, because any change to the extraNonce changes the merkle tree. This requires extra computation in order to propagate the change upwards until a new root of the merkle tree is calculated.\nThe Miner Reward A miner who successfully publishes a block the fastest is rewarded brand new Bitcoin, created out of thin air. That reward currently stands at 12.5 BTC. Just how do these Bitcoins come into existence?\nEach miner simply adds a new output transaction to their block that attributes 12.5 Bitcoins to themselves before beginning to mine the block. The network protocol will accept this special transaction as valid upon receiving a newly validated block. This special transaction is called a generation transaction.\nIts the miner’s responsibility to add this transaction into the block before mining it. There has been at least one case where miners forgot to add the reward to the transaction before mining a block, effectively destroying 12.5 BTC!\nValidating Proof-of-Work Let’s say our miner has found a hash that is less than the target. All this miner has to do is publish the mined block with the original six components to any connected nodes.\nThis node receiving the block will first verify the transaction set, ensuring all transactions are valid (for example, all transactions are appropriately signed, and coins aren’t being double-spent and/or being created out of thin air). It will then simply double-hash the block header and ensure the value is below the block’s included target value. Once the block is deemed valid, the new node will continue to propagate this block across the network until every node has an up-to-date ledger.\nAs you can see, newly published blocks can easily be verified by any given node. However, publishing a valid block to the network requires an incredibly large amount of computational power (thus, electricity and time). This asymmetry is what allows the network to be secured while simultaneously allowing individuals who wish to conduct economic activity on the network to do so in a relatively seamless manner.\nThe Block Time and Adjusting the Target As the first miners began mining, they each monitored the block time . Each Bitcoin block has a set block time of 10 minutes. What this means is that given the current level of computing power ( network hashrate ) on the network, nodes will always expect newly validated blocks to be produced every 10 minutes on average.\nWe can reasonably expect blocks to be produced within 10 minutes because the probability of finding a block, given the network hashrate, is known.\nFor example, let’s take the easiest target that’s ever existed in Bitcoin: the genesis block. The probability of any single hash being less than the easiest target is 1 in 2³². That’s one in over four billion. Therefore, we can reasonably expect somebody to run 2³² iterations of the mining problem in order to find a proper hash. Nodes on the network expected four billion of these iterations to be run across all miners on the network every 10 minutes.\nIf, over a large sample size of blocks, blocks start appearing faster than 10 minutes, this is a pretty clear indication that nodes on the network are iterating through four billion hashes much faster than 10 minutes. This situation prompts every node to adjust the target proportionally based on the increase (or decrease) in network power to ensure blocks continue to be produced every 10 minutes.\nIn actuality, nodes on the network monitor the block time across 2016 blocks, which comes out to exactly two weeks. Every two weeks, the total block time is compared to the expected block time (which is 20160 minutes).\nTo obtain the new target, simply multiply the existing target by the ratio of the total actual block time over the last two weeks to get the expected block time. This will adjust the target proportionally to the amount of entering or exiting computing power on the network.\nThe block time and the ability to easily calculate the probability of finding a valid block lets nodes easily monitor and determine the total hashpower on the network and adjust the network. No matter how much computing power is added to the network or how quickly its added, on average the block time will always remain at 10 minutes.\nThe current total hash rate on the network is 28.27 exahash per second. That’s 28.27 x 10¹⁸ hashes run every second across all computers on the network.\nIn summary We have now comprehensively covered the following:\nWhy cryptographic one way hashing is vital to proof-of-work A breakdown of the construction of a Bitcoin block The actual mining process and iteration itself How nodes can easily validate other blocks How the network manages to maintain the algorithm and competitiveness by monitoring the block time and adjusting the target You should now be able to understand and explain how proof-of-work actually functions and why it is considered to be an entirely secure algorithm that enables decentralization and consensus!\nHow Bitcoin mining really works was originally published in freeCodeCamp on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T20:10:10.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "76f8788cdb6915cc19acffd3aa9ccddf66bd19bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSbkJEADDtVI0_AMq30Zn5ep4kSCKc8T6eq7IR0cEogJgth.nUWzd8Uu47FxM0ZxmLguyykSciXPM", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Crypto On the Go: Prague Subway Gets 10 New Bitcoin ATMs", "title_full": "Crypto On the Go: Prague Subway Gets 10 New Bitcoin ATMs", "published": "2018-05-31T20:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "76f8788cdb6915cc19acffd3aa9ccddf66bd19bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSbkJEADDtVI0_AMq30Zn5ep4kSCKc8T6eq7IR0cEogJgth.nUWzd8Uu47FxM0ZxmLguyykSciXPM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-31T20:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Crypto On the Go: Prague Subway Gets 10 New Bitcoin ATMs", "text": "Crypto On the Go: Prague Subway Gets 10 New Bitcoin ATMs\n/u/dixiemaxi\nsubmitted by /u/dixiemaxi\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "prague", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T20:09:43.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1edc6d061dde33c4f043da71d393e175fc4a304a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.sq_gMZi1_u3RcdL_WoZjhGeV8PFcWOY8zSncY8dNXtCWb7osAfD5ztk0Hd3p58lWxQ--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Crypto On the Go: Prague Subway Gets 10 New Bitcoin ATMs", "title_full": "Crypto On the Go: Prague Subway Gets 10 New Bitcoin ATMs", "published": "2018-05-31T20:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1edc6d061dde33c4f043da71d393e175fc4a304a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.sq_gMZi1_u3RcdL_WoZjhGeV8PFcWOY8zSncY8dNXtCWb7osAfD5ztk0Hd3p58lWxQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-31T20:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Crypto On the Go: Prague Subway Gets 10 New Bitcoin ATMs", "text": "Crypto On the Go: Prague Subway Gets 10 New Bitcoin ATMs\n/u/dixiemaxi\nsubmitted by /u/dixiemaxi\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "prague", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T20:10:26.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fc90559638f115ad83ff8093da92ee2d875debcb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSVmMY58JlYQPvk2zKroY8ZSjYky29Yjq4gnEyhLWg6RjKdlPk5JMzpGZwW..OCleDUfNNMYU5btOYqKQ4rvOJmjXlsVxJXLpdM73GL1jAYqAuJbVzVNKxeXeiAhtcQywE-", "site_full": "www.startpagina.nl", "site": "startpagina.nl", "site_section": "https://www.startpagina.nl/v/categorieen/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Categorieën overzicht -

Shiller told CNBC’s Trading Nation:\nBitcoin won’t look anything like it is today [in 100 years]. It will have a different name, if it exists. There will have been many hard forks changing it and changing it. And, it’ll be a matter of dispute whether it exists or not.\nIndeed, the amount of Bitcoin hard forks already in existence numbers above 30, and most notably includes the likes of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin Gold (BTG), and Bitcoin Private (BTCP). A whole slew of less noteworthy forks also exists, including irrelevant coins like Bitcoin God (GOD), Bitcoin All (BTA), and Bitcoin Smart (BCS).

The company announced the suspension of its operations in Poland, where banks have been less than cooperative. BitBay is headed to the island country of Malta, which has given itself the nickname of Blockchain Island. BitBay is leaving the city of Katowice where it was founded in 2014 to bring cryptocurrency trading to Poland.\nIt’s not the first exchange redomiciling in Malta and its decision comes on the heels of Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange by volume (total volume in the last 24-hour period is $1.5 billion), moving from Hong Kong to the Mediterranean island. Polish Snag\nIn Poland, BitBay hit a snag when the only bank that was willing to cooperate with the exchange ultimately decided to end the relationship effective May 31. Banks around the world have been reluctant to support cryptocurrency exchanges, and it’s causing problems for the industry. BitBay was down to its last banking relationship in Poland and had been exploring its options already in search of the most cryptocurrency friendly jurisdiction it could find in the European Union.\nBitBay executives touted “productive discussions with the government of Republic of Malta and [a] friendly business environment.”\nIn the meantime, account holders on BitBay’s Polish platform can access all of the trading platform’s functionality until May 31. As of Sept. 18, 2018, traders can only make withdrawals, as deposits will no longer be supported. The official suspension of trading on BitBay’s Polish operations takes effect on Sept. 17, 2018.\nBitBay is looking to migrate its users over to the new platform and will prompt its members upon logging in to create a new account on the Malta platform. The dashboard should look the same, as the exchange will continue to use the same software that traders are used to. Malta Mission\nWhile countries like Poland and even Japan are making it difficult for cryptocurrency exchanges to run their businesses, Malta is rolling out the welcome mat, as evidenced by Prime Minister Joseph Muscat’s tweet in response to Binance’s announcement. Source: Twitter\nAs the smallest member of the European Union, Malta is an example of a tiny island country whose cryptocurrency regulation is advancing while crypto policies by larger governments around the world stall. Malta is currently efforting a trio of blockchain-fueled bills that will advance the industry in the jurisdiction, including a bill dedicated to regulating digital currencies, initial coin offerings and crypto exchanges.\nMalta’s economy is fueled largely by financial services and online gaming, and officials believe they can leverage their strength in these areas to take a leadership position in distributed ledger technology.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "malta bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mediterranean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockchain island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "binance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katowice", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T01:54:23.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2a3dd85d7277d663727b5b323968bd77238a88b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRXUU1IFV5qkfd4L7GZh9WU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Those who sold bitcoin are in for a big loss", "title_full": "Those who sold bitcoin are in for a big loss", "published": "2018-05-31T19:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.039, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2a3dd85d7277d663727b5b323968bd77238a88b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRXUU1IFV5qkfd4L7GZh9WU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "stayeduptolate", "published": "2018-05-31T19:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Those who sold bitcoin are in for a big loss", "text": "Quote: from: sann111 on February 21, 2018, 02:38:49 PM In a few days, we will be reaching $15000 again.

Robert Shiller a Nobel Prize winning economist and Yale University professor says Bitcoin may be extinct in 100 years because it looks like a bubble. If bitcoin is around Shiller says it will be a completely different iteration of what it is today. I’m thinking Bitcoin won’t look anything like it is today Schiller told CNBC.\nIt will have a different name if it exists. There have been many hard forks changing it and changing it so it will be a matter of dispute whether it exists or not a spike a fizzle Schiller said one scenario could see the top crypto currency by market cap experience a huge price spike before fading out. One scenario is something like what happened in 2013 when Bitcoin topped 1000 dollars and then lost 80 percent of its value.\nHe said it looked like bitcoin was fading away. Sheller then hedged a bit saying he could be wrong about the volatile market. You know it’s so hard to predict these things he said. I don’t mean to be dismissive of bitcoin but it looks like a bubble. Nobel Prize winning economist Robert Shiller of Yale University. CNBC one thing that Shiller likes about crypto mania which he has repeatedly dismissed is the excitement and innovative spirit it has ignited. It’s getting people enthusiastic and people are making different kinds of cryptocurrency he noted. There’s thousands of them now. So something good may come out of it.\nStudents traded BTC during final exams Shiller said he was amused when one of his economic students recently asked if he could keep his laptop on during his final exams so he could execute a cryptocurrency trade that’s a new first for me that shows real enthusiasm. Shiller laughed.\nI said OK if it’s so important to you you can trade during the final exam. Robert Shiller was one of three people who were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2013 for their work on spotting financial bubbles. Shiller is an avowed bitcoin bear who has scoffed at the crypto currency market ever since it started garnering countless headlines a fad fueled by hype in April 2018.\nShiller called Bitcoin mania a passing fancy that’s fueled by emotions and hype and is not rooted in sound financial fundamentals as CCN has reported. It’s another example of faddish human behavior Shiller said. It’s a story that I think goes way beyond the merits of the idea.\nEconomist Rrobert Shiller believes the hype surrounding the decentralized unregulated virtual currency markets stems partly from its defiant images rebelling against the system. I think it’s partly political he reasoned. There’s a big element of people who don’t trust the government anymore and they like the idea that this didn’t come from the government. It came from some real smart computer scientists. It’s a great story for today’s markets of course for every naysayer.\nThere are numerous bitcoin bulls who are supremely confident about its future including Twitter billionaire Jack Dorsey and billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper. Even as Shiller predicts the eventual demise of crypto Draper has boldly set a two hundred fifty thousand dollars Bitcoin price target for 2022 like Schiller.\nDraper has impeccable academic credentials.\nHe has an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University and an MBA from Harvard (although his recent comments on Theranos were insane).\nRaipur also has a pretty good track record with bitcoin price predictions and is hailed for his savvy decision to buy 30000 bitcoins for 600 dollars apiece back in 2014 when few people had heard of it at today’s price of roughly 7500 dollars a coin Draper’s stash is now worth about 225 million dollars.\nThe post Robert Shiller: Bitcoin May Not Be Around In 2028; Says Students Were Trading Cryptos During Finals appeared first on ValueWalk .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert shiller", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "schiller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shiller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "yale university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T19:52:37.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "58b1efd71d357881be2cef5f82f45c915e2ce01e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfXAVLzzpl2hJ8.v0wUIKl0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=191.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian)", "title": "[DISKUSI] Harga Bitcoin", "title_full": "[DISKUSI] Harga Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-31T19:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "58b1efd71d357881be2cef5f82f45c915e2ce01e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfXAVLzzpl2hJ8.v0wUIKl0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ocican", "published": "2018-05-31T19:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "[DISKUSI] Harga Bitcoin", "text": "setahu aku sih diatas 300$ lebih, dan tidak menentu, kadang naik kadang turun karna perubahan dipasar yg sering berubah", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T20:57:17.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "37d38ce22f9713d8cef70fd944d29b32ea368284", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHKcxOQn0gqcvlaj0m9gmZxWFSHJbrACaCILoUt7aOYCkb7jgaJx7dNEDxJNxiY0wr4_vPu3v68c5hvz_wVMGcohCFnI7C2VUdU-", "site_full": "wegobusiness.com", "site": "wegobusiness.com", "site_section": "http://wegobusiness.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "WeGoBusiness – Top business stories from around the internet", "title": "Bitcoin – Apple Sides with Russian Govt, Restricts Telegram, Claims Pavel Durov", "title_full": "Bitcoin – Apple Sides with Russian Govt, Restricts Telegram, Claims Pavel Durov", "published": "2018-05-31T19:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://wegobusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin-Apple-Sides-with-Russian-Govt-Restricts-Telegram-Claims-Pavel-Durov.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "37d38ce22f9713d8cef70fd944d29b32ea368284", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHKcxOQn0gqcvlaj0m9gmZxWFSHJbrACaCILoUt7aOYCkb7jgaJx7dNEDxJNxiY0wr4_vPu3v68c5hvz_wVMGcohCFnI7C2VUdU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "WeGoBusiness - Digital Business Academy", "published": "2018-05-31T19:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin – Apple Sides with Russian Govt, Restricts Telegram, Claims Pavel Durov", "text": "Bitcoin – Apple Sides with Russian Govt, Restricts Telegram, Claims Pavel Durov 31 May 2018 8530\nIf there’s a sacred line the crypto community insists shouldn’t be crossed, it’s Thou Shalt Never Cooperate with Government Prohibitions. Apple Inc., the world’s most valuable company, appears to have ventured into such territory, according to Telegram’s founder Pavel Durov. He claims the maker of iPhone, iPad, and other iconic hardware, is purposefully restricting Telegram’s program updates on Apple’s latest operating system rollout in an effort to appease Russian authorities.\nAlso read: Philippines’ Crypto Wallet Reaches 5 Million Users, Adds More Coins Apple Inc. Sides with Russia Against Telegram\n“Apple has been preventing Telegram from updating its iOS apps globally ever since the Russian authorities ordered Apple to remove Telegram from the App Store,” Telegram’s Pavel Durov wrote on his quarter million member Durov’s Channel . “Russia banned Telegram on its territory in April because we refused to provide decryption keys for all our users’ communications to Russia’s security agencies. We believe we did the only possible thing, preserving the right of our users to privacy in a troubled country.”\nAs reported in these pages two month ago, “Supreme Court Judge Alla Nazarova […] rejected an appeal filed by Telegram, objecting to Russia’s Federal Security Services (FSB) obtaining the encryption keys to its platform. As a result, Telegram will be legally obligated to grant security forces access to the private messages and other data of its users, unless it can convince an appellate court to reverse the decision.”\nWeeks after, a kangaroo Moscow court upheld that decision, ordering Telegram to comply. Then, as like now, Mr. Durov took to his personal channel, explaining defiantly, “The power that local governments have over IT corporations is based on money. At any given moment, a government can crash their stocks by threatening to block revenue streams from its markets and thus force these companies to do strange things (remember how last year Apple moved Icloud servers to China). At Telegram, we have the luxury of not caring about revenue streams or ad sales. Privacy is not for sale, and human rights should not be compromised out of fear or greed.” Apple Also Hounded by Russian Authorities\nBy late Spring of this year, Telegram had gone full protest mode. “For us, this was an easy decision. We promised our users 100% privacy and would rather cease to exist than violate this promise,” Mr. Durov stressed. “To support internet freedoms in Russia and elsewhere I started giving out bitcoin grants to individuals and companies who run socks5 proxies and VPN. I am happy to donate millions of dollars this year to this cause, and hope that other people will follow. I called this Digital Resistance – a decentralized movement standing for digital freedoms and progress globally.” Supporters even responded to Telegram’s call for a paper airplane mass fly, providing a profound and somewhat beautiful symbol of cryptography’s ultimate power.\nFor its part, Apple has been hectored by the Russian government’s telecommunications minder, which recently stressed, “In order to anticipate Roskomnadzor’s likely response to the violations regarding the operation of the aforesaid Apple, Inc. services we are asking you to notify us within the tightest deadlines of the company’s further actions regarding the solution of these issues,” Tass reported. The order was directed at both Apple and its App Store along with Google and its Google Play store to effectively drop Telegram.\nMr. Durov lamented, “Unfortunately, Apple didn’t side with us. While Russia makes up only 7% of Telegram’s user base, Apple is restricting updates for all Telegram users around the world since mid-April. As a result, we’ve also been unable to fully comply with GDPR for our EU-users by the deadline of May 25, 2018. We are continuing our efforts to resolve the situation and will keep you updated.”\nDo you think Apple should fight the Russian government ?

A Big Forking Problem\nNobody can accurately see 100 years into the future, but prominent economist Rober Shiller claims Bitcoin may go the way of the West African Black Rhinoceros — that is to say: extinct.\nAccording to the Yale professor, hard forks will be to blame for the dissolution of the first and foremost cryptocurrency. Shiller told CNBC’s Trading Nation :\nBitcoin won’t look anything like it is today [in 100 years]. It will have a different name, if it exists. There will have been many hard forks changing it and changing it. And, it’ll be a matter of dispute whether it exists or not.\nIndeed, the amount of Bitcoin hard forks already in existence numbers above 30, and most notably includes the likes of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin Gold (BTG), and Bitcoin Private (BTCP). A whole slew of less noteworthy forks also exists, including irrelevant coins like Bitcoin God (GOD), Bitcoin All (BTA), and Bitcoin Smart (BCS). Meanwhile, more hard forks of the market leader are already planned, including Anonymous Bitcoin (ANON).\nOne may easily argue that the sheer amount of Bitcoin hard forks indeed does very little to benefit the most mainstream cryptocurrency. In fact, there remains a civil war of sorts between Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) — the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization — with the latter actively making attempts to claim the Bitcoin name for itself while rebranding the former to Bitcoin Core.\nAdding to the confusion is the fact that a group of developers has recently embraced the Bitcoin Core moniker perpetuated by some Bitcoin Cash proponents — having launched a cryptocurrency under the same name (BTCC) while calling it the real open source, peer-to-peer electronic cash.\nFor those who have yet to dip their toes in Bitcoin’s waters, the widespread co-opting of the market leader’s name can be overwhelming — particularly when trying to figure out which is the “real” Bitcoin. ‘It Looks like a Bubble’\nHard forks may not be the only reason Bitcoin dies in a century or so.\nShiller also claimed that the gold-standard of cryptocurrency could fade away into obscurity as times change. He explained:\nThe one scenario is that something like what happened after 2013 when bitcoin topped $1,000, and then lost 80 percent of its value. It looked like bitcoin was just fading away.\nThe prominent economist also added that Bitcoin “looks like a bubble,” but still noted that nothing is certain, stating:\nIt’s so hard to predict these things.\nPredicting Bitcoin’s future is made even harder by the fact that the market leader itself is a voluntary monetary network, meaning every user chooses to play by the rules of consensus. The bigger the network gets, the harder it becomes to change said rules.\nFurthermore, Bitcoin will only tighten with future soft forks, offsetting the loosening of rules caused by controversial and irrelevant hard forks.\nWhere do you think Bitcoin will be in 100 years? Do you think hard forks will be to blame for Bitcoin’s extinction?

But apparently some people are taking it even further and just can't help but buy more and more crypto for no good reason, and that's why there's one Scottish hospital has expanded its rehab services for cryptocurrency addicts.\nThe hospital in question is Castle Craig hospital in Peeblesshire , and the expansion of services took place earlier this month with staff likening crypto purchases to gambling. Gambling therapist Chris Burn, said:\n“The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains & losses were made. It’s a classic bubble situation.”\nIt's not a terrible comparison, because a lot of people have likened investing in cryptocurrency to gambling due to its instability. According to the hospital, like gambling addicts, cryptocurrency addicts will obsessively chase the win and recoup their losses - even going so far as to borrow money, steal, or lie about it. Because it's basically a new form of gambling addiction Castle Craig aims to use the same methods used to treat patients, including a 12 step approach that uses cognitive behavioural therapy.\nThe hospital is a private facility, though, so you won't be able to book yourself in on the NHS's dime. Which is probably a good thing, because if the tabloids found out they'd probably go mental and fail to understand that 'crypto addiction' is just a fancy name for a very specific kind of gambling addiction. And it's not cheap either, with prices ranging from £1,360 to £9,240 a week depending on what package or treatment you're getting. Considering patients aren't likely to be fixed in a few days, that cost is going to add up significantly.\nBut like damn near everything, people can be addicted to buying and selling cryptocurrencies. If you're one of them, or you know someone who is, it's probably a good idea to seek help. The NHS has some resources for you to check out here.

However, early buyers of the miner are now accusing Bitmain of a total rip off. Faulty Machines\nThe early birds, who have purchased the overhyped Bitcoin mining equipment from Beijing-based Bitmain Technologies Ltd., are complaining that the machines have less computing power than what was advertised by the firm.\nAccording to local news source China Money Network , users said they scampered to purchase the miners after Xiaojun advertised the product beyond proportions at a live marketing event.\nThe Bitmain representative told attendees present at the event that the B3 miners could generate at least RMB285 ($44.5) per day, with a power consumption rate of 360 watts which costs only RMB4 daily ($0.62).\nThe Bitcoin mining equipment was initially sold at the rate of RMB17,000 ($2,651), but Bitmain suddenly slashed the price to RMB11,000 ($1,715) just three days before delivering the mining equipment to buyers.\nSome cryptocurrency investors were not so lucky, as they had earlier paid a whopping RMB20,000 ($3,119) for the same machine from other vendors. Not Worth the Stress\nAfter the initial excitement of buyers of the Antminer B3, they soon discovered that the machine was not exactly as functional as it was said to be.\nA Chinese resident, Zhang claimed that three of his B3 miners could only manage a hash rate of between 500H/s to 600H/s, which is a far cry from the expected 780H/s. Advertisement advertisement\nHe promptly notified the customer service department of Bitmain about his findings, and they asked him to reset the miner several times, yet the performance of the equipment remained below par. Bitmain Refunds Unsatisfied Customers\nThe bitcoin big whale subsequently investigated the matter and had claimed that only less than one percent of the new B3 Bitcoin mining equipment had computing power issues. The company refunded some of the ‘victims’ RMB4000 ($624) for each machine.\nHowever, Bitmain defended itself saying its marketing event did not precisely state the amount of money the advertised miners would generate for users. Therefore, it was not misleading in any way. Dirty Game?\nBitmain has been accused of playing dirty games previously in a bid to remain the most significant player in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem.\nIn a Medium blog post by the lead developer of the Sia project , David Vorick, the coder claimed that Bitmain has a penchant for playing dirty. He accused the cryptocurrency giant of forbidding a vast number of chip makers from producing their chips in China.\nIn his words:\n“…Our manufacturer reached out to us and said with little warning or reasonable explanation that they would be unable to manufacture for us. Just as we had been warned, our attempt to manufacture in China had fallen flat on its face.”\nOn May 12, 2018, BTCManager reported that Bitmain was doing brisk business at its two mega mining farms in the U.S. At current, all seems to be going well for the firm, as they are putting the finishing touches to their Antminer E3 that is scheduled for release before the end of 2018.\nWhether the E3 will be any better than the B3, remains to be seen.

The crypto world is burgeoning faster than most thought possible and I’m proud to be here on the cutting-edge along with many other freethinkers.\nThat’s why I was pleased to speak with Rafael LaVerde for the latest edition of Anarchast , where we discussed the upcoming launch of EOS and how it compares to Ethereum, as well as the ongoing Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash debate, scaling issues, prediction markets, and so much more.\nIf you’re unfamiliar, EOS is a new blockchain architecture and cryptocurrency aiming to handle millions of transactions per second. The software has the potential to eliminate user fees and allow for quick and easy deployment of decentralized applications.\nIt features a unique system of ‘governance’ where the blockchain’s direction and evolution can be voted on by owners of EOS tokens, preventing abuse by any single rogue figurehead.\nI’m excited about the philosophy behind EOS because it’s really poised to be a robust free-market platform with more smart contract elements.\nAt TDV, we recommended investing in EOS back when it was only 50 cents (it’s now $12) -- just another reason to be getting our newsletter and staying up to date with all things crypto ( SUBSCRIBE ).\nIn this interview, I announced that myself, Rafael, Everipedia and others have collaboratively formed Liberty Block to be a truly anarcho-capitalist EOS block producer -- transparent, accountable, and cooperative.\nYou can watch my full interview with Rafael here: If you’re interested in learning more about EOS or Liberty Block, check out these links:\nEOS.IO: /> Liberty Block: /> EOSGo:\nYouTube 553 Videos | 124,495 Subscribers\nUpcoming Events Infinite Man Summit Start date: July 13, 2018\nEnd date: July 15, 2018\nLocation: lisbon, portugal\nMore info\nThe Infinite Man Summit is a new event that inspires men to create extraordinary lives.

As many traders on Twitter have noted, we have formed a large consolidation pattern called a symmetrical triangle (outlined in red):\nFigure 1: BTC USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro Symmetrical Triangle\nSymmetrical triangles are consolidation patterns that are typically agnostic regarding their breakout direction. However, one important thing to note about this consolidation pattern is it embodies some of the hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range (TR) — most notable is the volume profile:\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 12-Hour Candles, Volume Trend\nOverall, the entire volume profile of the symmetrical triangle is sloping downward — this is indicating consolidation in the market. If we look closer at the consolidating volume trend, we can see a few details that are worth noting: The red arrows are pointing out the decrease in volume off the peaks of the rallies. Typically decreasing volume off rally reactions indicates a diminishing pool of supply. Vice versa, the green arrows are pointing out the increasing volume on the rallies. Increasing volume on rallies shows us there is still a steady amount of demand in the market. Points 1 and 2 together also reveal something about the lows made at the lower boundary of the symmetrical triangle: as the market pushes and establishes its lows, we see climactic volume. Climactic volume leading into support is a great sign of supply absorption and hints toward further demand in the market.\nThere is a really strong case for the current symmetrical triangle being a reaccumulation TR that, in the grand scheme of things, is nothing more than a pitstop in an otherwise upward-trending market. A breakout to the top of the symmetrical triangle would have a price target in the $15,000s. However, as I mentioned at the beginning of this article, symmetrical triangles are directionally agnostic and can also break to the downside. If the triangle breaks down, the measured move for the breakout would have us testing the $2000–$3000 price range.\nFor now, the volume is content with continuing to consolidate, but the market is poised for a very strong move that will likely shape the landscape of the market for the next several months. It’s impossible to determine when a market will breakout, so all we can do is hedge our bets and wait. Summary: The market has been consolidating for months in the form of a symmetrical triangle and is tightly wound for a strong, sustained move. There is strong evidence of supply absorption in the market which would likely lead to an upward breakout. Symmetrical triangles are directionally agnostic and can oftentimes break to the downside.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

(For the uninitiated: if you own cryptocurrency, you must store the access keys to your coins in a digital wallet— or to be extra cautious you can practice “ cold storage ” by using a hardware wallet .)\nThese days, the average American who is not steeped in crypto understanding, but decides they want to buy some bitcoin, is likely to head to Coinbase, the largest mainstream U.S. site for buying cryptocurrency . And until this year, Coinbase and Blockchain were not really competitors. Blockchain, which is headquartered in the UK, has long offered bitcoin buying services there, but not in the U.S., where about 40% of its users reside. This year, Blockchain has slowly begun rolling out the option to buy and trade bitcoin in the U.S.\nAnd Blockchain’s 25 million wallets are double the size of Coinbase’s user base: 13 million users as of November, the last time the company shared a number publicly. Twenty-five million is also more than the customer base of TD Ameritrade (11 million accounts) or Charles Schwab (9 million), Blockchain points out in a press note.\nTo be sure, Blockchain’s wallet count is not the same metric as individual users, since some users have multiple wallets. But 25 million global wallets still speak to the company’s staying power as the leading wallet provider. Blockchain is also known for blockchain.info , its free “blockchain explorer” site that shows real-time activity on the bitcoin blockchain.\nBlockchain CEO Peter Smith at Yahoo Finance’s All Markets Summit: Crypto on Feb. 7, 2018 (Gino DePinto/Oath) More “We’ve experienced unprecedented growth in the last few months,” a Blockchain spokesperson says. The company has raised $70 million in funding to date.\nBlockchain has also made a slew of recent notable hires: Vice President of engineering Peter Wilson , formerly of Facebook and Google; head of institutional sales Breanne Madigan , formerly of Goldman Sachs; and head of research Garrick Hileman , a veteran of Allianz and Bank of America.\n“Everyone should have some meaningful yet small allocation,” Blockchain CEO Peter Smith said on a panel at Yahoo Finance’s live cryptocurrency summit in New York on Feb 7 . “You should buy crypto in amounts that you’re not worried about, and you should sell it whenever you start thinking about it once a day.”\n—\nDaniel Roberts covers bitcoin and blockchain at Yahoo Finance.

Manipulating Bitcoin Price: Prominent Trader Advertisement\nPeter Brandt, a prominent trader and respected technical analyst, believes there is no solid evidence to back up claims that whales and large-scale investors have been manipulating the bitcoin price or the wider cryptocurrency market. Not Futures Market\nEarlier this week, after various reports that the fall of bitcoin’s value coincided with the launch of CME and CBOE bitcoin futures market in December 2017, Brandt said :\n“Cryptos. There is no evidence whales have been shorting crypto markets. The weakness in May appears to have come from liquidation of longs by small spec retail traders.”\nBrandt added that it is not possible for the futures market to have an overwhelming impact on the bitcoin price because there exists a fixed number of short and long contracts. “There are always the same number of short-contracts as long contracts. Always. No matter the market,” explained Brandt.\nSince December 2017, the point in which CME and CBOE bitcoin futures market were introduced to the public, the bitcoin price dropped from $19,900 to $7,500, by more than 62.3 percent. The sharp decline in the price of bitcoin led investors and analysts to suspect manipulation in the futures market, which still remains as one of the very few public instruments investors can utilize to invest in the cryptocurrency market.\nHowever, Brandt stated that it is not possible for any futures market to see a continuous decline of value and overwhelming support from bears because the quantity of short and long contracts are available is identical.\nIf the futures market had the same leverage it had in December throughout 2018, the price chart of bitcoin should have had demonstrated similar volatility and intensified downward movements. But, bitcoin suffered three major corrections in 2018, and each successive correction recorded lower sell volumes and drops. One-Year Bitcoin Price Chart\nA bitcoin trade group echoed a similar sentiment to Brandt in a popular bitcoin price discussion, as it stated that the decline in sell volumes in succeeding corrections after the initial drop in the bitcoin price in January show that the bear trend is “running out of gas.”\n“Not only is selling volume lower, but the drops have been less severe. Each component of each leg down is less steep than the previous leg down. RSI, a momentum indicator, also shows selling has been less extreme. The trend is ‘flattening out’ In our opinion, the bear trend is running out of gas. Bears/whales/market makers held a great supply of BTC that they pumped until 12/17/17,” the trade group said .\nIf the bitcoin futures market had been the main factor behind previous corrections, traders should have been able to gain similar leverage in successive corrections. However, bears have continuously lost leverage over the market, which was likely triggered by the liquidation of longs by small retail traders, as Brandt suggested. Flattening Out Process\nAfter the flattening out process comes to an end in the upcoming weeks, bitcoin will likely experience a strong rally that will expand throughout the mid-term. In the short-term, due to the intense volatility of the cryptocurrency market and the downward trend of bitcoin, it is possible for bitcoin to fall below the $7,000 mark to the lower end of $6,000.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TheCryptoFam/status/999407808041930752", "https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/1001484125243490304"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peter bran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brandt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T23:38:27.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fda5bd05f34026532051355287011d5551bb2f27", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdSDeCspvrtcsAw7pc7DYjo-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=39.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Beginners &amp; Help", "title": "Transfer bitcoin from one to another wallet ?", "title_full": "Transfer bitcoin from one to another wallet ?", "published": "2018-05-31T18:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.168, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fda5bd05f34026532051355287011d5551bb2f27", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdSDeCspvrtcsAw7pc7DYjo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "pealr12", "published": "2018-05-31T18:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Transfer bitcoin from one to another wallet ?", "text": "Quote: from: altcoinanalyst1 on May 23, 2018, 05:17:53 PM Hello guys, I want to know if it is possible to transfer all funds from one wallet to another ?\nYes its possible.

XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap after Bitcoin and Ethereum, is the name for both a digital currency and an open payment network. It allows users to efficiently send money globally using the blockchain.\nGarlinghouse also criticized Bitcoin’s efficiency when it comes to making payments. He said it’s a bad idea for Bitcoin to replace fiat currency as the average Bitcoin transaction can take as much as 20 minutes and the transaction fees are still pretty steep.\nFor context, Ripple can handle 1,500 transactions per second, while Bitcoin can reportedly only handle seven in the same timespan. Earlier this month, actor and tech investor Ashton Kutcher donated $4 million in Ripple’s XRP tokens to wildlife charity, The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund. “We can actually transfer [the donation] into Rwandan francs right now, right here, and all we have to do is push this button and it’s in your account,” Kutcher said.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.dianomi.com/cms/register-interest/?utm_source=network&utm_medium=smartad_sponsor_link%22%20target=%22_blank", "https://www.dianomi.com/cgi-bin/smartads.pl?id=3367&v=2&callback=getDianomiAdContentABGFF&format=json&imgsize=256x143", "https://www.cnet.com/news/bitcoin-is-like-napster-important-flop-ripple-ceo-says/", "https://coinmarketcap.com/", "https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-ripple-819806/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brad garlinghouse", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pandora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garlinghouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spotify", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "napster", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T18:45:37.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1d6db65a784045dc0dec4a16108c81c3840f41d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSL4jLVmYoN8Q.OdrJhbzBk0NotQqFOfwr9LiXbmP3lpDuWk99hJh5yryctqj58gb4f_NgJ6K_wT9MHUxmB.jX6FnzqscCmEXY-", "site_full": "coinidol.com", "site": "coinidol.com", "site_section": "https://coinidol.com/rssshort", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "News", "title": "French Capital Will Host Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference France – Large Blockchain Event with Top Experts", "title_full": "French Capital Will Host Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference France – Large Blockchain Event with Top Experts", "published": "2018-05-31T18:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://coinidol.com", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1d6db65a784045dc0dec4a16108c81c3840f41d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSL4jLVmYoN8Q.OdrJhbzBk0NotQqFOfwr9LiXbmP3lpDuWk99hJh5yryctqj58gb4f_NgJ6K_wT9MHUxmB.jX6FnzqscCmEXY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-31T18:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "French Capital Will Host Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference France – Large Blockchain Event with Top Experts", "text": "French Capital Will Host Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference France – Large Blockchain Event with Top Experts May 31, 2018 at 15:41 // PR Author Guest Author\nOn July 18, top crypto experts from huge international corporations will gather in Paris at the Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference France – large-scale event dedicated to cryptocurrencies, Blockchain and ICO.\nThe meeting will include conference and demozone. Presentations from leading specialists and expositions of the innovative solutions from blockchain-based startups are waiting for the guests. Blockchain in France: Big Changes\nAccording to the French Minister of Economy, the country is planning to become the main leader in European fintech industry. The claim is supported by recent actions of government officials.\nIn March 2018, French market regulator AMF announced the project of a new law which makes ICOs a legal means of investing. One month later, Council of State suggested reducing cryptocurrency operations taxes from 45% to 19%. Capital growth from cryptocurrency has been proposed to be counted as equal to non-fixed assets.\nParliament already discusses the DLT. Large banks, including BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and RCI Bank, introduce blockchain transactions, while the Bank of France helps startups based on decentralized technology.\nRecent changes show that the government is interested in the blockchain-based business and cryptocurrency market development. This is why French crypto community welcomes blockchain events with open arms. Who Will Present and What Will Be Discussed?\nStefano Tempesta, Regional Director at Microsoft, will deliver a presentation “Blockchain for Enterprise.” He will discuss smart contracts and cybersecurity, and will share real-life cases of blockchain integration into business operations.\nThe Founder and CEO at Chaineum Laurent Leloup will introduce the topic “The new use cases of blockchain for industrials and governments.” The expert will talk about the current trends in blockchain use and its innovative opportunities.\nMarc Durand, a Blockchain leader at IBM Cloud France, will give a presentation “Industrial blockchain projects with Hyperledger Fabric: Feedbacks and Perspectives.” Demozone\nApart from the conference, guests of the Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference France will have a chance to visit demozone where companies working in the blockchain industry will introduce their developments.\nThe event will include the networking time as well: companies will be able to find business partners, get business ties and sign profitable contracts.\nОrganizer\nThe event will be held by the company Smile-Expo, which has organized the Blockchain World Events series in 25 countries. Venue\nThe conference will take place in the Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile hotel in the heart of Paris next to Arch of Triumph and Champs-Élysées.

It will have a different name, if it exists,” said Yale professor and Noble Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller in an interview with CNBC . “There will have been many hard forks changing it and changing it. And, it’ll be a matter of dispute whether it exists or not.”\n“A hard fork (or sometimes hardfork), as it relates to blockchain technology, is a radical change to the protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid (or vice-versa). This requires all nodes or users to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol software ,” according to Investopedia . “Put differently, a hard fork is a permanent divergence from the previous version of the blockchain , and nodes running previous versions will no longer be accepted by the newest version.” Diverging Views\nBitcoin does not lack for supporters as there have been plenty of bullish calls on the cryptocurrency in recent weeks. Some crypto market observers have opined bitcoin could reach new highs this year, but those are just projections. In financial markets, price matters and bitcoin’s price has rapidly eroded since the start of May.\nHowever, Shiller has a different view.\n“ The one scenario is that something like what happened after 2013 when bitcoin topped $1,000, and then lost 80 percent of its value. It looked like bitcoin was just fading away,” the economist said in the CNBC interview. “It’s so hard to predict these things.”\nBitcoin’s price action still prompts some market observers, including Shiller, to say the cryptocurrency is a bubble. After surging 35% in April, bitcoin tumbled in May. After trading around $20,000 in December, bitcoin currently resides slightly below $7,400, but even with that massive decline, the largest digital currency has more than tripled in value over the past year.\nFor more information on the cryptocurrency market, visit our Bitcoin category .

Both organizations are seeking to develop a stronger, more organized system for allowing charities to accept virtual currency donations.\nBitGive previously made headlines in October 2017 when it launched its new GiveTrack platform, which uses blockchain technology to clarify and record digital asset donations to global charities. Individuals can trace their funds in real time, and see how their money is spent once an organization receives it. They are also informed of the charity’s project results, creating direct engagement between the donor and the receiver.\nBitGive’s founder Connie Gallippi explained in a statement:\n“It’s been incredibly rewarding to see our GiveTrack platform gain unabating momentum. Throughout this process, we’ve discovered numerous opportunities, as well as challenges and barriers, that have helped shape the development of our platform and define crypto-philanthropy. Using this knowledge, in tandem with the bright minds at the University of Edinburgh, BitGive will be delving into how to overcome the roadblocks to effective crypto-philanthropy and establish how cryptocurrency can best be used to uplift and revolutionize the charitable sector.”\nBitGive and the University of Edinburgh are seeking to uncover the challenges of using and converting cryptocurrencies in third-world countries. To do this, BitGive will analyze data collected from GiveTrack’s implementations in nations like Indonesia, Kenya and India to better understand these regions’ levels of cryptocurrency acceptance and feasibility.\nIn addition, both organizations are also hoping collected data will shed light on merchant adoption, regulation, and the effects of cryptocurrencies on local governments and cultures in each country.\nResearch partner at the University of Edinburgh Dr. Claudia Pagliari says:\n“Through their experience of planning and delivering projects using the GiveTrack platform, Connie and her team have gained important insights into how cryptocurrency can be effectively used to support humanitarian efforts in developing countries, as well as some of the challenges involved. Through our research collaboration with BitGive, and meeting key stakeholders, we aim to learn as much as we can about the technical and contextual factors that can ultimately influence the success of these approaches so that this knowledge can be used to inform future programs worldwide.” Open Mind Africa\nThis week, BitGive also launched its latest charitable project partnership with Open Mind Africa , aiming to raise funds to support a Summer Camp and Educator Summit in Ghana, where students will have “fantastic opportunities to develop essential social-emotional skills, multiple intelligences, build friendships and make memories that will last a lifetime.” Now in its second year, the camp is also inviting educators and facilitators from the U.S. and Australia, as well as Ghana.\nOpen Mind Africa was founded on a firm belief that there is a better future for Africa if we promote a quality education rooted in essential skills needed to succeed in school, career and life.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.givetrack.org/view/55/open-mind-africa-2018-summer-camp-educator-summit-ghana", "https://www.bitgivefoundation.org/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "connie gallippi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T23:38:29.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9452680ed717837d14d91420f7cc2d1eea40adf6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSDAcJIStjdfDkxWnrppft1fahF5JebLTR2QBTkQfEEpw1B.yzUzKKkBAMCCwMfZOMbpm_yKUqmM76VPih.Vso9QDqM2v2n6EdXlFUoosH2zK61vsRv2aHmQDggV8DB7UHZR7mBS2AVViND9Y32NtV9", "site_full": "cointelegraph.com", "site": "cointelegraph.com", "site_section": "http://www.xbt.money/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "XBT.MONEY", "title": "Ripple CEO Compares Bitcoin to Napster, Says BTC’s Influence on Market Could Lessen", "title_full": "Ripple CEO Compares Bitcoin to Napster, Says BTC’s Influence on Market Could Lessen", "published": "2018-05-31T18:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.xbt.money/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/528_Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy81YmU2YTczYWJlNWMxOTc5YmE4ZWUyNTQ2MTZmNzZhYS5qcGc=-528x330.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45237, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9452680ed717837d14d91420f7cc2d1eea40adf6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSDAcJIStjdfDkxWnrppft1fahF5JebLTR2QBTkQfEEpw1B.yzUzKKkBAMCCwMfZOMbpm_yKUqmM76VPih.Vso9QDqM2v2n6EdXlFUoosH2zK61vsRv2aHmQDggV8DB7UHZR7mBS2AVViND9Y32NtV9", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "xbt.money", "published": "2018-05-31T18:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ripple CEO Compares Bitcoin to Napster, Says BTC’s Influence on Market Could Lessen", "text": "Ripple CEO Compares Bitcoin to Napster, Says BTC’s Influence on Market Could Lessen May 31, 2018 8 Views Brad Garlinghouse , CEO of Ripple (XRP), thinks that Bitcoin’s (BTC) influence on cryptocurrency market prices will eventually decrease, CNBC reported yesterday, May 30. Garlinghouse, referring to cryptocurrency as a “nascent industry,” told reporters that “over time, you’ll see a more rational market and behaviors that reflect that,” adding:\n“There’s gonna be a bit of a correction along the way here where a lot of the players in the space that don’t actually solve a real problem are going to get washed out.”\nDuring a conference this week, Garlinghouse spoke of Bitcoin’s future as potentially ending up like the now defunct music service Napster, TechCrunch reported yesterday. He noted that Napster “showed us what’s possible, but in the end, it was Spotify and iTunes and Pandora that won the day because they engaged with regulators.”\nRipple’s CEO also spoke to CNBC about crypto and securities regulation in the U.S., in response to the fact that a former U.S. government regulator said last month that both Ripple and Ethereum (ETH) could likely be considered unregistered securities . In Garlinghouse’s opinion, the coin is not a security under U.S. law because owning XRP is not comparable with owning stock in a company:\n“If you own XRP, you don’t own rights to the profits or any dividends to the company. XRP has real utility.”\nHowever, Garlinghouse did note that the company has been “an advocate of ‘yes, the government should get involved,’” stating: “The SEC is getting involved as they should because there have been frauds committed […] the government should be protecting investors and companies but there’s also examples of real utility.”\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently launched “Operation Cryptosweep,” in collaboration with Canadian authorities, investigating potentially fraudulent crypto companies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICO).

Investors are looking for fundamentals to support the price of Bitcoin. The Consensus 2018 event evidently failed to bring the kind of rally many in the industry were expecting. Yes, it did bring some Lamborghinis in town, but if you are speaking of super and exotic cars, then NYC most definitely is the wrong place because Monaco’s crypto event was far better (given that the event was during the Festival de Cannes and car enthusiasts brought their classic and supercars to test them on the formula one track ahead of the F1 racing week). Perhaps, next year, when the event takes place again, hopefully, speculators will not count on this event as a bullish factor.\nShutterstock\nFollowing today’s surprise move by Donald Trump to impose steel and aluminium tariffs on Canada, Mexico and the EU, traders are bracing themselves for increased market volatility. This could provide the much-anticipated tailwind in the crypto-markets, as Bitcoin could once again become an ideal hedge opportunity .\nDuring the month of May, central bankers and governments have further praised the adoption of the blockchain technology. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has talked more positively about the importance of the Central Bank Digital Currency, CBDC, a complete U-turn compared to his speech back in February.\nXi Jinping, the Chinese president, also decided that it is about time to concur with the leading governments on the serious potential of the blockchain technology. This was the first time we have had anything positive from the Chinese president about blockchain. For investors, this is a welcoming initiative (adopted by the president) because it could be only a matter of time before the People’s Bank of China echoes the same stance. However, this does not necessarily mean that the ban on cryptocurrencies is going to vanish, but the leash may start to loosen up.\nIn terms of jurisdiction, Malta remains an attractive place for exchanges to conduct their business and given that some major exchanges such as Binance and OKEx are already operating in Malta, the Mediterranean island has started to attract exchanges from less crypto-friendly jurisdiction. Friendly jurisdiction only means that exchanges have more support from government and banks. For instance, the biggest exchange in Poland decided that they are no longer happy in Poland and picked up Malta as their new destination. While in Tallinn, Estonia, at the Tokeneconomic conference, I was moderating a panel on this particular topic; choosing a favourite jurisdiction. I suggested Malta has become more popular because the process of setting such business there is much less burdensome and more time efficient. A famous crypto lawyer, Cal Evans, founder of Gresham International, agreed and said “Malta is a great jurisdiction for secondary market players. Their speed and upcoming legislation make them an obvious choice for companies looking for regulatory certainty while getting the best tax advantages.”\nTechnical Perspective From a technical analysis perspective, if we look at the monthly chart of the Bitcoin price, it’s good news for the bulls that the previous month’s low is holding. Also, Bitcoin’s highest price ($9795) for the month of May is higher than the previous month (April’s high $9755). In other words, a small bull signal. However, the closing price of Bitcoin at the end of the month is lower than the opening price of the month. This illustrates that the bears are still holding on to their ground.

The machines can be used to purchase bitcoin — currently trading at more than $7,500 per unit — as well as other digital currencies, according to the company's website.\nAnd Prague isn't alone. There are bitcoin ATMs all over America, according to Coin ATM Radar , an online tool that tracks the machines.\nCoin ATM Radar's tracking shows that the United States boasts the most bitcoin ATMs in the world by far, with 1,960 of them.\nLos Angeles, where bitcoin ATMs reportedly date back to 2014, is the U.S. city with the most of the machines, with 250, according to Coin ATM Radar. There are also nearly 170 of the ATMs in Chicago and over 120 in both New York City and Atlanta. Washington, D.C. has more than 60 of the machines, and Texas-based company Coinsource is reportedly set to install 20 more machines in the nation's capital by the end of the year.\nCanada comes in second as a nation, with 540 crypto ATMS. show chapters 7:10 PM ET Tue, 30 Jan 2018 | 00:59\nThere are roughly 46 bitcoin ATMs in the Czech Republic, and more than 3,150 active located in 70 countries around the world, according to Coin ATM Radar.\nThe machines, which are made by a variety of different manufacturers , allow prospective cryptocurrency investors to buy their own digital currency on the spot by inserting cash to initiate a digital transaction that transfers the purchased bitcoin (or other cryptocurrency) via either a paper receipt or an online \" wallet ,\" where digital currency can be safely stored. Also, some bitcoin ATMs support two-way transactions, which means you can even sell your bitcoin and have cash dispensed on the spot.\nA two-minute tutorial video posted on the website of General Bytes, the second-largest producer of bitcoin ATMs, shows how a customer can insert cash into the machines to purchase bitcoin while scanning a QR code to choose the digital address where they want to receive the bitcoin. The company sells its bitcoin ATMs online , with models selling for as much as $9,499. General Bytes said in a press release in April 2018 that it had sold more than 1,500 bitcoin ATMs worldwide, though Coin ATM Radar puts the number at 850.\nU.S.-based Genesis Coin has installed its own bitcoin ATMs in 1,065 locations.\nMeanwhile, bitcoin's price has rebounded somewhat recently, but the digital currency has still been a highly volatile investment for much of 2018, as its value is still more than 60 percent off its peak from December 2017.\nDon't miss:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://coinatmradar.com/manufacturers/", "https://nypost.com/2014/08/21/nycs-first-bitcoin-atm-to-open-for-business/", "https://wamu.org/story/18/05/09/washingtonians-want-buy-sell-bitcoin-just-go-atm/", "https://www.generalbytes.com/batmthree/", "http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-bitcoin-atm-20140613-story.html", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-qc149KwDo", "https://services.generalbytes.com/cs/", "https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet", "https://coinatmradar.com/blog/how-to-use-printed-paper-wallet-on-receipt-from-a-bitcoin-atm/", "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-holds-7000-volatility-trends-lower-2018-05-29", "https://www.generalbytes.com/1500-atms-sold/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anthony wallace/afp", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "general bytes", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "prague", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "czech republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T18:33:43.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "37f38187f9ecaf6059611c03b7bc687e60e5518a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRHRQOcVqN.HJfqvW56gIOY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin Advantage and Disadvantage", "title_full": "Bitcoin Advantage and Disadvantage", "published": "2018-05-31T18:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "37f38187f9ecaf6059611c03b7bc687e60e5518a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRHRQOcVqN.HJfqvW56gIOY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "johnlhy253", "published": "2018-05-31T18:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Advantage and Disadvantage", "text": "I'm new to bitcoin, What are the advantage and this advantage of using bitcoin.

I only have a little understanding about the idea of currency and its value although i've already been at it all my life.

It is the market that decides if something has value and how much.\nA good example is gold. The value it has today is because of the price the people are willing to buy it for. But trap those same people in a desert and sell them water or gold, then I believe water would be more in demand, making it more \"valuable\".\nBitcoin càn big help their need of people because of good profit and we can earn money.

Date: in: Bitcoin 0 Views\nBitcoin price movement and volatility might well be a reliable indicator of how the overall market is likely to behave during regular trading hours. According to Brian Stutland , of Equity Armor Investments, the largest cryptocurrency is somehow becoming the next Volatility Index or VIX, for determining the credit risk in the banking industry. Bitcoin vs. CBOE VIX ‘ @BrianStutland breaks down why #bitcoin could be the new fear gauge pic.twitter.com/tAYnkbmKds Sponsored Links\n— Options Action (@OptionsAction) May 29, 2018\nProfessionals have long used the CBOE VIX as a measure of volatility and fear in the marketplace. After carefully studying bitcoin’s price movement and comparing it with VIX price action, Stutland believes the virtual currency could also be used to determine investor’s sentiments in various marketplaces.\n“There is huge correlation right now between VIX and bitcoin 30 days ago, 30 trading days ago, that is starting to measure out credit risk in the market,” Stutland said.\n“That’s what cryptocurrency is becoming. It’s becoming a way to sort of de-risk yourself from credit risk in the banking industry.”\nBitcoin price movement has always seemed to have had a ripple effect on the broader cryptocurrency sector. The pioneer cryptocurrency’s rally has most of the time been associated with growing investor confidence in the industry; a stance that has always had a positive impact on other cryptocurrencies. Other digital assets also tend to edge lower whenever bitcoin takes a drop.\nIt remains to be seen if professional investors will keep a close eye on bitcoin’s price movement as a way of gaining a head start on the volatility in the broader, well-regulated stock market. The fact that cryptocurrencies are in many ways unregulated means most traders would be extremely cautious in using bitcoin to gauge investor confidence in the mainstream sector. Bitcoin Rallies, Dow Plunges\nThe correlation between Bitcoin and VIX was brought to question on May 29, 2018, as the virtual currency held steady while the broader market came under immense pressure. The cryptocurrency rallied from the $7,100 to highs of $7,400.\nIn contrast, all the major indices had a turbulent day, closing on the red as the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed nearly 400 points, amid losses in Goldman Sachs, Boeing, and JPMorgan. The S&P 500 was down 1.16 percent as the NASDAQ lost 0.5 percent to finish the day at $7,396.\nThe sell-off was triggered by political turmoil in Italy that sent the Euro tumbling. Things turned from bad to worse on the revelation that the U.S. and China are still far off on trade talks. Tuesday’s sell-off marked the third consecutive day of losses for the Dow and the S&P 500. Bitcoin Weekly Outlook\nBitcoin bounced back after hitting its lowest level in May 2018 near the $7,000 handle. The cryptocurrency had come under pressure early in the week after it emerged that the Department of Justice had opened an investigation over possible price manipulation allegations. There have been claims that people with vast holdings might be engaging in illegal trading practices in a bid to swing prices of the cryptocurrency to their advantage.\nBitcoin appears to have bounced back following the allegations after rallying from the $7,100 handle to above the $7,400 mark. Given that the crypto is still trading in a downtrend, it may have to rise and close above the $7,750 handle, if it is to be considered a buy from the current level.\nAfter plunging from the highs, the crypto appears to have found support at the $7,500 handle, from where it is trying to make a comeback. The long-term outlook shows bears taking control especially on the virtual currency falling and trading below $7,500.

Don’t worry, even if you’re new to Bitcoin on Linux, this isn’t too difficult. At the start, the program states that “Bitcoin Core will download and store a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain”.

Click the “File” button, then select “Backup wallet”. In the file browser dialog, write out the name of your backup (it saves as a .dat file) and click the save button. Soon after, your wallet will be saved! Encrypt Wallet\nEncrypting your Bitcoin wallet is a good idea, as it adds security. To start encrypting, click the “Settings” menu button, look for “Encrypt wallet” and click on it. From there, a menu will appear asking to enter a secure password. Do so, but keep in mind that this password can’t be recovered, so be sure to write your password down on a piece of paper and place it in a home safe (or some other safe location).\nHaving trouble coming up with a secure password? Consider using the Strongpasswordgenerator.com website.\nEnter your password two times and click OK. After that, read the warning and click “YES” once you understand it.

Various government authorities have launched investigations relating to cryptocurrencies.\nGoldman Sachs plans to begin a Bitcoin trading operation, citing interest from their clients.\nGovernments, particularly state and local governments, will be using cryptocurrencies to obtain money for associating with specific cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies have been on a wild ride over the past year. Bitcoin, which was the first of what are now some 1600 different versions, rose dramatically from about $1800 to a peak of over $19000 on December 16, 2017 as shown on Chart I attached. This peak was reached soon after the Chicago Mercantile Exchange began trading in Bitcoin futures. The currency then fell to a low around $6600 in April this year only to rise to nearly $10000 in May before falling back to its current value around $8000. Considering the cost of computers that are necessary to \"mine\" a crypto currency and the cost of the electricity necessary to run the computers, many estimate the break even price of Bitcoin to be right around its current level. But this has not deterred forecasters from projecting wide deviations from this break even level. Indeed, skeptics such as Warren Buffet proscribe a value of zero to the currency while some are projecting a rise to as much as $64000 in the foreseeable future. The recent rebound in Bitcoin and its cohorts was interrupted by a series of negative developments. Aside from Warren Buffet denouncing it at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting, Korean prosecutors exercised a search warrant on the nation's largest crypto exchange, UPbit. In that warrant prosecutors alleged that the exchange has been transferring funds from customer accounts to a separate account allegedly belonging to an executive of UPbit. Instances of alleged fraud and theft via computer hacking have come to light on a fairly regular basis. Indeed, in just the last week U.S. prosecutors announced a wide ranging investigation into crypto price fixing and manipulation. This has not deterred enthusiasts from predicting eventual widespread acceptance of cryptos. In our report last January titled The Cryptocurrency Craze we pointed out that cryptocurrency transactions are still too slow and cumbersome to replace most other mediums of exchange. Moreover, the price of cryptos fluctuates wildly on a daily basis, significantly impeding their reliability as a means of payment or as a unit of account. To some extent, the slowness is a technology issue that could be overcome as computers continue to become faster and more powerful. Self-driving cars are an imperfect analogy. The technology is not yet at hand, but autonomous vehicles may eventually be economically feasible. Flying cars are a less optimistic analogy. These have been forecast to be economically feasible in movies and magazines since the 1930s. But technology in this area has run up against physical constraints. Since its notion of use as a medium of exchange has been debunked by us and others, supporters now primarily emphasize its function as a store of value. Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) pointed to the desire to use cryptocurrency for this purpose in its announcement of plans to begin a Bitcoin trading operation. A Goldman spokesperson noted that the firm concluded that Bitcoin is not a fraud. But while it does not have the characteristics of a currency, hedge funds, endowments, and foundations express interest in holding it as a valuable commodity given the limited quantity of Bitcoin that can ever be \"mined\" in a complex virtual system. Goldman said \"it resonates with us when a client says, \"I want to hold Bitcoin or Bitcoin futures because I think it is an alternate to gold as a store of value\". There are currently 1,624 cryptocurrencies of which a partial list is shown on Table I attached. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is about $380 billion. Four account for about $266 billion or about 70% of the total. By far the largest with about $147 billion in market capitalization is Bitcoin. Many use the terms \"Bitcoin\" and \"cryptocurrency\" interchangeably. The other major cryptocurrencies are: Ethereum with about $67 billion of market capitalization, Ripple with about $27 billion in market capitalization, and Bitcoin cash with about $24 billion in market capitalization. While these are all cryptocurrencies there are significant differences among them. Ethereum is technically not the name of a cryptocurrency but rather the name of the blockchain company that created the cryptocurrency \"ether\". Ethereum and ether are now used interchangeably and most refer to the cryptocurrency ether as Ethereum. Many believe Ethereum will ultimately be more important than Bitcoin. A consortium called the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance , which includes companies like Microsoft ( MSFT ) and J P Morgan ( JPM ), is developing uses for the Ethereum blockchain. While Bitcoin has no use other than as a medium of exchange or store of value, Ethereum's ether is also a type of fuel which must be purchased in order to use and access the Ethereum blockchain platform. The main advantage that Ethereum has over Bitcoin is smart contracts. A smart contract is one that is written in code into a blockchain. Once the terms of the contract are met by each party, a deal would be automatically executed. Smart contracts are very useful in applications such as gambling and financial transactions. In addition to its use as a medium of exchange and store of value, Ethereum's ether has an intrinsic value as a fuel that must be bought by the many entities that are employing smart contracts on the platform. Some predict that Bitcoin may be adapted to include smart contracts in the future. On May 17, 2018 China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology released its public blockchain ratings , ranking various blockchain projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum in the global cryptocurrency sector based on three criteria: technology, application, and innovation. Ethereum received the highest ranking while Bitcoin was ranked at only 13. The top five were Ethereum, Steem, Lisk, NEO, and Komodo, all of which utilize smart contracts. Ripple has a very low price relative to the others and as a result it has been popular with investors/speculators. The Ripple digital currency, known as XRP, may be used by enterprises to get instant liquidity needed to consummate a high-value transaction without incurring fees. XRP acts as a bridge between fiat currencies during a transaction. Ripple said transactions in XRP can be settled in four seconds, faster than any existing major cryptocurrency. Bitcoin cash is a version of Bitcoin that was created by a split in Bitcoin. Those who owned Bitcoin at the time received free Bitcoin cash tokens. Many developers voiced concern over the high transaction time on a Bitcoin network. As a result, they proposed a solution that would increase the size of each transaction and therefore boost the speed. But not all in the community agreed with the proposal, resulting in the split. The supporters of Bitcoin cash claim that transaction times are faster than the original Bitcoin. In our report from January, 2018 we pointed out that digital cryptocurrency would eventually replace money as we know it today. But before this would occur we also suggested that government would take control of the cryptocurrency universe. Government would then know the exact real identity of all blockchain wallet owners, giving government knowledge of all transactions. Government and banks, central and otherwise, would then be the sole creators of the cryptocurrency and would control the amount outstanding. The first step in how governments might get involved could involve cashing in on their names and status. Already there is a patent pending \"Systems and methods for managing and processing transactions where legal tender status may be established for cryptocurrencies\". This would allow cash hungry governments at the national, state, and even local level to obtain income from cryptocurrencies without financial risk. Russia and Turkey have floated the prospect of a national cryptocurrency and Venezuela has actually launched one called the Petro. The price of one Petro is pegged to the price of one barrel of Venezuelan oil. The main purposes of the Petro were to evade sanctions and raise desperately needed cash. The Venezuelan government has already defaulted on debt so trusting Venezuela to honor its promise with regard to the Petro would seem no less risky than trusting it to pay interest on its bonds. The challenge all cryptocurrencies face is attracting miners who use the crypto of choice for transactions, as a store of value, or as a speculative instrument. There is a need for each crypto to devise some feature that allows for a market share gain over others. It is presently unlikely that a crypto directly issued by a government or a central bank would receive immediate wide acceptance since the major original attraction of cryptos was that they were independent from governments or central banks. However, a crypto that had some element of legal tender status would clearly have a competitive advantage over its competitors. We think the eventual replacement of paper money with a digital crypto could involve municipalities issuing what might be described as a put warrant. This is a security that gives the holder the right (but not the obligation) to sell a given quantity of an underlying asset for an agreed upon price on or before a specified date. A typical put warrant issued via blockchain methodology by a municipality would allow the holder to use specific cryptos to satisfy obligations to the government at a specified exchange rate, which is the strike price. A example of such a transaction might be one in which a municipality issues a crypto put warrant with a market price of $1000 and a strike price of the warrant at $100. This gives the holder of the warrant the right to put to the government one unit of cryptocurrency and be credited with $100 as payment for taxes. This theoretical warrant is far out of the money and would likely never be exercised. The worst case for the municipality is that the crypto's value falls to zero sometime in the future. This would cost the municipality $100 at some future date as the warrant reduces the holder's tax burden by using one unit of cryptocurrency to satisfy all or part of its obligation to the municipal government. However, the municipality had initially received more than $100 in return for issuing the warrant so it will always benefit or at worst break even. The cryptocurrency that first aligns itself with a municipal government will likely be a winner during the period that the transition to a digital currency gradually occurs. That particular crypto would enjoy a first mover advantage in a new world monetary order. Summary and Conclusions We agree with GS that Bitcoin is not a fraud. To some extent cryptocurrencies comprise an asset class different from any that has ever existed before. GS and their clients appear to be applying Modern Portfolio Theory and the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which says that the most efficient portfolio is one that includes all possible invest-able assets. Current portfolio theory textbooks, now indicate that all invest-able assets should include collectibles, art, real estate, bullion etc. A consensus among those in the financial theory community that cryptocurrencies are an asset class that makes a portfolio more efficient, could provide a boost to cryptocurrencies. A thing to keep an eye on is whether other major financial market participants follow GS with regard to the cryptocurrencies. Despite claims by some, we have not seen any methodology which can be used to arrive at an intrinsic value for a cryptocurrency. This is certainly an impediment to cryptocurrency achieving the status of an asset class that would routinely be included in well diversified portfolios. The next major event in the cryptocurrency space will likely be the integration with cryptocurrencies by state and local governments. This will involve quasi-legal tender status being obtained by some cryptocurrencies, in that under some circumstances, cryptocurrencies could be used to satisfy obligations to state and local governments. It is not clear if this will provide a boost for the entire cryptocurrency space or result in distinct winners and losers among the cryptocurrencies. In order to integrate with the public finance issuers, cryptocurrencies will have to provide financial incentives to the cash-hungry state and local governments. The winners and losers among the cryptocurrencies may, in a large part, depend on which particular have the ability, willingness or political connections to be among the earliest to achieve quasi-legal tender status via integration with state and local governments.

Photo: iStockphoto\nA mosque in Britain’s capital is willing to receive your donation—in bitcoin. The Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said.\n“For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,” said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology.\n“For the donor, it’s just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque’s perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,” Musial said.\nEgypt’s Grand Mufti, the nation’s top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque’s decision.\n“Bitcoin is like any other currency. It’s… accepted by a group of people…. We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved… we are a charity,” Adeyemi told Reuters .\nThe mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results. It says it is on track to double its donations this year to more than £10,000 ($13,300).\nMuslims with the means are religiously obliged to give alms, often calculated as being 2.5% of their wealth, and many do so during the holy month of Ramazan, a time when Muslim charities are most active.\n 09 13 AM IST", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lukasz musial", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "musial", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egyptia", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "shacklewell lane mosque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dalston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T08:23:05.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cf2759130c83fd24e97b068d40e6f35612d36416", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQfi6RaB89_4xvuKTvvzsCg-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=56.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Gambling", "title": "Cloudbet.com -

It’s early, over time you’ll see a more rational market and behaviors that reflect that,” Garlinghouse told CNBC.\nThe manner in which Garlinghouse describes the independent use cases for the numerous digital assets resembles that of unique asset classes in the broader financial markets, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, etc. If the bitcoin price performance were to no longer trade in tandem with the broader crypto market, this may suggest that there would be separate asset classes under the cryptocurrency umbrella.\nMeanwhile, if you ask Garlinhouse, of the 1,500-plus digital currencies that are being traded, only 1% of them will be around in a decade.\n“There’s gonna be a bit of a correction along the way here where a lot of the players in the space that don’t actually solve a real problem are going to get washed out,” Garlinghouse told CNBC.\nGarlinghouse is at the helm of blockchain startup Ripple, which owns most of the XRP cryptocurrency and is the No. 3 digital currency by market cap. While altcoins tend to jockey for position, none have been able to knock bitcoin out of its top spot. Some market participants are anticipating No. 2 cryptocurrency Ethereum will do so, an event that’s been dubbed a flippening. Early Innings\nMeanwhile, the first quarter of 2018 was a mixed bag for cross-border payments startup Ripple. The company set new records operationally, but the XRP coin that’s tied to it was sent reeling. XRP lost nearly three-quarters of its value in Q1 2018. The bitcoin price was about halved in Q1.\nGarlinghouse pointed out that it remains early innings for the industry, while others maintain the cryptocurrency market remains in the pre-game stage.\n“It’s still a nascent industry, the speculation in the market dominates the trading activity. I think it’s a matter of time until people better understand the different use cases,” Garlinhouse told CNBC.\nOn the operational side, Ripple couldn’t have done better. The company signed nearly two dozen first-time production contracts, a record pace for the payments startup. Among its new partners is Islamic lender Kuwait Finance House as CCN previously reported . Ripple inked a partnership with MoneyGram earlier this year in which the remittance company is piloting the payments platform.\nFeatured image from Flickr.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/30/bitcoins-influence-over-cryptocurrency-prices-could-end-soon-says-ripple-ceo.html", "https://hacked.com/continue-reading"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "garlinghouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad garlinghouse", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T15:59:25.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "03503cbab1fb7600604bfc8b6a577f81815f7140", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgvt5m5Ip7pS_gLuOopd8QTar84XSE_idY2M.lZmIgIktL.tl3zIC37DPnPplDlU0YwyB2TsqrQ3hVgyn8lSmY0N8eCAfoC9u0", "site_full": "internetdo.com", "site": "internetdo.com", "site_section": "http://internetdo.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Internet Do", "title": "Bitcoin bulls see silver lining as speculators flushed out", "title_full": "Bitcoin bulls see silver lining as speculators flushed out", "published": "2018-05-31T17:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "03503cbab1fb7600604bfc8b6a577f81815f7140", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgvt5m5Ip7pS_gLuOopd8QTar84XSE_idY2M.lZmIgIktL.tl3zIC37DPnPplDlU0YwyB2TsqrQ3hVgyn8lSmY0N8eCAfoC9u0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-31T17:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin bulls see silver lining as speculators flushed out", "text": "The topsy-turvy week for digital currencies looks set to continue with most major coins trading higher Thursday, bucking Wednesday’s moves where most digital currencies finished the day in the red.

First, a bit of disclosure. We are not associated or affiliated in any way with the 365 Bitcoin Trader Robot, App, and automated trading software. In fact, it took our research staff about one minute to add the fraudulent 365 Bitcoin Trader system (not to be confused with Crypto Robot 365) to our scam bucket blacklist, as we have immediately identified it as a clone and replica of the viral Bitcoin Trader scam which we have already discussed in great detail here at Binary Scam Alerts. The new 365 Bitcoin Trader scam represents everything which is wrong and ethically problematic with trading Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies online. Yes, it is very much possible to achieve wealth by trading virtual currencies, but lets be honest. The 365 Bitcoin Trader app is NOT an investment platform, and in reality has nothing to do with cryptocurrencies or for that matter anything related to online trading. It is merely a shell and facade used in a very deceptive and misleading manner, and in a way which appeals to the most basic instincts of human beings. Its true, we all want to get rich and understand that we need to do it fast in order to get ahead in life. This notion, coupled with the pressures of every day life and the MASSIVE media hype bitcoin has been receiving provides the perfect breeding ground for cunning online scammers who are out to get your credit card details. In addition, this is one of those rare cases where we were able to catch the con artists before they were able to complete their crime. As we dive into the facts and start connecting the dots, the evidence will start to surface and the picture will become very clear. So keep reading our revealing 365 bitcoin trader review to see how we caught these cheaters red-handed and exposed their dirty little operation.\n : 365bitcointrader.com\nLet’s Get Right Into It – Proof of Scam! Here we have a comparative screenshot. On one side we can see the 365 Bitcoin Trader members area, and right next to it the one from Bitcoin Trader. You don’t need to be a rocket scientist to understand what’s being done here, as this is obviously a crude attempt to copy a fake sales gimmick which for some unknown reason has been able to trick and bait thousands of innocent opportunity seekers looking to cash in on a legit crypto app.\nHere’s some additional proof. Again, the text is copied verbatim in a very careless and unprofessional manner. Obviously someone wasn’t fully aware of how difficult it is getting these days to scam and victimize potential customers as the internet makes everything transparent and open to the public for scrutiny.\nAnd here is the last piece of evidence we were able to produce. This is probably the worst mistake any scammer can do, and that is allowing himself to get caught with gibberish on the sales page instead of actual and meaningful content. I mean how sloppy can you get right? Well, that goes to show you that even the most persistent con artists can get lazy and slack off. But that’s OK because this is exactly where we catch them red-handed and shed light on their activities.\n365 Bitcoin Trader Review If we made a mistake we apologize as there was no way for us to fully ascertain if the 365 Bitcoin Trader is a manual signals or automated trading software. There is always a third option which is also used by scammers. Sometimes there is NOTHING THERE! Sometimes it’s just a grandiose sales pitch with an empty shell and broken promises designed to get you to fund a real money trading account with an unregulated offshore broker. This time we can’t really say because we were not able to signup, so we are basing our assessment according to our previous experience with similar software and according to what we are seeing the same modus operandi (method of operation) is being used. Namely the affiliate marketers produce the customers by generating interest via EMAIL Spam, annoying popup ads, or fake reviews. Then the brokers rob the day-traders and split the stash in what is commonly referred to as a revenue-share scheme.\nUnfortunately there is not much to add here, I mean we can talk about “laser-accurate performance and superior technology” or award winning apps, but that is a mere rehash of older texts and we have no inclination to produce rehashed content because some scammer decided to copy a stupid sales page. It’s also plain to see they are using the Richard Branson and Elon Musk video saying that “Bitcoin is all the rage” and if you don’t invest now you stand to lose out on the deal of the century (or something along those lines). At some point we just have to say stop and move on because these types of get-rich-quick schemes are so nauseating and repetitious that you just have to recognize its a scam and move on.\nCan I Make Money With 365 Bitcoin Trader? No, it is not possible as it is designed with the premeditated and malicious intent of getting you to LOSE money and NOT earn it. That is the simple fact, and the ones making the money are promoters and thieving brokers who will lie through their teeth in order to get you signed up and depositing.\nIs It Free? Obviously not! It’s going to cost you at least $250 to activate this software or scheme (honestly we are not quite sure at this point), and that money will be charged to your credit card so don’t invest and stay alert.\nFake 365 Bitcoin Trader Reviews We have just spotted a few despite the fact that the scheme has not even been launched, but we are sure that at some point we will see more fake review sites endorsing this offer (for the lack of a better word) in the hopes that you signup and the referring agent will be paid affiliate commissions.\nAlarming Fact: We have just found out that the affiliate crooks behind the 365 Bitcoin Trader software are the same ones behind the Crypto Robot 365 and Binary Robot 365 (see a pattern?)\nSystems That Actually Work Fake software like the 365 Bitcoin Trader SCAM are launched on a daily basis, and they all have the same thing in common. They are designed to get you to lose money and by doing that the crooks behind it transfer part of that money back to themselves (that’s the secret formula). However, once in a while there is a viable system that actually produces results and performs as advertised. That is when we test it and if it is consistently profitable (in the ~ 87% ITM ratio) then we add it to the recommended section.\n365 Bitcoin Trader Review Summary and Recommendations The 365 Bitcoin Trader SCAM is blacklisted and this is not even up for debate. If you are unsure about the authenticity of our review and despite everything still believe you need a second opinion, then you need to take a closer look at the facts and maybe consider other ways to generate money online because trading is most likely not for you. It’s also important to stress that any form of trading, especially anything related to cryptocurrencies or Forex trading has a high degree of risk attached to it. We don’t see these types of warnings anywhere, in fact the opposite is true as these crooks are trying to get you to drop your guard,trap you, and steal your money. In short, please avoid the 365 Bitcoin Trader scam software and seek alternative and more legitimate trading opportunities.

It will have a different name, if it exists. There will have been many hard forks changing it and changing it.
