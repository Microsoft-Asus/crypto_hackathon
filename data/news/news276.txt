Residential Strong Arm Robbery\nThey say that crime never pays. For five men in Georgia, that was certainly the case.\nAs reported by 11 Alive , the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office arrested five men in connection with a conspiracy to invade a Forsyth County home in the hopes of making off with upwards of $1 million in Bitcoin, the world’s most popular and expensive cryptocurrency.\nThe arrests come after a 4-month-long investigation, following the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office Narcotics Unit’s response to what was initially believed to be a drug investigation at a local hotel. On January 29, narcotics authorities intervened on four males in possession of zip ties, latex gloves, duct tape, and bandanas. The men were released, however, due to a lack of sufficient evidence.\nThe subsequent investigation revealed that the men were not planning a drug-related crime. Rather, they were after someone’s Bitcoin fortune. The four men – Trivette Adams, Matthew Schwartz, Jacob South and Michael McDermont – were allegedly planning to rob a homeowner of his digital currency.\nAdams and McDermont were apprehended near the Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta before they were able to flee by airplane. The former tried to make a run for it but failed to outrun the deputies.\nSouth and Schwartz, meanwhile, were able to fly out of Atlanta. However, two Major Crimes Unit detectives in Chicago caught up to the criminals and extradited both with help from the Chicago Police Department.\nFinally, a fifth suspect, Justin Ellison of Illinois, was arrested on May 11 following an interview conducted by Illinois detectives in connection to the investigation. As noted by 11 Alive :\nTrivette Adams, 20, of Pflugerville, Tex., has been charged with residential strong arm robbery and criminal trespass; Robert South, 21, of Norcross has been charged with residential strong arm robbery; Matthew Schwartz, 18, of Hesperia, Calif., has been charged with residential strong arm robbery; Michael McDermott, 18, has been charged with residential strong arm robbery and criminal trespass; Justin Ellison, 20, of Worth, Ill., has been charged with residential strong arm robbery and conspiracy to commit a felony.\nThe foiled conspiracy should serve as a reminder to keep not only your private keys hidden, but also keep the contents of said wallets on a need-to-know basis.\nWhat measures have you taken to prevent the criminal theft of your cryptocurrency holdings?

Genesis, as many of you reading this might know, is the world’s largest cloud bitcoin mining company, with over 2 million customers worldwide. It calls Iceland home, whose cool climate and affordable green energy are ideal for mining newly minted virgin cryptocurrencies. Last year, Genesis helped connect the blockchain sector and traditional capital markets by partnering with HIVE Blockchain Technologies, the first publicly traded digital currency mining firm.\nThis week, Marco will be one of the panelists at the Consensus 2018 blockchain technology summit in New York, which I will also be attending. Below are highlights from our conversation. Tell us how you got started in this industry.\nI’ve always had a passion for mathematics, science, physics. I wanted to understand how nature works. I used to spend days and nights in the library, and I was actually on my way to becoming a math professor.\nBut then blockchain and bitcoin came along, and that changed everything. At the time, the community was very small, but the ideas and visions were very big. No one fully realized then how fast it would all grow or just how revolutionary it could end up being. I watched as new marketplaces began to emerge, businesses began to bet on bitcoin and people started adopting it. More and more exchanges popped up. All of this happened within a year of me first reading about blockchain and bitcoin—it progressed that quickly.\nIt was clear that something big was happening. The world was changing, and I needed to be part of it. How would you describe bitcoin to someone who knew nothing about it?\nWith bitcoin, you can send money anywhere in the world to anywhere else without worrying about boundaries or having the transaction controlled or stopped by a third party. It’s a completely independent, decentralized, peer-to-peer system. This is what makes it so revolutionary.\nThe conventional banking system really shows its limitations when we try to move money between developed and underdeveloped countries, particularly those in Africa. There are some serious inefficiencies that, frankly, many of the big banks just aren’t interested in fixing. But with bitcoin, you don’t have to worry about that. You can send money to, say, a coffee farmer in Africa, and he’ll receive it directly.\nMoney transfers are only one among a number of many other uses. Bitcoin is also a store of value. It’s one of the few assets that I would say are uncorrelated to the broader financial markets.\nAs for blockchain, it has innumerable world-changing applications across a wide range of industries. That’s why I believe it’s crucial that people have the right information about blockchain and understand it. If people don’t understand it, and it gets overhyped, I’m afraid it could start going in the wrong direction. We recently mined the 17 millionth bitcoin, leaving only four million left. Explain why it becomes exponentially more difficult to mine coins the closer we get to that 21 million-coin ceiling.\nIt’s not that the mining itself becomes more difficult. To answer this, I think we have to look at two components.\nOne component is the daily supply of bitcoin. At the moment, only 1,800 bitcoins can be generated every day by the whole network, meaning all the miners worldwide. But it’s important to remember that after every 210,000 blocks that are mined, the rewards are halved. What this means is that after the next halving, which I believe is expected sometime in 2020, the number of bitcoins mined a day will fall from 1,800 to 900. And then after the next halving, it’ll be 450. This helps reduce the supply in a natural way. click to enlarge\nThe second component is a measure of how many miners and how much computing power is in the network. If more miners come online, then of course the competition becomes greater. Because the daily supply is already fixed, your market share shrinks. click to enlarge\nThink of it like the California Gold Rush. Mining gold at first was relatively easy because the metal was plentiful and there were few miners. By the end, it became more difficult because the easy gold had already been claimed, and you were competing with far more miners. We’re seeing the same thing happen with bitcoin and other mineable digital currencies. Speaking of computing power, HIVE Blockchain just announced that it expanded to 24.2 megawatts (MW), up from 2.4 MW in August. What’s next in the pipeline for HIVE?\nYes, the last expansion was a massive build-out in Sweden. It was done in three phases. I think this was a remarkable achievement for HIVE, that it could add so much computing power so quickly.\nThis is only the beginning. The year is still long and you can expect to see some bigger expansions on the way. In September, for example, we’re going to ramp up another bitcoin mining facility worth 20 MW, which is very exciting. And from there it goes even further. G20 finance ministers are scheduled to share their plans for more uniform regulation of cryptocurrencies by July. What are your expectations?\nI personally think that this is very good and that it will bring more professionalism into the market. The momentum and adoption has grown so much and so rapidly that there really needs to be some kind of strategy—the world’s economic leaders can’t just leave this space untouched. Anyone who believes otherwise isn’t facing reality.\nHaving said that, regulating this market will not be easy because it’s in a whole other dimension than anything that has come before it. As an analogy, imagine someone trying to regulate flying cars using the same measures that have been written for cars driving on the street. It wouldn’t make any sense. So there will certainly need to be some innovation to get it right. I think it’s also important that the regulators talk to the right people, the industry leaders. They have good input, and I think it could be a very fruitful dialogue. Along those same lines, South Korea’s central bank just announced that it was looking seriously into how the Korean economy might use blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Specifically, there’s talk of the country going cashless by 2020. Do you think that’s where the global financial systems are headed?\nI think there’s a natural incentive for governments to go in that direction because, of course, they want to have greater control over their economies. But as is the case with overregulation, too many controls—or going completely cashless—could be harmful to the economy. This is certainly part of a long and interesting debate, and I’m curious to see how it plays out, in South Korea and elsewhere. Where do you see the best application of blockchain technology right now?\nBlockchain’s greatest contribution is its ability to erase boundaries. It completely removes the element of trust—or distrust, I should say—and adds a stabilizing effect to nearly every industry because of decentralization.\nTake the global banking industry, for example. You don’t need to look far to find some serious inefficiencies, as I mentioned earlier. We’re already seeing some very concrete instances where blockchain can be of help here. The banks recognize this and are getting together to make use of this technology to improve their services. What’s been the greatest challenge you’ve faced so far in your journey?\nFor me, the greatest challenge can usually be found in the moment that you’re currently in. I always compare this industry to the beginning of the internet—no one knew where it was headed or what it would eventually look like. Most people had a general idea that it was innovative and could benefit the world, but the full implications were unclear.\nSimilarly, no one knows where blockchain and cryptocurrencies might take us, and having to deal with this constant uncertainty is, I’ll admit, not trivial. You must always be prepared to act quickly in response to another bitcoin fork, a hack or some other unexpected event. These are things that keep you up at night.\nBut it’s exciting. I think what history has shown again and again is that it’s dangerous to be ignorant and to not have an open mind. Not everything was euphoric and wonderful when the internet first emerged. Problems still occur online, but I believe most people would agree that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.\nNo industry is without its challenges, and as long as you’re willing to address them, it can be very rewarding. As for blockchain technology, I’m very happy and thrilled to be a part of it this early on.\nInterested in learning more?

The first stemmed from South Korea, one of the largest bitcoin trading hubs in the world.

Late in the week, the price fell below $9,000, accompanied by negative news out of Asia. The rest of the crypto space also plunged reflexively, with most major coins declining twice or even three times as much as Bitcoin.\nSouth Korean prosecutors conducted a raid of the country’s largest Bitcoin exchange, UpBit. Hard drives and ledgers were seized as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent practices. UpBit is suspected of selling crypto to phantom clients.\nThe trustee handling the Mt. Gox bankruptcy case has sold a further 8,000 bitcoins this week, in 4 batches of 2,000 coins. Previous liquidations by this trustee, seemingly conducted without regard for market effects, have also exerted downward price pressure.\nChina’s Huawei corporation placed the BTC.com Bitcoin wallet in its application store. As the Google Play Store and portions of the iTunes store are banned in China, Huawei’s AppGallery is likely to become a popular download destination for Chinese users seeking a mobile wallet.\nFinally, Dandelion – a prototype code for a new privacy-enhancing feature for Bitcoin was released . Dandelion prevents the linkage of IP addresses with new transactions.

We have processed a total of $2,841,345 New Zealand dollars and that’s now worth $7,724,174 in Bitcoin.\n“We’re excited to be able to offer more cryptocurrencies to investors to help diversify their portfolios.”\nBlackmore says the decision to expand to Ethereum first was simple.\n“Ethereum is not only a highly popular cryptocurrency of its own, the technology is also used to power most of the new cryptocurrencies entering the market.\n“What’s more, with the Ethereum blockchain, you can build smart contracts for any industry or use you want: whether it’s in property ownership or logistics,” Blackmore says.\nThe Ethereum network is powered by the ‘Ether’ token, which is what New Zealanders will be able to save with MyCryptoSaver.\nOnce registering on the website, users will be able to buy up to $2,000 worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum every month.\nThe platform allows users to choose what percentage of their payment goes into either coin with a simple slider.\n“As we add more coins to the platform throughout this year, they will have the same requirements in common: be established with a high market cap and liquidity, as well as having a real-world use case,” Blackmore says.\n“Kiwis are seeing the real-world potential of cryptocurrencies and we want to be able to safely and reliably distribute crypto to anyone in New Zealand, whether they have $20 or $2,000 to spend.”\nMyCryptoSaver buys cryptocurrencies in bulk from an overseas exchange to reduce the costs and time usually involved in buying cryptocurrencies as an individual.\nThis enables MyCryptoSaver to provide a better rate to users compared to most other crypto platforms.

(Source: “ Bitcoin Price Is Correlated To Stocks ,” Forbes , May 8, 2018.)\nIn other words, he showed that Bitcoin and the Dow are connected.\nHe offered a specific Dow chart to back up his claims. It showed that a rise in the Index often precedes a rise in Bitcoin prices and vice versa.\nAs for the “why” of the situation, there’s a simple explanation: It’s the Federal Reserve .\nEver since the 2008 financial crisis, the central bank has tried to tempt investors into something known as a “carry trade” . This simply means that Wall Street borrows money at record low interest rates to invest in high-yield assets.\nIf you’ve watched the markets for the last decade, you probably recognize it.\nThe Fed pumped so-called “easy money” into the economy, and the result was a stock market boom from 2009 to now. But that world is falling apart. The Fed raised interest rates five times in the last two years.\n“Trillions of levered QE dollars have pushed the stock market to epic highs,” wrote Chambers. “This process is being unwound and because of that the markets have become extremely volatile.” (Source: Ibid.) Why Should Investors Care?\nScroll down the Dow Jones Index and you’ll see only 30 names, all of them steeped in American history. It’s an exclusive list of blue-chip stocks— Boeing Co (NYSE:BA), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD)—that appear in almost every major portfolio in the world.\nThat amount of liquidity makes the Dow extremely sensitive to changes in the interest rate. Bitcoin, on the other hand, takes some time to respond because trades don’t happen instantly—they sometimes take several hours, if not days.\nThis lag time in Bitcoin trading presents an opportunity. Studious traders can watch the Dow Jones to see if it breaks a tough price point, then execute a similar trade for BTC/USD.\nBut let’s zoom out to 10,000 feet for a moment.\nThere’s a bitter irony in the Dow influencing what happens to Bitcoin prices. Satoshi Nakamoto (the mysterious creator of Bitcoin) would probably shudder at the thought. After all, he made Bitcoin to replace the existing financial system, not to operate as a cute subdivision.\nBitcoin enthusiasts often claim this anti-Fed attitude is what makes cryptocurrency so invaluable.\nI disagree.\nWhat makes cryptocurrency special is the ability to decentralize information structures, build smart contracts, or create an infallible record of something.\nI’m a big fan of these non-political uses of cryptocurrency. Unfortunately, big chunks of the community remain obsessed with toppling central banks and other such cartoonish goals.\nIf anything, the link between Bitcoin and the Dow shatters any myth that BTC/USD prices are driven by an earnest evaluation of cryptocurrency adoption. It isn’t. Traders don’t care whether people are using Bitcoin to pay for Subway sandwiches—they care about the potential return.\nSpeculation, more than anything else, is driving both Bitcoin prices and the Dow Jones Index through the roof. I don’t think the same is true for Ethereum or Ripple, both which provide value to real businesses. Analyst Take\nIf you’re trying to make a quick buck trading cryptocurrencies, this intraday correlation is something you can use to your advantage. However, I am a fundamentals/strategy guy. I like to evaluate the end game of a cryptocurrency.\nSo, my favorites are, and will always be, those investments that actually do something in the real world.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2018/05/08/bitcoin-price-is-correlated-to-stocks/#bb2108440726"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "clem chambers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forbes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "forbes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T09:21:55.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9de9ff74a8968c6695a3b5f679cfe0b771ff2065", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOoXHG419QIpiwuNowKdEDjgEMtdrvqSApeIjIH_jpUzNjMhBHPjs1eJEHfYUeKfT2h_XgWVoo8F9UxfjKmwa97OU2KfCj9GMnj3jbCC6CGOOuumTm_XNgtZweUAGBnOEBhVQ2z4xu.2xQqKyZaCIMs26rF928uaHVbYvvm569Q_EL1NrLQ6jQ_dNZvZcIhppr6iaOeg.YNTif2NcLzwx9xLS.lcd8cYmzsM3gq4h7CiBw--", "site_full": "sproutnews.com", "site": "sproutnews.com", "site_section": "http://sproutnews.com/feed", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "SproutNews", "title": "Digital Currency Market and Digital Coins Industry 2025: Global Demand, Top Players (Bitcoins, Ethereum, Ripple) Growth Opportunities Analysis and Industry Forecast", "title_full": "Digital Currency Market and Digital Coins Industry 2025: Global Demand, Top Players (Bitcoins, Ethereum, Ripple) Growth Opportunities Analysis and Industry Forecast", "published": "2018-05-14T06:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9de9ff74a8968c6695a3b5f679cfe0b771ff2065", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOoXHG419QIpiwuNowKdEDjgEMtdrvqSApeIjIH_jpUzNjMhBHPjs1eJEHfYUeKfT2h_XgWVoo8F9UxfjKmwa97OU2KfCj9GMnj3jbCC6CGOOuumTm_XNgtZweUAGBnOEBhVQ2z4xu.2xQqKyZaCIMs26rF928uaHVbYvvm569Q_EL1NrLQ6jQ_dNZvZcIhppr6iaOeg.YNTif2NcLzwx9xLS.lcd8cYmzsM3gq4h7CiBw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sproutnews", "published": "2018-05-14T06:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Digital Currency Market and Digital Coins Industry 2025: Global Demand, Top Players (Bitcoins, Ethereum, Ripple) Growth Opportunities Analysis and Industry Forecast", "text": "• Downstream Vendors\nAvailable Customizations With the given market data, MartResearch offers customizations according to the company’s specific needs.

Both Chu and Kelly argued that the fact that these contracts would be settled with the delivery of BTC itself is an important factor in Bitcoin’s mainstream adoption.\nBoth commentators were unanimous in considering that the plans of NYSE’s parent company Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) – news of which comes from “multiple reports citing sources familiar,” if true, could be of momentous consequence for the future of crypto.\nimage courtesy of CoinTelegraph\nWhereas the futures contracts currently being offered on CME and CBOE are ultimately settled in fiat , Kelly emphasized that ICE’s suggestion that crypto swap contracts will be settled in BTC is a significant milestone that could herald major Wall Street crypto adoption. Kelly explained:\n“[The] physical delivery of Bitcoin…means that ICE has a custody solution. That has been the big hurdle. How do you hold onto these assets? These are generally bearer instruments…and so you have to have a third-party custody person. That’s the big deal, they have come up with a custody solution for institutional holders.”\nCold storage custodian solutions are currently offered by small operators, and ICE has not confirmed whether it plans to build an in-house cold storage solution or to outsource it. Indeed, ICE has so far declined to comment on the reports at all.\nKelly said that if ICE can offer a custodian solution that is SEC-qualified and fits with the SEC’s compliance requirements, this would “open the floodgates” to institutional capital, resulting in some “big price moves” in the crypto markets.\nA custody solution would also open the door for pensions and endowments, he said, leading him to conclude that cryptocurrencies now “look to be becoming an emergent asset class…most obviously at the expense of gold .”\nKelly noted that the markets have been slow to respond, suggesting that many are underestimating the significance of the news.\nICE’s plans come just days after investment banking giant Goldman Sachs announced it will be opening a crypto trading desk “within weeks,” as well as recently hiring a cryptocurrency trader as vice president of their digital asset markets. This week, BTC stopped short of breaking the $10,000 resistance, trading around $8.600 currently…\nHowever, Goldman Sachs is not quite so positive, suggesting Bitcoin faces considerable downside…\nBitcoin held another ABC corrective target for resistance at 9,719-9,771\nThe area includes 61.8% retrace of the decline from February as well as an equality target off the Apr. 6th low. Holding below implies that the recent rise is corrective/counter-trend. It also re-instates the impulsive nature of the sell-off in February/March.\nThis ultimately exposes downside risks to new lows, possibly as far as 4,485; another equality target from Feb. 20th.

The company’s founder, Radoslav Albrecht, argues that it’s both considerably cheaper and faster to use bitcoin to exchange funds across borders.\n“Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,” Albrecht told Reuters Saturday. “With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.”\nThe idea of sending out loans in bitcoin may sound speculative, particularly given bitcoin’s near-constant price movements, but in this case, bitcoin itself is not being used as an asset but as a transfer method. Bitbond sends the loan in bitcoin, then the receiving client, often within seconds, has the bitcoin exchanged to their fiat currency of their choice, minimizing exposure to bitcoin price movements.\nAlthough Reuters claimed this is a first — in that bitcoin has never been used as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally — that’s actually not correct. Bitcoin has long been a popular method to make cross-border transfers. But this may be the first time a commercial, registered bank has used the cryptocurrency formally to facilitate loan transfers.\nThe decision by the bank to use bitcoin to transfer money internationally, currently about $1 million a month, also reflects a changing landscape for the cost of bitcoin transactions.\nAt the peak of the 2017 speculative bubble which saw bitcoin climb close to $20,000, the cost of bitcoin transactions went through the roof, peaking at $55.16 apiece on Dec. 22, according to Bitinfocharts. As the price of bitcoin declined, so did transaction costs, with Coinbase reporting prices of about $3 as of Feb. 23. Since then, the price has dropped even further, to an average of $1.26 as of today.\nAt those low prices, presuming they remain low, transferring money internationally using bitcoin as the transfer method becomes highly appealing.

I chose to host my content on Medium.com. Unfortunately, it seems like they are very hostile to crypto; indeed, crypto-related accounts on this platform have been vanishing left and right for totally frivolous reasons (hi, /u/Jarunik !).\nWell, it finally happened to me. They didn't give me any warning so I could move my work elsewhere or resolve whatever TOS issue they had with my content. They didn't even bother to let me know that I had been \"suspended\" - or really, blacklisted/deleted. Indeed, as long as I was logged into my account it looked like my articles were still online! On top of this, once I figured out what was going on, they wouldn't even tell me what rule they thought I violated. Crazy, right?\nWell, my understanding is that the community likes to keep abreast of banks, companies, platforms, and so on that are hostile to cryptocurrency. My opinion is that Medium is one of these companies. Thankfully, I am a computer scientist, so I was able to quickly spool up my own site.

If anything, the State Bank has barred commercial banks and financial firms from dealing in cryptocurrency which, of course, makes life harder for local exchanges. Individual traders, however, are finding alternative ways to acquire or sell cryptocurrencies, defying the warnings and the prohibitions.\nAlso read: India's Supreme Court Keeps Ban on Banks' Crypto Services, For Now\nCentral Bank Can't Ban Cryptocurrency in Pakistan Pakistan's experience with cryptocurrencies offers another example of how ineffective financial authorities can be when trying to fill a legal vacuum with prohibitive administrative measures. Central banks often forget they are neither parliaments, nor governments, and their regulatory overreach cannot legitimately substitute the normal legal process. The recent decision of the State Bank of Pakistan to ban crypto-related activities proves that observation.\nIn early April, the SBP issued a circular on the \"prohibition of dealing in virtual currencies\", right after a similar measure by the Reserve Bank of India, the regional rival. Unlike their Indian colleagues, who gave banks and traders three months to comply, Pakistani central bankers imposed the ban with immediate effect. SBP said virtual currencies and tokens were not legal tender and reminded it had not authorized any individual or entity to issue, sell, purchase, or exchange any such coins in Pakistan. All banks, microfinance entities, payment system operators and service providers were \"advised to refrain\" from dealing in cryptocurrencies.\nThe local market is by no means comparable to India's booming crypto sector. According to Danyal Manzar, CEO of Pakistan's first bitcoin exchange Urdubit, about 100 different digital coins were being traded daily across all mediums before the ban. His trading platform decided to close down permanently following the prohibition. \"The decision was made in haste. Ample time should always be provided for a proper shutdown. But we respect the SBP's decision,\" he told The Express Tribune .\nImmediately after the ban, Urdubit warned its clients to withdraw both their fiat and their crypto funds. A month later, however, some of its users still have bitcoins in their accounts on the platform. Manzar believes that those who want to trade will continue to do so because \"alternative ways still exist that will continue to be tapped no matter how risky they are.\" He thinks that cryptocurrencies would only disrupt the stock market, and not the entire monetary system. \"About 80 to 85% of the traders from stock exchanges came to try their luck in virtual currency,\" he said.\nLocalbitcoins PKR Trade Spikes After Ban Recently, Pakistani crypto traders told Asia Times that the central bank's move initially caused a dip in the crypto market but the volume of trading has gradually picked up after alternative trading methods were discovered. \"Traders realized that the SBP hasn't, and can't ban cryptocurrency in Pakistan,\" Lahore-based trader Majid Ali commented. \"What the State Bank has done is ban banks from entertaining crypto, so if you're not dealing via banks, you [still] can own and trade virtual currency in Pakistan, which comes under the IT ministry,\" he explained.\nIndeed, as the chart of the weekly Localbitcoins volume from Coin Dance shows, trading has spiked after the release of the circular. It peaked in the week of April 28 to more than 163 million Pakistani Rupee (>1.4 million USD), almost reaching December-January all-time highs.\nThe price of Pakistan's first and only cryptocurrency, Pakcoin, which was explicitly mentioned in the SBP's prohibition, has also jumped – by over 60% since the ban. Pakcoin founder Abu Shaheer says that the central bank's measure has actually worked in favor of his crypto by \"serving to expose Pakcoin's name [and] more people got interested in it.\" The digital token is already used for mobile phone credit top-ups.\nIslamabad to Prohibit \"All Forms of Virtual Currency\" After All Sources from Pakistan's Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication have told Asia Times that the government in Islamabad does plan to formally declare cryptocurrencies illegal in the country. \"We have forwarded our recommendation for a ban on all forms of virtual currency trading, and proper legislation is being worked on,\" a government official said.\nAccording to crypto trader Majid Ali, however, while the legislation is likely to hit trading, there are alternatives for dealing with cryptocurrencies. \"The government of Pakistan can't stop the trade in an international commodity that is accepted in other countries,\" he said. Majid also warned that the ban actually opens transfer channels that can be used for illegal purposes.\nDo you think that bans imposed by central banks can really stop cryptocurrency trade?

Bitcoin cash is superior technology, but that can be argued for a handful of other alts, but It’s claim to fame is it’s similar name.

However I think people here need to wake up. This market is completely unpredictable and the argument that bcash is technically better means nothing. Remember this sub is a huge echo chamber. The plain and simple facts are bitcoin cash is a terrible name, and the expectation that it will overtake (EDIT: bitcoin) is a pipe dream.\nThere will be many coins that get adopted and used as we move toward the future.

This seems extremely bullish for bitcoin.\nAt the Consensus event - Wednsay 16th at 9:10am Microsoft will be presenting the following:\n\"DECENTRALIZED IDENTITY FOR A DECENTRALIZED WORLD\nEmpower users to own and control their Identity. In this session Microsoft, along with Sovrin, Blockstack and uPort will share why we need Decentralized Identity.

This is an extremely big industry and costs user and corporations heaps in security, verification processes, customer service etc..\nI believe this is going to be built [primarily] on the bitcoin lightning network. Microsoft have already released the following:\n\"To support a vast world of users, organizations, and devices, the underlying technology must be capable of scale and performance on par with traditional systems. Some public blockchains (Bitcoin [BTC], [E TH], [L TC], to name a select few) provide a solid foundation for rooting DIDs, recording DPKI operations, and anchoring attestations. While some blockchain communities have increased on-chain transaction capacity (e.g. blocksize increases), this approach generally degrades the decentralized state of the network and cannot reach the millions of transactions per second the system would generate at world-scale. To overcome these technical barriers, we are collaborating on decentralized Layer 2 protocols that run atop these public blockchains to achieve global scale, while preserving the attributes of a world class DID system.\"\nSource: https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2018/02/12/decentralized-digital-identities-and-blockchain-the-future-as-we-see-it/\nClearly bitcoin is way ahead with second layer solutions (lightning network) and will therefore be the strongest candidate to run this system.\nVerifying this, the lead microsoft developer, Daniel Buchner, tweeted this morning;\n\"I was intro'd to Bitcoin in early 2011 by a good friend at Mozilla.
