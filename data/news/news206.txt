Half 1 – Aleksandar Svetski – Medium", "text": "Impartial (in nearly each method, ie; politically, racially, standing, and so on) Decentralized (on extra ranges, AND, greater than than the rest) And due to this fact offers: Censorship Resistance, and Of a Bearer Asset, which might characterize a worth , for anybody, wherever, at anytime.\nVALUE (Bear in mind this phrase.) Bitcoin’s use as a censorship resistant bearer asset is it’s most necessary use case, and off the again of this assertion, I’m going to discover how greatest to strategy ensuring these issues stay key & core. Should you disagree with that assertion, now could be a great time so that you can assessment what occurred to the final non-governemnt issued / mandated forex to be issued, that was not these two issues: Now, lets break this argument down. 2 Methods. One is Superior Taking out the entire conspiracy theories, and information, the next comparability desk is how I feel the two methods might be summed up. Slide from my presentation @ BTC vs BCH Brisbane Of observe is the “order” of how issues ought to occur, which I is much better depicted by this picture than phrases: The purple line is just not funding recommendation…however stays my speculation Half 2: Arguments This isn’t going to be probably the most coherent, ordered set of arguments — however I don’t have the time to fuck round right here, so I’m simply going to select every argument aside & lay it out. I’ll most likely should roll these into Half 2, however lets see how a lot of a rampage I’m going on right here & I’ll strive squeeze all of it in. 1. Transactional Utility will create Retailer of Worth Sorry. However that’s bullshit. Incremental will increase in Utility have little or no to do with “worth”. Retailer of Worth has bought all the pieces to do with safety, belief, self sovereignty, social settlement, and long run worth stability. Medium of Change has all the pieces to do with worth stability. BCH has neither of those, and being being 15c cheaper and 5min sooner makes zero distinction, apart from the power to take a position and convey extra volatility into the market.. There are two necessary elements it’s essential perceive: Volatility. Velocity Let’s clarify them: I don’t give a shit how briskly your transactions are, if there may be volatility within the worth, YOU DO NOT have a forex. A forex is steady , and it’s that stability that provides rise to its use as tender. Bitcoin’s community worth is WAAA too small for or not it’s steady. It must be value 10–20 occasions what it’s value now to ensure that the volatility to subside after which probably have an summary layer act as a steady forex / technique of trade. However that does NOT begin with transaction pace. It begins with safety/security/belief (pillars which I’ll clarify learn how to attain later). Volatility fucks with Velocity. Velocity is a measure of what number of occasions a unit of cash strikes, divided by the entire provide of stated cash. Growing velocity an excessive amount of is BAD for an asset (or forex) and is the idea for the devaluation of a forex . Reducing it an excessive amount of freezes the asset and erodes / destroys it’s worth (no utility). There’s a center floor which is difficult to search out, however which BTC at the moment has. By specializing in making transactions sooner & simpler, if something, you simply enhance velocity. Then, whenever you add volatility into the combo, individuals don’t know wether to purchase, maintain or promote, and if promoting is fast & straightforward, there’s a excessive likelihood velocity shoots via the roof and the entire issues spirals uncontrolled. BCH is specializing in the WRONG levers. It can’t & is not going to be adopted as a forex as a result of its nascent community worth provides rise to very large volatility, which then impacts and distorts it’s velocity, then diminishes the need for customers to take part & thereby impacts it’s safety assure — and the entire thing finally ends up yo-yo-ing and defeating it’s authentic “money” proposition. 2. Transactional “Foreign money” as major focus BCH is specializing in the flawed factor. Excessive throughput and sooner transactions DON’T MEAN SHIT. It’s not a battle crypto can win! How is BCH going to compete with these guys, be it on pace, effectivity, community results or value? Simply among the compitors that have already got extra belief, scale, tech & stability It will possibly’t ! I’m sorry, however for the common consumer, the next is method extra helpful than BCH. It’s prompt, one other 2bn individuals have it, and most significantly it’s STABLE: Sport. Set. Match. Bitcoin (nor another blockchain for that matter) can’t, and won’t win the “handy funds” conflict, nor will it win the “money substitute” conflict except it survives — and the one method to do this is unfold Bitcoin, like a virus, on a number of layers & make it inconceivable to kill. So long as that core layer stays the supply of fact, and stays incorruptible, we are able to construct options on prime of it which have the prospect to compete with the entire above, all while retaining the shop of worth, bearer asset basis. With out that, we’re competing with them — and that’s a battle we’re most probably going to lose. 3. Combating the WRONG Combat As an extension the above, it’s necessary to notice that this whole panorama of cryptocurrencies is partly collaborative, however from a community evaluation standpoint; it’s a conflict. And BCH is preventing on too many fronts, too quickly: One other slide from my presentation. CBF writing all of it once more. I feel there at the moment are Eight or 9 steady coin initiatives which can be outstanding, not to mention one other 20 or 30 that are in all probability within the works or on the way in which. Some are extra boring tokenized representations of fiat, however some like MAKR Dai and possibly even Basecoin have fairly fascinating fashions the mix components of decentralization, stability, pace of fee & extra. Then you’ve got Litecoin, Sprint, ZCash and what number of others? While you layer these, with the Authorities or Central Financial institution issued “crypto currencies” (which is a misnomer, and is a load of shit, however will idiot most people) you’ve got a state of affairs the place you’re attempting to say this “different” factor (BCH) is a greater medium of trade than what the UN is releasing. hmmm. Lets even take the federal government / central financial institution morons out of the equation. What about Amazon / Fb / Google / Tencent / Ali Baba or Apple releasing their very own transactional forex? They already service greater than half the world (if no more) and being the dimensions they’re, have gained appreciable belief amongst the mass inhabitants. The aggressive panorama, exterior of simply “crypto” Right here’s the factor. They will all make a digital forex with excessive transactional utility and capability. However guess what; none of them can create a decentralized, censorship resistant bearer asset. This can be a robust battle. 3. Trustless Techniques Require TRUST! Paypal is healthier than BCH. There! I stated it! It’s bought WAYYYY extra customers It’s sooner It’s extra trusted, by extra individuals. For all of the speak now we have about “trustless” programs, the adoption of those new digital / crypto currencies is definitely constructed upon a bedrock of belief. And that “belief” is available in layers: Belief that the maths works (engineers / specialists) Belief that the specialists and engineers know what they’re doing (status) Belief derived from the spokespeople & supporters of the protocol / challenge That final piece extra necessary than we realise. 99% of the inhabitants, (ie; the individuals who will drive the subsequent wave of adoption) don’t actually perceive (1), could get a glimpse of (2), however will base their choices on (3). Adoption is a type of layered belief. And in the intervening time, I can inform you for sure the next: a) As a funds mechanism for most people, Paypal is a greater resolution than BCH. b) Individuals will belief a public firm the dimensions of PayPal L NG earlier than they’re going to belief a few shady miners, a dodgy web site that confuses individuals about what their shopping for and a moron pretend satoshi operating round saying he’s “modelling issues”. 4. Bitcoin Dominance The argument about BTC Dropping dominance as a result of block dimension restrict is void. The argument says that “as a result of Bitcoin throughput was restricted, all of those different cryptocurrencies had an opportunity to be created and achieve traction and consequently have taken away from Bitcoin’s dominance”. I name bullshit. Altcoins and different cryptos had been ALWAYS going to come back alongside they usually’re a part of a cycle. That is an OPEN SOURCE know-how and the whole level is that anybody can use / duplicate / modify it. Anybody who thinks in any other case is an entire moron. ( Kyle Samani wrote an excellent piece on the significance of go-to-market on this open supply trade which drive this level residence properly). All nice applied sciences undergo growth / bust / progress cycles. When the web was first taking off, there was not solely a number of variations, however everybody stated it was the boring model of all these new “info tremendous highways”. It’s been the identical all through historical past with ANY new know-how, and on this world of open supply; the consequences are compounded by orders of magnitude! Gartner’s hype cycle. The identical will occur in Crypto The autumn in dominance is a pure prevalence, that’s a part of a cycle. When the entire silly shitcoins, with no staff, a shit thought and no execution expertise go bust, Bitcoin’s dominance will rise once more. **Be aware** I’d additionally say that Bitcoin’s dominance within the broader scope of the crypto market is a really BAD indicator of Bitcoin’s dominance. If something, Bitcoin must be measured extra towards different bearer asset shops of worth, and fewer towards issues like XRP or ETH. In that sense, it’s ‘dominance’ has not fallen in any respect. The truth is, it’s in all probability remained extraordinarily regular while the general community worth has grown. 5. “All of the Quantity is gone” All of the “quantity” coming into BTC was not from utilization — it was 85% hypothesis. Making an attempt to level on the block dimension as the rationale why Bitcoin quantity dropped is ridiculous. The quantity dropped as a result of the bubble popped! All of the morons who purchased Bitcoin or another Alt on the peak of the bubble ran for the exits as quickly as that shit began to dump. That has ZERO to with Block Measurement. It’s fairly easy. 6. BTC ought to do all the pieces This one is silly. Sure — while there are probably multiple use case for public, decentralized, consensus networks (though worth is the foundational one), it doesn’t imply that Bitcoin ought to characterize all of them. BTCs focus must be on being sound cash.This concept that BTC ought to do all the pieces is silly as a result of it will increase the assault floor, dilutes the message to the market, and makes it a jack of all trades & grasp of none. There may be greater than sufficient area for different crypto initiatives to unravel different use instances. 7. Price Markets are Unhealthy Once more, I feel this can be a main flaw in logic. Markets exist inside sure parameters. Parameters is one other phrase for “constraints”, and with out these, you wouldn’t have markets — you’d simply have noise. Or spam. The largest drawback with the web is that knowledge has grow to be negligble in value, and consequently, we’re bombarded with spam and noise. The brand new wave of profitable web functions are all about making “sense” of all that noise, attempting to prioritize it, attempting to filter it, and so on. With out happening one other rabbit gap right here, let me simply say a price ‘market’ is a robust factor. Markets are the muse for sturdy ecosystems that characterize precise worth. Limitless free transactions on empty blocks is simply silly. It = spam. And most significantly, in case you take a long run view on all of this, excessive charges aren’t an issue. They solely had an affect for about 2 or Three months throughout a fucking tulip-style mania that noticed probably the most avid depiction of the larger idiot principle at work. 8. Retailer of Worth Speculation BCH proponents say Retailer of Worth is both ”bullshit made up by Blockstream operatives”, or “one thing that comes later”. Clearly they’re both confused, or simply haven’t any idea of human evolution, nor financial historical past. There are trillions of {dollars} on this planet, at the moment being saved someplace, not shifting. That cash desires security . It desires safety  — and it desires sufficient liquidity to have some stage of mobility. It’s at the moment a lot safer to place your cash in USD or Gold for that goal. Bitcoin has provides the world an answer that’s orders of magnitude higher than each USD and Gold, and with a view to maintain it that method, Bitcoin must evolve and pattern towards additional decentralisation, and construct layers of redundancy into the verfication, validation and participation fashions. Making funds 10min sooner and 15c cheaper, for a complete of three–12 months (wait till lightning beneficial properties adoption), with the trade-off of complicated the neighborhood, complicated the brand new customers, trolling & losing everybody’s time, hijacking a model, and most significantly constructing a “resolution” on an structure that developments towards centralisation and management by a number of idiots is probably the most brief sighted, egocentric, ridiculous, grasping, profoundly silly issues I’ve ever seen in my life. Safety / Belief is what’s wanted for Retailer of Worth. These elements at all times trump transactional utility. Take a second to look via historical past. Gold survived as a retailer of worth (greater than the rest), while EVERY SINGLE forex within the histroy of humanity that targeted on a “higher type of transactional utility” blew up. Each one. Gold was actualy a reasonably shit medium of trade (comparitively extra during the last 500–2000yrs), but it surely’s the one SoV that really nonetheless exists. Medium of Change doesn’t beget Retailer of Worth. It’s not how issues work. There’s a logical order and stream. That is Bitcoin: Bitcoin. Robust Basis. Abstracts up the Pyramid of Worth And that is Bitcoin Money: Now..you may be considering I’m taking a stab at BCH, or that the diagram is just not fully correct — and also you’d be proper. However…I truly don’t know what they’re considering. I’ve learn so lots of their arguments and (a) they’re all so contradictory, (b) all of them revert again to some type of conspiracy principle. That’s not sufficient to persuade me…sorry. To Be Continued… I assume I’ll be splitting this into Three elements — hopefully making it simpler so that you can digest. I’ll replace the hyperlinks to Half 2 and Half Three right here as soon as they’re finished, in any other case simply leap on my profile and discover them. I’d additionally strongly suggest you learn this text as a result of it offers you the foundational components you want from a historic perspective to raised perceive the place I’m coming from:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "aleksandar svetski", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bearer asset", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T11:53:06.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e603a77077624d579465ca3ac01b5a4e0846f32c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmR5ivjqbMc5guwFH0mP6b2A-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Today is 10,000 Bitcoin paying day for Pizza", "title_full": "Today is 10,000 Bitcoin paying day for Pizza", "published": "2018-05-20T11:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e603a77077624d579465ca3ac01b5a4e0846f32c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmR5ivjqbMc5guwFH0mP6b2A-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "nguyenphucdang", "published": "2018-05-20T11:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Today is 10,000 Bitcoin paying day for Pizza", "text": "In the 2010 18th may laszlo Was Posted 10000 Bitcoin for Pizza", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T12:36:57.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "497f9f22ee629548bf4590a4cc1d3f67b53e2007", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5uVLlyanVHNt9Wb.xHK8qxBOVodlWEVx0NUIv.SJWMNHDJBHAxdhdU3MOJuqAke8ZCvZq5om3TBzE3jqzZM1qy29TCKyURWpvkYg1eNEBKof", "site_full": "cryptogeeks.com", "site": "cryptogeeks.com", "site_section": "http://cryptogeeks.com/news/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin: 5 Reasons Cryptocurrency Payments May Spell the Future of E-Commerce", "title_full": "Bitcoin: 5 Reasons Cryptocurrency Payments May Spell the Future of E-Commerce", "published": "2018-05-20T11:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "497f9f22ee629548bf4590a4cc1d3f67b53e2007", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5uVLlyanVHNt9Wb.xHK8qxBOVodlWEVx0NUIv.SJWMNHDJBHAxdhdU3MOJuqAke8ZCvZq5om3TBzE3jqzZM1qy29TCKyURWpvkYg1eNEBKof", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsbot", "published": "2018-05-20T11:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin: 5 Reasons Cryptocurrency Payments May Spell the Future of E-Commerce", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T12:17:38.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8ba9386572708626e23d83ca0bd68b08b474fbeb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbMkpBdR799LMP85Tj1AIk4-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=224.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation (Altcoins)", "title": "Ripple vs Bitcoin?

Millennials Better Suited to Lead Cryptocurrency Adoption\nEarlier this year, Columbia University Business School professor Chris Castiglione stated that millennials are better suited to lead the adoption of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum because they are capable of managing the risks associated in transacting with and investing in cryptocurrencies.\n“I think the crypto market is attractive to millennials because it’s a space with both a lot of growth and risk. People who are 40+ years of age are likely settled down with a career and family, and less inclined to get into such a quick growth, volatile field. It’s been the same way with startup founders over the past 2 decades. Millennials also seem to be much more digitally literate than Gen X or baby boomers,” explained Castiglione.\nCryptocurrency wallets and exchanges enable users to send, receive, store, and invest in cryptocurrencies with ease and eliminate the necessity of technical knowledge on blockchain technology and cryptographic systems. As such, by simply entering wallet addresses and maintaining back ups of private keys, it is possible for newcomers to send, receive, and store bitcoin relatively easily.\nBitcoin provides complete financial independence and freedom, as it eliminates the involvement of third party service providers like banks. Even on exchanges and marketplaces like Paxful that are peer-to-peer, users can buy and sell bitcoin without depending on financial institutions.\nConsequently, because trusted third party service providers do not exist, careless mistakes such as sending funds to the wrong bitcoin address or account could result in permanent loss of funds and unrecoverable errors. Castiglione stated that to utilize cryptocurrencies, individuals must have some digital literacy and thus, millennials are better suited to adopt cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum.\n“Many of the people starting cryptocurrencies and tokens do seem to be between the ages of around 22-40. But obviously anything is possible, and I could list many exceptions to the rule,” Castiglione. Millennials Core of Crypto\nIn consideration of the statement of Castiglione, it is not an understatement to claim that millennials are a core part of crypto. With studies suggesting that millennials have lost trust in banks and financial institutions over the past few years, the cryptocurrency sector is in ideal position to appeal to young users.\nBitcoin service providers and peer-to-peer marketplaces such as Paxful have started to observe a rapid increase in the activity of millennials on their platforms and as millennials continue to utilize cryptocurrencies more extensively in the future, platforms like Paxful will be able to grow exponentially in terms of user base and user activity.\n“As masters of the side hustle and challengers of the traditional 9-5 working lives of previous generations, millennials are welcoming blockchain with open arms,” Storm CEO Simon Yu noted, emphasizing that cryptocurrencies have also become an opportunity for millennials.

It evaluates the technological capability , usefulness of the application, and innovativeness of the project.\nBlockchain , the system powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin , is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet.\nEmbed from Getty Images\nEthereum , whose currency is called ether, garnered an overall score of 129.4. It has the become the foundation for many initial coin offerings , in which start-ups create their own digital currencies and sell them to investors to generate financing for their projects.\nBitcoin, founded nearly 10 years ago, had a rating of 88 and came in at No. 13.\nBlockchain projects Steem, Lisk, NEO and Komodo took second, third, fourth, and fifth place, respectively, with scores of 115.9, 104.8, 103.0 and 101.5.\nThe index, which has 28 blockchain projects with their corresponding cryptocurrencies, will be updated monthly\nThe sector currently has more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies , with total market capitalization of nearly $380 billion, according to digital currency tracker coinmarketcap.com.\nBitcoin, the largest of the digital currencies, last traded at $8,153.39 <BTC=BTSP> on the BitStamp platform. Ethereum was down 1.4 percent at $689.62.\nChina in general sees blockchain technology as an active area of innovation and expects public blockchains and decentralized applications to become significant parts of the future economy .

Now, the PRC is the first country to come out with official government crypto rankings. Its China Center for Information Industry Development (CCID) used three filters through which coins would be judged: innovation, technology, application. Rather surprisingly to some enthusiasts, bitcoin core (BTC) didn't even crack the top ten, while bitcoin cash (BCH) almost didn't make the list at all.\nAlso read: Alec Baldwin's Lambo Movie Backed by Crypto Tech\nChina Lists Ethereum as Best in Crypto Class In what is either widely being referred to as a case of communist schizophrenia or a passive nod to the inevitable financial future, the PRC's CCID released its first set of cryptocurrency rankings. China, of course, outright banned crypto in all its various forms, and the broader market was thought to have plummeted for a time as a result. That it is now publishing coin rankings is confusing to many observers.\nCN Ledger, a popular Twitter handle, was the first to expose the rankings to the outside world. Its author, Eric Zhao, explained how \"most old-school experts haven't followed the crypto space long enough to grasp some of the traits of tech and community that can't be found elsewhere.\"\nIndeed, this year found Weiss Ratings' inaugural list of their rankings, as these pages reported. It too was very controversial. \"The eagerly-anticipated report rates 74 of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market, scoring them from A to D,\" we wrote. \"Such was the level of interest in the report, the company's website was knocked offline as interest peaked on Wednesday morning. Weiss Ratings include some controversial scores for currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum that are sure to spark debate.\" Then, as now, BTC ranked lower than Ethereum. Weiss spent a great deal of time defending their decision.\nMr. Zhao hoped the CCID effort signals a kind of new opening. \"I believe at least it's a sign that the officials are starting to treat crypto projects more like a neutral endeavour towards better technology and innovations, rather than just challenging the power and authority of banks and government,\" he stressed.\nBTC Listed 13 of 28 Just a week ago, the PRC ministry surprised enthusiasts with a press release announcing its Global Public Chain Assessment Index . \"This independent analysis of cryptocurrencies and global public blockchain technology demonstrates the confidence of the Chinese Government in the technology, and will act as a guide for government, enterprise and research institute,\" news.Bitcoin.com quoted the government notice as stating.\nThe Center for Information Industry Development used three main criteria in scoring cryptocurrencies, though scant information exists about methodology. Application, innovation, technology were used to place 28 total cryptos and their respective blockchains (which the rankings, at least at first glance, weigh heavily).\nOf the top four coins by market capitalization, Ethereum ranked first, followed by bitcoin core (BTC) at number 13, ripple in the 17th spot, and bitcoin cash (BCH) lagging well behind them all at the lowly number 25 of 28. For the CCID, however, the top five cryptos to their liking include ether, steem, lisk, neo, komodo.\nFor those who worry about such rankings, PRC appears to, again, value blockchains over currencies – a common refrain heard in the Western corporate world. If, alternatively, one were to assess various cryptocurrencies according to their efficacy as mediums of exchange, BCH and BTC would likely rank quite high, and could be considered a most obvious threat to a regime bent on control. Whatever the case, cracks do happen inside the communist stronghold: quite a few crypto tech related patents are owned by China, its central bank has openly mused about state-backed crypto, and, of course, its burgeoning video game industry is very bullish on tokens and distributed ledgers.

There is a monster bearish trend line forming with resistance at $8,300 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair has to move above the trend line and settle above $8,300-8,400 for more gains in the near term. Bitcoin price is currently testing a major resistance near $8,400 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD could accelerate higher once there is a proper close above $8,400.\nBitcoin Price Upside Barrier This past week, there were further downsides from well above $8,500 in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The price moved down and broke the $8,200 support level. There was even a spike below the $8,000 pivot level before a low was formed at $7,940. Later, the price started an upside correction and succeeded in moving above the $8,000 pivot level.\nThere was also break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $8,884 high to $7,940 low. However, there is a crucial barrier on the upside near $8,300-8,400, which is preventing further gains. More importantly, there is a monster bearish trend line forming with resistance at $8,300 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. Furthermore, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $8,884 high to $7,940 low is also close to the $8,400 level. Therefore, a break and close above the $8,400 resistance is needed for more gains in BTC. The next resistance above $8,400 sits near the $8,800 pivot level.\nLooking at the chart , the price seems to be approaching a key break above $8,400. If buyers fail to push the price above the mentioned resistance, there could be a downside reaction back towards $8,000.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n4-hours MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is currently stable in the bullish zone.\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently just below the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $8,000\nMajor Resistance Level – $8,400\nThe post Bitcoin Price Weekly Analysis: BTC/USD Testing Crucial Resistance appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T09:54:32.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c663519713fde725b61dd6a069f7e7e58b3d2a82", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZGmEuD_g8EcHzADvLRMHyHc8C0NGXn5rBH03WOVW23mYkUyKuMSe8f_l4j93VVz0_hBSvT4z2qiQ--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Raining Bitcoin - Animated GIF", "title_full": "Raining Bitcoin - Animated GIF : btc", "published": "2018-05-20T09:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c663519713fde725b61dd6a069f7e7e58b3d2a82", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZGmEuD_g8EcHzADvLRMHyHc8C0NGXn5rBH03WOVW23mYkUyKuMSe8f_l4j93VVz0_hBSvT4z2qiQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "toomuch72", "published": "2018-05-20T09:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Raining Bitcoin - Animated GIF", "text": "submitted by /u/toomuch72\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T05:54:43.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "869e367e7ed2085825a125d7da09916717c98c8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.suKwIORlxioAJ9CLG.zLRAAQH9PrFEtgLmn5oYIh_gcV8kEQ68iUPWr_Ml4GGv.XzQ--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Anyone else just randomly receive bitcoin in their wallet?", "title_full": "Anyone else just randomly receive bitcoin in their wallet?", "published": "2018-05-20T09:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "869e367e7ed2085825a125d7da09916717c98c8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.suKwIORlxioAJ9CLG.zLRAAQH9PrFEtgLmn5oYIh_gcV8kEQ68iUPWr_Ml4GGv.XzQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-20T09:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "Anyone else just randomly receive bitcoin in their wallet?", "text": "Anyone else just randomly receive bitcoin in their wallet?\n/u/kedjthrows\nhttps://blockchain.info/address/1NDyJtNTjmwk5xPNhjgAMu4HDHigtobu1s?filter=1\nAnyone know whats going on here?

Presently, the PRC is the main nation to turn out with official government crypto rankings. Its China Center for Information Industry Development (CCID) utilized three channels through which coins would be judged: advancement, innovation, application. Or maybe shockingly to a few aficionados, bitcoin centre (BTC) didn’t split the main ten, while bitcoin money (BCH) nearly didn’t make the rundown by any stretch of the imagination. China Lists Ethereum as Best in Crypto Class\nIn what is either generally being alluded to as an instance of socialist schizophrenia or an aloof gesture to the unavoidable money related future, the PRC’s CCID discharged its first arrangement of digital money rankings. China, obviously, through and through restricted crypto in all its different structures, and the more extensive market was thought to have plunged for a period, therefore. That it is presently distributing coin rankings is confounding to numerous eyewitnesses.\nCN Ledger, a prominent Twitter handle, was the first to open the rankings to the outside world. Its creator, Eric Zhao, clarified how “most old-school specialists haven’t taken after the crypto space sufficiently long to get a handle on a portion of the characteristics of tech and group that can’t be discovered somewhere else.”\nIn reality, this year discovered Weiss Ratings’ inaugural rundown of their rankings, as these pages announced. It too was extremely dubious. “The anxiously foreseen report rates 74 of the most famous digital currencies available, scoring them from A to D,” we composed. “Such was the level of enthusiasm for the report, the organization’s site was thumped disconnected as intrigue crested on Wednesday morning. Weiss Ratings incorporate some questionable scores for monetary forms, for example, bitcoin and ethereum that are certain to start discussions.” Then, as now, BTC positioned lower than Ethereum. Weiss invested a lot of energy safeguarding their choice.\nMr Zhao trusted the CCID exertion flags a sort of new opening. “I accept in any event it’s an indication that the authorities are beginning to treat crypto extends more like a nonpartisan undertaking towards better innovation and developments, as opposed to simply difficult the power and specialist of banks and government,” he focused. BTC Listed 13 of 28\nOnly seven days back, the PRC service amazed aficionados with an official statement declaring its Global Public Chain Assessment Index. “This autonomous investigation of digital forms of money and worldwide open blockchain innovation exhibits the certainty of the Chinese Government in the innovation, and will go about as a guide for government, venture and research establishment,” news.Bitcoin.com cited the administration see as expressing.\nThe Center for Information Industry Development utilized three fundamental criteria in scoring digital forms of money, however meagre data exists about philosophy. Application, advancement, innovation were utilized to put 28 add up to cryptos and their particular blockchains (which the rankings, in any event at first look, weigh intensely).\nf the main four coins by showcase capitalization, Ethereum positioned in the first place, trailed by bitcoin centre (BTC) at number 13, swell in the seventeenth spot, and bitcoin money (BCH) falling great behind them all at the modest number 25 of 28. For the CCID, be that as it may, the main five cryptos to their enjoying incorporate ether, steam, lisk, neo, Komodo.\nFor the individuals who stress over such rankings, PRC appears to, once more, esteem blockchains over monetary forms – a typical hold back heard in the Western corporate world. Assuming, on the other hand, one were to survey different cryptographic forms of money as indicated by their adequacy as mediums of trade, BCH and BTC would likely rank very high, and could be viewed as the clearest risk to an administration bowed on control. Whatever the case, splits do occur inside the comrade fortress: many crypto tech related licenses are claimed by China, its national bank has transparently considered about state-sponsored crypto, and, obviously, its blossoming computer game industry is exceptionally bullish on tokens and circulated records. Also, simply reported, “The most prominent stock exchanging application in China, Straight Flush (同花顺), now includes bolster for demonstrating the cost of Crypto-Currencies.”\nDid you believe China’s rankings will have any genuine effect?

The United States Securities and Exchange Fee (SEC) has really not too long ago reached a call relating to the standing of tokens launched within the notorious DAO ICO which has truly forced numerous tasks and financiers to re-study the financing designs of a lot of ICOs. If you are you looking for more about echat for Investing look at our web-site. The rise of ICOs has prompted the U.S. Securities and Trade Commission to difficulty cautions to traders and startups. Nevertheless, ICOs operate at a unique timescale, the place worth changes can happen in a matter of minutes reasonably than months for a traditional sequence of investments. You'll be able to think of an ICO as an analogous course of to an initial public offering (IPO) with the primary distinction that as a substitute of equity share in an organization, ICO will grant the investor a new coin or a token. Although there are successful ICO transactions on report and ICOs are poised to be disruptive innovative instruments in the digital era, investors are cautioned to be cautious as some ICO or crowdsale campaigns are literally fraudulent. Traders could use the DAO's tokens to forged votes on the right way to disburse funds, and any earnings had been supposed to come back again to the stakeholders. ICOs have change into a main technique of fundraising for initiatives constructed on blockchain expertise. ICOs create new cryptos, there are already 1000's of cryptos… but there are solely so many crypto users and solely so much cash. Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies have been legally accepted as money in Japan since 2014, owing to a government choice that acknowledged that there aren't any current legal guidelines that may unconditionally ban individuals or corporations from receiving cryptocurrencies as payment. Platforms like Koinify (now closed) promised due-diligence of projects before listing them, and releasing the money to the challenge team conditional upon realizing some pre-outlined goals. Gross i want to buy stocks at echat sales of cash or tokens are direct, including multiple rounds, with few if any intermediaries required within the course of, investors basing investment selections on the content echat material of white papers ready by the fund raising entity. Bitcoin and different digital currencies echat for investing goals are based on blockchains—cryptographic ledgers that report every transaction carried out using Bitcoin tokens (see Why Bitcoin May Be A lot Extra Than a Foreign money \"). Particular person computers everywhere in the world, connected by way of the Web, confirm every transaction utilizing open-supply software program. Very similar to Kickstarter, a token sale is an occasion that runs over an arbitrary variety of days, with a predetermined goal similar to a certain number of tokens provided and sold. After all, German regulatory regulation does not apply to all ICOs issued throughout the globe, but it is very important understand that the applicability of most regulatory laws does not depend on the corporate being based in Germany or the legal guidelines applicable to the ICO purchasing contract. A basic difficulty with ICOs is the fact that most of them increase cash pre-product. ICOs will become an increasing number of ‘mainstream' as a technique for elevating funds. Why is not Bitcoin or Ethereum sufficient to function the venture's token? The majority of ICOs contain the creation of a defined number of coins or tokens previous to sale. The ICO was held unofficially by means of an nameless Bitcoin Discuss discussion board account, with funds being despatched to the individual's private Bitcoin deal with with a special message connected. This ICO also means traders can readily sell their investments on a secondary market. ICO Presale or often known as Pre-ICO, is the token sale event that Blockchain enterprises run before the official crowdsale or ICO marketing campaign goes live. Since these fund-raising operatives aren't managed by monetary authorities such because the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), funds which are misplaced attributable to misleading efforts may by no means ever be recuperated. Startups are basically printing money with ICOs right now - over $1 billion raised this 12 months alone. The miners backing the bitcoin cash blockchain had been successful in officially branching off and in the end added blocks to a new and separate blockchain. Thus, everybody has to make a personal selection regarding what ICOs and companies they want to give their data to (for this reason we've solely instructed main ICOs from present companies with current token-primarily based systems). The first ICO was by Mastercoin again in 2013, which raised approximately US $600,000 for a project to create a Bitcoin change and platform for transactions, whereas Bitcoin led the way in which on Cryptocurrencies, changing into the primary decentralized cryptocurrency back in 2009, other cryptocurrencies someday referred to as Altcoins, essentially Bitcoin options have hit the market. It's now price roughly $1,a hundred and twenty per bitcoin These bitcoin whales\" are at present the ones who make or break many of the ICOs.

Greenberg said accepting bitcoin and bitcoin cash as a payment method will promote transparency and accuracy in payment. “There’s no risk to the taxpayer,” said Greenberg, who has often raised eyebrows since his 2016 election by moves including encouraging certain employees with concealed-weapons permits to carry a firearm openly as a security measure. “Blockchain technology is the future of the whole financial industry.” A spokesperson for a neighboring county’s tax collector said they had no plans to follow the move. “Frankly, I think the currency is so volatile that I donâ(TM)t think it makes sense.” And an official at a nearby county said bitcoin payments were “not on our to-do list”, adding that no one in the county had requested the ability to pay their taxes in bitcoin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "soni", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "slashdot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joel greenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "payment first government office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "first government office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orlando sentinel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seminole county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T09:50:27.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1919e3f1a8be046b6b7821ac33e8abd85ad6fb10", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.spQ5RFHCiFjkCLTbzLpHZv8rCHU2DL7uCE9DIRRfvizsqFzCeFsWhnxA1IVwAhFjGQ--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "China Ranks Cryptos: Bitcoin (BTC) Dismal 13 of 28", "title_full": "China Ranks Cryptos: Bitcoin (BTC) Dismal 13 of 28", "published": "2018-05-20T08:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1919e3f1a8be046b6b7821ac33e8abd85ad6fb10", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.spQ5RFHCiFjkCLTbzLpHZv8rCHU2DL7uCE9DIRRfvizsqFzCeFsWhnxA1IVwAhFjGQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-20T08:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "China Ranks Cryptos: Bitcoin (BTC) Dismal 13 of 28", "text": "China Ranks Cryptos: Bitcoin (BTC) Dismal 13 of 28\nC.

However, upsides in BCH/USD are likely to be limited by the $1,320 resistance zone.\nBitcoin Cash Price Upside Hurdle\nThis past week, there was a sharp increase in selling pressure on bitcoin cash price above $1,400 against the US Dollar. The price started a downside move and traded below the $1,350 and $1,280 support levels. There was even a break below the $1,200 pivot level, which opened the doors for more losses. It traded close to the $1,120 support level and a low was formed at $1,131.\nLater, the price started an upside correction and moved above the $1,120 resistance. It also moved above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,506 high to $1,131 low. However, there are many barriers on the upside near $1,300. An initial hurdle is near $1,128, which was a support earlier and it may now prevent gains. There is also a crucial bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,320 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,506 high to $1,131 low is positioned near $1,318 to act as a hurdle.\nLooking at the chart, the price may continue to rise in the near term towards $1,300. However, a break above $1,300 and $1,320 won’t be easy.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n4-hours MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is moving back in the bullish zone.\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is heading towards the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $1,150", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin cash price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "recoveries remain limited bitcoin cash price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T01:40:12.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d6f20c00757ce600e83f6f5e92255b6ea59c885d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgvt5m5Ip7pS8Pf5Dlo7_5pfvrMtMF_oDBMeok.3vhrUhUpfStGbDuSJQ3x8LX.tW5xYpWhQAKp9WJyEQ6.EgEm7NKs5VkgRCce00e2adw1rQ-", "site_full": "internetdo.com", "site": "internetdo.com", "site_section": "http://internetdo.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Internet Do", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Price Weekly Analysis: BCH/USD Recoveries Remain Limited", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash Price Weekly Analysis: BCH/USD Recoveries Remain Limited", "published": "2018-05-20T08:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d6f20c00757ce600e83f6f5e92255b6ea59c885d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgvt5m5Ip7pS8Pf5Dlo7_5pfvrMtMF_oDBMeok.3vhrUhUpfStGbDuSJQ3x8LX.tW5xYpWhQAKp9WJyEQ6.EgEm7NKs5VkgRCce00e2adw1rQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-20T08:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Price Weekly Analysis: BCH/USD Recoveries Remain Limited", "text": "Key Points Bitcoin cash price got bid near the $1.130 level and started a recovery against the US Dollar.

It’s surprising that someone like Gates doesn’t currently know what he can or cannot do in the Bitcoin investment landscape.\nFor his part, Buffett bashed Bitcoin by stating that “when you’re buying nonproductive assets, all you’re counting on is the next person is going to pay you more because they’re even more excited about another next person coming along.” The Oracle of Omaha said the same thing about commodities several years ago. It’s true that it remains difficult to accurately predict commodity prices over time due to the challenges of maintaining consistent profit margins in a fluctuating market, but by no means is an investor not able to turn a profit with a properly timed investment, which is the case with Bitcoin or any other investment.\nMunger jumped in by saying Bitcoin was “worthless artificial gold,” and that it reminded him of “Oscar Wilde’s definition of fox hunting: the pursuit of uneatable by the unspeakable.” All the Bitcoin bashing didn’t go unnoticed, causing the digital asset’s value to slip all the way down to $9,300. It’s true that these three billionaires are the best of the best and deserve to have their opinions heard, but this story has been played out over and over again.\nI would put people like Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and Charlie Munger at the top of this list. And let’s not forget about other Bitcoin haters like JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon or BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who called Bitcoin a fraud.\nThe fact is that these individuals have achieved success at the highest level, and they continue to badmouth Bitcoin because it offers no benefit to their current ventures and only threatens their wealth and business enterprises.

There is a crucial bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,320 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may continue to rise in the short term, but it is likely to face sellers near $1,320-40. Bitcoin cash price is showing positive signs above $1,150 against the US Dollar. However, upsides in BCH/USD are likely to be limited by the $1,320 resistance zone.\nBitcoin Cash Price Upside Hurdle This past week, there was a sharp increase in selling pressure on bitcoin cash price above $1,400 against the US Dollar. The price started a downside move and traded below the $1,350 and $1,280 support levels. There was even a break below the $1,200 pivot level, which opened the doors for more losses. It traded close to the $1,120 support level and a low was formed at $1,131.\nLater, the price started an upside correction and moved above the $1,120 resistance. It also moved above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,506 high to $1,131 low. However, there are many barriers on the upside near $1,300. An initial hurdle is near $1,128, which was a support earlier and it may now prevent gains . There is also a crucial bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,320 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,506 high to $1,131 low is positioned near $1,318 to act as a hurdle.\nLooking at the chart , the price may continue to rise in the near term towards $1,300. However, a break above $1,300 and $1,320 won't be easy.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n4-hours MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is moving back in the bullish zone.\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is heading towards the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $1,150\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,320\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Weekly Analysis: BCH/USD Recoveries Remain Limited appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin cash price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T07:57:29.051+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d73f719f1a03d7fae186e40961b7019085cbeabb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTL5OCwAE6oDI.MoomeMcLQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "The reason why we should invest in Bitcoin Or Ethereum ?", "title_full": "The reason why we should invest in Bitcoin Or Ethereum ?", "published": "2018-05-20T07:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d73f719f1a03d7fae186e40961b7019085cbeabb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTL5OCwAE6oDI.MoomeMcLQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "khaled0111", "published": "2018-05-20T07:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "The reason why we should invest in Bitcoin Or Ethereum ?", "text": "If you are a good observer of bitcoin and ethereum you will notice that they are not having that speed when the value is increasing what I mean it is not force price.
