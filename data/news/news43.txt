Slovenia has announced that its largest shopping center — coincidentally known as BTC City — will transform into a complete bitcoin city , in which every store and venture will accept cryptocurrency and operate via blockchain technology.\nThe complex, located in the country’s capital of Ljubljana, stretches over 1,558,398 square feet and contains over 500 retail stores. Prime Minister Miro Cerar recently visited the shopping center, where he was treated to a cup of coffee (purchased with cryptocurrency by State Secretary Tadej Slapnik). Details regarding the center’s newfound approach to bitcoin are being headed by fintech startup Eligma.\n“The purpose of his visit was to open the Beyond 4.0 international conference, dedicated to digital society and blockchain, and to get acquainted with BTC City’s strategy to become a Bitcoin City,” said BTC City representatives.\nBTC City initially began in 1954 as a warehouse and logistics center. More warehouses were added to the complex over time, and, by 1990, it had transformed into a commercial shopping arena. BTC City presently plays host to several travel and tourism ventures including a luxury hotel and casino, a multiplex cinema, a waterpark and the Crystal Palace office park — home to Slovenia’s tallest building.\nExecutives of BTC City say they’re hoping Bitcoin City will give rise to new businesses that push the cryptocurrency space toward mainstream territory and lead to further blockchain developments.\n“Bitcoin City will create an open society which will enable users to pursue their missions as well as develop their business environments in line with their wishes, needs and operating policies,” they said.\nEligma’s cryptocurrency transaction system Elipay is being installed in several stores. Situated throughout the premises are also several one-way cryptocurrency ATMs, along with the Blockchain Think Tank and what executives call the biggest crypto mining rig in Slovenia.\nRepresentatives further commented, “The development of BTC City into a bitcoin city is an important step toward the realization of BTC’s openness-oriented strategy, providing its customers and business partners with both freedom and choices regarding their purchases with new forms of payment.”\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

June 05, 2018 15:29 IST Raj Kundra | File\nThe Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday questioned Raj Kundra, husband of actor Shilpa Shetty, in connection with a money laundering probe related to a bitcoin transactions case, officials said.\nThe businessman was summoned at the ED office in Mumbai and was asked questions about his involvement in the trade, termed as illegal by the government, they said.\nThere are some instances of the case that are linked to Kundra and hence, he has been asked to record his statement, the officials said without elaborating.\nThe ED, sometime back, had registered a criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against bitcoin-based investment website GainBitcoin, its founder Amit Bhardwaj and eight others.\nIt is alleged that about 8,000 investors lost about Rs 2,000 crore funds by transacting in this scheme.\nThe ED had filed its case based on an FIR of the Maharashtra Police in this case and the Pune Police arrested Bhardwaj and his brother Vivek from Delhi earlier.\nBhardwaj reportedly was behind ventures like GainBitcoin, GBMiners, MCAP and GB21, and the investors were allegedly duped after transactions on these portals.\nThe central agency has expanded its probe into this case and is also investigating related bitcoin or cryptocurrency transactions that are under the scanner of other departments.\nIt is alleged that Bhardwaj and his associates allegedly duped investors to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore in Mumbai, Pune, Nanded, Kolhapur and other places in the state. also read Bitcoin to use 0.5 per cent of world's electricity by year end\nLast year, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had informed Parliament that there are no regulations governing virtual currencies in India and the RBI has not given any licence to any entity/company to operate such currencies.\nThe government had also cautioned investors to be wary of virtual currencies such as bitcoin, saying they are like Ponzi schemes with no legal tender and protection.

However, some of the retailers, including Atlantis water park, Al Capone, Babadu, Bijoux modni dodatki, Big Bang, istyle, Vodno mesto San Martino, Sneakers, Minicity, and Kibuba have displayed that they can’t wait for the scheduled date.

That's compared with $837 for the Antminer S9.\nAs if there was any doubt that GMO plans to knock Bitmain of its pedestal, the firm's CEO Masatoshi Kumagai reportedly stated:\n\"I respect Bitmain, but we will top them\"\nAs reported by CoinDesk, the B2 was revealed on May 24, with GMP saying pre-orders will start on June 6 and shipments to follow in October.\nThe launch comes following a months-long testing period since the firm initially revealed it was researching and developing the new mining processor in September 2017.\nGMO B2 miner image via Yuji Nakamura/Twitter ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "daniel palmer", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gmo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taiwan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T19:39:02.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fb843030dca62d4bd42b1bf2ba36ad41052db3ad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS6w6R9f_QJQRbKz3uDgWqgg-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "The Highest Paying Bitcoin Website", "title_full": "The Highest Paying Bitcoin Website", "published": "2018-06-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fb843030dca62d4bd42b1bf2ba36ad41052db3ad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS6w6R9f_QJQRbKz3uDgWqgg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Highest Paying Bitcoin Website", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nEarn Bitcoins while using Mozilla Firefox!

According to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Bitcoin will not remain the “gold standard” of cryptocurrencies for much longer. Instead, he is convinced that altcoins will carve out their own paths and no longer rely on Bitcoin’s price momentum. Brad Garlinghouse has Some Contrarian Views\nAnyone who has paid attention to the cryptocurrency industry for more than three weeks will have noticed an interesting trend. Regardless of how successful or promising some altcoins may be, they will not thrive unless the Bitcoin price is going up. It is a very annoying trend which has hindered the growth of altcoins for some time now, unfortunately. It will be quite difficult to reverse this trend, assuming that’s possible.\nSurprisingly, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is convinced things will change in favor of the altcoins fairly soon. Although he doesn’t deny the correlation between the price of XRP and the value of Bitcoin, he believes there may be a shift on the horizon. As one would expect, his statement has faced some opposition, even though most people would welcome such a change.\nWhile the cryptocurrency scene is still in its infancy after nine years, the time has come for altcoins to emerge and carve out their own paths. Whether or not any of them will be able to do so in the near future is a different matter altogether. With speculation remaining one of the bigger problems affecting market growth, there will not be any exciting developments in favor of the altcoins anytime soon.\nAccording to Garlinghouse, the decoupling of altcoin markets from Bitcoin will take place through “investor rationale”. In his view, it’s only a matter of time until investors see the value in individual cryptocurrencies and their respective technologies. At the same time, Garlinghouse believes certain altcoins will continue to ride the coattails of Bitcoin. Indeed, there have been a fair few cryptocurrencies coming to market which serve no real purpose and have no active use cases. Nor will they have any, by the look of things, even though such currencies remain extremely appealing to cryptocurrency speculators.\nWhile the comments from Garlinghouse are pretty interesting, it remains to be seen if any of his predictions will come true. After all, Bitcoin has dominated the cryptocurrency industry for quite some time now, despite the Bitcoin Dominance Index dropping below 40% this year. An interesting situation is unfolding in the cryptocurrency industry, but nothing has been set in stone just yet.

Etheris up 1.7% to $606.00, Bitcoin Cash is higher by 2.9% at $1,149.60 and Litecoin has added 1.8% at $121.60.\nFutures followed the spot market higher Tuesday.

Both digital assets saw a major increase in global trading volume compared to the month prior. BTC held steady, averaging $200 billion a month, but ripple didn’t fare so well, recording trading volume that was down 86% since January, mirroring its decline in price.\nAlso read: Decentralized Exchange Compendium ‘Index’ Lists Over 200 Dex Platforms Bitcoin Cash Is May’s King of Coins\nThere are various ways to measure a cryptocurrency that’s in demand, with trading volume the most useful indicator after price. A lot of bitcoin cash changed hands in May – 140% more than in the month prior in fact. Diar’s weekly update highlights the big winners and losers in the cryptocurrency market in May, and shows the substantial demand for BCH. In total, $30 billion of bitcoin cash changed hands in May. The next biggest gainer was ethereum, whose trade volume was up 50% on April, resulting in monthly trading volume of over $80 billion.\nMost major cryptocurrencies saw an increase in trading volume in May including litecoin, which had a modest increase. There was one notable loser however – ripple. XRP trading volume has been on the decline since January, back when $100 billion of tokens were traded in a month, pushing the price of XRP north of $3. Reality has since settled in, and May saw just $16 billion of ripple traded. Fake Volume Rears Its Head\nWhen it comes to analyzing trading volume, one topic that often crops up concerns fake volume. Exchanges and their traders are frequently accused of creating orders that they have no intention of fulfilling, which creates a false impression of liquidity. If traders are doing so, it’s likely bot-based as a means of market manipulation in the pursuit of profit. If exchanges are responsible, it’s likely to make their platform look more popular than it is, and to benefit from the additional custom that comes from being a top ranked global exchange by volume.\nBinance is the latest exchange to have faced accusations of fake volume, with certain coins displaying unusually high volume for short periods of time, comprising fluctuations that appear outwith normal trading patterns. Given the hundreds of thousands of traders who can be using a platform such as Binance at one time, including countless bots connected via API, determining which orders are real, which are fake, and who’s responsible for any manipulation, is virtually impossible.\nDo you think fake volume is a problem on major exchanges?

According to new research into their onboarding practices, most of the studied platforms do not meet the requirements of the upcoming regulations under the updated EU anti-money laundering directive.\nAlso read: Localbitcoins Updates ToS: ‘Some Situations May Require ID’ ‘Crypto Identity Crisis’\nThe research , titled “The Cryptocurrency Identity Crisis: An Industry Scorecard for Digital ID Verification for KYC and AML”, looked into the onboarding practices of leading cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers in Europe and the US. Its main goal was to determine whether these prominent platforms implement proper Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures regarding new users. The study was conducted by P.A.ID Strategies and commissioned by Mitek, a provider of digital identity verification solutions.\nThe results show that 68% of 25 examined crypto exchanges and custodian wallets allow users to trade crypto and fiat currencies without conducting formal identification. These companies do not meet many of the requirements mandated by the upcoming EU regulations. They are not performing identity verification checks against official identity documents and lists of politically exposed persons. There is no sanctions screening or audit trail to trace criminal activity.\nThe EU’s fifth anti-money laundering directive, AMLD5, is due to come into effect next year. It is expected to bring crypto-related services in line with the standards applied to other financial products such as those offered by banks. That includes mandatory identity checks on new customers like those conducted by traditional financial institutions.\nThe European Parliament adopted the European Commission’s proposal for a Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive on April 19 this year. The document aims to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing through the financial system of the European Union. It was proposed by the Commission in 2016, even before AMLD4 was implemented by all member-states. The updated directive introduces stricter requirements for customer due diligence procedures and identity verification. Exchanges and Wallets Ranked\nUnder the new rules, cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers will be obliged to apply for registration. The platforms in the study have been ranked according to how compliant their onboarding process is with the AMLD5 provisions.\nTopping the list are exchanges like Coinbase , Gemini , Poloniex , and Itbit . All these require users to present official ID documents to begin trading. They have received an “ID Verification Score” of 9 out of 10. Platforms like Kraken , Bitstamp , Wirex , Local Bitcoins , Bitpanda , and Bitwala are also included in the survey.\nA verified email address and a mobile phone number are often enough to sign up for the exchanges and wallets that do not have KYC procedures. The researchers note that both are easily obtainable without identification. Users can start trading with any email address and a number from a prepaid cell phone service.\n“Cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges want to enjoy the same trust as the wider traditional financial services,” said John Devlin, Principal Analyst at P.A.ID Strategies, quoted by Real Wire . “Meeting regulatory demands ahead of AMLD5 coming into force could go a long way to changing this sector’s reputation as being something of a ‘wild west’,” he added.\nMitek COO Kalle Marsal believes that crypto exchanges and wallet providers want to change the “perceptions of lawlessness,” which in his words is a relatively straightforward fix. “Identity verification processes can be, if implemented correctly, simple for the customer and no barrier to signing up,” he argued.\nDo you expect exchanges and wallets to comply with the stricter EU regulations?

Being first also means, however, that Bitcoin suffers from the technical disadvantages common among “version 1.0” software products.\nCompared with most other cryptocurrencies, for example, Bitcoin is painfully slow – it can take hours for transactions to fully settle, and the Bitcoin network is extremely inefficient – some experts estimate that it even uses more electricity per day to operate than some Western countries. Yes, literally. Bitcoin also utilizes a relatively small block size – which, while an acceptable design when Bitcoin was in its infancy and used by relatively few people, translates into poor scalability – a major issue for a platform trying to become an alternative to dollars, Euros, and other fiat currencies. Because of the way the underlying implementation of blockchain technology works, as time marches on, the adverse impact of these Bitcoin deficiencies will continue to worsen. Bitcoin also has a relatively small supply of possible coins, which also poses potential long-term challenges.\nIt is also important to understand that the payment anonymity first offered by Bitcoin made it quickly become a payment method of choice for all sorts of illegal activity – from ransoms demanded by ransomware , to dark web markets where people buy and sell drugs, guns, and stolen credit card numbers , to various money laundering operations. It is possible, therefore, that, even after recent drops, the skyrocketing Bitcoin prices last year have caused the greatest wealth transfer to criminals since the dawn of civilization, and may have also enriched rogue nations such as North Korea, that likely mine, steal, and use Bitcoin in order to undermine international sanctions. Bitcoin has, effectively, given them the ability to anonymously print dollars like never before.\nI believe that Western governments will not ignore these and other concerning factors forever – they certainly also do not like losing the tax revenue from people not reporting capital gains from the sale of cryptocurrencies – and attempts at creating various forms of regulations are not that far away.\nBitcoin also lacks the smart contract features of Ethereum – which, ironically, may ultimately make some criminals adopt the latter for security reasons; the heist of millions of dollars of escrowed Bitcoin by the folks running the Evolution marketplace on the dark web, for example, might have been preventable had Ethereum been the currency being escrowed, rather than Bitcoin.\nThere is, of course, no guarantee that Bitcoin will remain acceptable as a payment method. It is not “legal tender for all debts public or private,” and there is no country that guarantees that it can be used to buy goods and services within its borders. Instability in Bitcoin’s value makes accepting Bitcoin as payment for goods and services extremely risky – and both legitimate vendors and criminals are beginning to take notice; think about how many goods and services are bought and sold everyday within a ten-mile radius of your present location – now consider how few of them can be purchased with Bitcoin. Unlike tokens needed to use various blockchain-based applications, Bitcoin is effectively only a currency, so if it becomes effectively unusable or unacceptable for commerce it loses much of its reason for existing in the first place.\nI am also concerned that a great deal of the increase in Bitcoin’s value has come from speculators buying in, and businesses stocking up on the coin in case they need to pay ransoms; if nothing changes, the combination of the fact that few law-abiding people actually benefit significantly from utilizing Bitcoin in their daily lives, the instability in Bitcoin’s value is making it decreasingly viable as a payment method, the probable arrival at some point of government regulations, and the underlying technology’s shortcomings, could ultimately transform Bitcoin into the “Myspace of cryptocurrencies” – what was once the biggest and the best can ultimately be eclipsed and replaced by superior offerings.\nIn short: Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, and it is possible that it will become worth very little, or even worthless, down the road.\nBlockchain, like social media, is here to stay, but who the dominant players will be as the market matures is still unknown. Of course, it is possible that Bitcoin will evolve into a standard currency on par with the dollar or Euro; with its shortcomings, however, I remain skeptical.

Last month, he said that he believes the project could become the next Apple in terms of its status in the tech sector.\nWozniak continues to be seen as not only a Bitcoin bull but also a technologist who understands the value and use cases connected to cryptocurrencies. While his total crypto holding may not be public there are rumors that he holds more than just a ‘few bags’ and is involved in several ICO’s set to come to market. In other words, take notice when he talks anything connected to cryptos.

Price is at a crucial area of interest, though, and a bounce or break could determine the next long-term direction. If these support levels hold, bitcoin could bounce back to the swing high and resume the reversal. Bitcoin price is pulling back to an area of interest after breaking above a longer-term descending trend line. Technical Indicators Signals The 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the upside. This suggests that the uptrend is more likely to resume than to reverse. However, price has fallen below the longer-term 200 SMA as an early indicator that bearish momentum is kicking in. RSI is indicating oversold conditions, though, so a bounce may be in order. Stochastic has already climbed out of the oversold area to show that buyers are ready to return. A larger pullback to the broken trend line closer to the 61.8% Fib may be the last line of defense for bulls, and a break below this could lead to a drop to the swing low. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView Market Factors Bitcoin was off to a promising start for the week but it looks like bulls were unable to sustain the momentum as investor worries lingered. Not even remarks from Steve Wozniak on how bitcoin is the only digital gold were able to help. He cited: All the others tend to give up some of the aspects of Bitcoin. For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control. That’s the first one they have to give up to try to have a business model. Still, the dollar managed to recoup its losses in the latest US session, likely on the bounce in equities. Trump and Kim Jong-Un are still a go with their meeting on June 12 and this is giving dollar bulls optimism at the moment.\nFull details at www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/05/bitcoin-btc-price-watch-bears-return-full-swing/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "2018 network technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T07:33:30.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e53bbdc463f75171ec5375935647af3e3b90d243", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9GpoK49ucKkf2dZLim3V2VuobTNvr0Sxq9RlcGEFp82Tychh8DgE.Dkqgli6goKe25oaSHvJcRrDNQTeL2b2YW", "site_full": "www.bitcointalkradio.com", "site": "bitcointalkradio.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "", "title": "BITCOIN (in USD) levels: Weakening | Bitcoin Talk Radio", "title_full": "BITCOIN (in USD) levels: Weakening | Bitcoin Talk Radio", "published": "2018-06-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.022, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e53bbdc463f75171ec5375935647af3e3b90d243", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9GpoK49ucKkf2dZLim3V2VuobTNvr0Sxq9RlcGEFp82Tychh8DgE.Dkqgli6goKe25oaSHvJcRrDNQTeL2b2YW", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "BITCOIN (in USD) levels: Weakening | Bitcoin Talk Radio", "text": "Share on Linkedin BEST BROKERS TO TRADE CRYPTO\nThis report has been prepared by AC Markets and is solely been published for informational purposes and is not to be construed as a solicitation or an offer to buy or sell any currency or any other financial instrument.

The probe until now indicates that many had invested unaccounted money in Bitcoins after demonetization.\n“During the probe, it came to light that investments in crores of rupees were made in Bitcoin just after demonetization. The income tax department and ED were also informed about the facts of the case,” mentioned a statement issued by CID (Crime).\nDipankar Trivedi, DIG of CID (Crime), on Sunday informed reporters that a recovery worth Rs 17.44 crore has been made in the case which includes 169.42 Bitcoins, 8kg of gold and cash. Trivedi said 152 Bitcoins were recovered from accused Dilip Kanani and 10.92 Bitcoins were recovered from another accused, Nikunj Bhatt.\nThe probe yielded that the complainant, Shialesh Bhatt, himself and his associates had invested money in different lucrative ponzi schemes through multi-level-marketing which offered 1% to 4% interest per day. “Bhatt had also lured others to invest in the schemes launched by Bit Connect in Nexa coins and Bit Coin Connect. It has also come to light that these schemes were launched to cheat the middle class of their money,” said a senior CID crime official.\nKey accused Shailesh Bhatt along with others had abducted Dhaval Mavani — an administrator of the Bit Connect firm and its office boy Piyush Savaliya from Surat and extorted 2,256 Bitcoins, 11,000 lite coins and Rs 14.50 crore cash, which have a total worth of Rs 155.21 crore\nBhatt had alleged in an FIR lodged with CID crime that he, and his business partner Kirit Paladia were kidnapped by police inspector Anant Patel and seven other policemen for extortion of Bitcoins and cash worth Rs 12 crore.\nDuring the probe, it came to light that Bitcoins extorted from Bhatt were procured from kidnapping of Dhaval Mavani and Piyush Savaliya. BJP’s ex-MLA, Nalin Kotadiya, and SP Amreli, Jagdish Patel, are also accused in the case.

And it’s Bitcoin exactly that is most associated with blockchain. Throughout its existence Bitcoin saw a lot of interesting things: from selling pizza to rapid slump of exchange. Since the very beginning work with Bitcoin was portrayed as following: fast, convenient, reliable, cheap. But now you can confidently claim that it’s not convenient, not reliable and not cheap. These are the fundamental problems of Bitcoin, and there are only few companies out there that can solve them. Telegram is already on the way. Input data We learnt about Telegram plans concerning the launch of its own blockchain platform TON with Gram cryptocurrency at the beginning of 2018. The company conducted two ICO stages and collected 1,7 mlrd dollars. And as we got to know in May, the company declined third and public ICO stage. By the middle of March Telegram had over 200 million users all over the world. In the middle of April Russian court demanded to block Telegram after the messenger refused to pass the encryption keys of user dialogues to Federal Security Service. In the end of April Iran court banned Telegram in its country. In Russia Telegram has about 14 million users and about 40 million in Iran. Problems Below are the following methods of safe Bitcoin storage: Protection of failures: paper and / or digital backups with opportunity to encrypt them and / or store few parts in different places. Protection from theft: «cold storage» or hardware ways of protection. Wallet encryption itself is not the safe protection method from Trojan programs because the password can be read with the keylogger. The presence of various methods of safe storage, on one hand, aids the users but, on the other, increases the risk of data theft and affects convenience and speed of work with Bitcoin. The disunity of services that are not united into single system creates great number of fraudsters. During the attempts to find the necessary exchange / storage methods you will come upon a huge list of websites that are offering their services and you can never be sure they will not deceive you. Considering the fact that it’s impossible to cancel the transaction, chances are high you will forever lose big amount of money. So is it reliable? Not too much. In its turn, Telegram accumulates the necessary services in one app. Right now closed testing of Telegram Passport takes place already. The service will allow to identify the messenger user. It is supposed that the user will upload all the necessary data at once and then Telegram will be able to immediately transfer them to the partner services and use them both inside Telegram and outside of it. End-to-end encrypting ensures the data usage safety. The data is stored in your smartphone only and Telegram does not have any access to it. Sounds quite nice. Convenience, speed and price are tightly connected. Do you want to send Bitcoin faster? Pay more for it. But even high price cannot always guarantee you fast transactions. Not very convenient if we speak about the world where every second matters and, considering the Bitcoin rate, there is always quite a sum of money in the hold-off state. Add to that the time to use various safety methods mentioned above. How can Telegram solve these problems? Everything is simple. 200 000 000 active users. This is more than enough for perfect system performance. Right now the messenger is the fastest among its competitors. If they dealt with the messenger, they will deal with the speed of work with cryptocurrency. Even though the company team is relatively small, but it’s composed of the best minds of this planet. All projects by Durov featured great talents. And Telegram has the best of them. Telegram will be able to guarantee convenience and speed. Will it be cheap? We can suppose that yes, as much as it can be possible. Conclusion There are a lot of rumors about TON cryptocurrency. If we consider the proven facts only, we can be sure that Telegram will be able to solve the fundamental problems of Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies. Pavel Durov, being the PR genius as he is, has already started his expansion. Time will show how his system will work after the official release. And we will hope that this would be the next step in cryptocurrency development.

Slovenia has announced that its largest shopping center — coincidentally known as BTC City — will transform into a complete bitcoin city , in which every store and venture will accept cryptocurrency and operate via blockchain technology.\nThe complex, located in the country’s capital of Ljubljana, stretches over 1,558,398 square feet and contains over 500 retail stores. Prime Minister Miro Cerar recently visited the shopping center, where he was treated to a cup of coffee (purchased with cryptocurrency by State Secretary Tadej Slapnik). Details regarding the center’s newfound approach to bitcoin are being headed by fintech startup Eligma.\n“The purpose of his visit was to open the Beyond 4.0 international conference, dedicated to digital society and blockchain, and to get acquainted with BTC City’s strategy to become a Bitcoin City,” said BTC City representatives.\nBTC City initially began in 1954 as a warehouse and logistics center. More warehouses were added to the complex over time, and, by 1990, it had transformed into a commercial shopping arena. BTC City presently plays host to several travel and tourism ventures including a luxury hotel and casino, a multiplex cinema, a waterpark and the Crystal Palace office park — home to Slovenia’s tallest building.\nExecutives of BTC City say they’re hoping Bitcoin City will give rise to new businesses that push the cryptocurrency space toward mainstream territory and lead to further blockchain developments.\n“Bitcoin City will create an open society which will enable users to pursue their missions as well as develop their business environments in line with their wishes, needs and operating policies,” they said.\nEligma’s cryptocurrency transaction system Elipay is being installed in several stores. Situated throughout the premises are also several one-way cryptocurrency ATMs, along with the Blockchain Think Tank and what executives call the biggest crypto mining rig in Slovenia.\nRepresentatives further commented, “The development of BTC City into a bitcoin city is an important step toward the realization of BTC’s openness-oriented strategy, providing its customers and business partners with both freedom and choices regarding their purchases with new forms of payment.”\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .

Hedge fund mogul Jim Chanos claimed Bitcoin was “masquerading as a technological breakthrough” in a new interview with Bloomberg June 4. Chanos said that in the event of a global crisis, it would be “better” to own food, or a government-backed (fiat) currency.\nSpeaking to the Institute for New Economic Thinking and quoted by various media outlets, Chanos, who last year stated he “didn’t understand” Bitcoin or blockchain technology, issued stark warnings about cryptocurrency investment.\n“We’re now nine years into this bull market, same as the ’90s, so I suspect that now things are starting to percolate,” he told Bloomberg. He also called the past year’s increased public interest in Bitcoin part of the “fraud cycle,” adding:\n“This is simply a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough in monetary policy.”\nChanos added that in the event of a global crisis, governments would step in with fiat currency as lenders of last resort, an option unavailable to cryptocurrency , given its decentralized nature:\n“For those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that’s exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least. The last thing I’d want to own is Bitcoin if the grid goes down.”\nThe well known short-seller, who predicted the fall of Enron, joins an ever-decreasing pool of steadfast Bitcoin naysayers.\nGoldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, who in December 2017 told Bloomberg Bitcoin “isn’t for him,” has since presided over a policy of increasing exposure to crypto assets.\nBerkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffet and vice president Charlie Munger nonetheless remain committed to denouncing Bitcoin investment in increasingly grotesque language, with Munger most recently comparing crypto trading to dealing in “freshly harvested baby brains” last month.

Share: Jun 05, 2018, 18:00 PM IST Trending News\nMUMBAI: Even five hours after Enforcement Directorate (ED) began questioning businessman Raj Kundra in connection with a Rs 2000-crore Bitcoin scam, the law enforcement agency is still continuing to probe him. Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty's husband, Raj Kundra, was on Tuesday summoned in connection with the scam.\nThe questioning began at 11:30 am and is likely to be revolving around Amit Bharadwaj, an accused in the case. Kundra's name came up when Bharadwaj was being questioned. The Income Tax Department had recently sent notices to bitcoin users who were dealing in bitcoins worth Rs 1 crore or more daily. These names were also forwarded to ED and a probe into possible money laundering and fraud was initiated. It is learnt that many well-known names - especially those of Bollywood celebrities - may come up during investigations.\nPune businessman Bharadwaj was arrested six months ago from the Delhi airport. He had allegedly flown away after duping over 8000 people under the Ponzi scheme. Pune Police had located him in Bangkok. He had duped people to invest in bitcoins for 18 months and promised them benefit at the return of 10 per cent. When people did not get back the promised money, they filed a complaint with the police.\nWhile the nature of Kundra's questioning is not yet clear, he is not new to controversies and was previously embroiled in the infamous IPL betting scandal. He is serving a life ban from all cricket-related activities. In March, Kundra did file a petition in Supreme Court challenging the ban.\nRajasthan Royals, a franchise he co-owns, was also banned for two years and made a comeback in the recently-concluded IPL season.

June 5, 2018\nBitcoin is, today, without a doubt, the leading cryptocurrency – usable for making payments without regard for the physical location of a payer or a recipient, and, if utilized correctly, for preserving a greater level of anonymity than is possible with many other forms of electronic payments.\nBitcoin was the first of the modern cryptocurrencies, and the first implementation of blockchain technology – attributes that helped make it the best known of the cryptos, and the one with, by far, the greatest market cap (presently at approximately $125-Billion – although this number fluctuates dramatically). Being first also means, however, that Bitcoin suffers from the technical disadvantages common among “version 1.0” software products.\nCompared with most other cryptocurrencies, for example, Bitcoin is painfully slow – it can take hours for transactions to fully settle, and the Bitcoin network is extremely inefficient – some experts estimate that it even uses more electricity per day to operate than some Western countries. Yes, literally. Bitcoin also utilizes a relatively small block size – which, while an acceptable design when Bitcoin was in its infancy and used by relatively few people, translates into poor scalability – a major issue for a platform trying to become an alternative to dollars, Euros, and other fiat currencies. Because of the way the underlying implementation of blockchain technology works, as time marches on, the adverse impact of these Bitcoin deficiencies will continue to worsen. Bitcoin also has a relatively small supply of possible coins, which also poses potential long-term challenges. ALSO READ China’s Police Force Reveals Offshore Exchange Surveillance\nIt is also important to understand that the payment anonymity first offered by Bitcoin made it quickly become a payment method of choice for all sorts of illegal activity – from ransoms demanded by ransomware , to dark web markets where people buy and sell drugs, guns, and stolen credit card numbers , to various money laundering operations. It is possible, therefore, that, even after recent drops, the skyrocketing Bitcoin prices last year have caused the greatest wealth transfer to criminals since the dawn of civilization, and may have also enriched rogue nations such as North Korea, that likely mine, steal, and use Bitcoin in order to undermine international sanctions. Bitcoin has, effectively, given them the ability to anonymously print dollars like never before.\nI believe that Western governments will not ignore these and other concerning factors forever – they certainly also do not like losing the tax revenue from people not reporting capital gains from the sale of cryptocurrencies – and attempts at creating various forms of regulations are not that far away.\nBitcoin also lacks the smart contract features of Ethereum – which, ironically, may ultimately make some criminals adopt the latter for security reasons; the heist of millions of dollars of escrowed Bitcoin by the folks running the Evolution marketplace on the dark web, for example, might have been preventable had Ethereum been the currency being escrowed, rather than Bitcoin. ALSO READ Bitcoin Mining is Booming in Iceland, But at What Cost?\nThere is, of course, no guarantee that Bitcoin will remain acceptable as a payment method. It is not “legal tender for all debts public or private,” and there is no country that guarantees that it can be used to buy goods and services within its borders. Instability in Bitcoin’s value makes accepting Bitcoin as payment for goods and services extremely risky – and both legitimate vendors and criminals are beginning to take notice; think about how many goods and services are bought and sold everyday within a ten-mile radius of your present location – now consider how few of them can be purchased with Bitcoin. Unlike tokens needed to use various blockchain-based applications, Bitcoin is effectively only a currency, so if it becomes effectively unusable or unacceptable for commerce it loses much of its reason for existing in the first place.\nI am also concerned that a great deal of the increase in Bitcoin’s value has come from speculators buying in, and businesses stocking up on the coin in case they need to pay ransoms; if nothing changes, the combination of the fact that few law-abiding people actually benefit significantly from utilizing Bitcoin in their daily lives, the instability in Bitcoin’s value is making it decreasingly viable as a payment method, the probable arrival at some point of government regulations, and the underlying technology’s shortcomings, could ultimately transform Bitcoin into the “Myspace of cryptocurrencies” – what was once the biggest and the best can ultimately be eclipsed and replaced by superior offerings. ALSO READ Volatile fiat drives bitcoin adoption in Africa\nIn short: Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, and it is possible that it will become worth very little, or even worthless, down the road.\nBlockchain, like social media, is here to stay, but who the dominant players will be as the market matures is still unknown. Of course, it is possible that Bitcoin will evolve into a standard currency on par with the dollar or Euro; with its shortcomings, however, I remain skeptical.

Home Finance Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Trading Volume Soars But Ripple Keeps Falling Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Trading Volume Soars But Ripple Keeps Falling June 5, 2018 0\nMay was a bumper month for bitcoin cash and ethereum. Both digital assets saw a major increase in global trading volume compared to the month prior. BTC held steady, averaging $200 billion a month, but ripple didn’t fare so well, recording trading volume that was down 86% since January, mirroring its decline in price.\nAlso read: Decentralized Exchange Compendium ‘Index’ Lists Over 200 Dex Platforms Bitcoin Cash Is May’s King of Coins\nThere are various ways to measure a cryptocurrency that’s in demand, with trading volume the most useful indicator after price. A lot of bitcoin cash changed hands in May – 140% more than in the month prior in fact. Diar’s weekly update highlights the big winners and losers in the cryptocurrency market in May, and shows the substantial demand for BCH. In total, $30 billion of bitcoin cash changed hands in May. The next biggest gainer was ethereum, whose trade volume was up 50% on April, resulting in monthly trading volume of over $80 billion.\nMost major cryptocurrencies saw an increase in trading volume in May including litecoin, which had a modest increase. There was one notable loser however – ripple. XRP trading volume has been on the decline since January, back when $100 billion of tokens were traded in a month, pushing the price of XRP north of $3. Reality has since settled in, and May saw just $16 billion of ripple traded. Fake Volume Rears Its Head\nWhen it comes to analyzing trading volume, one topic that often crops up concerns fake volume. Exchanges and their traders are frequently accused of creating orders that they have no intention of fulfilling, which creates a false impression of liquidity. If traders are doing so, it’s likely bot-based as a means of market manipulation in the pursuit of profit. If exchanges are responsible, it’s likely to make their platform look more popular than it is, and to benefit from the additional custom that comes from being a top ranked global exchange by volume.\nBinance is the latest exchange to have faced accusations of fake volume, with certain coins displaying unusually high volume for short periods of time, comprising fluctuations that appear outwith normal trading patterns. Given the hundreds of thousands of traders who can be using a platform such as Binance at one time, including countless bots connected via API, determining which orders are real, which are fake, and who’s responsible for any manipulation, is virtually impossible.\nDo you think fake volume is a problem on major exchanges?

It’s the second attempt by the outfit, and both times they’ve relied upon stylometry before concluding that Bitcoin Cash developer Gavin Andresen is Satoshi hiding in plain sight. This go-round analysis involves not only statistical analysis of prose, but also Maciej Eder’s bootstrapping method in an attempt to eliminate natural bias in such conclusions.\nAlso read: Apple Sides with Russian Govt, Restricts Telegram, Claims Pavel Durov Bitcoin Cash Developer Gavin Andresen Is the Real Satoshi Nakamoto\nTwo upfront admittances, if readers indulge. The first is, I am a Troy Watson fan. I enjoy his work, and count myself as someone who approves of his earnest dive into such subjects. Second, I have probably read more about the present pseudonym under examination than is healthy, and not just because I make my living in the space. Flatly, I am obsessed. No clickbait here, or not intentionally. No hype. This is a fun pursuit, and one worth some effort as it involves cryptocurrency’s origin story.\nZy Crypto is a curious little outfit based in a lesser-known part of the United Kingdom. They’ve the site proper, a news aggregation service, and what appear to be variations on the public relations themes of initial coin offerings and blockchains. To publish one, let alone two articles asserting both times how Bitcoin Cash developer Gavin Andresen is Satoshi, for once and for all, speaks volumes about either the confidence Zy has in its writer or the fact they’re sporting for clicks.\nConsider this sentence, hitting readers right between the eyes: “We identified Bitcoin Cash developer Gavin Andresen as being the real Satoshi Nakamoto,” Mr. Watson boldly asserts before an immediate pivot towards technique. The primary methodology used in both examinations is what’s known as stylometry. It’s the study of prose put up against other writers as a way of determining patterns and is an actual predictive of authorship when done well.\nStylometry has picked up in recent years as an investigative tool when faced with the spectre of Satoshi Nakamoto. The pseudo anonymous creator of Bitcoin holds more than five percent of bitcoin in circulation, making him the first crypto billionaire. Should Mr. Nakamoto decide for shits and giggles to dump a significant amount of coin onto the market, not only would the price drop by virtue of economic law, confidence would probably crash as well, bringing down a giant chunk of whatever value bitcoin has. It’s a big goddamn deal who Satoshi is. Zy Crypto neato graph. Stylometry’s False Positives or Conclusive Hits\nThe technology to out a writer wishing to remain in has proven its worth. In the mid 1960s, Frederick Mosteller used stylometry to establish authorship of the hotly contested Federalist Papers , determining James Madison as their probable main author (instead of Alexander Hamilton). It took him almost half a decade, whereas today software exists to run such analysis pretty fast. More famously, and recently, no less an author than zillion-selling Harry Potter creator JK Rowling was found to be the actual author of The Cuckoo’s Calling . A few years ago she wished to have her writing evaluated on its own merits, and so Ms. Rowling took a pen name. Stylometry outed her. Satoshi?\nAnd Zy Crypto isn’t the first to attempt applying the statistical method to Satoshi’s true identity. As bitcoin’s price began to skyrocket, so did interest in who its creator might’ve been. During Craig Wright ’s supremely odd public display, outed by supposed hackers, claiming to be Satoshi and then suggesting it was a hoax, a couple of once well-regarded tech journals believed Mr. Wright to be Satoshi . International Business Times employed the very firm used to blow Ms. Rowling’s cover, Juola & Associates. They soon determined what most in the know suspected: Mr. Wright wasn’t bitcoin’s father (he’d respond that he and partner David Kleiman collaborated on the project, but even that has been posthumously tainted). He managed to fool or convince or onboard original Bitcoin dev Gavin Andresen, who went so far as to record video testimony (Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum genius, weighed in on the noise of the matter, and later just outright spat fraud in Mr. Wright’s direction).\nLate 2017, price fever pitch reached maximum overdrive, and Michael Chon took his own swing at discovery. The Georgetown University and Booz Allen Hamilton alum concluded Satoshi was a group of devs, with some authoring the whitepaper while others engaged in email exchanges. He narrowed it down to four: “Nick Szabo, Ian Grigg, Wei Dai, and Timothy C. May.” Gavin Andresen wasn’t considered, a subject to which we return.\nMr. Watson details how “using Eder’s bootstrapped stylometry method…this finding supports our previous article on the topic that also identified Gavin as Satoshi using Principal Component Analysis and Burrows’ delta.” Knowing full well the history I’ve outlined above, he concludes, “A big part of this failure can be attributed to the lack of convergence validity in the stylometry field.” And a pitfall within the field itself is how “stylometrics often cherry pick results due to their algorithms producing vastly different results when slightly tweaked,” he acknowledged. This led to suggesting Wei Dai as Satoshi, at least for a time. Using Stylometry Analysis I Have Discovered I May Be Satoshi Nakamoto\nThis time, Mr. Watson’s confidence in Mr. Andresen as Satoshi extends from Maciej Eder, who “created a bootstrapping method specifically designed to overcome the problem of cherry picking elements like Most Frequent Words (MFW). The approach uses Burrows’ delta to find a difference between two texts, but also uses random sampling of MFW ranges so as to output more robust results. Burrows’ delta is basically a manhattan distance of z-scores which is sourced from a list of top words used in an entire corpus.”\nThe rest of the article reads similarly, and the interested would do well with frequent searches of Wikipedia. Nevertheless, he’s “found that the first nearest neighbour was Satoshi’s email texts followed by 3 of Gavin Andresen’s Github documents and then followed by Satoshi’s forum texts. These findings are quite reasonable because not only do they validate the links between the Satoshi whitepaper-emails-forums but they also cluster Gavin as the likely author. It’s also of interest that Gavin’s style was so much like Satoshi’s whitepaper that he beat Satoshi himself with the forum texts!” Crypto Cornelius for the win.\nStill more discussion of limitations and technical methodology follows, and those without a statistical or mathematical background are cautioned. It’s somewhat like reading French if you don’t speak French. Yeah, there’s the standard Latin alphabet and all, but that’s about as far as most will get. Again, Wikipedia is a friend. I don’t buy it in the end, and have instead relied upon resident ecosystem muckraker, Crypto Cornelius , as my prime response. “I have identified Myself,” he typed in the patois of most these studies, “an amateur crypto enthusiast as being the real Satoshi Nakamoto using Yeder’s bootstrapped Coronary Angiogram stylometry method. This finding supports a previous thought when I woke up one night and thought ‘Could I be Nakamoto?’” Sides splitting, tears dropping on the laptop as I type to you Dear Reader, he continues, “Nano Stylometry was invented by Elon Musk and is a set of methods that aim to identify an unknown author by statistically deciphering their style using statistics, hard to understand graphics and random information.” For geeks like me, good old Cornelius is necessary to bring us back to reality.

Today, on June 5, bitcoin fell to $7,400, increasing the probability of a further drop to $6,900. End of Another Corrective Rally\nThe failure to recover back to $7,700 speedily in the next 12 to 24 hours would signify the end of BTC’s most recent corrective rally. On April 12, BTC’s corrective rally extended from $6,900 to $9,900, but it ultimately came to an end after BTC failed to test the $10,000 support level.\nThroughout April, the BTC price fell sharply from $11,700 to $6,900, leading investors to panic. The swift corrective rally of BTC from $6,900 to $9,900 convinced investors that the next bull rally of bitcoin is imminent. However, the low volume of BTC and the strong hand of bears disallowed bulls to take over the market, initiating yet another correction.\nIf BTC falls below the $7,200 mark in the next 24 hours, a drop to the $6,000 region is inevitable. If BTC falls to the higher end of the $6,000 region, a sudden surge in volume triggered by a corrective rally is a possible situation, similar to the rally of BTC on April 12. If BTC falls to the lower end of $6,000 by slowly bleeding out from the higher end of $6,900, it may result in BTC initiating a mid-term recovery throughout June, without a short-term bounce.\nIt is also possible for BTC to bounce strongly at $6,530, a region where the last corrective rally on April 12 was triggered. In early April, there were some notable spikes in volume that led investors to be optimistic about the short-term trend of BTC. As of recent, the volume of BTC has been substantially low, decreasing the probability of a short-term bounce back to the $8,000 region. What is Causing the Bleed Out?\nBTC is suffering from an intense downward trend and a sell-off from medium-sized investors and holders. The sell-off of investors is not being met with an increase in demand from both small and large-scale investors, as seen in the daily trading volume.\nBut, the cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile and the entrance of a few large-scale investors could sway the market, especially in a period like this wherein the volume of BTC remains quite low.\nAri Paul, the co-founder of Blocktower, a prominent cryptocurrency hedge fund founded by Paul along with Goldman Sachs executives, stated that institutional investors can only enter the market once proper custodian solutions are available.\n“[Emergence of reliable custodian solutions] that will allow institutional inflows to start accelerating. Once a couple big traditional money managers announce that they’re including BTC as ‘digital gold’ in their portfolios, others will follow. Again, not instantly, but I think fairly quickly,” said Paul.\nUntil then, which could be three to six months from now, it is unlikely that the cryptocurrency market returns to the $500 billion region and BTC recovers to its previous all-time high.\nIt is also important to prevent recency bias from affecting trading calls. A drop to $6,900 for BTC could lead investors to panic, but a quick bounce as seen in on April 12, could lead BTC back to $8,000 in an instant.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cryptocurrency market suffers bitcoin price drops", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T16:41:21.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5012972612abd1e8b5c4395b8da975d29be22749", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMsBMGqLDzzLIl0ERgqKRUlyD.kB7eXEuoo-", "site_full": "vectrum.biz", "site": "vectrum.biz", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Japan’s GMO Unveils Specs and Price of 7nm Bitcoin Mining Rigs – On Sale Tomorrow – Vectrum", "title_full": "Japan’s GMO Unveils Specs and Price of 7nm Bitcoin Mining Rigs – On Sale Tomorrow – Vectrum", "published": "2018-06-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i1.wp.com/vectrum.biz/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gmo-miner-banner1-768x768.png?fit=768%2C768", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5012972612abd1e8b5c4395b8da975d29be22749", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMsBMGqLDzzLIl0ERgqKRUlyD.kB7eXEuoo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lloyd Alexandre", "published": "2018-06-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Japan’s GMO Unveils Specs and Price of 7nm Bitcoin Mining Rigs – On Sale Tomorrow – Vectrum", "text": "June 5, 2018 June 5, 2018 No Comments on Japan’s GMO Unveils Specs and Price of 7nm Bitcoin Mining Rigs – On Sale Tomorrow Article written by Kevin Helms from Bitcoin News. Read full article here .\nJapan’s GMO Internet has unveiled the price and specs of the GMO miner B2 equipped with 7nm ASIC mining chips. The mining capacity is 24 TH/s and the price of the machines will be adjusted monthly according to demand. Using GMO’s mining rigs, the power consumption can be reduced up to 20% and the cost of network equipment can be reduced to 1/55, local media report from Tuesday’s press conference.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space GMO Miner B2 Specs\nJapanese internet giant GMO announced the details of its bitcoin mining rigs called “GMO miner B2” in a press conference on Tuesday, June 5, ahead of the actual launch that is scheduled for the morning of the following day, June 6.\nNikkei reported:\nThe GMO miner B2 features a semiconductor chip ‘GMO 72b’ dedicated to mining that adopts the in-house developed 7-nanometer process technology. The hash rate indicating the computing capacity of mining is 24 TH/s, and can calculate hash 24 trillion times per second. Bitmain Antminer S9\nFor comparison, the popular Bitmain Antminer S9’s hashrate is 14TH/s. According to Bloomberg, the GMO chips are designed in Japan and produced in Taiwan.\nMasatoshi Kumagai, Chairman and Director of GMO Internet and the GMO Group representative, described the advantages of his company’s mining equipment over other products.\n“The performance per unit is higher than that of major competitors’ products,” he was quoted by the news outlet. “If we switch from over 20,000 mining machines operating in Northern Europe to GMO miner B2, the installation space will be about half in terms of equivalent performance.” Power Consumption\n“Compared to general mining machines…the power consumption is up to 20%, the cost of network equipment etc. can be reduced to 1/55,” Itmedia noted.\nKumai publication reported from the press conference that each unit consumes 1,950 watts and power supply units can supply up to 2,200 watts at 240 V. Adjustable Price – $1,999 for June\nGMO miner B2 will be sold through the company’s subsidiary in Zug, Switzerland, according to Nikkei. They will be on sale starting Wednesday and orders will start shipping from the end of October, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported .\nThe price for each unit is “announced monthly,” the publication added, revealing that the “sales price in June is $1,999.” Itmedia described:\nThe price for the June release is $1,999 (including power supply unit, excluding tax). The sales price is adjusted monthly according to demand etc. The number of shipments was kept private.\nCurrently, Bitmain’s Antminer S9 is priced at $837. GMO’s Plans\nMr. Masatoshi Kumagai told reporters that so far the crypto mining industry is dominated “by mining machines provided by Bitmain, a major mining hardware company in China,” and that he “noticed the fact that not a single Japanese company that is good at manufacturing is able to participate.”\nHe also revealed that the company “invested nearly 10 billion yen for the development of the product,” the publication conveyed and quoted the chairman explaining:\nWe are not setting business targets such as sales targets yet, but if we cannot sell it, we will use it in our mining business, so I think that it is a very excellent business in that there is no inventory risk.\nFurthermore, he added, “we also provide an API (application programming interface) for system monitoring compatible with GMO miner B2 and a detection function [for] when the product is connected to the net at the time of an unlikely event of theft.”\nWhat do you think of GMO miner B2? Will you buy one? Let us know in the comments section below.\nImages courtesy of Shutterstock, Nikkei, Itmedia, Kumai, and GMO Internet.\nNeed to calculate your bitcoin holdings?

Sarah Jenn | June 5, 2018 | 4:05 am Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Bears Return in Full Swing! Sarah Jenn | June 5, 2018 | 4:05 am\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights Bitcoin price recently broke out of a descending trend line and is pulling back for a retest. Price is at a crucial area of interest, though, and a bounce or break could determine the next long-term direction. If these support levels hold, bitcoin could bounce back to the swing high and resume the reversal.\nBitcoin price is pulling back to an area of interest after breaking above a longer-term descending trend line.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the upside. This suggests that the uptrend is more likely to resume than to reverse. However, price has fallen below the longer-term 200 SMA as an early indicator that bearish momentum is kicking in.\nRSI is indicating oversold conditions, though, so a bounce may be in order. Stochastic has already climbed out of the oversold area to show that buyers are ready to return. A larger pullback to the broken trend line closer to the 61.8% Fib may be the last line of defense for bulls, and a break below this could lead to a drop to the swing low. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin was off to a promising start for the week but it looks like bulls were unable to sustain the momentum as investor worries lingered. Not even remarks from Steve Wozniak on how bitcoin is the only digital gold were able to help. He cited:\nAll the others tend to give up some of the aspects of Bitcoin. For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control. That’s the first one they have to give up to try to have a business model.\nStill, the dollar managed to recoup its losses in the latest US session, likely on the bounce in equities. Trump and Kim Jong-Un are still a go with their meeting on June 12 and this is giving dollar bulls optimism at the moment.

The scandal resulted in the departure of Chief Executive Ian Narev.\nCBA denies knowingly breaching AML laws, arguing that a single coding error had led to the failure to report the 53,506 transactions. However, they did admit responsibility for a lack of proper due diligence.\n“Our agreement today is a clear acknowledgment of our failures and is an important step towards moving the bank forward. On behalf of Commonwealth Bank, I apologise to the community for letting them down,” said CBA current chief executive, Matt Comyn. Illegal transactions: Fiat vs. Crypto\nThis news is particularly ironic considering the accusations by the mainstream media (and Bill Gates ) that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are being used primarily for money laundering and funding terrorism.\nStudies conducted by Colombia University Economics professor Edgar Feige have already disproven these claims, citing that almost 50% of the world’s hard currency is utilized to make Illicit transactions like drug and arms trafficking.\nA recent panel held by the US Senate Judiciary on modernizing anti-money laundering laws also found that only a small percentage of illicit activity spending is done through cryptocurrency .\nThe fact remains that cash is offline, and therefore more difficult to trace. Digital cash is recorded on a centralized database, where institutions with their own agendas can easily hide these transactions from the authorities.\nBy contrast, the immutability of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain actually makes it harder to move money around without a trace.\nA recent study by Qatar University and Hamad Bin Khalifa University revealed that unmasking the users behind these transactions often requires nothing more than a wallet address and a Google search. Qatar University researcher, Husam Al Jawaheri, explained:\nThe retroactive operation security of Bitcoin is low. When things are recorded in the blockchain, you can go back in history and reveal this information, to break the anonymity of users.\nThe best drug traffickers can hope for at the moment is using coins like Monero to mask their transactions, however, even Monero has its vulnerabilities . CBA Implementing Blockchain?\nJust 2 years ago, the now-ousted CBA executive Ian Narev acknowledged blockchain’s potential to be “transformational” for customers and in reducing costs, while perhaps not also recognizing its capabilities as an immutable ledger for the Bank itself.\nIt’s safe to say that a CBA ledger built on the blockchain would’ve made it much more difficult to conceal 53,506 transactions, saving AUSTRAC a lot of time and money investigating the breach.\nTo date, CBA has spent more than $400 million on anti-money laundering compliance measures.\nDo you think the bank would consider using Blockchain technology to improve compliance with AML an d counter-terrorism financing laws?

Bitcoin mining rigs are currently easily imported into Vietnam. This proposal follows the largest crypto fraud case in the country involving over $656 million and more than 32,000 victims.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Ministry of Finance’s Proposal In the recently released report containing the opinions of the ministries involved in the management of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Vietnam, the country’s Ministry of Finance proposes suspending the importation of mining equipment, according to local media. This report, referred to as Document 5964 / BTC-TCHQ, has been submitted to the country’s prime minister. Zing.vn publication elaborated:\nAccording to the Ministry of Finance, mining machines are not on the list of goods banned from importation and are not subject to the list of specialized management or unsafe goods, so enterprises are easily allowed to complete the import procedures. The ministry outlined in its report that the use of mining equipment for bitcoin, litecoin and other cryptocurrencies in the country is difficult for the authority to manage. “From there, it is easy for people to use [cryptocurrencies] as a currency or another method of payment,” the City Economic News Kinhte & Dothi quoted the ministry. “This is in violation of the amended government Decree 101 on non-cash payments,” Zing.vn conveyed.\nThe publication also noted that data from the General Department of Vietnam Customs shows that “from 2017 to half of 4/2018, the country imported about 15,600 mining machines,” adding that most of them were imported into Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Da Nang. Last year, more than 9,300 rigs were imported into Vietnam and over 6,300 rigs were imported in the first four months of this year. Decision to Ban Mining Imports\nThe ministry also referred the case where Modern Tech Corp in Ho Chi Minh City was “accused [of] over VND 15 trillion [~US$656 million] of fraud by more than 32,000 people through its Ifan and Pincoin virtual currency investment models.” According to the ministry, protecting the Vietnamese people from similar scams in the future “requires state management agencies to take strict control measures with the import and use of this commodity.” The Vnexpress reiterated:\nTo prevent other possible events, in the immediate future, the Ministry of Finance proposed to apply the import suspension measures for the above types of mining equipment.\nThe Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc recently signed a directive to strengthen “the management of activities related to bitcoin and other virtual currencies,” as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported .\nWhat do you think of the proposal to ban mining rig imports?

Bitmain ’s Antminer S9 uses a 16nm chip, while Halong Mining ’s DragonMint T1 features a 10nm chip produced by Samsung.\nGMO believes the release of this miner is the first step in supplanting Bitmain — which currently manufacturers an estimated 80 percent of all ASIC miners — as the dominant force in the industry.\n“I respect Bitmain, but we will top them,” GMO CEO Masatoshi Kumagai reportedly said.\nBloomberg tech reporter Yuji Nakamura reports that, though developed in Japan, the B2’s 7nm chips were produced in Taiwan, most likely by TSMC, which also supplies China-based mining giant Bitmain with most of its chips. GMO unveils Japan's first-ever Bitcoin mining chip B2:🛒$1,999 (vs $837 for Bitmain's S9)⚡️24TH/s (vs 14TH/s for S9)🇹🇼Designed in JP, produced in TW🔌1,950w per unit📅Reservations start June 6, ships by Oct end👨‍💼CEO: \"I respect Bitmain, but we will top them\" pic.twitter.com/m04WGBX1jf\n— Yuji Nakamura (@ynakamura56) June 5, 2018\nThe B2 will retail for $1,999 — compared to $837 for the S9 — but its specs are vastly superior to those of Bitmain’s flagship product. GMO says that the B2 can achieve 24TH/s (vs 14TH/s for the S9) at a power consumption of 1950W per unit (81W per 1TH/s). GMO will begin accepting preorders for the units on June 6, with an anticipated ship date in October.\nThe production of these devices will also help GMO build out its bitcoin mining operation, which the firm launched last year. According to data released Tuesday, the company mined 472 BTC and 37 BCH in May. The firm now has a total hashrate of 299PH/s, up from 22PH/s in Dec. 2017. The company has stated that it hopes to achieve 3,000PH/s by the end of the year, representing a more than 900 percent increase from current levels.\nAs CCN reported , GMO also recently developed an app called “CryptoChips by GMO” that distributes bitcoin rewards to mobile gamers based on their rankings within participating games.\nFeatured Image from Twitter", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yuji nakamura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "masatoshi kumagai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gmo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tsmc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taiwan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T17:18:36.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "082d8be173dee6a0598b604cba792f1bc74de74e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQO744iQOU.daAU63kK70DG3FoeJQCcT27UuAsjCV8Tt3KKAdGMAch4dcTLT4PRaqI-", "site_full": "www.pinterest.com", "site": "pinterest.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech", "social"], "section_title": "", "title": "bitcoin fork november bitcoin atm las vegas strip – next big thing after bitcoin… – cupbord", "title_full": "bitcoin fork november bitcoin atm las vegas strip – next big thing after bitcoin… – cupbord", "published": "2018-06-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.043, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "082d8be173dee6a0598b604cba792f1bc74de74e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQO744iQOU.daAU63kK70DG3FoeJQCcT27UuAsjCV8Tt3KKAdGMAch4dcTLT4PRaqI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mohamed Elarby", "published": "2018-06-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin fork november bitcoin atm las vegas strip – next big thing after bitcoin… – cupbord", "text": "bitcoin fork november bitcoin atm las vegas strip – next big thing after bitcoin… bitcoin fork november bitcoin atm las vegas strip – next big thing after bitcoin… Mohamed Elarby June 5, 2018 Technology No Comments\nbitcoin fork november bitcoin atm las vegas strip – next big thing after bitcoin.athena bitcoin cryptocurrency technology sell itunes gift card for bitcoin hello cryptocurrency bitcoin cash live chart 24090.bitcoin latest news today bitcoin why buy – top websites to buy bitcoin.bitcoin cash to usd how to get one bitcoin lydian cryptocurrency bigger than bitcoin gemini wallet bitcoin 77642 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T18:18:11.034+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cb91a3509a5b3a8ccddf89116005c53f2cf15ade", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVSAy5K._BR06Xj9CUrtj2WNoREwoxW84eqmTOUiZ3urL6whfWCmfg.G0AB_GHsHDHT6Ul9kraXRwsMm2IuSyXSw--", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Zimbabwe’s Golix Exchange Enters Kenya, Uganda, South Africa - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Zimbabwe’s Golix Exchange Enters Kenya, Uganda, South Africa - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-06-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_781019464_1600.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cb91a3509a5b3a8ccddf89116005c53f2cf15ade", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVSAy5K._BR06Xj9CUrtj2WNoREwoxW84eqmTOUiZ3urL6whfWCmfg.G0AB_GHsHDHT6Ul9kraXRwsMm2IuSyXSw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lubomir Tassev", "published": "2018-06-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Zimbabwe’s Golix Exchange Enters Kenya, Uganda, South Africa - Bitcoin News", "text": "291 Zimbabwe’s Golix Exchange Enters Kenya, Uganda, South Africa\nCrypto exchange Golix is entering three other African markets in an effort to survive the ban imposed by the central bank in its home country – Zimbabwe. Moreover, the troubled trading platform claims the move is part of a strategy to offer its services across the whole continent. Golix says the shortage of infrastructure has slowed down the adoption of cryptocurrencies in Africa.\nAlso read: Johannesburg Gets a New Crypto ATM, Ban Threatened Harare May Lose One Golix Moves On After Ban, Expands in Africa\nTrying to stay afloat after the crackdown by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), Golix has turned its attention to Kenya, Uganda, and South Africa. Zimbabwe’s leading cryptocurrency exchange hopes to continue trading in these African countries, despite the ban imposed by financial authorities in Harare.\nIn a statement quoted by News Day , Golix head of growth, Panashe Tapera, noted that moving outside the country was part of a new strategy – the trading platform plans to expand operations across the entire continent. Tapera said:\nAs part of our strategy, starting from Friday, June 1, people in Kenya, South Africa and Uganda will be able to start trading from Golix. This is one of our plans to be the leading exchange in Africa, which is inspired by the vision to provide financial autonomy in the continent.\nGolix has been offering exchange services in Zimbabwe for the past three years and was the only crypto trading platform there for quite some time, processing transactions worth $20 million and having 50,000 local users. Now it’s planning to continue to do the same in more and larger markets, saying that shortage of crypto infrastructure has slowed down the adoption of digital currencies in Africa.\nThe Republic of South Africa, the region’s economic powerhouse, has the highest number of cryptocurrency exchanges on the continent. Its central bank has set up a special unit tasked to review its position on cryptocurrencies and a “self-regulatory” approach has been proposed by legal experts working in the crypto sector. Uganda has been mentioned recently as a crypto-friendly destination, where the leading crypto exchange Binance wants to open a new office. Challenging the Central Bank in Court\nThe announcement comes after last month the central bank in Harare issued a circular to banking institutions instructing them to stop providing bank accounts to cryptocurrency companies. The new guidelines effectively banned all crypto-related activities in the country. The RBZ gave local banks and cryptocurrency operators 60 days to comply.\nGolix has since sent several letters to its clients informing them that they would not be able to trade digital coins or deposit fiat currency, and also helping them withdraw their funds.\nAccording to local media, the operator of the exchange, Bitfinance Limited, has filed a lawsuit against the central bank. Later, it was reported that the country’s High Court has ruled in favor of the company’s argument that the RBZ has no authority to ban digital currencies.\nLast week, Golix said it had been granted “an interim relief.” In further communication with its customers, the exchange shared that its accounts had not been restored and the legal proceedings were still ongoing. “Nevertheless, please note that we are in the middle of promising engagements with a financial institution which is willing to process our fiat withdrawals through a prepaid debit card,” the platform told its clients. Golix Takes Its Token Sale to the New Markets\nThe Zimbabwean exchange intends to enter and operate in Kenya, Uganda and South Africa by also conducting its $32 million token sale there. The aim of the coin offering is to enable instant remittances and international payments through cryptocurrencies.\nAccording to Golix lead of special projects, William Chui, “Since the onset, our main agenda is to provide financial autonomy in Africa. The GLX token is going to be used to facilitate and realize this agenda.”\nClients from different countries will be able to buy the GLX token from the exchange with fiat currencies, he explained. Then, the coin issued by Golix will be used to purchase other cryptos on its trading platform at zero transaction fees.\nZimbabwe’s first crypto exchange also promises lower fees, in comparison with traditional banking methods, for remittances and international transfers facilitated by the GLX token. The Golix representative believes that will contribute to the GDP growth in African countries.\nDo you think the expansion to new markets will help Golix survive the ban in Zimbabwe?

Bitcoin has left a Doji after a mid-sized candlestick, so we could see a turning formation during the American session.\nOn the upside, the first target is at the 50-EMA, located now at the $7550 mark, followed then by the 100-SMA at the $7650 level. Breaching that level would be very bullish for BTC/USD, although it is not the most likely scenario. Further above, there is another price resistance level at $7870 that would leave Bitcoin at the doors of a technically important trendline at $7950.\nOn the bearish side, the first support is at the current price ($7400), with a possible extension down to $7359. If that level is lost, Bitcoin would fall straight down to the more accelerated trendline that is located at the $7230 level.\nMACD in the Bitcoin 4-hour chart is still showing some room to cover on the bearish side, particularly if we consider that it is trading on the positive side of the indicator, losing some strength. Potential bearish lateral moves look quite likely with an increase of volatility, which could lead to a change of direction.\nDirectional Movement Index in the same chart is showing buyers in retreat since the $7700 level was reached. Sellers, on the other hand, have been increasing their positions as the price action started weakening, but have quieted in the last hours, not showing much confidence in more falls.\nETH/USD 4H chart\nEthereum fell down yesterday to $580 just before bouncing to the price congestion support at $587. However, the 50-EMA at the $590 mark was lost and has been barely recovered at the time of writing this article.\nETH/USD is stuck in a tight falling wedge, barely in a $70 range, where the 50-EMA, the 100-SMA and two significant price levels ($587 and $565) meet.\nGiven the current scenario, every level is important, with the most important one to track on the upside being the 100-SMA located at the $602 mark and the falling wedge superior trendline at $605. If those levels are broken to the upside, Ethereum would enter a much more positive scenario that would quickly take the $620 mark back.\nOn the bearish side, the first support is on the 50-EMA at $590, which would take the price back to the inferior trendline located at $570. If that level is lost, ETH/USD would enter a scenario open to new falls, with the first support being very close to the $567 mark. That would be the last stop before very important falls that would target $520.\nMACD in the Ethereum 4-hour chart shows how the bearish movement is losing steam and both the mid-line and the signal one are flattening quickly, proposing a bullish cross attempt. This is a very premature try and will probably fail. We should still consider this as lateral with a neutral profile.\nDirectional Movement Index in the same chart is gifting us another setup favorable for confusion. Buyers and sellers are close to being even, with a profile that proposes an increase on the buyers' side. Technical setups such as this one usually allow confusing movements that might result in a contrarian outcome. The outlook is lateral with bullish potential, but we should wait and see.\nXRP/USD 4H chart\nRipple is trading inside a wide-open technical scenario, but with multiple resistances and supports complicating any development. The indicators are set up quite differently than the other two assets analyzed.\nOn the upside, the first resistance is located at $0.66, immediately followed by the trendline located at $0.67 that protects the doors to a net bullish territory. We can find another price congestion resistance at $0.679, which strengthens the wall behind the bulls paradise.\nOn the downside, the first support is at the 50-EMA ($0.635), followed by a price congestion support at $0.63. If that level was lost, the bearish target would clearly be at $0.60.\nMACD in the Ripple 4-hour chart shows a similar profile than the Ethereum one, although a bit more advanced. This is an optimal profile for a bullish cross, but also for a bull trap. We recommend to wait to confirm the breakout and latter consolidation before taking any positions.\nDirectional Movement Index in the same chart still gives some edge to the buyers, that might take back the ADX line. If that happens, it would be a very strong bullish signal. Sellers have increased a lot during the last dip, but are losing some strength today, not showing much confidence to more falls.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/top-3-bitcoin-ethereum-ripple-price-prediction-technical-contradictions-price-action-to-dictate-decision-making-201806051004", "https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/BTCUSD", "https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T23:44:33.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3bffd79caca6baf0c20e7f1df3ceadbeeac1a36e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSn_gk062VlfY4LrqtSUM5BhB1fzwi7p3WYUacyOU8JGcBrc4aE1lgZtMZe5moPopqgwMMdLCyx37a4k8GcoYZDMLSse_6K2k.p_iBDq.r7Xg--", "site_full": "www.coindesk.com", "site": "coindesk.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Apple Co-Founder Backs Dorsey: Bitcoin Should Become Web's Currency - CoinDesk", "title_full": "Apple Co-Founder Backs Dorsey: Bitcoin Should Become Web's Currency - CoinDesk", "published": "2018-06-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/06/woz.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10453, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 4}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3bffd79caca6baf0c20e7f1df3ceadbeeac1a36e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSn_gk062VlfY4LrqtSUM5BhB1fzwi7p3WYUacyOU8JGcBrc4aE1lgZtMZe5moPopqgwMMdLCyx37a4k8GcoYZDMLSse_6K2k.p_iBDq.r7Xg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nikhilesh De", "published": "2018-06-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Apple Co-Founder Backs Dorsey: Bitcoin Should Become Web's Currency - CoinDesk", "text": "Apple Co-Founder Backs Dorsey: Bitcoin Should Become Web's Currency NEWS Jun 5, 2018 at 02:00 UTC\nApple co-founder Steve Wozniak is a big believer – though not an investor currently – in bitcoin.\nWhen asked about recent comments from Square and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey – who remarked during CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference in New York that he hopes bitcoin becomes the internet's \"native currency\" – Wozniak said he hopes that vision works out.\n\"I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it's going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking,\" Wozniak was quoted as saying by CNBC on Monday. Wozniak was interviewed during the Money 20/20 conference, which is taking place this week in Amsterdam.\nHe spoke positively about the aspect of cryptocurrency that limits the number of coins that can exist – but stressed that he isn't an investor but rather a supportive technologist.\nThe Apple co-founder also indicated his support for bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies, stating that \"only bitcoin is pure digital gold...and I totally buy into that.\"\n\"All the others tend to give up some of the aspects of bitcoin,\" he went on to say. \"For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control. That's the first one they have to give up to try to have a business model.\"\nSteve Wozniak image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

Ackermann", "text": "tjack\nJapanese IT giant GMO Internet has revealed prices and specs for its new-from-the-ground-up bitcoin miners – the world’s first based on a 7nm chip.\nAt a press conference, the company said Tuesday that its 7nm ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) that will power the new B2 miner is designed in Japan, but manufactured in Taiwan.\nThe arrival of a 7nm chip is notable since it ushers in more hashing power for bitcoin miners , while at the same time reducing power consumption, an important factor for miners in seeking return on their investment.\nAccording to a Bloomberg reporter who tweeted from the event, the B2 will provide a hash rate of 24TH/s, with power consumption at 1,950W per unit – that breaks down at 81W per 1 TH/s.\nBy comparison, the current market leader – Bitmain’s Antminer S9 – offers 14TH/s at a power consumption of around 1,300W or 93W/TH (2x = 28 TH/s @ 2,600W) .\nThe B2 may offer market leading power, if GMO’s figures prove to be accurate, but it will come at a price – $1,999 ($84/TH) to be exact. That’s compared with $837 for the Antminer S9 ($60/TH).\nAs if there was any doubt that GMO plans to knock Bitmain of its pedestal, the firm’s CEO Masatoshi Kumagai reportedly stated:\n“I respect Bitmain, but we will top them”\nAs reported by CoinDesk, the B2 was revealed on May 24, with GMP saying pre-orders will start on June 6 and shipments to follow in October.\nThe launch comes following a months-long testing period since the firm initially revealed it was researching and developing the new mining processor in September 2017.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas j. ackermann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gmo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taiwan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T20:51:54.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f92366c09c3b8db0514159a057f13137045b432d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS2bkr_4KZr2zB_r9TPbQtGI-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "title_full": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "published": "2018-06-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f92366c09c3b8db0514159a057f13137045b432d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS2bkr_4KZr2zB_r9TPbQtGI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInstall our official extension in Mozilla Firefox Store to start earning BTC – To get started visit ------> https://btctarget.blogspot.com/2018/04/guide-to-earn-btc-in-2018.html\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can trust us with 100%, we always pay!

The top cryptocurrency by market value struggled to gain much momentum in either direction, trading for a second day near $7,500. These are the stories you can’t miss in cryptocurrencies for Tuesday, June 5. Apple’s Wozniak Echoes ‘Native Currency’ Sentiment\nSteve Wozniak, co-founder of Action Alerts PLUS holding Apple Inc. (AAPL) , said he remains bullish on bitcoin but doesn’t currently own any. Wozniak, who labels himself as a supportive technologist but not an investor, told CNBC that he agrees with comments from Square Inc. (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey, who said he wants bitcoin to become the internet’s “native currency” last month. “I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking,” Wozniak said. SEC Appoints Crypto Director\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it has appointed Valerie Szczepanik as the associate director of the Division of Corporation Finance and senior adviser for digital assets and innovation. Szczepanik is expected to “coordinate efforts across all SEC divisions and offices regarding the application of U.S. securities laws to emerging digital asset technologies and innovations, including initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrencies,” the SEC said. The commission has played a pivotal role in the public discourse regarding the future of crypto regulation, most recently honing in on ICOs and associated fraudulent behavior. LinkedIn Co-Founder Raising $20 Million for Token Project\nEric Ly, one of the co-founders of now-Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) owned LinkedIn, is part of a project raising $20 million for a project called Hub Token. Ly was LinkedIn’s first chief technology officer. According to public documents, Ly is part of a group looking to raise $20 million in a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) sale for Hub Token, an asset tied to a forthcoming platform called ICOHub. ICOHub was created earlier this year as a platform for reputable token sales with the goal of eradicating fraudulent ICOs. As of the most recent Form D filing, Ly’s venture had raised about $13.6 million from 20 investors. The token was created as an incentive for building trust among ICOHub network participants. Google Searches for Bitcoin Plummet\nGoogle Trends show that searches for the term “bitcoin” have dropped more than 75% since the beginning of 2018, CNBC reported.

The cryptocurrency had been allegedly earned through the provision of illicit pornographic content. A Case Stretched in Time\nA legal case took place last year involving 33-year old Ahn, who had been operating an illegal pornography site in South Korea since December 2013. He was arrested in May 2017. The prosecution found that the individual had accumulated a total of 216 bitcoins at the time of his arrest.\nUnder the premise that Ahn had acquired Bitcoin through criminal activity, the prosecution demanded that the convict’s cryptocurrency should immediately be confiscated.\nYet, applying the laws by the letter, Suwon’s District Court ruled that:\nIt is not appropriate to confiscate bitcoins because they are in the form of electronic files without physical entities, unlike cash. […] Virtual currency cannot assume an objective standard value.\nThe decision of the court was appealed, leaving it to the discretion of the country’s Supreme Court. New Development Taking Place\nOn May 30, 2018, South Korea’s Supreme Court banged the gavel and ruled in an entirely different light. The country’s highest magistrates confirmed the appeal, allowing the prosecution to seize 191 of the 216 bitcoins.\nThe court ruled that exactly 191 units of the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had been accumulated through the website distributing illegal online content.\nThe Supreme Court’s merit for the ruling was that:\nThe cryptocurrency is recognized to have value so it can be confiscated.\nGoing further, taking the Penal Code of South Korea into account, the court also stated that:\nThe bitcoins were earned from the proceeds of crime. […] If we return the bitcoins to Ahn, it will be giving him back profits that were earned illegally from running an online porn site. A loss for Ahn, A Victory for Cryptocurrencies\nWhile it’s true that not all of Ahn’s bitcoins fell under the range of the ruling, the Supreme Court’s decision offers some legislative clarity on the matter of cryptocurrencies — for once, it recognized them as a traditional asset class.\nThe Supreme Court in South Korea is second only to the country’s Constitutional Court in terms of legislative capabilities. While its rulings do not constitute laws or even legal directions, the fact that such a high legislative authority recognizes Bitcoin as an asset class surely carries some weight.\nFor what is worth, we’ve seen a lot of movement on that front in the past month. First, the country’s Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) declared that the government is set to review the currently existing regulations. Later on — at the end of May — we saw the country’s National Assembly proposing a permit for domestic Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).\nDo you think South Korea is moving in the right direction towards transparent regulation for cryptocurrencies?

Speaking on the sidelines of Money20/20 Europe, Wozniak told CNBC that he is attracted to the “purity” of the idea that people around the world could one day share a single currency, despite being separated by national borders. He said:\n“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking.” As CCN reported , Dorsey, who is CEO of both social media giant Twitter and digital payment processor Square, said recently that he believes bitcoin will be the world’s only currency — perhaps within a single decade. The “Woz” has long been a fan of bitcoin, a fact that has not changed since he decided to sell off most of his holdings after finding that he spent too much time watching price movements. Hearkening back to comments that he has made in the past, Wozniak said that bitcoin is “pure digital gold” and — unlike many cryptocurrencies — “totally decentralized” since it is not run by a company and does not have a business model. “Bitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed… and it’s pure and there’s no human running, there’s no company running and it’s just… growing and growing… and surviving,” he said. “That to me says something that is natural and nature is more important than all our human conventions.” Notably, Wozniak is also bullish on Ethereum, particularly since it views itself as a platform rather than just a store of value. Last month, he said that he believes the project could become the next Apple in terms of its status in the tech sector.
