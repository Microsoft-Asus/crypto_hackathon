With over 824,000 subscibers now, we should be in the top 100. Reddit metrics isnt using accurate info, not sure how often the figures are updated. They currently state we have 749,237 subscribers putting us in no 112. If we had 824,000 when figures were last updated, we would be in the top 100, in fact we may even be now. I expect us to easily get into the top 100 this year, possibly into the top 50 when the next boom cycle begins.\nInteresting to see that that the no1 sub reddit, /r/announcements , has just over 21 million subscribers, not even a full bitcoin for every subscriber if that was their thing.

Private, cryptographic keys need to exist as ones and zeros on actually computer memory. So what do you do if you’re a newly-minted Bitcoin billionaire? Maybe you store those crucial codes in a Swiss bunker. As reported by Bloomberg , bunkers run by a startup known as Xapo, are filled with computer servers that are entirely disconnected from the internet and any other sort of computer network. The company does not actually store Bitcoin, which exists on the public, distributed ledger known as the blockchain . Rather, the vaults store the private, cryptographic keys used to lay claim to particular Bitcoins. Xapo has vaults on five continents, including ones embedded deep within the Swiss mountains. Last year, Quartz got an inside look at one of them. Xapo’s head of security, Carlos Rienzi, described the situation as being “under attack 24/7. This is not a race. It is a chess game. You have to think about the opponent’s next movement. You can never relax.”\nCiting two clients, Bloomberg estimates that Xapo keeps the keys to around $10 billion worth of Bitcoin in its various vaults, subject to Bitcoin’s rapidly changing values. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general have proven to be pretty disruptive technologies in a very literal sense. The electricity-heavy mining process has gotten kicked out of small towns , sent Russian nuclear scientists to jail , and pissed off UFO hunters .

More than 1,500 other cryptocurrencies have come into existence since bitcoin’s inception in 2009, each one trying to overcome one or more of bitcoin’s flaws.\nIncreasing interest in bitcoin over the last year has been reflected across the cryptocurrency markets, with ethereum and bitcoin cash making significant gains on bitcoin.\nIn the past 12 months, the price of one bitcoin has risen from around $1,700 to $9,360 - an increase of 450 per cent. In the same timeframe, ethereum has seen gains of almost 1,000 per cent to reach its current value of $764, while bitcoin cash has surged from around $500 in August last year to today’s price of $1,655.\nThe price of ethereum may still be a long way off bitcoin, however there are five-times more in circulation - meaning ethereum’s market cap is just under half that of bitcoin’s.\nOther cryptocurrency experts contend that bitcoin is too well established to lose its position as the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency.\nMichael Jackson, the former COO of Skype who now works for the investment firm Mangrove Capital Partners, believed the issues that blight bitcoin can be overcome, therefore negating the benefits of alternative cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash.\n“There is so much talent in the crypto space, and people are working on solving these scalability problems,” Mr Jackson said.\n“I don’t see why bitcoin shouldn’t remain in the number one spot. It is still by far the best known and it is ultimately the reserve currency in the space.”\nBitcoin could remain the world’s dominant cryptocurrency, Mr Ver conceded, but he does not believe such a scenario is likely. While its perceived limitations may see its price stagnate, the utility of bitcoin cash could see its price reach “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in the future.\n“It’s not guaranteed but it is much more likely to happen than not,” Mr Ver said. “Bitcoin cash has more than doubled in value in the last month and big investors coming in soon could see it double again by next week.

After the meteoric rise of the Bitcoin, almost everyone wants to gain from the trend that could give returns unseen in many of the traditional markets. So, before you dive into the cryptocurrency mining , it is advisable and also wise to choose from the best graphic cards currently available.\nIn the world of cryptocurrency mining, the graphics card is the most important component when it comes to performance. Ethereum and many other popular cryptocurrencies work on memory hard-hashing techniques, which require a lot of graphics memory. The importance of the graphics card is quite evident from the fact that last year over 3 million add-in board (AIB) graphics cards worth around $776 million were purchased by the miners, according to a report by Jon Peddie Research (JPR).\nThe massive demand for these cards – as a result of a surge in cryptocurrency mining – even created a shortage of these products along with inflating their prices . Though gaming is still the primary driver for graphics card sales, cryptocurrency has played a part as well.\nChoosing the best graphics card is not an easy task as each offers one or the other advantage over others. However, there are a few factors that must be considered to select the best graphics card – memory, power consumption and cost. We have used the same factors to come up with a list of the best graphics cards that could help you maximize profits.\nAMD RADEON RX 580 is the first in our list. It is a preferred choice of the cryptocurrency miners due to its remarkable performance and pricing. Though its price is inflated now due to high-demand, it still offers value for money. It gives a lucrative hash rate of 29 mh/s along with keeping the electricity consumption low.\nNext in our list of the best graphics card is the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070, which is ideal for both – gamers and cryptocurrency miners. The card offers a hash rate of around 30 mh/s, and that too with low power consumption. Power consumption (as we noted above) plays a major role in maximizing your profits, the more power a GPU takes, the more expensive it is to run. Though its price may be a bit discouraging, its overall performance surely compensates for it. Also, Nvidia recently announced that its GTX products are now back to their original price. The high demand earlier pushed their prices up.\nAMD RADEON RX 570 is the next as it offers similar performance as the RX 580, but at a lower cost. It is $60 cheaper than the Radeon RX 580, but offers 90% of the 580’s Ethereum hash rate. It has 4GB onboard GDDR5, and can also be fine-tuned for greater efficiency.\nNvidia GeForce GTX 1060 is also a deserving contender. Though it is not the most powerful GPU around, it produces desired results without costing you too much. It’s not as fast as AMD’s best products, but it is efficient. Due to its low power, it gives out less heat and noise. A user can also easily tune the performance for higher hash rates. Further, it is pretty good for gaming, so miners can use it there as well.\nNext is AMD Radeon RX Vega 56, which is the best value-packed graphics card currently available. Based on the benchmarks, it is faster than the Nvidia GTX 1070. Also, it is cheaper to boot. However, its power consumption makes it a bit expensive to run. But, if you want to put the highest possible hash rates into a single chassis, and have the needed power supply, this is the one to go for. Further, these GPUs adjust well to the undervolting and overclocked memory, but require substantial cooling.\nApart from the five mentioned above, miners might also consider Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti. It is a gaming GPU, but has given excellent mining results as well. However, it is a bit expensive and takes up relatively more power, thus lowering the return on your investment. But, if you have the cash to spend, you won’t regret buying it. Similarly, the GTX 1070 Ti is also good for cryptocurrency mining, but it suffers from the same issues as the 1080 Ti, i.e., it is relatively expensive and consumes more power.\nThese are the best graphic cards available currently, but you would need to check if they are in stock or not. We know for sure that Nvidia’s GeForce cards are back in stock. The company only yesterday tweeted, “GeForce GTX 10-Series GPUs are back on shelves at MSRP!” However, AMD GPUs are still difficult to get online.

Thailand’s Stock Exchange Launched Platform with Blockchain Tech to Boost Economy\nStock Exchange of Thailand (SET), the national stock exchange of Thailand that had 688 listed companies at the end of 2017, launched a crowdfunding marketplace which is made on blockchain technology in order to broaden the access to capital funds of new domestic companies.\nThe platform called LiVE has been formed with the use of blockchain technology as an infrastructure for participating ventures to grow and get connected with future unions. However, in order for businesses to qualify in joining LiVE, their founders and executives should carry no criminal records with financial statement audit done by certified auditors and the companies should be fully registered to operate in Thailand. A Russian Court Has Recognized Blockchain-Based Bitcoin as Valuable Property\nA Moscow court has set a precedent, obliging a debtor Ilya Tsarkov to give the financial manager an access to his cryptocurrency wallet in order to restore the bankruptcy estate, the local news outlet edomosti reported. Thus, the court indirectly recognized the digital currency as property and recognized its value.\nAccording to the court decision on May 7, 2018, financial manager Aleksey Leonov will receive a password from the e-currency wallet belonging to Ilya Tsarkov, who previously was recognized a bankrupt. It is worth mentioning, that on February 26, the demand to transfer the virtual coins to Leonov was rejected by the Moscow-based court.

Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is Confirmation Bias Fueling Investors’ Dreams of $10K? bitcoin , bitcoinist , crypto , news #bitcoin # invest #money\nWe live in a world where people only validate what they personally believe to be true irrespective of the facts. Therefore, it’s fair to ask whether Bitcoin’s repeated failure to surpass the 200-day moving average is indicative of underlying weakness, or is confirmation bias fueling investors’ dreams of Bitcoin price above $10,000? Market Overview\nThe third time has not been the charm for bitcoin as it bounced off the 200-day MA after an exciting run up to $9,990. While a pullback from the $10,000 resistance was expected, the drop below $9,000 was a bit harsher than expected.\nA quick glance at the top 10 cryptocurrencies shows a handful recovering from 10 to 15% drops and BTC has recovered some ground to sit slightly above the $9,200 support. While the pullback from $9,990 is indicative of bullish exhaustion, general market sentiment remains positive as the cryptocurrency market capitalization steadily creeps towards $500 billion.\nMost investors appear unconcerned within the current correction and the majority of FUD seems to be wafting from a trio of cantankerous fuddy duddies who compare bitcoin trading with cow pats, casinos, rat poison , and ‘ harvested baby brains ’.\nAll FUD aside, encouraging developments that are likely to accelerate BTC momentum are occurring. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) recently announced that it intends to offer BTC swap contracts that will be settled in BTC rather than fiat.\nGoldman Sachs confirmed plans to open a cryptocurrency trading desk within weeks and Mike Novogratz has decided to have another go at opening a crypto trading index. Next week New York will host the world’s largest cryptocurrency conference (Consensus) and Fundstrat research analyst Tom Lee predicts BTC is in for a ‘massive ’ rally due to the excitement surrounding this momentous event. Highlights\nBTC was predominately bullish for most of last week as the cryptocurrency passed through multiple resistance levels only to run out of steam at $9,990. April’s rally brought back memories of the late 2017 cryptocurrency euphoria but hopes have been continuously dashed each time BTC failed to cross the 200-Day MA. The on May 9th Bitcoin price sunk to a weekly low below $9,000 as bears broke the support at $9,200 and continued their work on the $9,000 support.\nAs seen on the daily chart, BTC toppled out of the ascending trend line and set lower lows and lower highs, indicating short term weakness as the bears attempt to take charge. Daily Chart\nSince yesterday BTC has been working to recover lost ground, retaking the $9,200 support but struggling to reach $9,400. Various iterations of the simple moving averages highlight the dissolution of bullish bias and at the time of writing the RSI is turning down from 50 and the MACD is currently below bearish territory.\nThe 5 and 10-day MA have reversed course and appear to be closing the distance between each other but a turnaround won’t begin until BTC trades above the 50 MA. 4HR Chart\nBTC still needs to cross the 50 MA at $9,450 and previously, movement past $9,500 provided a path towards $9,700 and eventually $10,000. Gains above $9,780 would place BTC back into the ascending channel and a close above the 50 SMA ($9,450) would signal that the downtrend has finished.\nIf BTC is unable to recover, there is strong support at $8800 and $8350. It’s possible that BTC could trade in this range before the rally to $10,500 – $11,200 continues. Next Test for Bitcoin Price\nMomentum should improve when $9,500 is passed but the 200-day MA remains a major resistance. The next tests for BTC should be at $10,500, $11,250 and $11,750 levels of resistance.\nIf the downtrend continues and BTC closes below $9,000, a drop to $8,800 and below could take place. Bearing this in mind, aggressive traders should take caution and initiate 50% positions whereas longs could add to their positions.\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in this article are not intended as investment advice.

The Martkapitalisierung of the space deer is located at 146 billion euros and that of the entire crypto market has again exceeded the EUR 400 billion mark.\nAn unknown Investor with the Bitcoin address “3Cbq7aT1tY8kMxWLbitaG7yT6bPbKChq64” has doubled in just a few days ago his bitcoin use almost 56.357 (09.02.2018) today 96.651 Bitcoins.\nWithin the bitcoin market, the largest part of the capital is distributed to only a few large whales are the “big whales”. One of them seems to be the owner of the shown address.\nIn many Online forums and the Social Media world is discussed and puzzled over who could be this Investor. Jeff Koyen, President of 360 Blockchain USA, said in an Interview:\nIn the meantime, the $400 million whale is fuel for the Telegram channels where traders lay out their conspiracy theories.\nHowever, I am willing to believe that, seeing bitcoin bottom around $6,000, Wall Street smelled blood and jumped back in.\nWhether this theory is actually the truth, it can be speculated at this point. The Bitcoin owner of the above address is ascended at the current rate for the billionaire. Altcoins are growing strongly\nClear winner the cryptocurrency Verge, which has risen within the last 24 hours by more than 33 percent, and within the last 7 days by 34 percent in the course.

From July 1, 2019, any business transaction over $10,000 has to be done using electronic payments. Handing over a hundred $100 notes or more will be illegal, as the government tries to flush out tax avoiders, drug dealers and the rest of the underground economy.\nBitcoiners and other cryptocurrency fans predicted this, and the government is playing into their greedy little hands.\nGRINDING ON UP\nBitcoin surged to $US20,000 last year and then quickly plunged back down to about $6700. Many thought it would continue back down close to zero. Instead, it has rebounded about 40 per cent in the past month to more than $9000, as this next graph shows.\nThe volatile Bitcoin has rebounded in the past month.\nThe recommendation of a ban on cash comes from the government's Black Economy Task Force. The head of the task force, Michael Andrew, described the reasons people use cash in a recent podcast, giving as an example a shopkeeper who runs two tills, keeping some money out of sight of the taxman.\n\"It's basically paying people cash who want to maintain their welfare, their visa status or avoid their child maintenance,\" Mr Andrew said. \"That is widespread in certain areas particularly … the services-based economy, security industry, hospitality, cleaning, couriers, personal trainers, hairdressing and nail salons for example.\"\nGovernments around the world are interested in cracking down on cash, and not just to get those dodgy nail salons paying tax, but also to kill off terrorist financing, to reduce money laundering, and even to let them reduce interest rates below zero. (If you make interest rates negative, people will just take cash out of the bank, but if you also make cash illegal, that's not possible.)\nANARCHY IN THE BLOCKCHAIN\nAll these anti-cash trends are giving life to Bitcoin, and other digital currencies that could serve as an alternative to cash. For some people, that's the whole point of cryptocurrencies. A big part of the early adopters of Bitcoin were people who are deeply worried about government. Many early Bitcoin adopters were libertarians and anarchists who feared an Orwellian world where government constantly monitored and controlled you.\nWhen Mr Morrison bans cash, those libertarians and anarchists get their \"I told you so!\" moment. But these days, as Bitcoin aims for mainstream acceptance, the industry is keen to distance itself from those people.\n2 LEGIT 2 BIT\n\"It is not about encouraging a black market economy,\" says Caleb Yeoh, the co-founder of Travel by Bit, which has made buying things with cryptocurrencies possible at about 150 Australian businesses, including mainstream outlets such as Red Rooster.\n\"We signed up over 150 businesses across Australia. Each one of them gets a tax reporting functionality on our platform, so they declare taxes even thought they take payment in Bitcoin.\"\nYeoh, whose business is part-funded by government grants, points out that Bitcoin maintains a record of every transaction in its Blockchain.\n\"People often have this impression that if you take payments in Bitcoin you're creating a cash economy, under the table, can't be monitored by government. That's not true at all. It is transparent on the Blockchain. If you are doing something bad with Bitcoin you should be able to be caught.\"\nWhile this is true of Bitcoin, it is not the case with every other cryptocurrency, some of which are designed to be anonymous.\nSo the big risk is not when businesses agree to take Bitcoin, like this labour hire firm has. (\"You could be forgiven for thinking that accepting Bitcoin payments is a publicity stunt,\" the firm's website says, insisting it will actually be efficient. However, you can check its Bitcoin address on the Blockchain and see that no customers have paid bitcoin to that address yet).\nThe big risk is when the guy who is installing your new kitchen asks if he can be paid in anonymous cryptocurrencies like Monero or Dash. That's when the government's cash ban could really backfire.

May 10, 2018 118\nWe live in a world where people only validate what they personally believe to be true irrespective of the facts. Therefore, it’s fair to ask whether Bitcoin’s repeated failure to surpass the 200-day moving average is indicative of underlying weakness, or is confirmation bias fueling investors’ dreams of Bitcoin price above $10,000? Market Overview\nThe third time has not been the charm for bitcoin as it bounced off the 200-day MA after an exciting run up to $9,990. While a pullback from the $10,000 resistance was expected, the drop below $9,000 was a bit harsher than expected.\nA quick glance at the top 10 cryptocurrencies shows a handful recovering from 10 to 15% drops and BTC has recovered some ground to sit slightly above the $9,200 support. While the pullback from $9,990 is indicative of bullish exhaustion, general market sentiment remains positive as the cryptocurrency market capitalization steadily creeps towards $500 billion.\nMost investors appear unconcerned within the current correction and the majority of FUD seems to be wafting from a trio of cantankerous fuddy duddies who compare bitcoin trading with cow pats, casinos, rat poison , and ‘ harvested baby brains ’.\nAll FUD aside, encouraging developments that are likely to accelerate BTC momentum are occurring. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) recently announced that it intends to offer BTC swap contracts that will be settled in BTC rather than fiat.\nGoldman Sachs confirmed plans to open a cryptocurrency trading desk within weeks and Mike Novogratz has decided to have another go at opening a crypto trading index. Next week New York will host the world’s largest cryptocurrency conference (Consensus) and Fundstrat research analyst Tom Lee predicts BTC is in for a ‘massive ’ rally due to the excitement surrounding this momentous event. Highlights\nBTC was predominately bullish for most of last week as the cryptocurrency passed through multiple resistance levels only to run out of steam at $9,990. April’s rally brought back memories of the late 2017 cryptocurrency euphoria but hopes have been continuously dashed each time BTC failed to cross the 200-Day MA. The on May 9th Bitcoin price sunk to a weekly low below $9,000 as bears broke the support at $9,200 and continued their work on the $9,000 support.\nAs seen on the daily chart, BTC toppled out of the ascending trend line and set lower lows and lower highs, indicating short term weakness as the bears attempt to take charge. Daily Chart\nSince yesterday BTC has been working to recover lost ground, retaking the $9,200 support but struggling to reach $9,400. Various iterations of the simple moving averages highlight the dissolution of bullish bias and at the time of writing the RSI is turning down from 50 and the MACD is currently below bearish territory.\nThe 5 and 10-day MA have reversed course and appear to be closing the distance between each other but a turnaround won’t begin until BTC trades above the 50 MA. 4HR Chart\nBTC still needs to cross the 50 MA at $9,450 and previously, movement past $9,500 provided a path towards $9,700 and eventually $10,000. Gains above $9,780 would place BTC back into the ascending channel and a close above the 50 SMA ($9,450) would signal that the downtrend has finished.\nIf BTC is unable to recover, there is strong support at $8800 and $8350. It’s possible that BTC could trade in this range before the rally to $10,500 – $11,200 continues. Next Test for Bitcoin Price\nMomentum should improve when $9,500 is passed but the 200-day MA remains a major resistance. The next tests for BTC should be at $10,500, $11,250 and $11,750 levels of resistance.\nIf the downtrend continues and BTC closes below $9,000, a drop to $8,800 and below could take place. Bearing this in mind, aggressive traders should take caution and initiate 50% positions whereas longs could add to their positions.\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in this article are not intended as investment advice.

Meanwhile, a strong support is seen at $9,228 (marked by a circle).\nThe momentum studies are biased bearish.

It also indicates the pullback from the recent high of $9,990 has not run its course.\nView A break below $9,228 (support on the hourly chart) would add credence to the bearish 5-day MA and 10-day MA crossover and open the doors for a drop to $8,980 and $8,868 (100-day moving average). A daily close (as per UTC) below $8,652 (April 26 low) would confirm a bearish reversal.

May 10, 2018\nUntil not long ago, ensuring first-rate traffic was one of the biggest issues in the crypto universe, as lots of crypto businesses struggled to meet demands in order to survive. Clearly, a new, innovative advertising solution had to be developed.\nIn November 2016, the world has seen the birth of Coinzilla – a smart digital advertising platform that delivers compelling monetization solutions for crypto services. Coinzilla has seen rapid and impressive growth over what is relatively a short timeframe, and it is currently one of the top three crypto advertising networks on the market.\nWhen asked about how he came up with the idea behind Coinzilla, the platform’s CEO, Tiberiu Stingaciu, mentioned that his colleagues had a very important role to play in his decision. It was them who suggested the involvement in this ever-growing and fascinating world of cryptocurrency. They also hinted at the excellent opportunity of developing one of the first crypto advertising agencies , especially one that promoted transparency and seriousness.\nAfter reaching out to publishers and website owners involved in the crypto world, Coinzilla became the successful platform it is today, making it the de-facto service for users interested in promoting crypto-related content (coins, ICOs, and other crypto services). Currently, the platform delivers more than 350 million ads per month.\nAbove all else, Coinzilla is mostly known for its effective adverts in the form of floating IAB banners and press release system. One of the main missions of Coinzilla’s design department is the creation of banners that offer high visibility and excellent engagement rates alike. Coinzilla banners can be seen on some of the most well-known crypto portals, such as coinmarketcap.com, coindesk.com, 99bitcoins.com, walletinvestor.com, coingecko.com, coincodex.com, and other big names.\nThe platform is created to cater for the needs of most users, including novices. Creating an account is hardly challenging, since you’re only required to click the “START ADVERTISING” button from the upper right part of the main web interface and to fill out the required form.\nAfterwards, you will receive a confirmation email which also contains extra information regarding your newly created account. Coinzilla accepts payments in BTC, ETH, and EUR, with a minimum amount of 0.05 BTC. The recommended budget for a large campaign is between 1000 and 2000 EUR per day. Coinzilla users, and advertisers interested in long-term partnerships in principle, are provided with a wide array of special packages that involve bonuses and rewards.\nOnce the account has been created and confirmed, you can start your advertising campaign by logging in and by clicking the “New Ad Campaign” button. One very important thing to note here is ensuring that your campaign is set up according to your objective. For example, if you want to target potential investors specifically, then you should select the Premium plan that offers a useful S.M.A.R.T. system which helps target that specific category of users. Alternatively, you can go with a brand awareness campaign designed to heavily boost your business’ exposure.\nYou are provided with multiple types of ads and banners, with a wide assortment of features. Almost all Coinzilla banners feature the same number of user interactions.\nThe list of supported formats for the banners includes PNG, JPEG, GIF, and HTML. Any type of animation can be used, just as long as the banner doesn’t hinder the user’s navigation on the page, and the maximum size does not exceed the 500 KB mark.\nThe Coinzilla design team is at your service, ready to create banners specially tailored for you and your crypto business. If you are interested in this service, please feel free to contact the account manager. Advertisers who deposit a minimum of 10.000 EUR for their campaigns benefit from free banners.\nOne very essential tool in the online advertising field is the A-B testing. This practice helps you create multiple useful campaigns without spending too much money. It’s also very useful at helping you determine which type of campaign is better suited for your business. It does require an initial investment; however, this method helps you save a lot of money in the long run.\nAnother noteworthy feature is the geo-targeting. As its name suggests, it allows you to choose the exact country from where to receive traffic. To activate this feature, you need to contact your account manager and provide all the necessary campaign information. Geo-targeting is especially useful in countries with rigorous regulations concerning crypto adverts and businesses.\nThe account manager can also help you if you want to block off traffic from various types of devices.\nThe first thing to do before starting your campaign is to set up the desired CPM price. In order to ensure the best results, Coinzilla advises that you use the recommended prices. If you go for the lowest possible price, you will most likely receive a low conversion rate, with a modest number of clicks and impressions. Doing the opposite, opting to pay a higher price, will result in a higher amount of traffic, and in an improved conversion rate. The best alternative is to choose the “recommended price” option for a typical campaign, and the “optimal price” if you want to ensure a higher conversion, but without overspending.\nAfter all the aspects of your campaign have been defined, you can send it to Coinzilla for reviewing. If more details are required, you will be contacted by your account manager. If not, then the campaign will simply start and you will begin receiving high-quality traffic for your crypto projects.

From July 1, 2019, any business transaction over $10,000 has to be done using electronic payments. Handing over a hundred $100 notes or more will be illegal, as the government tries to flush out tax avoiders, drug dealers and the rest of the underground economy.\nBitcoiners and other cryptocurrency fans predicted this, and the government is playing into their greedy little hands.\nGRINDING ON UP\nBitcoin surged to $US20,000 last year and then quickly plunged back down to about $6700. Many thought it would continue back down close to zero. Instead, it has rebounded about 40 per cent in the past month to more than $9000, as this next graph shows.\nThe volatile Bitcoin has rebounded in the past month.\nThe recommendation of a ban on cash comes from the government's Black Economy Task Force. The head of the task force, Michael Andrew, described the reasons people use cash in a recent podcast, giving as an example a shopkeeper who runs two tills, keeping some money out of sight of the taxman.\n\"It's basically paying people cash who want to maintain their welfare, their visa status or avoid their child maintenance,\" Mr Andrew said. \"That is widespread in certain areas particularly … the services-based economy, security industry, hospitality, cleaning, couriers, personal trainers, hairdressing and nail salons for example.\"\nGovernments around the world are interested in cracking down on cash, and not just to get those dodgy nail salons paying tax, but also to kill off terrorist financing, to reduce money laundering, and even to let them reduce interest rates below zero. (If you make interest rates negative, people will just take cash out of the bank, but if you also make cash illegal, that's not possible.)\nANARCHY IN THE BLOCKCHAIN\nAll these anti-cash trends are giving life to Bitcoin, and other digital currencies that could serve as an alternative to cash. For some people, that's the whole point of cryptocurrencies. A big part of the early adopters of Bitcoin were people who are deeply worried about government. Many early Bitcoin adopters were libertarians and anarchists who feared an Orwellian world where government constantly monitored and controlled you.\nWhen Mr Morrison bans cash, those libertarians and anarchists get their \"I told you so!\" moment. But these days, as Bitcoin aims for mainstream acceptance, the industry is keen to distance itself from those people.\n2 LEGIT 2 BIT\n\"It is not about encouraging a black market economy,\" says Caleb Yeoh, the co-founder of Travel by Bit, which has made buying things with cryptocurrencies possible at about 150 Australian businesses, including mainstream outlets such as Red Rooster.\n\"We signed up over 150 businesses across Australia. Each one of them gets a tax reporting functionality on our platform, so they declare taxes even thought they take payment in Bitcoin.\"\nYeoh, whose business is part-funded by government grants, points out that Bitcoin maintains a record of every transaction in its Blockchain.\n\"People often have this impression that if you take payments in Bitcoin you're creating a cash economy, under the table, can't be monitored by government. That's not true at all. It is transparent on the Blockchain. If you are doing something bad with Bitcoin you should be able to be caught.\"\nWhile this is true of Bitcoin, it is not the case with every other cryptocurrency, some of which are designed to be anonymous.\nSo the big risk is not when businesses agree to take Bitcoin, like this labour hire firm has. (\"You could be forgiven for thinking that accepting Bitcoin payments is a publicity stunt,\" the firm's website says, insisting it will actually be efficient. However, you can check its Bitcoin address on the Blockchain and see that no customers have paid bitcoin to that address yet).\nThe big risk is when the guy who is installing your new kitchen asks if he can be paid in anonymous cryptocurrencies like Monero or Dash. That's when the government's cash ban could really backfire.

Bank of America (BoA) doubled down on its decision to stop customers buying Bitcoin with its credit cards May 10. The bank’s official called cryptocurrency “troubling,” according to CNBC.\nSpeaking to CNBC in an edition of the network’s Squawk Box segment, BoA’s CTO Kathy Bessant said that cryptocurrencies are “designed to be not transparent” and thus hinder banks’ attempts to catch “bad guys.”\n“As a payment system, I think it's troubling, because the foundation of the banking system is on the transparency between the sender and the receiver, and cryptocurrency is designed to be nothing of the sort, in fact [it's] designed to be not transparent,” she told the program.\nBoA caused friction with its cardholders when it instigated the Bitcoin purchasing ban in February.\nThe move saw JPMorgan and Citigroup follow suit, the former nonetheless subsequently finding itself at the center of a consumer lawsuit in April over “fraudulent” purchase fees.\nFor Bessant, however, cryptocurrencies still represent the opposite of financial transparency.\n“The way we sort of quote-unquote catch bad guys is by being transparent in the financial moment of money. Cryptos is the antithesis of that,” she added.\n“Just like we don't allow stocks to be purchased on our credit cards, we're not going to allow cryptos or other currencies to be purchased on our credit cards.”\nWeeks after the initial ban, BoA produced a report conversely identifying future risks to its business, in which it highlighted its “inability to adapt” to the competition cryptocurrency poses. ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : cointelegraph.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin",

However, Canaan did not make any official announcement yet.\nMoreover, the anonymous sources told the Chinese daily that the firm is aiming to raise as much as $1 billion with the IPO. Profits on rise\nCanaan Creative was established in 2013 amid the hype of Bitcoin mining . It designs and manufactures high-performance ASIC-based miners for Bitcoin mining and is well know for the Avalon series of bitcoin mining machines. Earlier in January, the firm released its income report where it showed a profit of $64 million (410 million yuan) for 2017 alone – an appreciation of 600 percent from the previous year – however, the report was unaudited. Failed attempts\nThe Hangzhou-based firm had earlier tried to list itself in multiple exchanges in China, however, all its attempts failed. In 2016, it tried to gain a listing in China’s yuan-denominated A-share market by buying Shandong-based electric equipment maker Luyitong. However, the plan went awry as the regulators raised questions on the valuation of the deal.\nThat followed Canaan’s attempt for listing in China’s “New Third Board” market, which primarily caters to startups with its less stringent listing requirements. That also failed, but the company did not reveal the reasons publically. Hazy future?\nDespite the profits of the firm, experts are concerned about the future of the firm as most of its clients are based in China . Earlier this year, many reports showed that the Chinese government is trying to systematically curb the booming crypto mining industry in the country citing no addition from them to its real economy. If the government, like last year, take any stance step, the business of Canaan will definitely fall drastically.\nFinancemagnates.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not

foundation of the banking system is on the transparency between the sender and the receiver, and cryptocurrency is designed to be nothing of the sort.

The space has been highly volatile , with bitcoin in particular soaring to nearly $20,000 in 2017 before falling drastically. On Thursday morning, it was at $9,340.\nOne thing they can't do, though, is use a Bank of America credit cards to speculate in the crypto world.\n\"Just like we don't allow stocks to be purchased on our credit cards, we're not going to allow cryptos or other currencies to be purchased on our credit cards,\" Bessant said.\nBroadly speaking, Bessant said bank security is improving.\n\"I do actually think we're in a better position every day,\" she said. \"Awareness is higher, the sophistication of our defense and detection efforts are growing every day.

Japan’s GMO Has Mined Over 900 Bitcoins – Hashrate Doubled Last Month 10 May 2018 8536\nThe mining operation of Japan’s internet giant GMO has resulted in over 900 bitcoins and 537 bitcoin cash so far, as the company roughly doubled its hashrate last month. Meanwhile, its crypto exchange reported a first-quarter loss after the country’s financial regulator ordered it to improve.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Over 900 BTC Mined So Far\nJapanese conglomerate GMO Internet released its cryptocurrency mining business report for April this week.\n“We are currently mining bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH),” GMO wrote. The company mined 373 BTC and 0 BCH in April. In March, it mined 295 BTC and 12 BCH and in February 124 BTC and 287 BCH. Overall, GMO has mined 906 BTC and 537 BCH so far since it began operation.\nThe group revealed that its “Hash rate rose due to the increase in the number of computers we are operating as planned.” In April, the hashrate was 241 PH/s, up from 129 PH/s in March, 108 PH/s in February, and 27 PH/s in January. The announcement details:\nHash rate is an important indicator for estimating our mining share. Our goal is to see the hashrate reach 3,000PH/s this year.\nThe company announced the launch of its mining business in September last year. In October, it outlined plans to launch an initial coin offering (ICO) for the sale of its “next-generation mining boards.” In January, GMO announced that it had succeeded in developing a 12nm ASIC mining chip. GMO Coin’s Earnings Performance\nGMO Coin is the cryptocurrency exchange subsidiary of GMO Internet. It is one of the 16 fully licensed crypto exchanges in Japan. The company has launched a service to allow customers to lend their bitcoins to the company as well as set up a bitcoin salary payment system to pay its employees in the digital currency.\nHowever, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) has issued the exchange a business improvement order. The only other government-approved exchange to have received such an order is Tech Bureau which operates Zaif exchange.\nGMO Financial Holdings recently released GMO Coin’s earnings report which shows an operating loss of 760 million yen (~US$7 million) in the first quarter of this year. The cost of operating the crypto business rose by about 560 million yen (~$5.1 million) for the group from the previous quarter.\nWhat do you think of GMO’s mining operations and exchange?

Pierce, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Hester Pierce , U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\nHester M. Pierce is a Commissioner at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. her recent remarks before the Medici Conference, available here . The views expressed in this post are those of Ms. Pierce and do not necessarily reflect those of the Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff.\nThank you, Vince [Molinari], for that kind introduction. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today. I must start with the standard disclaimer that my comments today reflect my own opinions and not necessarily those of the Commission or my fellow Commissioners.\nBack in Washington, DC, there has been a lot of talk about regulatory sandboxes. A number of forward-looking regulators, both here and abroad, have created regulatory sandboxes. In the United Kingdom, for example, the Financial Conduct Authority operates a regulatory sandbox that “allows businesses to test innovative products, services, business models and delivery mechanisms in the real market, with real consumers.” [1] Abu Dhabi’s RegLab was launched in late 2016 to allow an innovator “to develop and test its FinTech proposition in a safe environment while not putting undue regulatory burden on the participant.” [2] The Monetary Authority of Singapore similarly is using a sandbox to “encourage[e] more FinTech experimentation so that promising innovations can be tested in the market and have a chance for wider adoption, in Singapore and abroad.” [3] Under Chairman Chris Giancarlo, our sister agency—the Commodity Futures Trading Commission—has launched Lab CFTC, which “is designed to be the hub for the agency’s engagement with the FinTech innovation community.” [4] And moving a bit closer to this coast, Arizona recently launched the first state-level regulatory sandbox for fintech with the objective of allowing people “to test innovative products, services, business models, and delivery mechanisms in the real market without incurring the regulatory costs and burdens that would otherwise be imposed.” [5]\nThe motivating notion behind a regulatory sandbox is that the regulator in a sense sits in the sandbox with the innovator. [6] Not only is she right there to make sure that nobody gets hurt, but she has a front-row seat on the innovative process. She sits at the entrepreneur’s shoulder as he thinks through how to address structural and aesthetic weaknesses in his sandcastle.\nTalk of sandboxes is welcome, and my fellow regulators’ sandboxes have already yielded great dividends. Given that we are in Los Angeles, however, I would rather talk about beaches. [7] On a beach, the lifeguard watches over what is happening, but she is not sitting with sandcastle builders monitoring their every design decision. From her perch on the lifeguard stand, she can spot dangerous activity and intervene with a blow of the whistle or, if necessary, a direct intervention. She always stands ready to answer questions about the rules of the beach. She puts up the red flag to warn of dangerous riptides or sharks.\nIn the world of securities regulation, what does a beach look like? The regulator monitors the landscape, steps in to stop violations when they occur, and stands ready to answer interpretive questions as people seek to understand how the rules apply to their situation. Engagement with the regulator is welcomed, but the regulator leaves ample room for innovators to develop their ideas without the regulators sitting at their shoulder taking part in each creative decision.\nInnovation is always a challenge for regulators. We are used to the way things have been done. Our rules have grown up in response to past technologies. Figuring out whether and how they apply to new ideas is difficult. Technology’s promise is too great, however, for us to bury our heads in the sand. I am here today to ask you and others to help us learn more about the technology so that we are able to think about the regulatory obstacles that may stand in the way of crypto-technology’s ability to improve our lives. How can I, in a sense, be a better lifeguard?\nI have much to learn, but I am an eager student.\nI have to be a diligent student because understanding some of the concepts in this area requires me to re-think things I thought I understood. I used to think, for example, that I knew what a token was. It was a coin—metal, that clinked when you had a few in your hand. You used it to ride the subway. Or kids used tokens for rides at Chuck E. Cheese, or to play Space Invaders at the arcade. We know what those tokens are. They look like money, and to a kid at Chuck E. Cheese certainly feel a lot like money, but they aren’t actually money.\nOr are they? They can be exchanged for a ride or a game. They’re a means of storing value, a marker representing a certain amount of purchasing power that are almost worthless in themselves, but have value within the system that issued them, as long as others honor them. In form, no, they aren’t “money.” But in function, they have very clear money-like characteristics.\nIn everyday speech, money has a particular meaning that we all understand even if it takes several forms. In the US, by “money” we typically mean Federal Reserve notes issued in dollar denominations. A dollar bill. A twenty. But even that very quotidian concept isn’t so simple. Because when we say “money” we can also mean dollar-denominated, short term, revolving loans accessible through a credit card transaction. “Money” means, yes, those crumpled bills some of us still carry. But it also means any number of ways of storing and redeeming value. [8] It’s money not because of its form, but because of its function.\nThe idea that a thing can have many forms but still represent the same function, and therefore be subject to the same regulation, is just the beginning. The inverse is also true in the financial world. A thing might seemingly have one form but in fact support many functions, each requiring a different regulatory regime. A mortgage can be a loan, but also an income stream to be used to fund a collateralized debt obligation. Gold is an asset, but gold futures are derivatives. Creating and deploying new ways of holding and trading assets and their attendant risks is the creative heart of the financial world. Given our federal system’s considerable array of financial regulators, defining the function of a product or transaction is always essential to determining its proper regulatory regime.\nSuch an analytical approach—defining an instrument by its function not its form—can be useful when we’re confronted with something that seems entirely new and difficult to categorize. Like, for example, tokens. I’m not here, as you might have guessed, to give a speech about arcade tokens. The tokens we’re all so interested in these days aren’t metal and don’t clink. Instead they are…what, exactly? In metaphysical terms, they are sometimes talked about as if they are the gateway to a future that challenges well-established past norms. In physical terms they’re a set of code. In functional terms, well, it depends. And that’s the challenge.\nThere are, for example, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. These function perhaps like money. Some of their creators and certainly some of their early adopters may have intended them to function that way, even though technological and regulatory barriers can make it tough for cryptocurrencies to serve as currency. [9] They may be currency, commodities, or something else, but it is unlikely that, on their own, they’re actually securities.\nThen there are utility tokens that are designed to function much differently, at least at some point in their lifecycle. These tokens may function as a means of executing a transaction, as a way to get access to a product or service or participate in a community, or in any number of ways that have yet to be dreamed up.\nAnd then there are tokens or coins used in initial coin offerings, or ICOs. These look the most like securities. Their creator sells them as a means of raising funds. In one potential example, the issuer may want to build an environment in which the coins can be used—potentially as a medium of exchange, potentially as a means of executing or tracking exchanges—and sells the coins before the environment is built. The proceeds from the sales of tokens are used to build the system in which they will one day function. A coin that has no functionality at the time of sale will likely be cheaper to buy than one that offers entry into a fully realized environment. After all, which would you pay more for: a token for an arcade that is laid out in broad terms in a white paper, or a token for an arcade where you can play Space Invaders right now? The actual token—its form—would be no different, whether the arcade was built or not, but the functionality certainly would be.\nThat leads us to the burning question: what are these coins, the ones used in ICOs? Are they securities? Are ICOs offerings of securities? To comply with the law, do offerings have to be registered with the SEC or qualify for an exemption? Does the Securities Exchange Act govern trading in the coins after they have been sold by their creator?\nThere is a way of figuring this out. Although ICOs as a concept are extremely young, the old ways of determining whether they qualify as a security still apply. At its heart, the question is a very basic legal one. We still look to the 1946 Supreme Court decision in SEC v. Howey , which defined a security, among other things, as an investment in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits solely through the efforts of another. [10] The assumption underlying this test is that we look to function, not form when determining whether something is a security. In that case, the investment at issue was a set of contracts for an orange grove. Although the Court in 1946 hardly could have foreseen the development of ICOs 70 years later, the facts of Howey show that this is not the first time the SEC has had to grapple with the fundamental question of what, functionally , is a security.\nThis question, while rudimentary, is also extremely important and has ramifications beyond matters of regulatory compliance. The world of tokens and ICOs is still in its infancy. Determining the appropriate regulatory regime also will mean determining the shape these transactions will take as they mature. If the coins offered in ICOs are designated as securities, for example, their development and the development of their offerings will track the contours established by the relevant securities laws and regulations. They will, over time, come to look more and more like securities and securities offerings. Innovations that might otherwise have occurred that don’t fit within that “security” framework may never come to fruition.\nWhile it’s tempting to envision what might come to pass if these concepts were free to develop in whatever way the market dictated, without being pinned down with a label such as “security” or, as “commodity,” “currency,” “asset,” “forward contract,” there comes a point where regulatory uncertainty is a greater roadblock than confinement within a particular regulatory regime. [11]\nAnd there are aspects of certain tokens and ICOs that seem to fit well inside the “security” definition. To the extent that an ICO involves the sale of tokens to investors seeking to realize a profit from the increased value of their coins once the environment is created, it starts to look like a securities offering. At least some ICOs, or aspects of some ICOs, would seem to fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction.\nThis is not to say that all ICOs must be deemed securities offerings. Given the undeveloped nature of this area, I am wary of any blanket designation for all ICOs. Instead, the best path forward, at least for the time being, is to evaluate the facts and circumstances of each offering.\nDesignating certain ICOs securities offerings does not end the inquiry once and for all. What, for example, are the coins once the environment is completed? Are they still securities, subject to all the regulations that follow securities into the secondary market? Or are they something else? A commodity? A currency? Something in the nature of a Chuck E. Cheese token? When do they change into something new? When the environment is minimally functional? What if its developers make substantial upgrades to its functionality such that the value of the coins increases with the increased access to the new functionality? These are tough questions that still need answers. They are questions that turn on facts and circumstances, but we should strive to provide some guidance.\nFor those ICOs and tokens that do come under the SEC’s jurisdiction, it will fall to us to devise an appropriate regulatory structure for these new types of deals. This is no easy task, and there are many traps for regulators along the way. Several come to mind.\nFirst, while the SEC has considerable expertise in applying the Howey test, the first step in applying that test properly is understanding to what we are applying it. As I mentioned, I have had to put my student hat back on as I have worked to comprehend what tokens and distributed ledger technologies are and what their potential is. We have staff who are much better versed than I am in blockchain technology and the coding principles that underlie it, but for many of us in the lifeguard station there is a steep learning curve ahead.\nSecond, we must be careful not to let our lack of familiarity with new technology breed anxiety and therefore bad regulation. There is a risk, when something truly innovative comes along, that regulators will focus only on the harms the innovation may bring and miss entirely the opportunity it presents to improve people’s lives. New technology does often bring with it risks; it can take time and experience for developers to build in the proper safeguards. For example, we have seen lots of crypto currency thefts. [12]\nHowever, undue focus on potential harm can result in an agency’s leading with its enforcement powers, and ultimately setting itself up as the industry’s adversary. While a regulator should not be too chummy with the industry it regulates, creating a hostile relationship carries its own risks. Industry participants may be afraid to ask necessary questions and may avoid—rather than speak frankly with—the regulator. The regulator itself then risks becoming blind to the needs of the market, while also potentially missing significant wrongdoing.\nThird, even if the agency side-steps this trap, it may fall into another. The regulator may insert itself inappropriately into the creative process. The regulator should be careful not to try to control the development of new technologies. Not only is it outside the regulator’s proper function, but such micromanagement can result in the regulator forcing new technology to fit existing—and familiar—regulatory frameworks regardless of whether those frameworks are appropriate. The law deserves respect, but technological progress should not be bound by the limits of the regulator’s lawyerly imagination.\nIn addition to thinking about the potential risks of new technology, the regulator may feel compelled to assess its commercial value. For regulators, the temptation to substitute their own judgment for that of consumers and investors is powerful. Regulators do not need to take on the impossible task of deciding what products and services will win over consumers. The market is efficient at signaling which products and services people want in their lives and which they would rather do without.\nMy fear that regulators will grab hold of the shovels and buckets is why I am often wary of so-called regulatory sandboxes. I am entirely in favor of finding ways to make appropriate regulatory allowances that clear the way for innovation to flourish. What troubles me about sandboxes, however, is that the regulator is typically sitting right there next to the entrepreneurs. The regulator is facilitating and hosting the sandbox. In a rapidly shifting environment, such as the one surrounding ICOs, it is entirely appropriate for innovators to provide ongoing information to the relevant regulators. This interchange of ideas helps the regulators to understand what is happening, and therefore to feel comfortable exercising proper forbearance as new methods develop. A spirited back-and-forth also helps the regulators do their job better. That job includes evaluating new and existing regulations in light of market changes to ensure those rules are still well-suited to their intended purpose and do not unnecessarily stifle growth.\nThat sort of open communication between innovator and regulator can occur without a government-sponsored sandbox. To be clear, I am not categorically opposed to such solutions if they work to open the path for new developments. They seem to be working very well for some regulators. That said, I am mindful of the fact that a regulator’s mere presence can change the tenor of a fruitful conversation. Hence, the beach, not the sandbox, is my preferred approach.\nThe best path forward is for regulators to approach ICOs and tokens with intense curiosity. We must put in the effort to learn about these new technologies and employ the staff necessary to support our understanding. It is unfortunate that, to date, most of the communications from the SEC on the topic have come from our Division of Enforcement. Don’t get me wrong; it is absolutely essential that we address securities law violations, in particular fraud, that occur in any market under our jurisdiction. To that end, I encourage anyone who is aware of fraud in this space to notify the SEC so that we can ensure this market isn’t tainted by bad actors. [13] Chairman Clayton has rightly emphasized that we will pursue retail fraudsters, regardless of whether they use pre-Revolutionary Chinese bonds [14] or post-millennial ICOs. [15]\nAt the same time, I would much rather market participants who are not using the ICO label as an alluring way to steal money first meet us in a more neutral space. I encourage anyone with concerns or questions about the regulation of ICOs and distributed ledger technology to meet with the staff in the Division of Corporation Finance. The CorpFin staff, with the active engagement of our excellent CorpFin director Bill Hinman, has been looking hard at ICOs and related issues. They are trying to fully understand the technologies and to evaluate how an apt regulatory framework might look. As appropriate, staff in the Division of Corporation Finance can point you to other regulatory divisions, which are also looking at these technologies and thinking about the regulatory questions they raise.\nTo further these efforts, and for the benefit of all of us at the SEC working on these issues, I recommend that the SEC set up a web page devoted to questions and comments about ICOs, tokens, distributed ledger, and other crypto concepts. [16] We already have an email address—fintech@sec.gov—that folks can use to contact SEC staff for the purpose of discussing their fintech projects and regulatory options. A website would be easier for innovators to find. Unlike many other innovations in the financial world, much of this development is being done—not by financial firms, which are steeped in our regulatory environment—but by firms in the technology space, which may be unfamiliar not only with the SEC’s regulations, but also with the agency itself. It is important therefore to ensure that people who are looking for answers can find them easily. A crypto web page would be a modest first step to putting some helpful guideposts in place.\nAnother benefit of an easily accessible webpage is the opportunity to open-source answers to some of the challenges in this space. Recently, for example, the Division of Investment Management issued a letter that put the brakes on registered funds that seek to hold cryptocurrencies, pending satisfactory answers to a long list of questions. [17] I would love to provide people the opportunity to post public responses to these thought-provoking, important questions and react to one another’s responses. This kind of interactive conversation about challenges in the crypto-space, such as custody and valuation, would be valuable for me and, I suspect, for others at the Commission as well.\nI have enjoyed meetings at my office with people who are working in this space. My staff and I have learned an enormous amount from these meetings. I can’t do my job if I don’t know what the market needs. While I can do my share of reading and learning from the experts within the SEC, that knowledge is incomplete without insight from those who are actually on the ground, those whose ideas may transform our futures.\nI hope more people come to talk to me. I still have questions. For example, I understand that some issuers are conducting ICOs as private placements under Reg D. Does that approach work? Is there anything about our regulation of private placements that just doesn’t work with tokens? Should Reg D be revised in any way? Are other exemptions being used? How are those working? Where are the pain points? What can we do differently? How can we think through when a token that starts out as a security turns into something else? How should our thoughts on that question affect trading platforms? How should governance structures affect how we look at ICOs? What are some potential applications of distributed ledger technology in the securities space?\nThe SEC is not the only regulator interested in providing regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies, ICOs, and other applications of distributed ledger technology. Our colleagues at the CFTC, for example, have been very engaged in this space. Treasury plans to release a report on fintech in the coming months. Financial regulators are working together domestically and internationally to understand and respond to fintech developments.\nMy hope is that we can navigate these new waters collaboratively. The SEC’s role is not to hand out permission slips for innovation. Innovation happens—organically through private decisions and irrepressible human creativity. We at the Commission have a role to play in protecting investors and market integrity by deterring and punishing fraud and setting clear rules. As we sit atop our lifeguard’s stand and survey the beach, however, let’s not lose sight of the benefits new technology can provide in the area of capital formation, market efficiency, economic growth, and overall societal well-being.

Regulatory sandboxes encourage innovation by improving access to financing, minimizing legal uncertainty, and allowing entrepreneurs to experiment and fine-tune business models in a controlled testing environment. Such playgrounds allow regulators to stay abreast of new business ideas and products, and to learn where they might need to update or fill in gaps in existing regulatory frameworks.”).

While this is true, the current version of the protocol is not exactly anonymous.\nWhen Bitcoin was first introduced in 2009, its creator Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned it to be a private and secure protocol for transfer of value over the Internet. Before 2014, the general public didn’t really understand how the blockchain technology operates; there was very little information on the Internet and the limited info that was available was usually catered to developers/cryptographers who already knew a lot about the technology. The early adopters, hyped by this novel tech, massively overrated its capacity for anonymous transactions. Even today, when there’s not a person on the planet that hasn’t heard about Bitcoin, the majority of the people still think bitcoin transactions are anonymous.\nThe Bitcoin protocol it reliant on the blockchain technology which runs on a peer-to-peer network, thus eliminating the need for a trusted third party (like banks/clearing houses in the case of fiat money) to ensure the validity of the transactions. The blockchain provides transparency and transaction immutability, meaning that all valid transactions are permanently written down on this distributed ledger for everyone to see. A question inevitably arises: how are transactions made through the Bitcoin protocol anonymous, if they’re out in the open for everyone to see?\nThe answer is: they’re not. Bitcoin transactions are actually pseudo-anonymous, and there’s a big difference between the two. Even though the transactions themselves are transparent, they’re only linked to public addresses that are nothing more than strings of alphanumeric characters to the average Joe. So far so good, right? Wallets aren’t linked to any particular user by default. But what if (because of negligence, the actions of a malicious actor, or any other reason) a user was identified to own a certain wallet address? Then a simple search through the blockchain would reveal their entire financial activity on the network — all the way back to the Genesis block .\nWhile the casual use of Bitcoin grants you a little more anonymity than a wire transfer does, it’s not exactly anonymous. Get New Hardware Image credits: Alex Kunchevsky\nIf you’re thinking of setting up a truly anonymous Bitcoin operation from your desktop or laptop at home, forget about it. There’s all sorts of personal information and other data stored on it that someone with enough resources could access and use to reveal your identity. What you need is a fresh environment that has no traces of previous users: buy a cheap laptop, and two (or more) 8GB USB drives. After you do this, make sure you access the internet only through public WiFi networks (in cafes or libraries,) and never log into a social media or email account, or reveal any sort of personal information on that laptop. This will maximize your privacy, setting you up for the next step: Install Tails\nNext up, get yourself acquainted with Tails : “a live operating system that you can start on almost any computer from a USB stick”. It’s designed to protect your privacy, and allows you to browse the Internet anonymously by forcing all Internet connections through the Tor network. Tor is an overlay network consisting of over 7,000 relays that bounce your communications all around the world in order to defend you against traffic analysis (a form of network surveillance).\nTo install Tails on your USB drives, follow the step-by-step guide provided on their official website. You should spend a few days getting to know the Tails system and the Tor browser so you can use the set up correctly – minimizing your chances of getting exposed. Create a Bitcoin Wallet Image credits: Alex Kunchevsky\nNow that you have a “clean” hardware and software setup, it’s time to use it to set up your Bitcoin wallet . The name itself is a bit misleading, since a “wallet” is a place where you store coins. That isn’t the case – a Bitcoin wallet is more like a keychain where you store your private keys . The coins are stored on the blockchain, not “in” the wallet. You prove ownership over your coins using your wallet’s private keys ; anyone who has the private key can access the funds associated with it. You provide others with a public address , which is a hashed version of your wallet’s public key; think of it as a bank account number that you share in order to receive funds.\nThe key to using Bitcoin in a truly anonymous manner is to obfuscate any and all relationships between your real-world self and your digital self. A huge part of that is to never publicly associate your wallets’ public addresses with yourself, but you should also try to lose the link between individual transactions. In other words, never send or receive multiple transactions from a single bitcoin address. One way to achieve this is by using HD wallets. An HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) wallet uses a 12-word master seed key to generate multiple public addresses you can use to receive bitcoins; think of it as having a single password for multiple bank accounts. Ledger Nano S , Trezor , and MyCelium are all easy-to-use HD hard wallets.\nIf you can’t afford an HD hard wallet, there’s a cheaper option: cold wallets. A cold wallet is a wallet that isn’t connected to the Internet, meaning your digital assets are stored physically (on a piece of paper) and cannot be hacked into. The only risk here is misplacing that piece of paper, which is why it’s best to store it in a secure location. Use Bitaddress.org to generate new cold wallets for different transactions. Receiving funds is as easy as sharing your public address, but spending them is a bit more complicated since cold wallets aren’t meant for everyday usage. Buy Bitcoin Image credits: Alex Kunchevsky\nMost exchanges follow strict KYC and cTF/AML regulations and require some form of ID to create an account. As a consequence, buying your first bitcoins is the most complex part of the procedure. Here are your options: LocalBitcoins.com\nLocalBitcoins is a peer-to-peer service you can use to connect with cryptocurrency enthusiasts in your area and buy/sell crypto for cash. Open the website using Tor and sign up using a fake name and email address. Once you find a seller with a good reputation, arrange a meeting in a public place, make the transaction and (once you see the confirmation) you’re good to go. Bitcoin ATM\nA Bitcoin ATM accepts fiat for BTC, and vice versa. It usually doesn’t require any form of identification, but it may charge up to 7% in fees. As expensive as it is, it’s among the safest ways to acquire bitcoins: you put cash in and enter your public address as a recipient. Use CoinATMRadar to find a Bitcoin ATM in your area. Conclusion\nBy now you probably see the bigger picture: genuine Bitcoin anonymity is by no means granted to you. It comes as a result of meticulous planning and following a precise set of steps. Each phase of the process is crucial to the overall effect and, as challenging of an endeavour as it is, it’s very well worth the benefits. If you want to take it a step further, you should look into mixing services that further obfuscate the link between your address and your coins.\nIf you follow the steps in this guide in their entirety and in the right order, your identity will remain private, your transactions will be impossible to trace, and the link between you and your funds will be virtually non-existent.

ICE first appeared in the digital currencies market through a cryptocurrency data feed in March.\nICE has organised talks with other financial institutions about the project being developed and it has been asking not to be identified due to confidentiality of the conversations otherwise the project could be aborted prematurely.\nIn December 2017, Wall Street firms started giving clients futures from Cboe Global Markets and CME Group, but the financial sector has been timid from trading bitcoin. The reason is that virtual currencies can be hacked and stolen and this problem has happened very many times on most cryptocurrency firms. So traditional Wall Street firms will have to find out how to reserve such assets safely in order to facilitate and boom investment.\nWall Street bank Goldman Sachs disclosed that it was operating on a cryptocurrency trading desk earlier in May. Very many trading firms have been dealing with cryptocurrency including Chicago-based HFTs like Jump Trading and DRW\nPotential investors may be given swaps by Intercontinental Exchange that would end with the consumer owning bitcoin the following day. These contracts would set the trading under the control of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\nJeffrey Sprecher, ICE Chief Executive Officer promised to reject offering contracts based on digital currencies, in last month's interview: \"There is a trend here we can't ignore in my mind, so I don't discount it.\"\nThe undertaking will have a bigger advantage over existing cryptocurrency exchanges firms that lack the mature market structure of equities exchanges such as Nasdaq and the NYSE.\nGoldman Sachs Group has been tirelessly working on enlarging contract types available to different investors as it arranges to open a bitcoin trading business. The bank will presumably buy and sell bitcoin futures in a principal, market-making capacity and will make non-deliverable forward products.\nIn April, Nasdaq partnered with cryptocurrency exchange Gemini and is soon launching a futures cryptocurrency market.

A use case perhaps underappreciated is the potential for digital assets to facilitate freer societies. Micro-societies, breakaway camps, isles of autonomy are in various states of construction around the world. One of the furthest along is Fort Galt Chile. News.Bitcoin.com caught up with one of its founders, Gabriel Scheare, to find out more about an intriguing project.\nAlso read: Germany Gets Its First Crypto Exchange for Whales\nCryptocurrencies Facilitate Rise of Breakaway Societies\nAs this interview was conducted, at least three other micro-societies are being planned or attempting to function: Liberland , Seasteading , and the aptly named Free Society . Each has its particular charm and focus, but one factor increasingly important in their ultimate calculations is cryptocurrency. The present focus, Fort Galt, is based in Chile, a country wormed along South America's southwest. The country recently has gone back and forth on crypto, but maintains a unique place among Latin American countries as being very open to freer economies and markets. It just might give birth to the first viable project of this kind.\nNews.Bitcoin.com : Take us through how you came upon the idea to start a breakaway society or microsociety.\nGabriel Scheare: My partners and I were originally lured to Chile by another such project that was already underway near Santiago, Galt's Gulch Chile . Unfortunately, it turned out to be a scam so we decided that, if we really wanted to realize our dream, we'd have to go somewhere else and build it ourselves. The underlying motivation is really just the longing for a community of people that share our fundamental principles so that we can live more freely without having to walk on eggshells around incompatible neighbors.\nThe whole Gulch debacle sure looked bad. Was it a total loss or did you at least learn something useful from it?\nDefinitely. I was there working as a volunteer for three months and in that time, I took a lot of note. I had no previous experience in real estate so it was all new to me but nevertheless, it was easy enough to sort everything into the two categories of \"what works\" and \"what doesn't\". Above all else, I got to see that there was indeed a market for this sort of thing. The Gulch tested the waters and so I suppose you could say that we have a \"second mover advantage\" in that regard. They essentially did our market research for us just before collapsing. Some other obvious lessons would be things relating to the nature of the scam itself. Things like \"don't sell parcels of land that haven't actually been subdivided as you're showing them\" and \"don't try to build a new town on environmentally protected land that's close to a city of six million people, where water rights are in high demand.\"\nGabriel Scheare Didn't all of that tarnish the Galt name? Why didn't you pick a completely new one to distance yourself from the scam?\nFrom a marketing perspective, ditching the name would've been the smart thing to do. Frankly though, we were just pissed off that a couple of unscrupulous hucksters could so easily drag such a great name through the mud, and we really wanted to redeem it with our own success. Maybe it's just stubbornness but we refuse to let such a great name be trashed so easily. It should be attached to a shining example of what a self-reliant community can be, and by the time we're finished it'll be all that and more.\nA New Model That Makes the Existing Model Obsolete John Galt was the hero in Ayn Rand 's novel, Atlas Shrugged . How much of her philosophy influenced your project?\nYeah, I admit I'm not a big fan of her writing style but the essential message of the book resonates strongly with us. It's about a guy that gets fed up with the government and goes off to start a secret community in Colorado where he and others like him live in peace without having to contribute to a system they are philosophically opposed to. It struck me as being very much in line with Gandhi's advice, \"Be the change you want to see in the world.\" I think way too many people waste their time and energy fighting the powers-that-be when they could be focusing on removing themselves from the situation and building something new for themselves. Buckminster Fuller summed it up nicely when he said \"you never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.\" I really dig that attitude because it's optimistic and constructive rather than confrontational.\nHow viable is the current project? It seems to be moving along wonderfully.\nA lot had to be done to get us from zero to one, so to speak, but things are taking shape now and we're all pretty excited. As we speak, cement mixing trucks are pouring concrete at the construction site of our residential community center. We've also been selling plots of land to people that will be starting work on their own houses soon. A little later in the year, our schoolhouse will be built as well and several spin-off projects are already coming together around us now too.\nHow did you find cryptocurrencies?\nI guess I first started hearing rumblings about it in 2011 so I went to a meet-up in Vancouver to learn more about it. That was before any wallet apps existed so I didn't think it was user-friendly enough to really catch on yet. I kept an eye on it though and when the blockchain.info wallet was launched a couple years later, I decided it was time to jump in. I started mining bitcoin and selling miners in my free time. That was in 2013 and by the end of the year, the value had shot up 10x and the excitement was off the charts. I moved to Chile early the following year.\nHow much of a role do cryptocurrencies play in Fort Galt ?\nWe do still accept bank wires but almost all of our members, so far, have paid with cryptocurrencies instead. We've accepted bitcoin, dash, and ether and they've all proven to be faster, easier, and cheaper to use than any other payment system available today. For me, it brings to mind the gold coins of Atlas Shrugged because I think of bitcoin as being a sort of digital gold.

Bitcoin Beats Gold\nIn the battle between Bitcoin and gold, the former certainly comes out the winner in a variety of categories.\nAs noted by Forbes , gold doesn’t function well as currency, is insecure, experiences price volatility not too far removed from digital assets, and cannot easily be digitized. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is steadily moving towards mainstream adoption as a viable currency, is highly secure, and allows for cross-border transfers of value in a matter of hours at most. Furthermore, mining real gold uses a tremendous amount of energy and has an environmental impact vastly more significant than Bitcoin mining .\nHowever, there’s one category in which Bitcoin trounces gold that has largely gone overlooked — it’s become the dominant form of flight capital. What Is Flight Capital?\nFlight capital, generally speaking, is money transferred abroad to either avoid taxes and/or inflation or provide for possible emigration — particularly in times of war.\nTo put it simply, if the brown stuff hits the fan and you’ve got to pack up and move, it’s a lot easier to take your Bitcoin with you than it is to lug around a bag of gold. As noted by Clem Chambers, CEO of ADVFN.com and author of Be Rich, The Game in Wall Street and Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner’s Guide :\nWhen Little Rocket Man was wrestling Big Rocket Man, gold didn’t react, but Bitcoin went off the dial every night. You can’t head for the airport with gold bars these days, and opening a foreign bank account is a thankless task that can take months or never get done. A normal person sweating a war isn’t a billionaire with a private office, but in the old days they might have stashed a few thousand or even hundreds of thousands in gold if they thought the balloon was going up.\nToday you’d stash it in Bitcoin and be safe in the knowledge that you could fly away on holiday somewhere safe for a few months and your stash would be as safe as the place your hid you private keys.\nOf course, nobody wants a war — but should one happen, cryptocurrency investors and early adopters will be the ones set to remain most secure in their wealth. Concludes Chambers:\nNow Etherium, Bitcoin, Ripple, Litecoin and a myriad of crypto will get the attention that gold once enjoyed.\nIts bad news for grumpy old men but good news for crypto-believers and a new trading opportunity for us.\nWhat do you think about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as the new form of flight capital? Do you think conflict and war only increase the demand for digital currencies and assets?

Details remain patchy at this stage as to how the platform will work.\nHowever, suggestions are that it will be familiar to other crowdfunding models, with Bitcoin support the exclusive focal point for investments. The platform will also reportedly include support for ShapeShift.\nWhile there are few details on that front at the moment, this is already fueling interest in the crowdfunding platform from investors and analysts alike. The news is the latest positive development for Bitcoin Cash, and comes in the wake of several key technological developments.\nKey technical upgrades, combined with the upcoming second network upgrade, are already raising interest in Bitcoin Cash as the closest cryptocurrency to the vision in the original Satoshi whitepaper. With Coinfundr poised to launch later this month, all eyes will now be on whether the platform can carve a niche for itself within the cryptocurrency, as well as the wider crowdfunding sectors.

Shrem is a bitcoin pioneer, social economist, digital currency trader and is currently the founder of Crypto.IQ. His work in this field is legendary. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510005572/en/ Charlie Shrem (Photo: Business Wire)\nIn 2011, at the dawn of the crypto era, Shrem founded BitInstant, the first and largest Bitcoin company. In 2013, he founded the Bitcoin Foundation and served as its Vice Chairman. Since then, Charlie has advised more than a dozen digital currency companies, launched and managed numerous partnerships between crypto and non-crypto companies, and is the go-to guy for some of the world’s wealthiest entrepreneurs. He recently started Crypto.IQ, a premier advisory firm providing expert research, education and advice in the world of crypto assets. In short, he is the ultimate insider at the epicenter.\nShrem was an early change-maker for bitcoin, identifying some of the initial challenges and quickly working to overcome them so that it could be adopted on a mass scale. His company BitInstant was born out of the frustration of losing bitcoins due to long transaction times. At one time, it processed 30% of all bitcoin transactions. Shrem is responsible for bringing cryptocurrency to the masses by partnering with MoneyGram to allow cash deposits for bitcoin at over 700,000 US locations.\n“Shrem’s first hand experience with both the actual and perceived limitations of digital currency, followed by rapid innovation to overcome them, is exactly what we need to introduce a new cryptolocation technology on a massive and global scale,” said XYO Network co-founder Markus Levin.\nThe XYO Network is the next generation of GPS technology as it provides an efficient and foolproof way to deliver trustworthy location through cryptolocation technology that protects privacy while providing greater accuracy. With a platform of over one million connected beacon devices already in circulation, the blockchain technology can jump from the online realm into the real world with precise physical coordinates.\nAs the world leader in blockchain location technology, the XYO Network can serve as an Internet of Things (IoT) backbone for smart cities of the future. It can power everything from automated parking payments to traffic flow optimization, self-driving cars, autonomous drone delivery, airline luggage tracking, e-commerce, and many additional applications. It can even extend beyond the Earth to vehicle and equipment location services on the Moon or even Mars.\nFor additional information, visit xyo.network.\nAbout XYO Network:\nXYO Network built the world’s first decentralized location verification system with more than one million location tracking devices in circulation around the world. After years of investment and breakthroughs in crypto-location technology, XYO is poised to help bring the promise and the benefits of blockchain technology to the real world on a massive and global scale. This can have a profound impact on businesses that rely on the delivery of goods and services requiring non-forgeable and verifiable location data. It can power current applications like eCommerce as well as the backbone for smart cities of the future including the Internet of Things (IoT), self-driving vehicles, autonomous delivery drones, and even location tracking on the Moon and Mars.

SQ-Cash to BTC trading has been insignificant. Even w/ hyper growth still 40 [percent] too rich.\" Square stock momentarily shed 3.8 percent to $45.76 a share after the post, before making back almost all of its dip to close 0.48 percent lower on the day.\n( Source : Trading View )\nCitron also issued its short-term target price of $30 for the stock, or 36.9 percent below the close on April 27, 2018. The Square share price has changed little since former Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey offered Bitcoin trading in January 2018 to most of the company's Cash mobile-payments app users.\nPointing to the multiplier effect that Bitcoin can have on any business that jumps on board, Left insists that this is the reason for such optimism around Square , but that the core value analysis paints a different picture.\nBitcoin's unimaginable rise during 2017 has enthused a host of startups to capitalize on what they see as massive support for the digital currency. Left, however, is scrutinizing some of the surrounding service offers, including Square, and feels that there is still too much hype on the issue. This enthusiasm makes it challenging to come to a reasoned conclusion on the true value of the coin and the businesses that have capitalized on it.\nIn contrast, research analyst at Nomura Instinet , Dan Dolev, said that he feels the \"Bitcoin impact will be material, long-term.\" As opposed to Citron Research's analysis, he raised the price target for Square stock to $65 on April 18, 2018. Dolev is basing his target on the fact that the launch of Bitcoin trading by Square should add to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, amortization, and depreciation, and he is predicting this upswing to pan out an increased revenue of around ten percent.\nCryptocurrency Srading Still a Volatile Space Although Nomura Instinet has industry credibility and is adopting a different stance from which to analyze the current markets, Citron's is also a reputable voice, and commentators are divided on the issue of a legitimate share price for Square. Spiking to just under $20,000 in December last year, the Christmas madness around the pioneer cryptocurrency has abated, and although those formerly giddy highs are over, the coin remains massively up year on year.\nBitcoin traders have so far managed to avoid such considerable slumps in 2018, and new sobriety permeates the trading floors. Regulators are settling into their comfort zone with a handle on virtual currencies and users are starting to see the utility behind cryptocurrencies, rather than the potentially ridiculously profitable assets they were treated as during 2017.\nSquare shares are up 34 percent for the 2018 year to date. Bitcoin was trading around $9,300 on April 30, 2018. The coin is still a remarkable 570 percent up over the last 12 months of trading.\nThe post Square Shares Dip after Citron Labels Bitcoin Strategy \"Nonsense\" appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrew left", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "citron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "citron labels bitcoin strategy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "citron research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trading view ) citron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "labeling square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T15:38:49.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "66e4abef1ca018a5a40064ccbd0baf1f0adb94f8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnyw8ztXMws8newwXswprZJKa8tIGXfX3qB5LprUlM3wa4zteGcnKetKwA--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Bitcoin Beats Gold as New Flight Capital", "title_full": "Bitcoin Beats Gold as New Flight Capital", "published": "2018-05-10T15:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "66e4abef1ca018a5a40064ccbd0baf1f0adb94f8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnyw8ztXMws8newwXswprZJKa8tIGXfX3qB5LprUlM3wa4zteGcnKetKwA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-10T15:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Beats Gold as New Flight Capital", "text": "The Bitcoin-versus-gold debate is certainly nothing new, but there's one aspect in which the gold standard of cryptocurrency beats out the gold standard of historical currency hands down.\nBitcoin Beats Gold In the battle between Bitcoin and gold, the former certainly comes out the winner in a variety of categories.\nAs noted by Forbes , gold doesn't function well as currency, is insecure, experiences price volatility not too far removed from digital assets, and cannot easily be digitized. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is steadily moving towards mainstream adoption as a viable currency, is highly secure, and allows for cross-border transfers of value in a matter of hours at most. Furthermore, mining real gold uses a tremendous amount of energy and has an environmental impact vastly more significant than Bitcoin mining .\nHowever, there's one category in which Bitcoin trounces gold that has largely gone overlooked — it's become the dominant form of flight capital.\nWhat Is Flight Capital? Flight capital, generally speaking, is money transferred abroad to either avoid taxes and/or inflation or provide for possible emigration — particularly in times of war.\nTo put it simply, if the brown stuff hits the fan and you've got to pack up and move, it's a lot easier to take your Bitcoin with you than it is to lug around a bag of gold. As noted by Clem Chambers, CEO of ADVFN.com and author of Be Rich, The Game in Wall Street and Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner's Guide :\nWhen Little Rocket Man was wrestling Big Rocket Man, gold didn't react, but Bitcoin went off the dial every night. You can't head for the airport with gold bars these days, and opening a foreign bank account is a thankless task that can take months or never get done. A normal person sweating a war isn't a billionaire with a private office, but in the old days they might have stashed a few thousand or even hundreds of thousands in gold if they thought the balloon was going up.\nToday you'd stash it in Bitcoin and be safe in the knowledge that you could fly away on holiday somewhere safe for a few months and your stash would be as safe as the place your hid you private keys.\nOf course, nobody wants a war — but should one happen, cryptocurrency investors and early adopters will be the ones set to remain most secure in their wealth. Concludes Chambers:\nNow Etherium, Bitcoin, Ripple, Litecoin and a myriad of crypto will get the attention that gold once enjoyed.\nIts bad news for grumpy old men but good news for crypto-believers and a new trading opportunity for us.\nWhat do you think about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as the new form of flight capital? Do you think conflict and war only increase the demand for digital currencies and assets?

This shouldn't take more than two minutes. (Related reading, see: Basics For Buying And Investing In Bitcoin)\n[ Setting up a Bitcoin wallet is only the first step in becoming a cryptocurrency trader. If you're interested in learning more, Investopedia's Crypto Trading Course provides a comprehensive overview of the subject. You'll learn everything from crypto basics - including how to setup wallets - to technical analysis and risk management techniques to enhance your profitability. ]\nThis is what your account page would look like if you were to sign up for a Bitcoin wallet on Coinbase. As you see, it looks kind of like the online banking software that most traditional commercial banks use for their customers:\nUse Regular Money to Buy Bitcoin\nOnce you have a Bitcoin wallet, you use a traditional payment method such as credit card, bank transfer (ACH), or debit card to buy Bitcoins on a Bitcoin exchange (example: Coinbase). The Bitcoins are then transferred to your wallet. The availability of the above payment methods is subject to the area of jurisdiction and exchange chosen. Here is a screenshot of the Bitcoin interface showing how to buy and sell not just Bitcoin but also Ethereum and Litecoin, which are other popular virtual currencies. As you see, it's as straightforward as clicking on the \"Buy\" tab if you want to buy, and \"Sell\" tab if you want to sell. You select which currency you are buying/selling and which payment method (your bank account or credit card) you want to use.\nRemember that \"Bitcoin exchange\" and \"Bitcoin wallet\" need not be the same. Bitcoin exchanges are kind of like forex exchanges – places where you can trade Bitcoin for a fiat currency, say, BTC for USD and vice versa (in U.S. for example). While exchanges offer wallet capabilities to users, it’s not their primary business. Since wallets need to be kept safe and secure, exchanges do not encourage storing of Bitcoins for higher amounts or long periods of time. Hence, it is best to transfer your Bitcoins to a secure wallet. Security must be your top priority while opting for a Bitcoin wallet; always opt for the one with multi-signature facility.\nThere are many well-established exchanges that act as a one-stop solution by offering high security standards and reporting. Due diligence must be exercised while choosing a Bitcoin exchange or wallet. (Related reading, see: What Is Cold Storage For Bitcoin)\nA Bitcoin Wallet is for Your Private Key, Not for Storing Bitcoin\nThe common assumption that Bitcoins are stored in a wallet is technically incorrect. Bitcoins are not stored anywhere. Bitcoin balances are kept using public and private “keys,” which are long strings of numbers and letters linked through the mathematical encryption algorithm that was used to create them. The public key (comparable to a bank account number or IBAN) serves as the address published to the world, and to which others may send Bitcoins.\nThe private key (comparable to an ATM PIN) is meant to be a guarded secret, and only used to authorize Bitcoin transmissions. Thus, it’s the “private key” that is kept in a Bitcoin wallet. Some safeguards for a Bitcoin wallet include: encrypting the wallet with a strong password and choosing the cold storage option, i.e. storing it offline. In the case of Coinbase, they offer a secure \"multisig vault\" to host your keys, which you can sign up for.\nAs a user, you are free to use those Bitcoins using the “private key” to buy a commodity, or make a payment for a service, or send money to a friend or family. These Bitcoins are sent using the “address” of the recipient. Selling Bitcoins on the exchange will earn you its selling amount in the local currency, which can be withdrawn by you.\nAlthough Bitcoin is homogenous (the same everywhere in the world), its price varies across countries and even exchanges within the same country, giving a rise to arbitrage opportunities. The Bitcoin price in South Korea has been trading at a 35% premium while in India it has been at a 20-25% premium. The demand and supply conditions result in some aberrations in its price.\nThe number of places where Bitcoins can be spent is increasing rapidly and includes some big retail players as well as many small businesses and retailers. The increased acceptance is boosting its footprint across the globe and is helping it secure an official recognition as a mode of payment. Japan has recently accepted Bitcoin as a payment mode.\nThe Bottom Line\nThe changing regulatory stance, increasing adoption and acceptance, investments in Bitcoin start-ups and products being launched around it have cumulatively raised the confidence in Bitcoin. However, it’s still in a nascent stage and thus one must be aware of the price volatility issues, taxation aspect and legality angle before buying Bitcoins.\nRelated Articles\n Tech\n Best Ways To Protect Your Bitcoins\n Just like any other valuable asset, its important to keep your bitcoins safe.

The USD is backed by a government with over 240 years of history. The USD is probably the most liquid currency on the planet. It is directly backed by over 300 million individuals who buy their food and pay their taxes, supporting the government with this legal tender. It is so trusted, in fact, that it is the de facto currency for the vast majority of global trade. You want USD because you know its value and so do your friends and neighbors. Whatever Bitcoin may be, it does not share remotely the same universal value consensus as a USD. The movement from the GBP as the standard of world trade and finance to the USD is also instructive. Historically, in London, you paid for trade with bills-- pieces of paper drawn on merchant banks in London (like Rothschild) which were often treated as safer than metallic money (and easier to move). Essentially 100% of international trade cleared in London by the late 19th century. Thus the use of the GBP as the unit of denomination and account. That lasted until summer 1914 when Britain imposed various controls as part of the war measures \"home before the leaves fall\". Of course WW1 turned out to be the biggest war in human history (until then) and Britain and France liquidated huge amounts of their holdings to buy arms and raw materials from the USA. Given embargo on Germany etc. the international payment system came under huge pressure. (there was a actually a financial crisis in the London money markets in August 2014 and the markets were closed by the authorities for a few days. It's been forgotten, because we now remember that month as the month when Europe rushed off a precipice, almost by accident). Post WW1 Britain tried to restore the Gold Standard membership, with the GBP set at $4.85, its prewar rate. Winston Churchill's greatest mistake (he was Chancellor of the Exchequer/ Minister of Finance). That led to the General Strike of 1924 when the coal mining companies asked the workers to work for longer hours for less pay, to remain competitive. The 1920s was not a happy time for Great Britain. Eventually the pound was devalued (as it would be, post WW2). The transition to the USD as the international currency was not overnight. It was disrupted by the collapse of world trade and payment systems following the default of Credit Anstalt in Austria in 1931. Countries threw up huge barriers to trade, and began to trade bilaterally on a barter basis - Russian wheat for machinery, etc. The Bretton Woods Conference in 1944 was held to set the shape of postwar financial system. The primacy of the US dollar, and fixed exchange rates, was set at that time. Arguably the US accepted an overvalued exchange rate for the next 27 years, to allow postwar reconstruction of the devastated countries (Britain and GBP continued their slide into economic irrelevance). In 1971, the situation of the USD became untenable, President Nixon ended the Bretton Woods system, and we entered the world of free exchange rates (\"managed float\") that we have now. It's very difficult to see how another currency could come to rival the USD. You'd need a country prepared to run a current account deficit for decades to increase the holdings of its currency in foreign hands. There is talk of the Special Drawing Right, a composite money used between international financial institutions (Central Bank, IMF etc.).

Bitcoin Beats Gold\nIn the battle between Bitcoin and gold, the former certainly comes out the winner in a variety of categories.\nAs noted by Forbes , gold doesn’t function well as currency, is insecure, experiences price volatility not too far removed from digital assets, and cannot easily be digitized. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is steadily moving towards mainstream adoption as a viable currency, is highly secure, and allows for cross-border transfers of value in a matter of hours at most. Furthermore, mining real gold uses a tremendous amount of energy and has an environmental impact vastly more significant than Bitcoin mining .\nHowever, there’s one category in which Bitcoin trounces gold that has largely gone overlooked — it’s become the dominant form of flight capital. What Is Flight Capital?\nFlight capital, generally speaking, is money transferred abroad to either avoid taxes and/or inflation or provide for possible emigration — particularly in times of war.\nTo put it simply, if the brown stuff hits the fan and you’ve got to pack up and move, it’s a lot easier to take your Bitcoin with you than it is to lug around a bag of gold. As noted by Clem Chambers, CEO of ADVFN.com and author of Be Rich, The Game in Wall Street and Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner’s Guide :\nWhen Little Rocket Man was wrestling Big Rocket Man, gold didn’t react, but Bitcoin went off the dial every night. You can’t head for the airport with gold bars these days, and opening a foreign bank account is a thankless task that can take months or never get done. A normal person sweating a war isn’t a billionaire with a private office, but in the old days they might have stashed a few thousand or even hundreds of thousands in gold if they thought the balloon was going up.\nToday you’d stash it in Bitcoin and be safe in the knowledge that you could fly away on holiday somewhere safe for a few months and your stash would be as safe as the place your hid you private keys.\nOf course, nobody wants a war — but should one happen, cryptocurrency investors and early adopters will be the ones set to remain most secure in their wealth. Concludes Chambers:\nNow Etherium, Bitcoin, Ripple, Litecoin and a myriad of crypto will get the attention that gold once enjoyed.\nIts bad news for grumpy old men but good news for crypto-believers and a new trading opportunity for us.\nWhat do you think about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as the new form of flight capital? Do you think conflict and war only increase the demand for digital currencies and assets?

In Uncategorized . Leave a Comment on Buffett ‘Disciple’ Condemns Investor’s Views On Bitcoin\nVenture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya has countered billionaire Warren Buffett’s recent derogatory statements on bitcoin, stating that the cryptocurrency is “important.”\nHis comments come after billionaire chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett, argued that bitcoin is more of a gamble than an investment at the end of April, and then, last weekend at a shareholders’ meeting, he said bitcoin is “ probably rat poison squared .”\nWhile calling himself a Buffett “disciple,” Palihapitiya told CNBC that Buffett is wrong about bitcoin.\n“Not everybody is right all the time,” he told the news source, further suggesting that that knowledge about technology is not in Buffett’s “circle of competence.”\nPalihapitiya, a former Facebook and AOL executive, went on to push for the cryptocurrency’s benefits, saying it is a replacement to gold and:\n“Something like bitcoin is really important, because it is not correlated to the rest of the market.”\nSpeaking about the financial crisis, he said that “things that we thought were hedges went away” and “broke down”. Bitcoin is viewed as providing a hedge to traditional finance by those who have owned the digital currency, he said.\nChamath Palihapitiya image via JD Lasica/Flickr\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .
