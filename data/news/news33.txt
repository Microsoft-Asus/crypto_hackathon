Next time, BTC price will probably increase so now is the most appropriate investment time.

The top politicians and bankers jointly profit from inflating the values of money and debt with state power -- this system couldn't survive without either side.\nSee Dissecting the Parasitocracy .\nThe interesting thing is, if you buy and hold gold and Bitcoin for the long term, you can benefit. (Just make sure you don't buy when the global empire is rising, like the 1950s or early 1990s.) The reason is also due to the nature of the state-bank alliance.\nNote that, in this alliance, the top politicians contribute state power, while the top bankers contribute financial know-how. The politicians, being totally ignorant in this high-stakes and specialized game, are basically led around like children. They just go along because they benefit from issuing huge amounts of public debt without being punished by the 'markets.'\nSo here's the problem with this alliance. When financial asset values collapse (and this day will come, due to the incentives faced by the elites) and everyday people suffer, the politicians will put all the blame on the bankers. The reasons are obvious (and there is no loyalty in that game,) and the politicians are going to win that argument. The biggest such events in history include the Spanish Inquisition and the Nazi Holocaust. In our day, politicians like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have already gone after the bankers.\nKnowing that, the bankers and central bankers must prepare a last-ditch rescue for a worst-case scenario, when all trust in the system is gone. That rescue will be some non-state-issued asset, like gold, silver, and Bitcoin, that the elites can peg their money to (at a high price for the non-state asset,) stabilize their system, and ease the suffering. Even if the bankers think there's only a small chance for such an occurrence, it will be so devastating to the bankers that they must prepare for it.\nSo, the elites will try to suppress non-state assets, but won't kill them, even when given a chance. In the long run, this presents something like a one-way bet for these assets, at current prices.\nThe real reason why we should hold the bitcoin like its a gold cause we all know that bitcoin will pump again soon. So in short bitcoin will regain new value higher than twenty thousand dollars. So bitcoin willbe high value token or cryptocurrency again. Every day bitcoin change its value from ten to twelve thousand dollars", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T21:15:48.057+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a1967db9689a4af3abff0c685b2e7540f8fa5dda", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmVR1FCgmtiFh2TAZxt76Udc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Let's suppose that Bitcoin became universal (used everywhere you go)", "title_full": "Let's suppose that Bitcoin became universal (used everywhere you go)", "published": "2018-06-06T01:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a1967db9689a4af3abff0c685b2e7540f8fa5dda", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmVR1FCgmtiFh2TAZxt76Udc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ewox", "published": "2018-06-06T01:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Let's suppose that Bitcoin became universal (used everywhere you go)", "text": "You may not be paying taxes when using bitcoin now but once you place them in your bank account and once bitcoin is legalized or regularised then we will eventually pay taxes with them.

until they eventually miss the chance to buy in, start getting angry with everyone, eventually join FOMO and probably then, the market comes back down and they panic.\nIt is simple for investment, buy what you can afford to lose as long as you are investing long term, and forget about what the market holds currently and anyone who wants to trade should stop asking questions like this and should go learn so as to have the best opportunity to buy and sell whenever they want based on their trade decisions.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

( AAPL ) , said he remains bullish on bitcoin but doesn't currently own any. Wozniak, who labels himself as a supportive technologist but not an investor, told CNBC that he agrees with comments from Square Inc. ( SQ ) CEO Jack Dorsey, who said he wants bitcoin to become the internet's \"native currency\" last month. \"I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it's going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking,\" Wozniak said.\nSEC Appoints Crypto Director The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it has appointed Valerie Szczepanik as the associate director of the Division of Corporation Finance and senior adviser for digital assets and innovation. Szczepanik is expected to \"coordinate efforts across all SEC divisions and offices regarding the application of U.S. securities laws to emerging digital asset technologies and innovations, including initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrencies,\" the SEC said. The commission has played a pivotal role in the public discourse regarding the future of crypto regulation, most recently honing in on ICOs and associated fraudulent behavior.\nLinkedIn Co-Founder Raising $20 Million for Token Project Eric Ly, one of the co-founders of now-Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT ) owned LinkedIn, is part of a project raising $20 million for a project called Hub Token. Ly was LinkedIn's first chief technology officer. According to public documents , Ly is part of a group looking to raise $20 million in a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) sale for Hub Token, an asset tied to a forthcoming platform called ICOHub. ICOHub was created earlier this year as a platform for reputable token sales with the goal of eradicating fraudulent ICOs. As of the most recent Form D filing, Ly's venture had raised about $13.6 million from 20 investors. The token was created as an incentive for building trust among ICOHub network participants.\nGoogle Searches for Bitcoin Plummet Google Trends show that searches for the term \"bitcoin\" have dropped more than 75% since the beginning of 2018, CNBC reported . In the last three months alone, the number of searches has been cut in half.

"Cash has been dying for a long time, according to some . It's probably died more times than Bitcoin, over the years . However, cash (and its closest digital cousin, card payments) are far from dead and perhaps not even dying — despite the hype around wearable payments, mobile payments, and cryptocurrency.\nThe Money20/20 Europe Payments Race — something the conference has done in other parts of the world with significantly different results — pitted Team Cash, Team Card, Team Crypto, Team Wearables (using a Curve Ring and Apple Watch), and Team Mobile against each other to find the fastest route from Istanbul to Amsterdam.\nIn the end, the results were:\n(Joint) 1st – Team Cash / Team Card 3rd – Team Wearables 4th – Team Crypto 5th – Team Mobile\nDespite coming in first, Team Card said it suffered as a result of Visa’s service outage last Friday, describing it as \"a nice spanner in the works\".\nThe Visa outage on Friday left millions of people unable to pay for goods and services across Europe for a few hours.\nLast year the European Central Bank (ECB) said there were some 804 million payment cards in the European Union in 2016, representing around 1.6 payment cards per EU inhabitant, as well as around 54 billion transactions processed by retail payment systems that year, totalling €41.8 trillion ($48.7 trillion).\nIn the UK payment processing through Visa's systems accounts for £1 in £3 of all spending.\nTeam Wearables and Team Mobile, both dependant on contactless technology, said the the race was \"very challenging\".\nTeam Mobile summed up their performance: \"People love cash in the EU.\"\nPeople in the EU use cash on average 1.2 times per day, with card payments second most frequently used at an average of 0.3 times per day, according to a recent ECB report .\nECB — The use of cash by households in the euro area report Cash outstrips card and other payments in almost every EU country\nInterestingly, ahead of the result an audience poll predicted that Team Mobile would come out on top, with Card in second place and Cash in third. The Money20/20 audience are fintech pros and have perhaps been drinking their own mobile payments kool aid.\nMeanwhile, it should also be remembered how quickly technology can change the world. Cars wiped out carriages, telephones wiped out the telegram, and (eventually) digital payments will wipe out cash. But not yet.\nElsewhere at Money20/20, Brad Garlinghouse, the chief executive of blockchain startup Ripple, said Bitcoin is not the \"panacea\" people had thought it was due to its slow transaction times.\nXRP — the digital token exchanged on the Ripple network — has a transaction time of four seconds, according to Ripple's website, compared to Bitcoin's current average transaction time of 42 minutes, according to Blockchain.info data.\nGarlinghouse, speaking to CNBC on the sidelines of the conference , was responding to comments by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak who yesterday said he wanted to see Bitcoin become a global currency .\nWozniak also said the thinks those involved with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are currently too concerned with the price and has recently sold all but one of his Bitcoins to escape the daily price check.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://us.money2020.com/payments-race", "https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats/", "https://www.ft.com/content/9d5cd3f6-4bf9-11e5-b558-8a9722977189", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/05/ripple-ceo-bitcoin-is-not-the-panacea-people-thought.html", "https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op201.en.pdf"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "european central bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "team card", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amsterdam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "istanbul", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T19:56:51.039+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4afb398b1059ef469681e012d464fe6b17e8e386", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfPlyukz.CExnvXy7vyjP3Q-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin should NOT determine the market", "title_full": "Bitcoin should NOT determine the market", "published": "2018-06-06T00:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.012, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4afb398b1059ef469681e012d464fe6b17e8e386", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfPlyukz.CExnvXy7vyjP3Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "adamantasaurus", "published": "2018-06-06T00:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin should NOT determine the market", "text": "Quote: from: leviathon on June 04, 2018, 04:23:24 PM The reason why Bitcoin determines the prices of the whole market is cause it is the entry and exit point of the whole crypto market.

So far it is not known that this was done.”\nIts reported that the modification of the machines would offer QR code facilities to enable simple address scanning and modification.\nCryptocurrency ATMs are becoming far more commonplace around the globe, although Europe has a long way before it catches up with the US. Prague has recently seen the arrival of 10 new Bitcoin ATMs across the city’s subway routes, and London now has 74 positioned around the city, although 118 businesses also accept Bitcoin as payment.\nHowever, London ranks 6th globally on the crypto convenience list, with the top five cities all located in North America. Los Angeles tops the list with 145 ATMs and over 850 firms accepting Bitcoin payments. Other cities with a healthy spread include Toronto, New York, and Atlanta. Argentina has expressed a desire to have a gargantuan total of 30,000 located across the nation and US capital Washington DC has recently doubled its ATM availability from 20 to 40 due to public demand.\nThere are reportedly six German banks currently trading cryptocurrency according to BaFin, although the banks haven’t as yet been named. It remains to be seen whether banks see enough customer demand to operate the service\nHowever, German stock exchanges are seriously looking at cryptocurrency options for the future. Deutsche Boerse, the owner of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, is evaluating whether to offer cryptocurrency products, according to Bloomberg. If this is the case, this will be the second German stock exchange to make announcements this year regarding a move towards the adoption of cryptocurrency related products, after Boerse Stuttgart Digital Adventures announced the release of its Bison app in April.\nThe post German Banks Can Offer ATMs Exchanging Bitcoin and Ether to Euro appeared first on BitcoinNews.com .

Intrinsic value can be loosely defined as the thing that makes an investment worthwhile. Investors are always on the lookout for intrinsic value in an investment because that is what ultimately gives it staying power.\nThe price of an investment can sometimes rise without intrinsic value because of momentum from other people buying the asset. Yet lacking the intrinsic value, the price will eventually crumble, or at least that’s what conceivably should happen. In the case of Bitcoin, people who fear that there is no intrinsic value liken it to a stock bubble, where prices are inflated with nothing concrete inside to hold them together.\nYet the argument against Bitcoin having intrinsic value seems to be a bit empty itself when exposed to further scrutiny. While Bitcoin would seem to have certain flaws as an investment and even as an alternative currency, there is still enough behind it to give it substantial weight as an investment.\nAs for investing in Bitcoin, you can do so on your own, or utilize the help of a trading robot such as Bitcoin Trader to get the job done for you. Taking a close examination of Bitcoin will show you that it has more intrinsic value than its detractors give it credit for possessing. IMAGE: PIXABAY 1. The Technology\nYou might think that Bitcoin lacks any physical characteristics, and therefore lacks intrinsic value. After all, it is essentially nothing more than computer code and math problems whipping through the digital sphere. But the technology behind it, known as the blockchain, has extreme utility in the lives of the people who use it, and that goes far beyond simply making digital transactions. The blockchain has already made such a dent on modern society that its absence would be felt if taken away. 2. The Specific Uses\nAs for the way that Bitcoin uses the blockchain, it makes a difference in the lives of its adopters. Think of how a small business that accepts Bitcoin can receive a payment in a fraction of the time it would take with a credit card. Or the way that two people can conduct business without having to worry about geographical borders or tariffs, bringing the world a little closer together in the process. There is value, for certain, in these activities. 3. What They’re Missing\nMany people who make this argument about Bitcoin are those who have likely never used it themselves. Without having the first-hand experience with it, they can’t possibly make any assumptions about its worth to those who do. If you haven’t used it, you should find out the experiences of those who must see if there is any intrinsic value to be had. This will help you make a clearer decision about its worth.\nIntrinsic value is indeed an important factor in the world of investing . Just don’t believe that Bitcoin doesn’t have any of that value without experiencing it for yourself.\n cryptocurrency- PIXABAY", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_(finance)", "https://cybermentors.org.uk/bitcoin-trader-review-can-profit-bitcoin/", "https://www.business.com/advice/answers/question/what-is-the-most-important-factor-in-an-investors/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "karthik krishnan", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T00:43:51.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d8ddb4e288635cb931d8e72d5b8dc1302062e417", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWc.JrPSmK6Q7C3nQMSu7mg-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin plays a vital role in the economy", "title_full": "Bitcoin plays a vital role in the economy", "published": "2018-06-05T23:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.017, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d8ddb4e288635cb931d8e72d5b8dc1302062e417", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWc.JrPSmK6Q7C3nQMSu7mg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aing", "published": "2018-06-05T23:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin plays a vital role in the economy", "text": "Quote: from: sham100899 on April 30, 2018, 08:35:24 AM Bitcoin opens many doors of new markets, which would affect the economy of a country, the reason why there are some countries who don't like bitcoin because cryptocurrency controlled by no one and because they don't get taxes.

if it is a big deal is just showing the lack of mathematical understanding of numbers.\nIn many cases, I'd say you're correct. In this case, price is in a tightening range for the past 4 months. As such, it will take increasingly small moves for a technical breakout to occur as time goes on.\nAs John Bollinger likes to say, \"it's time to pay attention.\" The 1-week BBs have not been this tight since April 2017 (i.e. directly before the last bubble). The next move should be big.\na very good point. but i say this is still bitcoin and small moves are pretty common and they may not trigger anything even if we are in such a range. for example currently this range is about $1000 at least. meaning upper part is at $8000 and lower is at about $7000. so going up from $7300 to $7600 isn't really going to change much.", "highlightText": "",

company Coinmint is moving ahead with plans to revamp Alcoa's 1,300 acre plot once used for aluminum smelting. Coinmint said Tuesday it would invest up to $700 million in its new location on the Canadian border, creating an estimated 150 jobs over the next 18 months. The company signed a lease with Alcoa on December 1 of last year when bitcoin was near $11,000 — since then it has dropped about 30 percent. Published 4:42 PM ET Tue, 5 June 2018 Updated 8:11 PM ET Tue, 5 June 2018 CNBC.com lars Hagbarg | AFP | Getty Images Two technicians work at a bitcoin mining facility in Quebec.\nDespite bitcoin's price decline this year, a cryptocurrency \"mining\" company is moving ahead with plans to repurpose a 1,300 acre plot once used by Alcoa for aluminum smelting.\nCoinmint said Tuesday it would invest up to $700 million in the upstate New York location, which it expects to be the biggest bitcoin mining center in the world. The project will create an estimated 150 jobs over the next 18 months.\nAfter Alcoa shuttered its aluminum smelting operation there four years ago, the company was looking for a tenant. Following some back and forth and a few months of discussions, Coinmint said it signed a 10 year lease with options to renew. show chapters 2:32 PM ET Fri, 16 March 2018 | 00:39\nSince they penned a deal, bitcoin prices have dropped about 30 percent and are down nearly 50 percent this year, according to data from CoinDesk.\n\"As long as bitcoin network exists we anticipate mining to be profitable,\" said Coinmint's Chief Technology Office Prieur Leary. \"We've developed a process to get an edge in the market.\"\nPart of that process was the move to Massena New York, just south of the Canadian border.\nThe town has access to clean and cheaper power alternatives like hydroelectric and wind. Leary pointed out that each computer used to \"mine\" generates 1400 watts — the same as one hairdryer. With hundreds of thousands of these hot machines operating at once, upstate New York's climate is ideal for reducing air-conditioning costs.\nCryptocurrency \"mining\" is essentially math done by high-powered computers. In order to trade bitcoin, transactions need to be verified through complex math equations, then and added to what's known as a \"distributed ledger.\" In return for solving equations \"miners\" receive bitcoin.\nOperations are already underway at the former Alcoa East Facility complex, and are projected to be at full capacity within a year. The 435 Megawatt mining center is expected to be the world's largest digital currency data processor, based on capacity, Coinmint said.\nMost of Coinmint's competitors are overseas. Bitmain is the leader in the industry, and raked in record profits as bitcoin skyrocketed to almost $20,000 last year. The Chinese company likely made as much $3 billion to $4 billion in operating profit in 2017, as much as chipmaker Nvidia did last year, according to Bernstein analysts estimates.\nCoinmint is looking to hire around-the-clock staff, and plans to tap the local community to hire staff from security personnel to electricians, to highly- trained IT staff.\n\"We in Massena, would like to welcome Coinmint to our town,\" Steve O'Shaughnessy, Massena Town Supervisor said in a statement Tuesday. \"The thought of 150 jobs and revitalization of the Alcoa East Facility is exciting and what we have been working for.

Photo: PTI Mumbai: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday questioned Raj Kundra, husband of actor Shilpa Shetty, in connection with a money laundering probe related to a bitcoin transactions case, officials said.\nThe businessman was summoned at the ED office in Mumbai and was asked questions about his involvement in the trade, termed as illegal by the government, they said. There are some instances of the case that are linked to Kundra and hence, he has been asked to record his statement, the officials said without elaborating.\nThe ED had earlier registered a criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against bitcoin-based investment website GainBitcoin, its founder Amit Bhardwaj and eight others. It is alleged that about 8,000 investors lost about Rs2,000 crore funds by transacting in this scheme.\nThe ED had filed its case based on an FIR of the Maharashtra Police in this case and the Pune Police arrested Bhardwaj and his brother Vivek from Delhi earlier. Bhardwaj reportedly was behind ventures like GainBitcoin, GBMiners, MCAP and GB21, and the investors were allegedly duped after transactions on these portals.\nThe central agency has expanded its probe into this case and is also investigating related bitcoin or cryptocurrency transactions that are under the scanner of other departments. It is alleged that Bhardwaj and his associates allegedly duped investors to the tune of Rs2,000 crore in Mumbai, Pune, Nanded, Kolhapur and other places in the state.\nLast year, finance minister Arun Jaitley had informed Parliament that there are no regulations governing virtual currencies in India and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has not given any licence to any entity/company to operate such currencies. The government had also cautioned investors to be wary of virtual currencies such as bitcoin, saying they are like Ponzi schemes with no legal tender and protection.\nFirst Published: Tue, Jun 05

Upadhyay Raj Kundra with his wife Shilpa Shetty. Photo: PTI\nMumbai: Businessman Raj Kundra was summoned on Tuesday by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for questioning on his alleged role in a bitcoin scam. It is however unclear at the moment whether Kundra, the husband of actress Shilpa Shetty, played a role or was a victim in the ₹2,000 crore scam, said an ED official.\n“Raj Kundra was called for questioning in a bitcoin scam, which the Thane crime branch is investigating. We are looking at the angle of whether there is any alleged money laundering in the scam,” said the ED official.\nTwo businessmen, Pune-based Amit Bharadwaj and his brother Vivek Bharadwaj who are directorsof GainBitcoin company, cheated more than 8,000 people through a crypto-currency scheme.\n“The two brothers duped investors by floating an illegal crypto-currency scheme by promising investors assured returns on their investments. The two were arrested by Pune police on 5 April,” said the ED official.\nThe ED had last month had registered a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act against GainBitcoin, Amit Bhardwaj and eight others. This was based on an FIR by Maharashtra police.\nThe investigation into the FIRfiled by the Maharashtra police is being led by the crime branch under the Maharashtra Public Interest Depositors Act, the Chit Funds Act, and sections of the Indian Penal Code for cheating and forgery.\n“ED has also expanded its probe and is looking at other similar websites that have floated a crypto-currency scheme,” said the ED official.\nMint had reported on 21 December that ED is examining bitcoin exchanges for money laundering and forex violations. The income tax department is also examining high networth individuals (HNIs) who invested in bitcoins and whether they have not paid related taxes.\nDuring the budget speech finance minister Arun Jaitley had said that bitcoins and cryptocurrencies are not legal tender. On 29 December, the government had warned people of the risk of investing in cryptocurrencies, which are not backed by government fiat, and likened them to ponzi schemes.

By: Express News Service | Mumbai | Updated: June 6, 2018 5:06:20 am Businessman Raj Kundra comes out of the ED office at Ballard Estate in Mumbai on Tuesday. (Source: Kevin DSouza)\nBusinessman and actor Shilpa Shetty’s husband Raj Kundra was on Tuesday questioned by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with the Rs 2,000-crore Bitcoin fraud case, in which the agency is probing Amit Bhardwaj of GainBitcoin company for allegedly duping more than 8,000 investors across the country.\nKundra arrived at the ED’s Mumbai office around 11.40 am and was questioned for more than eight hours. “Raj Kundra is not an investor who was duped by GainBitcoin. The ED is questioning him currently on his role in the alleged fraud,” an ED source said, refusing to share further details.\nBhardwaj, the mastermind of the alleged scam, was earlier arrested from the Delhi airport by the Pune police. Three cases of Bitcoin multi-level marketing (MLM) were registered against Bhardwaj and his firms in Pune — two at Nigdi and one at Dattawadi police stations.\n“The ED called me as a witness. There is an Amit Bhardwaj, who’s involved in some scam. He had purchased a poker team from our poker league but didn’t make payment, so we expelled his team. I’ve given my statement,” Kundra said while leaving the ED office around 10 pm.\nREAD | Thane Police busts Rs 500-crore cryptocurrency racket; one held\nKundra said that Bhardwaj wanted to pay for the poker team in Bitcoins which was not accepted. “We thought he is a respectable person so we alloted him a team. His contract was terminated after he failed to make the payments,” Kundra said.\nKundra is the co-owner of Match Indian Poker League, which was launched last year.\nREAD | Bitcoin scam: Probe spotlight on Nanded network of prime accused\nThe ED is probing Bhardwaj and some of his associates under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).\nAccording to investigations carried out by the Pune police, Bhardwaj had allegedly set up an elaborate MLM scam by luring investors to hand him Bitcoins for higher returns. Under the scheme, investors were asked to invest one Bitcoin for a 10 per cent return with the contract being valid for 18 months.\nBhardwaj also offered another plan where he promised to help investors mine their own Bitcoins. However, he never gave the promised returns and fled the country.

Then you have the bottom and a rise, market usually tries to trick us many times\nQuote: from: BitcoinNewsMagazine on Today at 03:57:47 AM Silver bugs never respect the lesson the Hunt brothers learned the hard way. If you want to diversify your portfolio buy gold. Silver bullion is a poor store of value and will remain so while gold is not.\nGold is isolated from direct factors of economic growth but silver is an industrial metal so I agree they are not twins, its a weak relation\nThe Hunt Brothers had a giant counter to their plans, a strong and capable Federal reserve. This is like the biggest most relevant point to knowing this history, compare Fed and Fiscal debt and perhaps trade balance to now. In the 1980's the Fed raised rates to 15%\nThats a giant return for simply holding the debt of the country you live in and pay taxes to. Its not a hard bet to just side with that, of course the FED got control. Silver was not in use enough to be a challenger plus the Saudis do sell oil in dollars, thats a big backing plus everyone else.\nSo the situation now is the FED cannot ever raise rates this high. The average term of debt owed over 20 trillion by government is just 4 years. Raising rates this high would mean every cent spent in the white house budget would be interest payments. Its an insolvent situation, same deal as you read with Greek or similar spikes.\nWhat is going to happen this time is the debt is repaid with newly printed money. The path of least resistance, I dont have to be anti government, anti anyone this is just the gravity of the situation, water rolls down hill and the economy is going to be shaped by the simple dynamic of too much debt and a weak Fed policy vs inflation.\nKnowing history is great indicator to the future but various factors have developed further since then. So far as I know people expect a strong Fed to control the situation just like previously but its impossible when there is a fiscal deficit and no possible surplus to repay debt.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T20:48:41.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "caacc3ab9921cd3cdf3b2dbc74e10c92a57b18f8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz6cmlHHcdwcxGO6BBrrMJLI-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-05T23:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "caacc3ab9921cd3cdf3b2dbc74e10c92a57b18f8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz6cmlHHcdwcxGO6BBrrMJLI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-05T23:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ June 5, 2018 NEWS Should More Black-owned Businesses Start Accepting Bitcoin ?

Slovenia has announced that its largest shopping center — coincidentally known as BTC City — will transform into a complete bitcoin city , in which every store and venture will accept cryptocurrency and operate via blockchain technology.\nThe complex, located in the country's capital of Ljubljana, stretches over 1,558,398 square feet and contains over 500 retail stores. Prime Minister Miro Cerar recently visited the shopping center, where he was treated to a cup of coffee (purchased with cryptocurrency by State Secretary Tadej Slapnik). Details regarding the center's newfound approach to bitcoin are being headed by fintech startup Eligma.\n\"The purpose of his visit was to open the Beyond 4.0 international conference, dedicated to digital society and blockchain, and to get acquainted with BTC City's strategy to become a Bitcoin City,\" said BTC City representatives.\nBTC City initially began in 1954 as a warehouse and logistics center.

With the rise of bitcoin as a permissionless, decentralized alternative to national currencies, have the Swiss been forced to rethink what money really is?\nThe rise in the popularity and use of bitcoin has been phenomenal since 2009, in the process crossing major milestones and providing a safe haven for those in developing economies, such as Argentina and Venezuela. The grassroots movement emerged out of disdain of the financial sector, as Satoshi Nakamoto engraved into the first Bitcoin block a headline from The Times , \"Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\"\nThe very first Bitcoin block contains an important implicit message from Satoshi . Source: Quora\nIn an attempt to revamp the entire financial system, Bitcoin was created, to take power out of the banker's hands and into the people's. How far the movement has achieved this aim is still up for debate, but it has undoubtedly made significant progress, with remittances companies to loan providers utilizing the world's favorite digital asset.\nIn response to the fractional banking system which has been prevalent for over 100 years, Bitcoin was created as a full reserve system and enforces a rules-based monetary policy so that banks could not bring more bitcoin into existence by extending credit.\nBitcoin-friendly Switzerland Considers Sovereign Money System In the author's opinion, the Swiss referendum is likely to be partially related to the massive exposure bitcoin gained toward the end of 2017, and will see their citizens vote on whether Switzerland should move to a sovereign money system, also known as \"Vollgeld.\" Such a system will make it more difficult for banks to extend credit and enlarge the money supply, making the Swiss National Bank (SNB) the only source of new money. Banks would only be able to lend from the savings that have stored already.\nA successful \"Yes\" vote could later materialize into something more significant regarding bitcoin, such as an announcement of the SNB that it is holding the cryptocurrency as part of its foreign reserves. Either way, the vote goes to show the Swiss are scrutinizing the financial system, and rightly so, and the road could eventually lead to bitcoin.\nSwitzerland has been a hotbed for bitcoin and cryptocurrency, with one of the most accommodative regulatory environments in the world. For instance, the Swiss railway has dozens of bitcoin ATMs integrated into the ticket machines around the country, and in July 2017, the first Swiss bank took the plunge into crypto by offering bitcoin storage and allowing their customers to buy the cryptocurrency.\nAnalysts' Thoughts on the Referendum According to Reuters , opinion polls show that the referendum vote is undecided, with a third of Swiss citizens planning to vote \"Yes\" and repeal the powers of banks to create money, while around ten percent remain undecided. The plan for a sovereign money system was labeled a \"dangerous cocktail\" by SNB Governor Thomas Jordan.\nIf the referendum is passed, advocates claim it will lead to a more stable and sound financial system and reduce the frequency of financial crises, whereas critics state that it would hamper the SNB's ability to intervene in currency markets, spark greater volatility in the Swiss Franc and adversely affect the profits of banks such as UBS and Credit Suisse.\nThe move could also reduce the need for bitcoin somewhat, as the exit from a fractional reserve system may be considered in other countries as well, but the cryptocurrency would still be valued as a permissionless, censorship-free system.\nNeil Weller, a currency strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, said , \"This kind of a banking system hasn't been seen for a long time. The referendum would also unleash a lot of uncertainty into Swiss assets, including equity and bonds.\"\nPaul Wetterwald, the chief economist at Indosuez Wealth Management, said on June 1, \"Generally speaking, the strength of the currency reflects the strength of the economy and the trust shown by the market (and its) people. Ironically, if accepted, the Initiative may help the SNB to weaken the franc by diminishing Switzerland's safe-haven status.\"\nWhile the vote may not pass due to the anticipated adverse impacts on the Swiss economy, it does show that the Swiss are beginning to question the current monetary system, which is no doubt positive for bitcoin in the long run.\nThe post Has the Rise of Bitcoin Forced the Swiss to Rethink Money? appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "the times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "argentina", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T22:52:37.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4304c2973cf36bd7f473957f8f79eb24355ce2cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWlAO5eXvV0jd2Unsnu9Oc5R2u9pMpDcognPaAEqUkcF5S2xGPjlNPNHmLSg_.fTHvl7G3vGRhbUbEP7s_KvdKAiyJII6q55.6GJ5vS8FfRaoXfsc0HehQR", "site_full": "news.bitcoin-babe.com", "site": "bitcoin-babe.com", "site_section": "http://news.bitcoin-babe.com/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Slovenia Plays Host to the World’s First “Bitcoin City”", "title_full": "Slovenia Plays Host to the World’s First “Bitcoin City”", "published": "2018-06-05T22:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4304c2973cf36bd7f473957f8f79eb24355ce2cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWlAO5eXvV0jd2Unsnu9Oc5R2u9pMpDcognPaAEqUkcF5S2xGPjlNPNHmLSg_.fTHvl7G3vGRhbUbEP7s_KvdKAiyJII6q55.6GJ5vS8FfRaoXfsc0HehQR", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoinbabeau", "published": "2018-06-05T22:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Slovenia Plays Host to the World’s First “Bitcoin City”", "text": "\nAmong the smallest nations in the EU can also have some of the biggest ambitions. Slovenia has announced its biggest shopping centre, coincidentally known as BTC City, will transform into a comprehensive bitcoin town, wherein each store and venture will probably accept cryptocurrency and function through blockchain technology. The complex, based in the nation’s capital of Ljubljana, extends over 1, 558, 398 sq legs and comprises over 500 retail stores. Prime Minister Miro Cerar lately visited the shopping centre, where he was treated to a cup of coffee. Details concerning the center’s newfound strategy to bitcoin are being headed by fintech startup Eligma.\nThe purpose of his visit was to start the Beyond 4.0 international conference, devoted to digital society and blockchain, and to get acquainted with BTC City’s strategy to become a Bitcoin City, said BTC City representatives. BTC City first started in 1954 as a warehouse and logistics centre. More warehouses have been added to the complicated with time, and, by 1990, it’d transformed to a commercial shopping stadium. BTC City presently plays host to many travel and tourism ventures such as a luxury resort and a casino, a multiplex cinema, a waterpark and the Crystal Palace office park, home to Slovenia’s greatest building.\nExecutives of BTC City say they are hoping that Bitcoin City will give rise to new companies that push the cryptocurrency distance toward mainstream territory and result in further blockchain developments. Bitcoin City will make an open society that will allow users to pursue their assignments in addition to develop their business environment in line with their wishes, demands and operating policies, they said. Eligma’s cryptocurrency transaction system Elipay is being set up in many stores. Situated through the premises are also a few one way cryptocurrency ATMs, with the Blockchain Think Tank and what executives predict the largest crypto mining rig in Slovenia. Representatives further remarked, The growth of BTC City to a bitcoin town is a significant step towards the realization of BTC’s openness oriented approach, supplying its clients and business partners with both freedom and options regarding their purchases with new kinds of payment.\nSources:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "miro cerar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc city", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "slovenia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ljubljana", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T23:20:33.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1a777c5f85b1ee79214c2bba54d8edd36d0dd754", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZxnJLHHfWfOCLRJm0iYTH5OSSsU1_3ya.QSYiLPdvDxlcsQ80hchfAwOuFQlSa1P_m.tIJBuSpRJuWDN9ejoqd", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : btc", "title": "Debate with a Bitcoin Core developer... : btc", "title_full": "Debate with a Bitcoin Core developer... : btc", "published": "2018-06-05T22:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.174, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1a777c5f85b1ee79214c2bba54d8edd36d0dd754", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZxnJLHHfWfOCLRJm0iYTH5OSSsU1_3ya.QSYiLPdvDxlcsQ80hchfAwOuFQlSa1P_m.tIJBuSpRJuWDN9ejoqd", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MatthewDavis72", "published": "2018-06-05T22:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Debate with a Bitcoin Core developer... : btc", "text": "submitted by /u/MatthewDavis72\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T18:17:42.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a0aa3a10293fd2c80e4ed6057163ae9b01d2b60e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_DHA11VrlMy6owukzQcBwIUnruDV.Dmv6eZgipm0gOIDk6fkq7V6.MpBA5byelMJYXWepEBz5DUjgkxekuHdokqj3so0GZdLJAkXPEzHMg8b2euehjn0O", "site_full": "bitcoinmovement.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinmovement.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "#Bitcoinmovement - The hub of Bitcoin and Crypto media", "title": "📜 BitMEX: Bitcoin too Difficult for Money Laundering, Property Better", "title_full": "📜 BitMEX: Bitcoin too Difficult for Money Laundering, Property Better", "published": "2018-06-05T22:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a0aa3a10293fd2c80e4ed6057163ae9b01d2b60e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_DHA11VrlMy6owukzQcBwIUnruDV.Dmv6eZgipm0gOIDk6fkq7V6.MpBA5byelMJYXWepEBz5DUjgkxekuHdokqj3so0GZdLJAkXPEzHMg8b2euehjn0O", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jermaine Washington (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-05T22:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "📜 BitMEX: Bitcoin too Difficult for Money Laundering, Property Better", "text": "\nDaily Newsletter 05/06/18\nBitMEX: Bitcoin too Difficult for Money Laundering, Property Better https://www.bitmex.com/register/lNDD0w\nBitMEX goes on an all out brawl against the common association between Bitcoin and money laundering, looking into scenarios that commonly cross launderers' eyes.\nREAD STORY >>\nTron Technical Analysis: (TRX/BTC) Harmonic Gartley Pattern Idea\nNothing in this article is to be construed as investment advice.

Slovenia has announced that its largest shopping center — coincidentally known as BTC City — will transform into a complete bitcoin city , in which every store and venture will accept cryptocurrency and operate via blockchain technology.\nThe complex, located in the country’s capital of Ljubljana, stretches over 1,558,398 square feet and contains over 500 retail stores. Prime Minister Miro Cerar recently visited the shopping center, where he was treated to a cup of coffee (purchased with cryptocurrency by State Secretary Tadej Slapnik). Details regarding the center’s newfound approach to bitcoin are being headed by fintech startup Eligma.\n“The purpose of his visit was to open the Beyond 4.0 international conference, dedicated to digital society and blockchain, and to get acquainted with BTC City’s strategy to become a Bitcoin City,” said BTC City representatives.\nBTC City initially began in 1954 as a warehouse and logistics center. More warehouses were added to the complex over time, and, by 1990, it had transformed into a commercial shopping arena. BTC City presently plays host to several travel and tourism ventures including a luxury hotel and casino, a multiplex cinema, a waterpark and the Crystal Palace office park — home to Slovenia’s tallest building.\nExecutives of BTC City say they’re hoping Bitcoin City will give rise to new businesses that push the cryptocurrency space toward mainstream territory and lead to further blockchain developments.\n“Bitcoin City will create an open society which will enable users to pursue their missions as well as develop their business environments in line with their wishes, needs and operating policies,” they said.\nEligma’s cryptocurrency transaction system Elipay is being installed in several stores.
