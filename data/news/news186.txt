But some influential investors and business leaders argue that investing in digital currencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) is a dangerous game. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin a “fraud” and later said he isn’t interested in the subject .\nWarren Buffett recently told Liz Claman on FOX Business that bitcoin has “produced nothing.” His longtime business partner, Charlie Munger, has called bitcoin “rat poison” and a “turd.”\nShiller, a Nobel-winning economist known for predicting the housing crisis and dot-com bubble, said much of cryptocurrencies’ appeal is driven by the mysteriousness that surrounds them.\n“Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work. That mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal,” Shiller wrote for Project Syndicate. “None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a compelling story may not be enough.”\nShiller compared the emergence of cryptocurrencies with past experiments such as “time money.” In the 19th century, Josiah Warner opened the “Cincinnati Time Store,” which sold goods in units of hours of work, using “labor notes” as paper money. The store closed three years after it opened. A similar effort by the “father of socialism,” Robert Owen, also failed.\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels pushed for a “communistic abolition of buying and selling,” although no Communist state ever eliminated money, Shiller wrote. In the 1930s, a radical movement aimed to replace the gold-backed dollar with a measure of energy, but the Technocracy fad was short-lived. The economist John Pease Norton argued in 1932 for a dollar backed by electricity. That effort also gained little traction.\nShiller said these monetary innovations were connected to “a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society.” Likewise, cryptocurrencies “are a statement of faith in a new community of entrepreneurial cosmopolitans who hold themselves above national governments,” he wrote.\nRelated Articles\nChina reduces auto import duties effective July 1 following pledges to buy more U.S. goods, ease controls on industry Former Malaysian leader Najib grilled by anti-graft agency Former Malaysian leader Najib grilled by anti-graft agency", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2018/05/21/former-malaysian-pm-najib-questioned-by-anti-graft-agency.html", "https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/former-malaysian-leader-najib-grilled-by-anti-graft-agency", "http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/jpmorgan-chase-ceo-jamie-dimon-regrets-saying-bitcoin-is-a-fraud-but-still-isnt-interested-in-it&quot;", "http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/cryptocurrencies-scientific-narrative-by-robert-j--shiller-2018-05", "http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2018/05/22/china-reduces-auto-import-duties-effective-july-1-following-pledges-to-buy-more-u-s-goods-ease-controls-on-industry.html", "http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/jpmorgan-chase-ceo-jamie-dimon-regrets-saying-bitcoin-is-a-fraud-but-still-isnt-interested-in-it", "http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/bitcoin-is-rat-poison-berkshires-charlie-munger-says", "http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/bitcoin-is-rat-poison-berkshires-charlie-munger-says&quot;", "http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/cryptocurrencies-scientific-narrative-by-robert-j--shiller-2018-05&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert shiller bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shiller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie dimon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert shiller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie munger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liz claman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fox business", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jpmorgan chase", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T12:01:38.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6c7482e70e7d5b908bc0cc772de9f66520a2888e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRKfLN4O0mBUSEGVdgvjm0s-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why do so many people believe in Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why do so many people believe in Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-22T07:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.189, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6c7482e70e7d5b908bc0cc772de9f66520a2888e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRKfLN4O0mBUSEGVdgvjm0s-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Question123", "published": "2018-05-22T07:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why do so many people believe in Bitcoin?", "text": "Until now even the price of the bitcoin are decrease compared to the price last few months many peoplr are still believe bitcoin and even me because if you invested to bitcoin you can earn more profit or money.

Bitex Chief Marking Officer Manuel Beaudroit told CoinDesk the startup believes that this marks the very first time an internal bank has adopted a bitcoin for cross border payments. In announcements, Jose Dakak, chief shareholder of Masventas, credited the move to a broader drive from the lender to boost its electronic, smartphone based services, as well as to decrease the bank’s cost of support.\nAmong action was to contract Bitex as a strategic partner in the execution of the Bitex platform for payments and collections operations for our customers overseas, he explained. While no real world transactions have been established yet, the lender will soon use bitcoin for real client transactions, Beaudroit explained. He told CoinDesk: The clients will ask the bank to do an international payment, and the lender utilizes Bitex as a provider. For the consumer, it is transparent, they do not touch, they do not see the bitcoin. We’re a provider for them, plus they aren’t touching bitcoin.

Mining them is 60 percent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers.Why, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world’s biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date? Canaan - Investors - Bitcoin - Company - Chip Canaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.“Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public. Offering - Canaan - World - Bitcoin - Mining The offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world’s second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment.The Beijing-based company’s profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin’s soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand. Effects - Bitcoin - Volatility - Mining - Costs But the effects of bitcoin’s volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong’s central business district, where the IPO has been filed.Businesses selling mining rigs there said demand – especially for high-end machines – was limping along. Alvin - Wong - Rig - Hong - Kong Alvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit.“Since we weren’t selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,” said Wong, a...

rallied in the past few hours but also hit resistance on its channel. If this continues to keep gains in check, bitcoin could still resume the selloff to the support areas marked. Using the Fib extension tool shows the potential downside targets in the short-term. Bitcoin price might still resume its downtrend as the top of its descending channel is keeping gains in check.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside. In other words, the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse.\nHowever, an upward crossover appears to be materializing and if so, bitcoin price might still be able to break past the channel top. In particular, a move past the swing high around $8,600 could confirm that buyers have the upper hand.\nRSI is dipping into oversold territory to show that sellers are exhausted and may let buyers take over. Stochastic still seems to have some room to fall, so bitcoin price might follow suit.\nThe nearest support area is at the 38.2% extension or $8,039 level at the mid-channel area of interest. The 50% extension is at $7,855 and the 61.8% extension is at the swing low or $7,671. Stronger selling pressure could take it down to the 78.6% extension at $7,410 or the channel support. The full extension is located at $7,077.4.\nBTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nA rebound in risk-taking paved the way for some bitcoin price gains after a trade truce between the US and China was announced. This supported commodities, equities, and other riskier assets like cryptocurrencies versus the dollar.\nThe main event for the US dollar is the release of the FOMC minutes this week as this could clarify tightening expectations. Hawkish remarks could mean more dollar gains versus bitcoin while cautious ones could allow the cryptocurrency to advance.\nThere have been no major headlines pertaining to bitcoin, so investors could keep holding out and staying cautious while waiting for more developments.\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Bears Might Not Be Done Yet appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T07:04:35.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "99de0ff6c3cfbe72c5a43d5a15d93d77eef85dde", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCA3M_123tl5.wuprp7KtCn7AAHEh6.0Zlo.ep_.NA8ZWQzgPNdnysMGeXwQAP5HaqOZo01L.eaw0I1Ym47CBTpIO9twSxhZ0KBfkjhRiQXubIMKiRjF3pPx", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "CryptoCurrencies", "title": "Pullback Over?

Law enforcement agencies often see them as a criminal tool used to buy drugs, guns or other illegal items ; financial regulatory bodies can’t decide whether to classify them a security; and a handful of states have proposed legislation that would allow their constituents to pay their taxes with them.\nBut this regulatory uncertainty hasn’t stopped Brian Forde, a California Democrat running for the US House of Representatives, from accepting campaign donations in Bitcoin in the lead up to the 2018 elections. Forde’s embrace of Bitcoin makes sense: He was a senior advisor to the Obama administration on cryptocurrencies and other digital technologies, and headed up MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.\nIn 2014, the Federal Election Commission ruled it was okay for political action committees to accept donations in Bitcoin . Nevertheless, Dave Min, another Democrat vying for the same congressional seat, picked up on Forde’s crypto affiliations and used them as the basis for an attack ad. It is likely the first political ad in the US to mention Bitcoin.\nIn a copy of the ad provided to Motherboard by the Forde campaign, Forde’s face is superimposed over some footage of a stereotypical hacker typing on screens of streaming green code.

The BTC\\/USD pair traded as low as $7,915 before starting an upside move. It gained traction and moved above the $8,000, $8,200 and $8,400 resistance levels. The upside move was positive since there was a close above the $8,400 pivot level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. \\n\nBTC buyers got in control and pushed the price above the last swing high of $8,506. It opened the doors for more gains and it seems like the price may well test the 1.236 Fib extension level of the last decline from the $8,506 high to $7,915 low. At the moment, the price is consolidating gains above the $8,400 level. There is also a significant ascending channel formed with support at $8,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC\\/USD pair. Should the price gain bullish momentum, it could easily break the $8,600 resistance to test the 1.618 Fib extension level of the last decline from the $8,506 high to $7,915 low at $8,870. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the price remains well supported above the $8,400 level.

For a large financial institution such as ICE or Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), figuring out how to develop a cryptocurrency trading platform is a potentially complicated analysis that begins with the question of whether or not a cryptocurrency is a security. If a cryptocurrency is deemed a security by the Howey test , “there are a lot more regulatory requirements.” While people agree that the Howey test can act as the ultimate clarifier of which cryptocurrency is a security and which is not; the distinction is also important for another reason. Ultimately, the Howey test gives guidance on which regulatory agency polices which cryptocurrency. At this point, securities fall under the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) jurisdiction. Non-security cryptocurrencies or commodities are in the realm of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The distinction is important because each agency has taken a different approach to policing cryptocurrency. The SEC has gone after “ low-hanging fruit .” These are the “ pump-and-dump ” ICOs that are scams or otherwise illegitimate in their offerings to investors. And, at least with ICOs, both agencies appeared to be on the same page in January 2018. And just last week I learned that the SEC has created a fake ICO, whose token is being used as a way to demonstrate potential signs of fraud in ICOs to cryptocurrency investors. Outside of the SEC’s scam scrubbing, the regulator’s behavior that is not exactly encouraging for private sector participants:The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) say they want to have an active dialogue with industry participants to understand the latest trends and developments. Unfortunately, we see a lot of regulators initiating those conversations with industry players by way of subpoena. Whenever you receive a subpoena from a regulator, you have to be concerned that it could be a lead-in to an enforcement action. This dynamic doesn’t exactly promote a free and healthy exchange of ideas. In late April, SEC Chairman Clayton said Bitcoin is not a security, and because Bitcoin will not likely be classified as a security, larger financial institutions like CME, CBOE, Goldman Sachs and now ICE are able to move forward with giving their clients exposure. Not being a security also means that the CFTC is the federal agency that most often acts as a watchdog over Bitcoin transactions. The Big Q: How will the CFTC will handle bad actors and fraud in bitcoin transactions? The Big A: That is still being debated. Outside of cryptocurrencies, the CFTC’s prerogative to cut down on fraud and market manipulation. An underlying concern of the CFTC is that there are a number of people who can fairly easily impact prices with their trading. It makes it very difficult to regulate markets,but innovation is happening in futures and derivatives markets.” If reports that ICE is considering using a model of trading Bitcoin with swap contracts, this type of trading would remain under the regulatory realm of the CFTC. Swaps are a type of derivative contract where 2 parties trade based on a notional principal amount. Generally, 1 of these amounts is fixed, while the other is variable, commonly based on an interest rate, floating currency exchange rate or index price. Swaps do not normally trade on exchanges but instead are over-the-counter contracts between different organizations. So, that suggests that ICE would likely use an interest rate swap, though they are most likely still figuring out what they will pin Bitcoin prices to. Using the swap mechanism allows ICE to position themselves squarely under CFTC regulations, but getting that regulatory certainty looks like it will come at the cost of speed. One of the ideas behind Bitcoin and other digital currencies that made them so attractive as a concept was the idea that market participants could securely transact with one another almost instantly, without the need for intermediaries. But, if you have to create a swap product with a 1-day settlement frame to get regulatory clarity, then you lose a lot of what made digital currencies attractive in the 1st place. Lots of questions arise from that issue. A Key reason why regulators have not moved more quickly to establish clear law around Bitcoin is that there remains debate and uncertainty about regulators, the CFTC in particular, to police the markets. The implications of the rise in Bitcoin-based swap contracts also means that the instantaneous transaction, so highly placed in the early value of Bitcoin, might over for mainstream investors to gain less-risky exposure. Lots of investors are weighing the risk of maybe not getting their money back when they need to unwind a trade. Traders who don’t want to deal with this will opt-into these trading platforms run by accredited institutional investors. There is clearly more risk in operating on less regulated and decentralized exchanges. There may well be more lucrative opportunities as well, but there are all sorts of risks that a lot of traders want to avoid. Bitcoin futures have garnered the attention of regulators and that will inevitably alter the sector, in what way is still an open question. Weighing the risks of unregulated and decentralized exchanges draws back to the fundamental conflict that has been revolving around the cryptocurrency space since the Bitcoin white paper was published. i Big Q2: Will Bitcoin remain truly decentralized or will the desire to hedge against risk lead the majority of traders to accredited and regulated institutions? Big A2: For many who are invested in Bitcoin, not just for profit, but also ideological reasons, the answer appears obvious. Yet whether these early BTC adopters of a movement or no more than fringe factions will be decided by the market. Another factor in ICE and other market institutions hopping into Bitcoin trading is an increase in the space’s technological innovation brought by increased competition. The involvement of big financial players will affect the market, so established cryptocurrency exchanges are optimistic about the future. The director of marketing at the Hong Kong –based cryptocurrency exchange, BTCC, believes that exchanges like BTCC “will remain the go-to cryptocurrency market for retail clients for the foreseeable future.” “We specifically designed our USD exchange to be accessible, drawing on our 7 years’ experience operating the longest-running bitcoin exchange to create an effortless crypto trading experience. “ He also pointed out that many legacy financial exchanges will have “high barriers of entry and inaccessible or confusing user interfaces.” Citing “real-person 24/7 customer support and deposit options such as credit cards,” he believes that cryptocurrency exchanges will continue to create value that institutional exchanges are unable to offer. “In addition, legacy fiat exchanges are geographically bound, while exchanges like BTCC offer customers worldwide easy access to BTC/USD trading.” Further, there are many regulatory hurdles for institutional exchanges, many of which have not yet been created. For instance Even if an exchange is authorized, investment companies and broker dealers and issuers of ICOs must become accredited before they can move forward. The ICE Group indicated that plans for such a platform could dissolve at anytime based on the unregulated changes in cryptocurrency market. The CEO of NASDAQ (NASDAQ:NDAQ) Adena Friedman said that Nasdaq would be open for Bitcoin trading when “people are ready for a more regulated market.” Currently, Bitcoin is trading at: 8,303.4854, -216.50, or -2.54%, a s of 4:14a BST, the market is open Stay tuned…\nICE (NYSE:ICE) and the Future of Bitcoin Trading added by Paul Ebeling on May 21, 2018", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp", "https://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "https://www.addthis.com/help/api-spec", "https://www.howeycoins.com/index.html#about", "https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alert-public-companies-making-ico-related", "https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTCUSD%3DX?p=BTCUSD%3DX", "https://exchange.btcc.com/", "http://www.g-bit.io/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "howey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intercontinental exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T08:17:26.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1b5233e7202d1fd3749f9990e7d2a426f20d118a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUDcXZCDLH5FUFhrFF.dmRHdnF9UMhiKRXPcBvAOCsvFxXQa9AisipDwcsgwIgP_dqD_JWP_NayyvQ6AsMAF7lc", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/daily-forex", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Daily Forex - Barchart.com", "title": "BTC\\/USD \\n\\n Bitcoin markets rallied slightly dur", "title_full": "BTC\\/USD \\n\\n Bitcoin markets rallied slightly dur", "published": "2018-05-22T06:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.053, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b5233e7202d1fd3749f9990e7d2a426f20d118a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUDcXZCDLH5FUFhrFF.dmRHdnF9UMhiKRXPcBvAOCsvFxXQa9AisipDwcsgwIgP_dqD_JWP_NayyvQ6AsMAF7lc", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Christopher Lewis", "published": "2018-05-22T06:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "BTC\\/USD \\n\\n Bitcoin markets rallied slightly dur", "text": "BTC\\/USD \\n\\n\nBitcoin markets rallied slightly during the Friday session, bouncing from the $8000 level, which of course has been an area that has been supportive. The market looks likely to recognize this area at short-term support, but quite frankly if we rollover and break below the $8000 level, we could unwind to the $7000 level rather quickly. If we bounce from here will probably go looking towards the $9000 level above, which has been resistance more than once. Bitcoin continues to struggle overall, and I suspect that given enough time we will go looking towards the $7000 level underneath, an area that has been very important more than once. Adding more pressure to this market is that the US dollar has strengthened as of late, and of course crypto currencies have been less than impressive. I think there is too much resistance above to see a significant break out in the short term. \\n\\n\n\\n\\n BTC\\/JPY \\n\\n\nBitcoin rallied slightly against the Japanese yen as well but continues to look very suspicious to say the least. If we can break down below the ¥900,000 level, it’s likely that we will continue to go lower, aiming for the ¥800,000 level, and then the ¥700,000 level which is the bottom of the overall consolidation. If we do rally from here, I anticipate that the ¥1 million level could be a bit of trouble as well, extending to the ¥1.1 million level. Break above there should send the market towards the ¥1.25 million level. This is a market that is very volatile, so if you are planning on buying bitcoin against the Japanese yen, perhaps you need to see some type of pullback to offer a bit more value to get involved as you will almost certainly have to ride the move through a lot of noise. \\n\\n\n\\n\nOriginal Source DailyForex provides daily fundamental and technical analysis and signals for those looking to trade based on trends in the currency markets.

are worth less than half of what they were in December. Mining them is 60 percent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers.\nWhy, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world’s biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date?\nCanaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.\nTheir customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,â€ said one of the sources.Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public.\nThe offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world’s second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment.

BTC\\/USD could extend the current move above the $8.650 and $8,800 resistance levels. \\n Bitcoin Price Analysis (BTC\\/USD) \\n\nAfter a spike below the $8,000 level, bitcoin price found a strong buying interest against the US Dollar. The BTC\\/USD pair traded as low as $7,915 before starting an upside move. It gained traction and moved above the $8,000, $8,200 and $8,400 resistance levels. The upside move was positive since there was a close above the $8,400 pivot level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. \\n\nBTC buyers got in control and pushed the price above the last swing high of $8,506. It opened the doors for more gains and it seems like the price may well test the 1.236 Fib extension level of the last decline from the $8,506 high to $7,915 low. At the moment, the price is consolidating gains above the $8,400 level. There is also a significant ascending channel formed with support at $8,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC\\/USD pair. Should the price gain bullish momentum, it could easily break the $8,600 resistance to test the 1.618 Fib extension level of the last decline from the $8,506 high to $7,915 low at $8,870. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the price remains well supported above the $8,400 level. A downside break below $8,400 may well call for a short-term reversal of the current trend. \\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\n\nHourly MACD \\u2013 The MACD for BTC\\/USD is slightly in the bearish zone. \\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \\u2013 The RSI is moving lower towards the 50 level. \\n\nMajor Support Level \\u2013 $8,400 \\n\nMajor Resistance Level \\u2013 $8,650 \\n\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC\\/USD\\u2019s Bullish Scenario ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T22:03:40.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4e221054e2cab1387eae44d96e3258bbc212bfca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSbadRCM1Bf4fWWU9ZaiijmTUEr.4c.q9Iei8GEPtIxyC0oQi3XTYqV7fxnWSlCRFadv60pIuH8lm", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "As bitcoin world wobbles, mining rig company plans $2 billion IPO", "title_full": "As bitcoin world wobbles, mining rig company plans $2 billion IPO", "published": "2018-05-22T06:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4e221054e2cab1387eae44d96e3258bbc212bfca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSbadRCM1Bf4fWWU9ZaiijmTUEr.4c.q9Iei8GEPtIxyC0oQi3XTYqV7fxnWSlCRFadv60pIuH8lm", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-22T06:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "As bitcoin world wobbles, mining rig company plans $2 billion IPO", "text": "As bitcoin world wobbles, mining rig company plans $2 billion IPO\nAs bitcoin world wobbles, mining rig company plans $2 billion IPO Reuters Full coverage Google ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ipo reuters full", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T06:00:56.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c46137738343df8e446b37aab7bf837eb554d636", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUtSf_Ar24.Yjuicx7PauqgaPXQSz9pMUPBq9PJ6blojboyOeouX66FBABeCFffflboEh1f17Vceq1RUVLvlZDg8uo8tbbPcbvCBcRbbQYI5XxyQC12o14J", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/cryptocurrency-news", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency News - Barchart.com", "title": "If Bitcoin were a country, it would be the 40th l", "title_full": "If Bitcoin were a country, it would be the 40th l", "published": "2018-05-22T05:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c46137738343df8e446b37aab7bf837eb554d636", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUtSf_Ar24.Yjuicx7PauqgaPXQSz9pMUPBq9PJ6blojboyOeouX66FBABeCFffflboEh1f17Vceq1RUVLvlZDg8uo8tbbPcbvCBcRbbQYI5XxyQC12o14J", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "timcopeland", "published": "2018-05-22T05:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "If Bitcoin were a country, it would be the 40th l", "text": "If Bitcoin were a country, it would be the 40th largest consumer of electricity in the world. A new research paper has highlighted the growing problem as major cryptocurrencies seek to solve it. \\n Bitcoin’s Energy Crisis Explored \\n\nAccording to the figures, the amount of energy used for each transaction could run a dishwasher for a year. \\n\nAlex de Quote: : “With the Bitcoin network processing just 200,000 transactions per day, this means that the average electricity consumed per transaction equals at least 300 kWh, and could exceed 900 kWh per transaction by the end of 2018.” This doesn’t mean that Bitcoin transactions couldn’t be processed without high amounts of energy, it’s just that there are a lot of miners. Currently , miners earn about $100 per transaction. \\n\nDigiconomist estimates the consumption of electricity by Bitcoin Miners in its Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index (BEXI). According to its data, Bitcoin uses 67.91 TWh annually which is just greater than Chile, ranked 40th in the world at 66 TWh. They estimate that the amount of electricity used per transaction is higher at 929 kWh which would be the equivalent of running three dishwashers for a year. The main issue is that the figures are rising at a much steeper rate and have been since September 2017. \\n\n\\n\nBEXI has to work backwards to calculate the energy used. It starts with how much money the miners are making and works out how much they probably spend on electricity. Then they consider the price of electricity and estimate how much is used. It does rely on several assumptions but it would be much harder to contact all Bitcoin miners and ask how much electricity they use. \\n Will the Lightning Network Help? \\n\nThe Lightning Network will take Bitcoin transactions off-chain by setting up channels between users. Transactions between them will occur and only be recorded on the blockchain when the channel is closed. This will reduce the number of transactions that nodes will have to confirm and in doing so, will reduce the energy required for maintaining the network. \\n\nHowever, the majority of electricity used is for Bitcoin mining where computers generate hashes that fulfil a set of criteria. Reducing the number of transactions on the blockchain is unlikely to affect how many miners there are. Bitcoin transactions have halved since December but the mining difficulty has doubled , indicating there is twice as much mining equipment being used. This means that the Lightning Network will only be able to solve some of the problem. \\n\nIn reality, the best bet for Bitcoin, using Proof-of-Work, is using renewable energy, as highlighted in a response to the paper. The International Energy Agency said that renewable energy is set to grow 40% by 2022 and highlighted that renewables are dominant in new energy sources being created. Iceland has already shown how it can work as it runs on 100% renewable energy. In essence, renewable electricity allows the Bitcoin Network to run without changing its underlying structure. \\n\nOther ways of solving the problem include moving to Proof-of-Stake as Ethereum is doing. Digiconomist estimate that Ethereum uses about a third of the amount of electricity used to mine Bitcoin. NewsBTC reported on the recent publication of the code for Casper. The move is likely to reduce electricity usage significantly, but the question is whether or not the network will remain secure. \\n Featured image from Shutterstock. \\n\nThe post How Will Bitcoin Solve Its Energy Consumption Problem? appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex de quote", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "digiconomist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin miners", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chile", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T22:17:00.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f67e7e2a282a3113899180674680962d6fc73a7f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNJ7KmohdRlEz4fKOJvFGaBHauufk5u9fV5IruFopNgo7hGAcdDOX.8D0G4otenowd_rdyi1wni3ljK.vzidCQnM-", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/news-btc", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "NewsBTC - Barchart.com", "title": "If Bitcoin were a country, it would be the 40th l", "title_full": "If Bitcoin were a country, it would be the 40th l", "published": "2018-05-22T05:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f67e7e2a282a3113899180674680962d6fc73a7f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNJ7KmohdRlEz4fKOJvFGaBHauufk5u9fV5IruFopNgo7hGAcdDOX.8D0G4otenowd_rdyi1wni3ljK.vzidCQnM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "timcopeland", "published": "2018-05-22T05:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "If Bitcoin were a country, it would be the 40th l", "text": "If Bitcoin were a country, it would be the 40th largest consumer of electricity in the world.

But the cause of bitcoin continues to decline is the number of users who sell bitcoin because there is news or negative information coming to the world of cryptocurency, such as the government's ban regulations against bitcoin and so forth.\nWell they should not be uncertain about the profit of bitcoin, if today price is low then no need to be worry it will rise very high soon, many people become panic seller because they are now having proper idea about bitcoin price fluctuation, so my suggestion for them is not to sell because price can pump high very fast such as now price of bitcoin is getting better for us no need to sell for at least 3 years as it plays vital role in making price highly down.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T04:22:19.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5e665cdc2064ff5669ca20b55e4cbda8f70db7f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWPbI86qO0u1U3J4DoIokrw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "people criticizing Bitcoin", "title_full": "people criticizing Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-22T05:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5e665cdc2064ff5669ca20b55e4cbda8f70db7f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWPbI86qO0u1U3J4DoIokrw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "DAVETUN", "published": "2018-05-22T05:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "people criticizing Bitcoin", "text": "There criticism is base on lack of knowledge about Bitcoin and the technology behind it, also as some certain people do use BTC for illegal transaction such as money laundry platform, drug deals and arms deal, this has given BTC a bad omen, which has ultimately increase the number of BTC critics.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T05:43:22.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "78472ef10eecd770c18489bc12ec48284c43bbbe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZPJ.KBRmebPrB87ScbXVd1fp6Y2CkT76zAll76eBLlZPB5AwOa9GQPEk4JPugrLpitEhEvshQBQtU6rV8jWfu5EK96xxRu2F0-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : btc", "title": "What spec computer would you need to run a Bitcoin Cash full node ?", "title_full": "What spec computer would you need to run a Bitcoin Cash full node ?

Members were outraged that the crypto and wallet service, which is run by BCH evangelist Roger Ver appeared to be misleading buyers by muddling the distinction between BTC and BCH.\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ethereum-ripple-bitcoin-cash-eos-litecoin-cardano-stellar-tron-price-analysis-may-21", "https://www.bitcoin.com/", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/21/crypto-investor-brian-kelly-makes-the-case-for-bitcoin-cash.html", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-cash", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/pro-btc-movement-scraps-lawsuit-against-vers-bitcoincom-citing-lack-of-funds", "https://top.cointelegraph.com/people/Roger-K.-Ver/", "https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bkcm llc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T07:35:55.030+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e4d5dd65c88742ff2792a5f1ecb635858594d708", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf33O7oMC_8TKvHfolO1wqeZMJHu1AiMVflrOGqY.2VpxB_n.7hjasGrX8ztl79Xn4itgk1Cq5rSeU", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "http://bits.aihosting.com/rss", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "BTC News Aggregator", "title": "Coindesk (=organizer of \"Consensus\" Bitcoin Conference in NYC this year) supports scamming people.

Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy. News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system .

Mining them is 60 percent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers.\nWhy, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world's biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date?\nCanaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.\nTheir customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company, said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public.\nThe offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world's second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment.\nThe Beijing-based company's profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin's soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand.\nBut the effects of bitcoin's volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong's central business district, where the IPO has been filed.\nBusinesses selling mining rigs there said demand - especially for high-end machines - was limping along.\nAlvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit. \"Since we weren't selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,\" said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district.\nThe change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming.\nBitcoin prices have fallen 40 percent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400.\nPROMISED LAND\nTo some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment.\n\"Investors are always looking for crypto 'picks and shovels', and that's what this is,\" said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm.\nCanaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock.\nHowever, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens.\nFast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 percent of their 2017 peak at roughly $17 million per day.\nLast month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), the world's largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain.\nCryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator's apparent approval.\nVisiting its factory, he said: no matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally youre still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,\" according to mainland media reports.\nMARKET TEST\nBitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market - a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan's deal.\nAlthough the two sources were confident the IPO could raise $2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between $500 million and $1 billion.\nA lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price. In Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014. Eighteen months later, however, the company changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus to fintech software.\nLast year in Canada, listed miner Leeta Gold became HIVE Blockchain.\n\"Its not your everyday investment world,\" said HIVE chairman Frank Holmes, who is relatively new to the crypto world, but is a well-known investor in gold.\nHIVE, with a market capitalisation of $318 million, mines bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Iceland and Sweden, favoured for the energy-intensive process because of their cool temperatures and cheap power.\n\"We became the first public company that allowed institutions to play in this kind of space,\" Holmes added, pointing out that HIVE's second-largest shareholder is Fidelity, the giant U.S. fund manager.\nOther companies are also getting in on the act, with Canaan's smaller rival Ebang also considering a Hong Kong IPO, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.\n\"The excitement about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is not nearly finished, it is only just beginning,\" said Kenetic's Chu, who added that if successful, Canaan's IPO would encourage other cryptocurrency-related firms to list. People involved in Canaan's IPO say the prospects for the offering depend in part on the price of bitcoin over the next two months.\nWhile soggy prices, combined with rising mining capacity, will hit the hobby miners served by the Sham Shui Po shops far harder than Canaan's industrial-sized customers, they would still cast a shadow over the deal.\nIn Sham Shui Po, meanwhile, Alvin Wong says he will soon unplug his rig to put it and others back on the shelves - just as soon as customer demand returns.\n($1 = 6.3700 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Alun John and Jennifer Hughes; additional reporting by Sijia Jiang and Fiona Lau of IFR; Editing by Gerry Doyle)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "minin", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "canaan inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T14:06:42.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f6ff3120678cd09ea134edcf390d3ad0d00d26a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSmCL_6f2hFu5zcvYM_tuicIejzvPXKdcJE_o09ZtYTlUUy.qmB_yry", "site_full": "www.cryptocompare.com", "site": "cryptocompare.com", "site_section": "https://www.cryptocompare.com/forum/", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, BTC and Crypto Currencies Forum Discussion | CryptoCompare.com", "title": "Bitcoin Cash / BCC (BCH) -

Mining them is 60 percent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers. High-end graphic cards are installed in a cryptocurrency mining computer at a computer mall in Hong Kong, China May 17, 2018. Picture taken May 17, 2018. REUTERS/Bobby Yip\nWhy, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world’s biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date?\nCanaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.\n“Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public.\nThe offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world’s second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment.\nThe Beijing-based company’s profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin’s soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand.\nBut the effects of bitcoin’s volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong’s central business district, where the IPO has been filed.\nBusinesses selling mining rigs there said demand – especially for high-end machines – was limping along.\nAlvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit.\n“Since we weren’t selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,” said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district.\nThe change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming.

REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi/File Photo\nBitcoin prices have fallen 40 percent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400. PROMISED LAND\nTo some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment.\n“Investors are always looking for crypto ‘picks and shovels’, and that’s what this is,” said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm.\nCanaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock.\nHowever, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens.\nFast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 percent of their 2017 peak at roughly $17 million per day.\nLast month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), the world’s largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain.\nCryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator’s apparent approval.

REUTERS/Bobby Yip\nVisiting its factory, he said: “no matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you’re still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,” according to mainland media reports. MARKET TEST\nBitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market – a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan’s deal.\nAlthough the two sources were confident the IPO could raise $2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between $500 million and $1 billion.\nA lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price. In Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014. Eighteen months later, however, the company changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus to fintech software.\nLast year in Canada, listed miner Leeta Gold became HIVE Blockchain.\n“Its not your everyday investment world,” said HIVE chairman Frank Holmes, who is relatively new to the crypto world, but is a well-known investor in gold.\nHIVE, with a market capitalization of $318 million, mines bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Iceland and Sweden, favored for the energy-intensive process because of their cool temperatures and cheap power.\n“We became the first public company that allowed institutions to play in this kind of space,” Holmes added, pointing out that HIVE’s second-largest shareholder is Fidelity, the giant U.S. fund manager.\nOther companies are also getting in on the act, with Canaan’s smaller rival Ebang also considering a Hong Kong IPO, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.\n“The excitement about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is not nearly finished, it is only just beginning,” said Kenetic’s Chu, who added that if successful, Canaan’s IPO would encourage other cryptocurrency-related firms to list.\nPeople involved in Canaan’s IPO say the prospects for the offering depend in part on the price of bitcoin over the next two months.\nWhile soggy prices, combined with rising mining capacity, will hit the hobby miners served by the Sham Shui Po shops far harder than Canaan’s industrial-sized customers, they would still cast a shadow over the deal.\nIn Sham Shui Po, meanwhile, Alvin Wong says he will soon unplug his rig to put it and others back on the shelves – just as soon as customer demand returns.

The regulator started gathering information about these platforms after receiving complaints about them.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Warning to Investors\nThe Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) published an Investor Alert on Friday, warning the public of five firms that “appear to be involved in schemes that target Ontario investors and encourage them to trade or invest in cryptocurrencies,” stating:\nBtcreal, Bitserial, Hypercube Ventures LP, Cabincoin OÜ, and Baappay Inc. are not registered in Ontario to solicit investments or provide advice on investing in, buying or selling securities.\nThe Commission started gathering information on several crypto trading platforms last month after it received a number of complaints about them, CBC reported, adding that to date no platform has been recognized by the OSC as an exchange or exempted from recognition. Any platform that offers cryptocurrencies that fit the definition of securities “must determine whether it is a marketplace. Marketplaces are required to comply with the rules governing exchanges or alternative trading systems,” the news outlet elaborated.\nLast month, the OSC issued an Investor Alert on Bitconnect, Bitconnect Coin and the BCC Exchange. “Bitconnect, the BCC Exchange and representatives of Bitconnect are not registered in Ontario to solicit investments or provide advice on investing in, buying or selling securities,” the regulator wrote. The Five Unregistered Firms\nThe first firm mentioned in Friday’s warning is Btcreal . This company “claims to provide full investment services for cryptocurrency-related investments and forex,” promising investors “high returns in short periods of time,” the OSC described. The company’s website advertises “6 high ROI [Return On Investment] plans.”\nThe next company is Bitserial which “claims to offer opportunities to invest in BTE Tokens.” The firm also “encourages investors to participate in a lending program where they can exchange bitcoin, litecoin, or ethereum for BTE Tokens that are ‘lent out’ for high returns,” the Commission detailed.\nThe third company is Hypercube Ventures LP which manages multiple websites to encourage investors to buy “emission pools” in order to generate “VNN cryptocurrency,” according to the Commission.\nThe fourth is Cabincoin OÜ which “is currently advertising an unregistered token sale for Cabincoin Tokens,” claiming that “the future value of these tokens will far exceed their initial price,” the OSC wrote.\nThe last on the list is Baappay Inc. which “is a multi-layered platform that integrates both fiat and cryptocurrency payment services for merchants, that will confirm and guarantee all payments in seconds,” its website describes. The OSC says this company “is also currently advertising an unregistered token sale.”\nWhat do you think of the OSC’s warning?
