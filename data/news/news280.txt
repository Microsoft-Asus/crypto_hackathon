Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

The government has also revised the country’s tax code to add crypto taxation. Sellers of digital tokens will face a fine or even jail time if they fail to register with the regulator within 90 days.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Crypto Law In Effect\nThe Thai government’s decree to regulate cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) goes into effect on Monday. The Digital Asset Management Act BE 2561 was approved by the Thai cabinet in March and has been amended since.\nThe revision of the Revenue Code No. 19 was also announced in order to tax crypto profits at 15%, according to local media. Finance Minister Apisak Tantivorawong previously said, as reported by the Bangkok Post:\nIt [the decree] was not meant to prohibit cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings (ICOs) and other digital asset-related transactions, but to protect investors. Power to the Thai SEC\nAccording to the decree, the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has the duty and the authority to regulate digital currencies and their operators, Matichon reported.\nThe publication outlines four areas the SEC will be responsible for. The first is to regulate the issuance and offering of cryptocurrencies and digital asset businesses. The second is to set the fees and requirements for the registration and approval of cryptocurrencies and their operators. The third is to establish a guideline for dealing with potential problems. The fourth concerns all other areas not previously mentioned.\n“All sellers are required to register with the SEC within 90 days of the law taking effect,” the Bangkok Post wrote, adding that:\nSellers of digital tokens unauthorized by the SEC will be fined no more than twice the value of the digital transaction or at least 500,000 baht [~US$15,703]. They could also face a jail term of up to two years.\nThe news outlet elaborated that “the [finance] ministry and SEC will now work on organic laws requiring all digital asset transactions, including those of digital asset exchanges, brokers, and dealers, to be registered with the relevant authorities according to the decree.”\nDespite the new rules and direction presented in the decree, the Bank of Thailand (BOT) says that it will wait for the SEC to announce other details of the regulations before it will make a stance on cryptocurrencies and ICOs, according to Matichon. The BOT has previously banned financial institutions from crypto activities.\nWhat do you think of the Thai crypto regulations?

In forex signals trading, the trades on signal receivers accounts are executed automatically upon receiving the information from signal provider manually upon receiving an email or a text message.

And on the rare occasions when you do, you’re smart enough to resist the clickbait’s overtures. But what would happen if you did click to discover “the next bitcoin”? Where would the experience lead you, and could you profit from this esoteric knowledge?\nAlso read: Research Paper Finds Transaction Patterns Can Degrade Zcash Privacy I Clicked on a Spammy Cryptocurrency Ad and You’ll Never Guess What Happened Next\nLike the homeless, cryptocurrency ads are all around but most people choose not to see them. To the majority of web users, they’re an inconvenience – a distraction to be stepped over when reading Forbes and Vice and similar sites that use clickbait ads to conclude each paragraph like punctuation. While browsing the web on mobile recently, I came across one such ad:\nIt’s likely you’ve seen this ad or one very similar to it in your travels, and have skipped over it without a second thought. Normally, that’s what I would have done too. But this time was different. Be it out of boredom, curiosity or a need to file a news story, I decided to click. What were these three cryptos that were “better than bitcoin”, and better in what way – faster? More decentralized? Greater network effects? And more importantly, would buying them make me stupidly rich? There was only one way to find out. 3 Cryptos That Are 10x Better Than Bitcoin\nAfter clicking to discover which altcoins I should be buying “right now”, I was forced to enter my email address in return for being signed up to a newsletter called Coin Profits Daily. It would be delivered five times a week with “the most up-to-date information we have to offer on the world of cryptocurrencies”. I wasn’t interested in the newsletter: I just wanted to learn of those bitcoin-beating gems that my portfolio was crying out for.\nA couple of clicks later and I found myself reading a PDF emphatically named “3 Cryptos That Are 10x Better Than Bitcoin”. I skimmed through the preamble about how to identify altcoins with potential – I was only interested in the money shot. What were these magical coins I’d never heard of? I didn’t have to wait long to find out. Beneath the heading “The 3 Best Altcoins to Invest in 2018”, I met my first bitcoin beater – monero. That’s right, the 12th biggest cryptocurrency by market cap and the world’s most famous privacy coin was an under the radar gem I should be snapping up. Sell All Your Bitcoin and Buy This Instead\nI like monero, but it’s not the sort of obscure altcoin I had in mind when I clicked on the ad. Thankfully, the remaining coins in the guide proved to be less obvious, even if their inclusion was every bit as baffling. According to Coin Profits Daily, the final two alts that are “10x better than bitcoin” are vertcoin and burst. Reasons stated for buying this pair include the fact that vertcoin’s Instagram followers are over 2,000 “and the account was just created”. Burst, meanwhile, “implements the best technologies available and creates a universal coin with the attributes of many different cryptos”. As a consequence, it is “commonly referred to as a 2.0 cryptocurrency”.\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with these coins, but bitcoin killers they are not. So there you go: clicking on spammy cryptocurrency ads probably won’t cause your private keys to be stolen or your data resold. But it will fill your inbox with emails about “under the radar” coins from 2017, and that’s reason enough to steer clear.\nWhat sites do you think are worst for showing spammy cryptocurrency ads?

In a lot of cases, such threats are designed to steal sensitive information from companies and service providers. Australia’s Family Planning NSW recently fell victim to such an attack which saw thousands of patients almost having their sensitive details exposed. The criminals demanded a Bitcoin ransom for the sum of AU$15 , 000. The Family Planning NSW Attack Explained\nFamily Planning NSW is one of the largest sexual health providers in Australia. They serve thousands of clients throughout the country. It also means the organization wields a lot of sensitive information, which poses a big target for hackers and other criminals. A recent cyber attack exposed a few weaknesses in the organization’s website, which left their databases vulnerable. To this day, it remains unclear if anyone effectively had their details exposed in the process.\nAccording to company officials, the attack was never about data theft. Instead, the hackers demand a Bitcoin ransom after infiltrating the website. With numerous attacks happening around the time period, the ulterior motive remains rather unclear. In the ransom message, the attackers threatened to shut down the Family Planning NSW website altogether.\nPaying AU$15,000 in ransom is a rather steep amount. There was a timer on the website which showed the amount of time left to make the payment. It is unclear if the ransom has been paid at this stage. The Family Planning NSW website has been shut down to prevent any future attacks or discrepancies. The security weakness used for the previous attack has been addressed as well. Bitcoin Ransom Requests Remain an Issue\nOver the past few years, there has been an influx of criminal activity demanding a Bitcoin ransom. This trend has become most apparent in the malware industry. Various strains of ransomware will lock users out of their computers and won’t restore access until a Bitcoin payment is made. Even so, paying the ransom is no guarantee for getting one’s files unlocked once again.\nTo many people, Bitcoin has sufficient anonymity features to evade law enforcement scrutiny. That is not entirely correct, as blockchain analysis can be applied to Bitcoin transactions. With this method, officials can track down Bitcoin users sooner or later. It is not a viable tool for criminals by any means. Even so, the correlation between Bitcoin and criminal activity has not slowed down in the slightest.\nAttacks such as the one against Family Planning NSW show a lot of online platforms need to beef up their security. For the time being, the Australian Federal Police is still investigating the matter. No internal medical records were exposed, but several databases have been compromised in the end. It is an unfortunate incident, but until website security is improved in general, issues like these will remain a problem.

Residential Strong Arm Robbery\nThey say that crime never pays. For five men in Georgia, that was certainly the case.\nAs reported by 11 Alive , the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office arrested five men in connection with a conspiracy to invade a Forsyth County home in the hopes of making off with upwards of $1 million in Bitcoin, the world’s most popular and expensive cryptocurrency.\nThe arrests come after a 4-month-long investigation, following the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office Narcotics Unit’s response to what was initially believed to be a drug investigation at a local hotel. On January 29, narcotics authorities intervened on four males in possession of zip ties, latex gloves, duct tape, and bandanas. The men were released, however, due to a lack of sufficient evidence.\nThe subsequent investigation revealed that the men were not planning a drug-related crime. Rather, they were after someone’s Bitcoin fortune. The four men – Trivette Adams, Matthew Schwartz, Jacob South and Michael McDermont – were allegedly planning to rob a homeowner of his digital currency.\nAdams and McDermont were apprehended near the Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta before they were able to flee by airplane. The former tried to make a run for it but failed to outrun the deputies.\nSouth and Schwartz, meanwhile, were able to fly out of Atlanta. However, two Major Crimes Unit detectives in Chicago caught up to the criminals and extradited both with help from the Chicago Police Department.\nFinally, a fifth suspect, Justin Ellison of Illinois, was arrested on May 11 following an interview conducted by Illinois detectives in connection to the investigation. As noted by 11 Alive :\nTrivette Adams, 20, of Pflugerville, Tex., has been charged with residential strong arm robbery and criminal trespass; Robert South, 21, of Norcross has been charged with residential strong arm robbery; Matthew Schwartz, 18, of Hesperia, Calif., has been charged with residential strong arm robbery; Michael McDermott, 18, has been charged with residential strong arm robbery and criminal trespass; Justin Ellison, 20, of Worth, Ill., has been charged with residential strong arm robbery and conspiracy to commit a felony.\nThe foiled conspiracy should serve as a reminder to keep not only your private keys hidden, but also keep the contents of said wallets on a need-to-know basis.\nWhat measures have you taken to prevent the criminal theft of your cryptocurrency holdings?

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

Nouri declined to disclose how much the crypto exchange had paid, but said a rental like that typically goes for around $1,000.\nBitcoin Bros Lamborghini or Smart Marketing? Photographer: Lily Katz/Bloomberg\nThe flashy cars that symbolize conspicuous consumption among Bitcoin true-believers had caused a stir earlier as they roared through the streets near the hotel. Another stunt came from an upstart mining company called Genesis Mining. The firm hired actors to portray aggrieved bankers who will lose their financial services jobs when blockchain takes over the industry.\nThe gimmicks show that the hype that surrounded Bitcoin as it burst on the mainstream last year remains alive and well even after the biggest digital coin fell more than 50 percent from its December peak of almost $20,000.\nGenesis said the protest was a “fun way” to show how crypto can upend banking “if they fail to adapt to the new world we live in,” according to a blog post on its website.\nA hundred feet away, MK Li stood in front of the revolving hotel doors with a sign that read “Help a fellow VC to pay for this expensive conference!” Sporting a pink button-down shirt with a purple bowtie, the conference goer was accepting donations in digital tokens -- a way to protest the hefty price he’d paid for a conference about a technology that was meant to eliminate the need for expensive middlemen.\nTicket prices ranged from from $1,499 to $2,999, suggesting that organizer CoinDesk Inc. raked in at least $12.8 million in revenue from admissions alone.

Photographer: Lily Katz/Bloomberg\nInside the hotel, several floors up, one peeved attendee said to another, “How is this not a fire-code violation?’’ The two stood in the doorway of a packed ballroom, straining their necks to get a glimpse of a presentation about Cryptogaphic Innovations.\nThe hype is real at Consensus, the biggest of about two dozen events that make up “Blockchain Week.’’ So far, the conference — which is expected to bring in more than 8,000 people this year — has featured flannels, business suits, cowboy hats and dreadlocks amid a standing-room only sea of crypto and blockchain enthusiasts.\nSima Baktas, who works for a blockchain startup in Istanbul, sported a T-shirt that said “Satoshi is Female,’’ -- a reference to the mysterious and still-unknown author of the original Bitcoin whitepaper. Nearby, a man wore a red sweater covered in pictures of dollar bills. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Rather, anyone who wants to move their bitcoin to the sidechain needs the approval of a 'federation' group of third parties.\nStill, the miner support, RSK Labs co-founder Gabriel Kurman contends, is rather impactful as it shows support for a concept heralded as a way to expand bitcoin's functionality.\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\"It's a major announcement for bitcoin as a whole. This 10 percent is coming from 80 percent of the total mining pool power.\"\nAnd, although there's a small fraction of the entire network currently securing the sidechain, about 80 percent of miners have already committed support in the future.\n\"The hash power percentage is set to increase significantly over the next months,\" Kurman added.\nIt makes sense, after all, because the sidechain is designed to be \"merged-mined\" - a process which allows miners to get transaction fees by contributing their hash power to the sidechain, all while using the same equipment, electricity and power they're already using to mine bitcoin.\n\"RSK has massive support from the mining ecosystem because it adds a new revenue stream for them,\" Kurman said. RSK's lightning\nNot only that, but RSK has developed the sidechain to be able to handle more transactions than bitcoin can currently.\nThe RSK sidechain uses what the company calls \"smart bitcoins,\" a separate version of bitcoin with the smart contract capability, and that allows for improved scalability.\n\"On RSK you can process smart bitcoins at 100 transactions per second,\" Kurman said, pointing to the \"compression\" technology RSK pioneered that decreases the total amount of data that must be stored on the blockchain.\nEven with that improvement, though, Kurman is quick to note that that's not nearly enough to bring this technology to the masses, acknowledging that the sidechain still deals with the scalability issues faced by many of today's blockchains. But the team is working towards that.\nTaking inspiration from developers working on both bitcoin and ethereum, who have been developing technologies called the lightning network and Raiden network, respectively, RSK has been building a similar technology.\nCalled \"Lumino,\" the project is what Kurman describes as a \"combination\" of these two networks so that it can work with RSK's unique sidechains technology.\nKurman said he believes the finishing touches won't take long, telling CoinDesk:\n\"Before the end of the year, we hope to launch the Lumino network, which will allow for 20,000 transactions per second.\" Growing the family\nThe last announcement from RSK today is that two companies are now joining the \"RSK family,\" Kurman said.\nThe first is the Inter-American Development Bank, with an Argentinian bitcoin NGO, seeks to promote financial inclusion in Buenos Aires. The NGO has been working to use RSK for the past two years, although Kurman did not elaborate on how exactly the business plans to use the network.\nThe second company building on top of RSK is the BitGive Foundation, a long-standing bitcoin-focused charity organization that's been used to funnel bitcoin donations to Nepalese citizens affected by a devastating earthquake in 2015, among other initiatives.\nSpeaking to the BitGive's interest in using the RSK sidechain, Kurman said, \"It's a project that allows donors to have transparency using smart contracts.\"\nHe added that these new partners display that more and more businesses are starting to see the benefits of bitcoin (and beyond), and as such, are adopting the technology.\nRSK will be demoing all this functionality at their booth at CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference in New York City this week.\nStickers image via RSK The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

Where there are payments to process or data to secure, blockchain technology can be extremely useful. Another exciting aspect is how it can empower the underbanked and unbanked populations of the world. Put simply, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are for everyone. These aspects are most apparent when they are evidenced by real-world people, businesses, and use cases. I recently heard about a Chicagoland orthopedic practice beginning to accept Bitcoin as a payment method and reached out to them. The practice was started and operated by Dr. Chadwick Prodromos, and he was kind enough to take time out of his busy schedule to talk to me about integrating Bitcoin into his practice. Dr. Prodromos Doctor Prodromos, how long have you practiced medicine and how long has your practice been open? I have been in the practice of orthopedic surgery for 32 years, and heavily involved in stem cell and regenerative medicine for 7 years. When was the first time you heard about Bitcoin, and what convinced you to add it as a payment method for your patients? I heard about it several years ago and read Paul Vigna and Michael Casey’s The Age of Cryptocurrency. I believed it would be particularly useful for international patients. The book used Argentinians as a specific group, for example.

Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.” Clients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates. Bitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally. Albrecht’s service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013. His office employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month. Most clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don’t exceed 50,000 dollars. In 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since. Adoption of Bitcoin has been rapid in Germany. It trails only the U.S., according to Bitnodes, which tracks the location of all the Bitcoin nodes that transmit data about new transactions.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "prenzlauer berg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "online bank uses bitcoins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters tv", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T05:41:33.056+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "26280e84649dba017b4b5c2770b08e5de2948563", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmb2.XegzrjCi0cg4pULyDRs-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin & College students .", "title_full": "Bitcoin & College students .", "published": "2018-05-14T02:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.108, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "26280e84649dba017b4b5c2770b08e5de2948563", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmb2.XegzrjCi0cg4pULyDRs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Epimetheus", "published": "2018-05-14T02:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin & College students .", "text": "For today we have something that trained crypto and blockchain to do compulsory in educational institutions.

The world’s most popular bitcoin (bitcoin), which broke through the threshold of $ 9,000 on Friday morning, continues to decline to the area of ​​$ 8.5 thousand on negative news about searches on the large Korean currency exchange, the trade data shows. The Russian court first recognized the crypto currency property According to the portal CoinMarketCap, as of 21.47 Moscow time, bitcoin was cheaper by 6.84% – up to 8.623 thousand dollars. At the Bitfinex exchange, the Crypto currency was down 5.5% to $ 8.6 thousand, OKEx – 5.76%, to $ 8.6 thousand. Alternative crypto currencies also fall in price: Ethereum – by 7.7%, to 685.7 dollars, Ripple – by 10.6%, to 0.7 dollars, Bitcoin Cash – by 11.24%, to 1404.16 dollars. According to CoinMarketCap, the market capitalization of crypto-currencies is currently 333.4 billion dollars. Bitcoin accounts for approximately 36.5% of the entire market of crypto-currencies.“As expected according to the latest market trends, due to low volumes and inaction of buyers (bitcoin-ed.) At the level of 9.4 thousand dollars could not continue the growth and went on correction.” Now the sellers took over the relay, and in this they contributed to the negative news about the UpBit exchange, namely: searches have been conducted in the largest UP & C crypto exchange, the stock exchange is accused of fraud, “commented TheTokenFund analyst and TokenBox Alexander Litvinovich. Experts predicted a growth rate bitcoin above the psychological mark According to the analyst, a breakthrough down the psychological mark of 9 thousand dollars opened the way to further depreciation of bitcoins – to the area of ​​8.5-8.3 thousand dollars. “However, for the near future there are positive hopes for growth above $ 10,000 due to the start of the large Consensus conference in New York from May 14 to 16,” Litvinovich added at the same time. The initiator of the Consensus crypto conference is the managing partner of Fundstrat Global Advisors, Tom Lee. According to him, in 2018 the event will be a record number of participants and guests – 7 thousand people.

Both Chu and Kelly argued that the fact that these contracts would be settled with the delivery of BTC itself is an important factor in Bitcoin’s mainstream adoption.\nBoth commentators were unanimous in considering that the plans of NYSE’s parent company Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) - news of which comes from “multiple reports citing sources familiar,” if true, could be of momentous consequence for the future of crypto.\nimage courtesy of CoinTelegraph\nWhereas the futures contracts currently being offered on CME and CBOE are ultimately settled in fiat , Kelly emphasized that ICE’s suggestion that crypto swap contracts will be settled in BTC is a significant milestone that could herald major Wall Street crypto adoption. Kelly explained:\n“[The] physical delivery of Bitcoin…means that ICE has a custody solution. That has been the big hurdle. How do you hold onto these assets? These are generally bearer instruments…and so you have to have a third-party custody person. That’s the big deal, they have come up with a custody solution for institutional holders.”\nCold storage custodian solutions are currently offered by small operators, and ICE has not confirmed whether it plans to build an in-house cold storage solution or to outsource it. Indeed, ICE has so far declined to comment on the reports at all.\nKelly said that if ICE can offer a custodian solution that is SEC-qualified and fits with the SEC’s compliance requirements, this would “open the floodgates” to institutional capital, resulting in some “big price moves” in the crypto markets.\nA custody solution would also open the door for pensions and endowments, he said, leading him to conclude that cryptocurrencies now “look to be becoming an emergent asset class…most obviously at the expense of gold .”\nKelly noted that the markets have been slow to respond, suggesting that many are underestimating the significance of the news.\nICE’s plans come just days after investment banking giant Goldman Sachs announced it will be opening a crypto trading desk “within weeks,” as well as recently hiring a cryptocurrency trader as vice president of their digital asset markets. This week, BTC stopped short of breaking the $10,000 resistance, trading around $8.600 currently...\nHowever, Goldman Sachs is not quite so positive, suggesting Bitcoin faces considerable downside...\nBitcoin held another ABC corrective target for resistance at 9,719-9,771\nThe area includes 61.8% retrace of the decline from February as well as an equality target off the Apr. 6th low. Holding below implies that the recent rise is corrective/counter-trend. It also re-instates the impulsive nature of the sell-off in February/March.\nThis ultimately exposes downside risks to new lows, possibly as far as 4,485; another equality target from Feb. 20th. The next important support is down at 6,514-5,605 where there have been three separate lows since November.\nView: Tested/held 9,719-9,771. First in focus 6,514-5,605.

The Lightning Network is touted as a solution to bitcoin’s scalability problems has been live and running for several months now.\nWith an estimated 2,301 nodes having 6,290 channels to transmit bitcoin, the network has been used to transfer bitcoins worth around $156,074. Sponsored Links Mobile Lightning Wallet\nRawtx’s application is now available on the Android platform, and you can download the wallet through Google’s Play Store. With the app, users can send or receive testnet bitcoins on the Bitcoin blockchain through the existing Lightning infrastructure.\nEvery wallet is composed of two accounts, a checking account, and a savings account. The checking account can be used to view funds currently in the Lightning channel, while the savings account is used to check balance funds on the blockchain. Users can also use the the Rawtx wallet to create, join or close any payment channel.\nThe Lightning Network is an off chain scaling solution that settles transactions outside the blockchain.\nBecause the platform is an extension of the Bitcoin network, only supported wallets can be used to send micro-payments through this peer to peer method. What is the Lighting Network?\nTransaction fees on the Bitcoin blockchain skyrocketed throughout 2017, making it financially unviable to send and receive small payments on the network.\nIndependent developers then proposed the creation of a second layer scaling solution dubbed the Lightning Network. In theory, it would be ideal for transferring small amounts of bitcoin since the exchanges are held off-chain. Whenever two users want to transfer money between themselves, they open what is known as a ‘payment channel.’ The channel is a two-way medium that can both send and receive bitcoin.\nThe two users that created the channel can then carry out an infinite number of transactions between them as long as the channel remains active. The payment settlement is done off the main chain as details of the transactions are not sent to the blockchain. Ultimately, the main chain does not deal with the individual payments sent on any channel and only records only the opening and closing balance at both nodes.\nTherefore, with the proper and widespread implementation of the Lightning Network, the number of transactions on the main chain are reduced, freeing up the network to be used for settling larger amounts.\nThe transaction fee for sending bitcoin via the Lightning Network is also cheaper as compared to exchanges on the main blockchain. While the blockchain is not involved in any payment settlement of the Lightning Network, it is referenced in case of any discrepancies. Lightning Network Wallets\nSeveral web-based wallets such as Zap, Eclair, and HTLC.me have already allowed users to send and receive testnet bitcoins using the Lightning Network. It is, however, important to note that both the sender and the recipient of a Lightning transaction must have a compatible wallet associated with their account address.\nWhile either party can open a Lightning payment channel, the other user needs to join the channel for it to be valid. Once both the users have successfully verified the payment channel though, they can instantly send and receive bitcoin via the Lightning Network.

Bitcoin was about to reach the $10,000 mark but ended up dropping below $9000. This has affected the other coins as even they have dropped off in price. Many think that it might be the end of the crypto hype. But coins are slowly rising back again and investors predict that Bitcoin Cash [BCH] might enter into the top 3 of the crypto-rankings after its fork.\nBCH is currently priced at $1315.19 with a circulating supply of 17.12 million and an overall volume of $1.31 billion. The coin has a market cap of $22.52 billion. It is being noticed that the coin has declined by 0.19% in the past 24 hours and 18.98% in the past 7 days.\nBut the decline rate is nothing to be worried about as it has had the 2nd least decline rate in the top 15 cryptocurrencies. All other cryptocurrencies have had a 20% and above decline rate except for Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH]. 7 days graph of BCH\nCash Consortium [C2] is a Bitcoin Cash blockchain startup which was recently established that aims to provide a long-term growth in Bitcoin Cash. The organization follows the World Wide Web Consortium’s open standards. The open standards allow developers to have freedom and to find out bugs and flaws inside of the software.\nOne of the main founders of C2 says:\n“Bitcoin Cash [BCH] is one of the most important forms of cryptocurrency known. It has scarcity, fungibility, divisibility, durability, and transferability which make a coin perfect.

From a week prior to the end of the conferences, Bitcoin has rallied 10% to 69% and after two months it has increased 78% to 138%.

Looking at data from March 2017 to February 2018, they surveyed the public profiles of those investing in cryptocurrencies using their systems, and extracted demographic insights from age to gender to job sector.\nOne interesting point emerging from the data is that an absolute majority of traders are new in the business with regards to having any investing experience. A whopping 81.96% are at the Novice level, 10.66% are defined as Intermediate level, and just 7.38% qualify as having an Advanced level of experience in the market.\nLooking at the breakdown by occupation, it’s not surprising to see people working in the computer and IT services strongly represented at 15.05%, as well as the finance industry at 8.48%. Less expected is the high share of people working at sales and marketing involved in cryptocurrency trading at 14.49%. Additionally, about 30% of cryptocurrency traders are currently out of the job market, with 13.85% being students, 2.06% retired, and 14.74% just having no job. Crypto Gender Imbalance\nOne demographic issue that keeps coming up with relation to cryptocurrency developers is the lack of female representation, and the same statistics seem to be true for traders. In fact, the data shows that less than a tenth of crypto traders are women, with just 8.5% market share compared with men’s 91.5%. While there could be other factors at play, bitcoin is located at the intersection of technology and finance, both fields that suffer from a severe gender imbalance, so the results are not all that surprising in that context.\nInterestingly, the research also revealed that there are differences between the cryptocurrencies men and women prefer to trade, other than BTC which has 0% gender difference. It appears that Ripple’s XRP skews strongly into the female side, while ETC, BCH and LTC are firmly in male territory. In a note to investors, Senior Market Analyst at Etoro Mati Greenspan, summarized it all with a clear “Women Love ripple.”\nEarlier this year, Etoro was among seven leading cryptocurrency companies operating in the UK that formed an independent trade body tasked with developing self-regulatory standards for the cryptocurrency industry and engaging policymakers. The other founding members of Crypto UK are Coinbase, Cex.io, Blockex, Commerceblock, Coinshares, and Cryptocompare.\nHow cloud the bitcoin community attract more female users?

The objective is to ride any type of price increases in the underlying \"crypto\" assets, which need to enhance your revenues.

Generally, it allows services to approve \"crypto\" money for their product and services, enabling customers to maximize the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum etc without being afraid any kind of safety concerns (BitGo is heavily concentrated on safety and security implementation). This implies that if you obtain any type of cash via \"crypto\" symbols, whilst their rate will certainly often be line with the different \"fiat\" money - they will usually be fairly unstable. Therefore, it's usually the case that several eCommerce shopkeeper will merely \"exchange\" their \"crypto\" tokens for 100% fiat currency either at the end of the month, or after an order is gotten. The \"trick\" employed by a large number of store owners is to really maintain their earnings in the \"crypto\" environment.

If the Request Gateway does not retailer its own Request Tokens to burn it can all the time be required to buy Request Tokens at market worth. ethical investing at e-chat The gateways additionally allow Request to be foreign money and chain agnostic and ensures the success of the Request Network roll-out to the non-crypto world.

Founders may have unique entry to the Narrative group instantly after the Token Sale ends and till the community launches. Standing is an open source messaging platform and cell browser to interact with decentralized purposes that run on the Ethereum Community. Because of the large quantities of Standing ICO transactions and different Ethereum transactions going down, the system essentially failed. A decentralized community constructed on prime of Ethereum, which permits anyone, wherever to request a payment. The platform, the place tokens circulate, has already been developed. In consequence, holding REQ tokens makes it a lucrative funding if it achieves network effect. REQ tokens are ERC20 tokens which are essential to participate within the community and create advanced Requests. The cross-chain bridge answer proposed in the mentioned above Polkadot undertaking and employed by the Oracles Community's provides interoperability of Ethereum-appropriate blockchains, irrespectively to their consensus mechanisms. Furthermore, many organizations require solely fundamental tokens; they adopt the chance of Ethereum's Turing full programming language without profiting from many of its benefits. Utilizing data from the battery insurance coverage smart contracts, proof of concept has been demonstrated for the insurance coverage protocol and the workability of the platform. It's my humble opinion that Request is one of the extra hyped ICOs in the month of October; receiving widespread consideration after their whitelist was closed 5 days before the unique deadline in observation of overwhelming interest. With the burning mechanism (Gateways) and staking (PoS) working hand in hand Request could cater to both builders who create Gateways and lay traders who want to create a type of passive revenue for holding tokens. One solution that's being provided up is known as EOS , which goals to vary the best way ICOs are performed to permit sooner or later home windows for token gross sales, among quite a lot of other technical adjustments to allow for simply deployable decentralized functions. As soon as the initial providing is over, SAT token holders will have the ability to commerce their tokens on listed cryptocurrency exchanges. As all transactions that use extensions require REQ tokens, the more utilization the Request platform has, the extra invaluable REQ tokens should be. At the core of each district is the d0xINFRA framework, a stack of Ethereum good contracts and entrance-end libraries distributed on IPFS which energy a district's basic functionalities. BitClave has unfolded the market potential for the Oracles Network's solution for the decentralized search engine: a number of sub-chains assigned to particular geographic areas allow localized search customization for its users. The Ripio Credit score Network will serve as a peer-to-peer lending platform, using the token and its associated good contracts to safe each loan. Eliminating the requirement to ever maintain Request tokens for both the Requestor and the Payer, the Request Network becomes more accessible. Within the crypto world promotion and advertising have turn out to be decentralized as disparate token-holders are incentivised to convince non-holders (the broader market) that their tokens are ever-more valuable. These decentralized purposes remove the need for middlemen and centralised servers, offering a transparent path forward in the direction of an internet where users get to own their own information, and an economy constructed on permissionless, open protocols. Following the completion of the token sale Luu commented: I wish to thank the Kyber Network workforce members and advisors for getting the company to efficiently increase an excellent round.

Bitcoin (the blockchain technology) is not a payment system. It does not support chargebacks, it is slow, unreliable, inconvenient, and often expensive to interact with. It's the equivalent of trying to pay by putting bricks of gold in people's mailboxes.\nIt is however a natively digital, independent, and permissionless asset that can be transferred across the globe, free from censorship, inflation, or theft. Best of all, it achieves these properties without any trusted third parties that control the system.\nIn this regard, it competes with the dollar and other fiat currencies, not with credit cards. In fact, there is no reason why credit cards denominated in bitcoin (the currency) couldn't exist.\nThe hope however, is that due to being natively digital and permissionless, it is possible to build far better payment technology on top of this currency than what is possible with the dollar. One promising technology in this regard is the Lightning Network - a layer built on top of Bitcoin that offers cheap, fast, reliable payments which does not undermine the principles Bitcoin was designed for.\nSo why bother with the slow, expensive, and unreliable layer at the bottom, instead of directly building a payment system? Because different technologies are good for different use cases. In order to build a payment system, you first need something of value to pay with. The blockchain offers a way to do that, as it requires global consistency to guarantee no double spends are possible. But once you have that, there is no need for everyone in the world to know about your coffee - it can just be something between you and the seller.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T01:50:17.065+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b0fa29912874a36d88a39c385c4da79768af52b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqazi7.jHrttVJGlktXAGEGG2objPr6DZgq9oScDd6mXE2feRfbRFJ5LAvOfU9iym92RTkhpc9QLOw-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Bitcoin could rally +70% next week...", "title_full": "Bitcoin could rally +70% next week... : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-14T01:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b0fa29912874a36d88a39c385c4da79768af52b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqazi7.jHrttVJGlktXAGEGG2objPr6DZgq9oScDd6mXE2feRfbRFJ5LAvOfU9iym92RTkhpc9QLOw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cryptowallstreet", "published": "2018-05-14T01:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin could rally +70% next week...", "text": "submitted by /u/cryptowallstreet\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wljHYMgkMVo"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T21:05:48.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bfefaf8f19ad6477fdc4e35ff6ac8d791257f3c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkgz6eTlVHKdmK77vMTDWx0Fv5Ia5LOr4LLx2v4vXFkHNv.b4rwxvA2MOboN1M8JwxoMclFv8uxXwMsH_2ixY5tgtQbwkUNT1y11WavUO9Jmfvy9k7ZaiJrEC3lRQS3FE-", "site_full": "bitcoinwarrior.net", "site": "bitcoinwarrior.net", "site_section": "http://bitcoinwarrior.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "SEC declares its significance by comparing Bitcoin [BTC] to Beaches", "title_full": "SEC declares its significance by comparing Bitcoin [BTC] to Beaches", "published": "2018-05-14T01:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bfefaf8f19ad6477fdc4e35ff6ac8d791257f3c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkgz6eTlVHKdmK77vMTDWx0Fv5Ia5LOr4LLx2v4vXFkHNv.b4rwxvA2MOboN1M8JwxoMclFv8uxXwMsH_2ixY5tgtQbwkUNT1y11WavUO9Jmfvy9k7ZaiJrEC3lRQS3FE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Warrior", "published": "2018-05-14T01:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "SEC declares its significance by comparing Bitcoin [BTC] to Beaches", "text": "SEC declares its significance by comparing Bitcoin [BTC] to Beaches May 14, 2018\nChristopher Giancarlo, the Chairman of CFTC a regulatory commission, praised Hester Pierce for speaking on cryptocurrency and blockchain. Hester M. Pierce is a member of the SEC another regulatory commission. She compared Bitcoin to beaches using a metaphor of a lifeguard at a beach. Tweet by Christopher Giancarlo\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission [CFTC] is a financial regulatory agency tasked with overseeing the U.S. derivative markets. The regulatory body offers transparent, competitive, and financially sound markets. The commission seeks to protect market users from fraud, manipulation, and abusive practices related to the derivatives based on the Commodity Exchange Act [CEA].\nCommissioner Hester M. Pierce had joined the commission on the 11th of January 2018. U.S. Securities and Exchange Mission [SEC] is an institution that prevails to protect investors to promote and maintain fair, authentic trade. They are also responsible for facilitating capital formation as the institution was built on public trust.\nOn the 2 nd of May, Hester spoke about digitalized assets and securities. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin function as money or commodity but more than that they are actually securities. She also says that the Commission protects the investors and secures the market integrity by deterring and punishing fraud and setting clear rules.\nShe further clarifies:\n“As we sit atop, our lifeguard’s stand and survey the beach…… My hope is that we can navigate these new waters collaboratively. The SEC’s role is not to hand out permission slips for innovation.

If anything, the State Bank has barred commercial banks and financial firms from dealing in cryptocurrency which, of course, makes life harder for local exchanges. Individual traders, however, are finding alternative ways to acquire or sell cryptocurrencies, defying the warnings and the prohibitions.\nAlso read: India’s Supreme Court Keeps Ban on Banks’ Crypto Services, For Now Central Bank Can’t Ban Cryptocurrency in Pakistan\nPakistan’s experience with cryptocurrencies offers another example of how ineffective financial authorities can be when trying to fill a legal vacuum with prohibitive administrative measures. Central banks often forget they are neither parliaments, nor governments, and their regulatory overreach cannot legitimately substitute the normal legal process. The recent decision of the State Bank of Pakistan to ban crypto-related activities proves that observation.\nIn early April, the SBP issued a circular on the “prohibition of dealing in virtual currencies”, right after a similar measure by the Reserve Bank of India, the regional rival. Unlike their Indian colleagues, who gave banks and traders three months to comply, Pakistani central bankers imposed the ban with immediate effect. SBP said virtual currencies and tokens were not legal tender and reminded it had not authorized any individual or entity to issue, sell, purchase, or exchange any such coins in Pakistan. All banks, microfinance entities, payment system operators and service providers were “advised to refrain” from dealing in cryptocurrencies.\nThe local market is by no means comparable to India’s booming crypto sector. According to Danyal Manzar, CEO of Pakistan’s first bitcoin exchange Urdubit, about 100 different digital coins were being traded daily across all mediums before the ban. His trading platform decided to close down permanently following the prohibition. “The decision was made in haste. Ample time should always be provided for a proper shutdown. But we respect the SBP’s decision,” he told The Express Tribune .\nImmediately after the ban, Urdubit warned its clients to withdraw both their fiat and their crypto funds. A month later, however, some of its users still have bitcoins in their accounts on the platform. Manzar believes that those who want to trade will continue to do so because “alternative ways still exist that will continue to be tapped no matter how risky they are.” He thinks that cryptocurrencies would only disrupt the stock market, and not the entire monetary system. “About 80 to 85% of the traders from stock exchanges came to try their luck in virtual currency,” he said. Localbitcoins PKR Trade Spikes After Ban\nRecently, Pakistani crypto traders told Asia Times that the central bank’s move initially caused a dip in the crypto market but the volume of trading has gradually picked up after alternative trading methods were discovered. “Traders realized that the SBP hasn’t, and can’t ban cryptocurrency in Pakistan,” Lahore-based trader Majid Ali commented. “What the State Bank has done is ban banks from entertaining crypto, so if you’re not dealing via banks, you [still] can own and trade virtual currency in Pakistan, which comes under the IT ministry,” he explained.\nIndeed, as the chart of the weekly Localbitcoins volume from Coin Dance shows, trading has spiked after the release of the circular. It peaked in the week of April 28 to more than 163 million Pakistani Rupee (>1.4 million USD), almost reaching December-January all-time highs.\nThe price of Pakistan’s first and only cryptocurrency, Pakcoin, which was explicitly mentioned in the SBP’s prohibition, has also jumped – by over 60% since the ban. Pakcoin founder Abu Shaheer says that the central bank’s measure has actually worked in favor of his crypto by “serving to expose Pakcoin’s name [and] more people got interested in it.” The digital token is already used for mobile phone credit top-ups. Islamabad to Prohibit “All Forms of Virtual Currency” After All\nSources from Pakistan’s Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication have told Asia Times that the government in Islamabad does plan to formally declare cryptocurrencies illegal in the country. “We have forwarded our recommendation for a ban on all forms of virtual currency trading, and proper legislation is being worked on,” a government official said.\nAccording to crypto trader Majid Ali, however, while the legislation is likely to hit trading, there are alternatives for dealing with cryptocurrencies. “The government of Pakistan can’t stop the trade in an international commodity that is accepted in other countries,” he said. Majid also warned that the ban actually opens transfer channels that can be used for illegal purposes.\nDo you think that bans imposed by central banks can really stop cryptocurrency trade?
