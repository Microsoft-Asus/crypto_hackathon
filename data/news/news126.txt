Dether’s mission is to give power back to individuals — especially unbanked populations across the globe — by enabling them to easily access cryptocurrency. Dether is building a worldwide ecosystem of crypto buyers, sellers and physical stores willing to trade crypto for fiat cash and accept it as a means of payment. No bank account is needed, just a mobile phone with internet access.\nA mobile app that lets you cash-in and cash-out cryptocurrency, with no fees taken by the company\nBuying cryptocurrency presents many obstacles: fiat currency barriers, the need for a bank account, and certain geographical limitations. Individuals are often excluded from using cryptocurrency if their national currency is not accepted on a major exchange or if they don’t have a bank account or passport, leaving the world of dApps inaccessible.\nDether’s beta version, released on Ethereum test net in March 2018 on https://betakovan.dether.tech, allowed users across the globe to test the app and its main features. Now, with the release of the Dether mobile app in June 2018 , anyone will be able to use his or her mobile phone to connect and trade with crypto sellers near them on the Dether map, the app’s built-in location system.\nDether co-founder, Mehdi Amari commented:\n“ We are building a fully decentralized cash-in and cash-out marketplace, meaning that no central entity has any control over the user’s accounts, funds, or conversations. No funds are held. Each individual has his own private key locate in his device. Conversations are fully decentralized and peer-to-peer. The decentralized reputation system is based on the user’s number of trades and volumes. As a company, we don’t take any fees on the transactions between buyers and sellers.”\nEnabling any cryptocurrency holder to become a mobile ATM\nDether addresses both individuals interested in buying and selling cryptocurrency for fiat currency, and physical shops willing to accept cryptocurrency as a means of payment. Using Dether, both individuals and physical shops can become an exchange by registering their point of sale on the Dether map and choosing their own fees.\nFor users shying away from volatility, Dether and MakerDAO, creators of the Dai stable token, have partnered to bring the value and power of a stable token to retailers and individuals worldwide using Dether. By further breaking the barriers to blockchain and crypto adoption, they enable any individual or shop owner to easily switch from any cryptocurrency stabilized against the value of the U.S. Dollar, and vice versa.\nFrom Nigeria to Norway, shops all over the world can now be a part of a global ecosystem\nFollowing their successful token sale in February 2018 , Dether released “Dether for Shops” on Ethereum main net, allowing retailers to stake DTH (Dether’s utility token) in order to be listed on the Dether map and broadcast the fact that they accept cryptocurrency.\nDether co-founder, Hamid Benyahia stated:\n“ In terms of user experience, it’s much like the process of searching for a nearby café or restaurant on Google Maps, but in this case, you’re looking for a place to spend your cryptocurrency. This represents a unique opportunity for merchants and the crypto community, ”\nSoon, “Dether for Shops” will allow shop owners to be listed on the Dether map under exclusive keywords related to their business.\nAn Expected Release Targeting Developing Countries in Africa, Asia and South America\nDether co-founder, Hamid Benyahia said:\n“ We are thrilled to be releasing the Dether app across countries in Africa, South America, and Asia. There are more than 2 billion adults that remain unbanked in these regions. Whether it’s for remittance, investment, or as a response to hyperinflation, we believe that these markets are in critical need of the ability to easily buy and sell cryptocurrency for cash.”\nUsers interested in accessing the Dether mobile app can register for early access here: http://app.dether.io.\nVisit the Website: https://dether.io/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://dether.io/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dether", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fiat", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "gibraltar", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T10:46:36.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a732cb1040132e00ecf0993812c82213190c9b3d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYW8YjggBtqdKsU5mkDELXE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Can we make sure that our money we invest in Bitcoin is safe?", "title_full": "Can we make sure that our money we invest in Bitcoin is safe?", "published": "2018-05-27T06:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.008, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a732cb1040132e00ecf0993812c82213190c9b3d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYW8YjggBtqdKsU5mkDELXE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "vaughn125", "published": "2018-05-27T06:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can we make sure that our money we invest in Bitcoin is safe?", "text": "Quote: from: kauban2018 on April 22, 2018, 08:33:23 AM I just want to know how those people behind bitcoin secure the money they will invest because as far as I know there are lots of hackers all over the world.\nLook man, in this industry, you will never be a hundred percent safe from hackers or scammers because as security gets stronger, they also try harder to steal from people.

It filed an indictment, alleging that Hilmi Git had managed to commit more than 20,000 fraudulent transactions using Israeli credit cards, laundering the money through the Bitcoin network. 1,071 BTC Seized by Israeli Police\nHalmi Git, a resident of Hebron, has been accused of multiple offenses of credit card fraud, providing means for committing a crime, carrying out fraudulent trade activity, and laundering the proceeds through Bitcoin. It is reported that the Git managed to accumulate a total of 1,071 Bitcoin over the course of his crimes.\nAt press time, Bitcoin is trading at $7,342.21, putting the total value of Git’s fraud at a little over $7.8 million. Web of Crime\nAccording to the indictment, Git ran a network of forums and websites used to provide information on how to commit a range of computer offenses. One such forum provided is reported to have provided stolen credit card information. While entry to the forum was free, members could purchase a “VIP” membership to receive “fresh” credit card data. Git also published different guides in violation with the country’s Computers and Money Laundering Law.\nBut wait… there’s more! Reportedly, Git also ran another scam, fraudulently selling mobile phones – often members of his own forums – at substantially reduced prices.\nThe indictment describes a scheme in which Git would request that the customer transfer his money for the phone, after which point he would proceed to block the customer from the forum without ever actually having sent the customer their phone. He would go on to publish a positive feedback message on behalf of the deceived customer, expressing gratitude for the cheaper mobile phone. All Payments Made in Bitcoin\nThe Israeli State Prosecutor’s Office claims that Git had requested all the payments to be made in Bitcoin. As such, he has reportedly managed to accumulate more than 1,071 Bitcoin between 2008 and 2018.\nThe Bitcoin wallet of the accused has been seized and the funds in it are to be confiscated if and when he is found guilty of his crimes.\nThe prosecution also seeks an extension of Git’s confinement until the end of the trial due to potential flight risk as well as concerns that having access to the internet will allow Git to “continue carrying out the criminal enterprise he established over the past decade.” Given the defendant’s thoughts on his actions, the concern seems more than warranted.\nShowing no remorse whatsoever, Git was quoted as saying:\nWe are thieves, from wherever we can take money – we’ll take it, no matter where – from Israel, The US or even the moon – we will reach it and use it.\nWhat do you think will happen to those 1,071 Bitcoin if Git is found guilty?

The responses were, “that’s not true, once fiat money is created, no additional energy is required.”\nBitcoin and cryptocurrency have an energy problem?\nPeople at the FED don't sit around painting Benjamin Franklin all day on pieces of paper with watercolor to make $100 bills. It costs energy, electricity, & manual labor.\nIt costs significantly less to produce cryptocurrencies.\n— Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) May 24, 2018\nPerhaps a better way to phrase the statement was to replace energy with resources, as fiat currencies do require significantly more resources than cryptocurrencies.\nMyth Currently, the vast majority of people are comparing bitcoin’s electricity consumption to the production of paper money at central banks like the Federal Reserve, dismissing manual labor, energy, and electricity required to distribute and transfer money.\nFiat requires commercial banks, central banks, ATMs, armored cars, hundreds of thousands of employees, among other things to work. The central bank, in this case the FED, does not magically distribute the US dollar to every person in the country at their doorstep. The FED distributes its US dollar to banks and its friends, who then distribute money with the hopes of trickling down the US dollar to the bottom of the economy.\nCash requires a truly massive infrastructure to function. In the US alone, there are more than 6,000 banks that process cash transactions. Most people no longer uses cash in its physical form to transact. They rely on third party service providers and banks like JPMorgan, Visa, and MasterCard to process payments. The amount of resources and energy these companies and their hundreds of thousands of employees consume should be included in the comparison between the energy consumption of bitcoin against banks.\nBitcoin is a peer-to-peer financial network and due its decentralized nature, no third party is required to transact. Alice can send Bob $100 by broadcasting the transaction to the mempool, which is than picked up by miners to process. In return, miners are incentivized by receiving bitcoin and transaction fees included in the block.\nHence, while it may be accurate to claim it requires more electricity to mine cryptocurrency, it is false to claim that to create or generate bitcoin, more resources are required than to create cash or paper money, as the majority of the energy used by the miners is attributable to confirming and validating transactions, which most of the banks do globally.\nImprovement bitcoin mining farm More John Lilic, member at Ethereum blockchain development studio ConsenSys, stated that the cost per transaction is significantly higher with crypto and that is undoubtedly correct. Major banks like JPMorgan processes trillions of dollars on a daily basis. Lilic said that in the long-term, blockchain projects will have to find better ways to process transactions and information more efficiently.\n“The per unit cost of each tx is significantly higher with crypto. Data centres banks use are much more efficient than mining operations & legacy systems process orders of magnitude more tx’s per day than crypto. We need specificity around the energy issue, not conjecture. The real question is whether the gross energy inefficiency costs in crypto is worth the benefits like custody over assets. My contention is Yes! It is worth it but only if our industry prioritizes & continues to work towards energy efficiency gains like Proof of Stake.”\nAs cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology mature, they will experiment with more efficient methods of consensus algorithms and mining methods that may decrease the energy output of cryptocurrencies in the long-term.\nImages from Shutterstock\nThe post Op-Ed | Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Consume Significantly Less Resources than Fiat Money appeared first on CCN .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ccn.com/op-ed-cryptocurrencies-like-bitcoin-consume-significantly-less-resources-than-fiat-money/", "http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/c9ed23564474160dd6e53b86ece425e3", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qJBZo0PZ2Se7QypbQCpw7A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/b669ddde9aecff9edd1005726066c7a7", "https://twitter.com/iamjosephyoung/status/999565178382385153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.ccn.com/op-ed-cryptocurrencies-like-bitcoin-consume-significantly-less-resources-than-fiat-money/&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ghaB3NVPtVYKRc1HOE98FA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzUwO2g9NTAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/c9ed23564474160dd6e53b86ece425e3);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ghaB3NVPtVYKRc1HOE98FA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzUwO2g9NTAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/c9ed23564474160dd6e53b86ece425e3"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joseph young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin franklin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fiat money", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fiat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T04:21:52.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "df247377b372e00bd5be0b4fa60a4011400ef10c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmV2NUx.oR7xRdSuSJENhHbQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin is useless so why high price?", "title_full": "Bitcoin is useless so why high price?", "published": "2018-05-27T05:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.079, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "df247377b372e00bd5be0b4fa60a4011400ef10c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmV2NUx.oR7xRdSuSJENhHbQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brunoaoi007", "published": "2018-05-27T05:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin is useless so why high price?", "text": "Bitcoin is not useless, bitcoin is the first coin.

Either the number one crypto is either here to stay or it is just a fad. Thus, whether you support the \" bubble \" argument, the \" currency of the future \" notion or any other position, it all inevitably leads to the \"boom or bust\" conclusion or at least, so says Grayscale Investments managing director Michael Sonnenshein.\nTwo Mutually Exclusive Bitcoin Future Outcomes According to Sonnenshein, there is no middle ground as far as Bitcoin is concerned. Speaking during a recent interview with Fortune , the cryptoanalyst said :\nAs we begin to look at assets like Bitcoin and the unbelievable adversity it's faced over the last ten years, every day that Bitcoin doesn't go away, every day that Bitcoin overcomes a new challenge, for me that makes me feel that Bitcoin will do either one of two things.\nIt will either survive and become all these amazing things that we think it can be, which will cause its price to be a lot higher. Or it is possible something else may come along that will displace it and Bitcoin goes to zero. It likely will have a binary outcome.\nTo emphasize the point, consider the image above. Those were the top ten cryptocurrencies exactly five years ago as cataloged by CoinMarketCap. How many of them do you recognize? Now compare with the image below and see that only Bitcoin and Litecoin are still in the top ten. Where did the others go? Well, Freicoin isn't even in the top 1,000 coins. Namecoin and Peercoin have also fallen spectacularly over the years as have the others on the list.\nBitcoin Should Be Able to Adapt The critical question is where does Bitcoin's destiny lie? Sonnenshein believes there is hope for the digital currency as long as there are continued improvements upon the technology. The managing director of Grayscale investments said that Bitcoin's future is tied to its ability to remain relevant in the emerging digital currency landscape which it has historically dominated right from the outset.\nBitcoin does have one crucial advantage – it is an open source protocol. Thus, if a paradigm-shifting technological breakthrough emerges, it should be easy to incorporate at least some aspects of it into the network.\nWhere do you stand on the boom/bust debate? Do you think Bitcoin can adapt to changes in the crypto ecosystem?

But it doesn't mean that trading will stop, because there will be a lot of bitcoin users that will just HODL on it because the price will definitely skyrocket because its going to be scarce.

That horror recently turned a reality for one man, as detailed in the New York Post .\nJames Howells lost a hard drive with the key to more than $60 million in bitcoin.\n“I mined more than 7,500 coins over one week’s time in 2009; there were just six of us doing it at the time, and it was like the early days of a gold rush,” said the IT worker turned crypto investor, 32, who lives in Newport, Wales.\n“Four years later, I had two hard drives in a desk drawer. One was empty and the other contained my bitcoin private keys,” Howells recalled. “I meant to throw away the empty drive — and I accidentally threw away the one with the bitcoin information.”\nFrom the Post:\nHowells didn’t realize the value of his coins for a few weeks after he lost them. “I looked up the price, did the calculation . . . and thought, ‘S - - t.

heart attack in Mexico , his family was unable to locate the pass code needed to retrieve his fortune — said to have been worth as much as $1 billion — in XRP cryptocurrency, according to the Daily Mail .\nLosing passwords is the kind of nightmare that haunts bitcoin investors. In fact, there are an estimated 3 million bitcoins — totaling nearly $25 billion — lost because the retrieval codes have gone missing or the currency owners died without passing the codes onto their next of kin.\nJust ask James Howells — who lost a hard drive with the key to more than $60 million in bitcoin.\n“I mined more than 7,500 coins over one week’s time in 2009; there were just six of us doing it at the time, and it was like the early days of a gold rush,” said the IT worker turned crypto investor, 32, who lives in Newport, Wales.\n“Four years later, I had two hard drives in a desk drawer. One was empty and the other contained my bitcoin private keys,” Howells recalled. “I meant to throw away the empty drive — and I accidentally threw away the one with the bitcoin information.”\nIn 2008, bitcoin’s alleged creator Satoshi Nakamoto published an open-source code through which bitcoins are “mined” by solving complex calculations, embedded throughout the Internet, via extremely powerful computers. There is a finite number of 21 million bitcoins.\nPart of cryptocurrency’s appeal is that it’s anonymous, untraceable and can only be retrieved by the person with the private key. Randomly generated by the Bitcoin algorithm, these can be more than 50 characters long — not exactly something you can memorize.\n“People put them on laptops, storage drives, USBs,” said Brian Stoeckert, a legal consultant in the crypto field. “Lose one of them without having it backed up, and you are out of luck.”\nHowells didn’t realize the value of his coins for a few weeks after he lost them. “I looked up the price, did the calculation . . . and thought, ‘S - - t. [My investment is] worth around $2 [million] or $3 million.’ A few months later it was worth $9.9 million. I was annoyed, pissed off, sick. I spoke to the people at the landfill and told them that I threw away a hard drive worth $10 million. They looked at me stupidly.”\nHis story echoes a plotline in the recently wrapped season of the HBO show “Silicon Valley,” where blowhard venture capitalist Russ Hanneman, played by Chris Diamantopoulos, is seen leading a crew of hired trash pickers at the local dump, on a mission to turn up a mistakenly discarded thumb drive that contained the code needed to retrieve his $300 million in bitcoin.\nA scene from the HBO show “Silicon Valley.” Ali Paige Goldstein/HBO “We heard a lot of stories about people having incredibly long numbers [as their pass codes, known as private keys] and losing them,” series creator Mike Judge told The Post. “There’s definitely a part of the tech culture, Silicon Valley in particular, where people take pride in failure. But I don’t think losing a hard drive with your Bitcoin code on it falls into that category. I think it happens more than people want to admit.”\nAtlanta-based software developer Syl Turner, 33, can relate. After mining two bitcoins in 2010, he didn’t give much thought to the cryptocurrency and ended up moving the computer to his attic when he bought a new one.\nThen, “last November, [the value of a bitcoin] hit $10,000. Everybody was talking about bitcoin, and it seemed like I should go into the attic to find the computer,” he said.\nHe found what he was looking for but had inadvertently written over the hard drive — erasing his private key. “I’m pretty sure I wrote over it because bitcoin had no real monetary value at the time I did it,” Turner said.\nSo why don’t more people keep better track of their magic numbers? “It’s problematic in that if you have your code written down in too many places, people can find it and take your money,” said Judge. “But if it’s in too few places, you may not be able to find it yourself.”\nWhich can become a nightmare when investors pass away without having shared their private keys with their heirs.\nSyl Turner Matt Odom According to Michael Yang, who runs a cryptocurrency exchange in the Bay Area, “One of my friends had half of a bitcoin private key in his hand and half in his [business] partner’s hand. Then the partner passed away.” Now, the living friend cannot access the funds.\n“It’s a tragedy,” Yang added. “They had at least 500 bitcoins” — worth around $4 million. (A source close to Mellon’s family, meanwhile, denied they were unable to locate his money.)\nSome believe that bitcoin’s mysterious creator, Nakamoto, may have lost his private key. (Another theory is that he committed suicide and failed to leave the pass code behind.)\n“None of the [1 million] coins he mined have moved,” said Kim Grauer, senior economist with Chainalysis, a Manhattan-based digital forensics firm. “It’s odd that they have not been cashed out.”\nIf an investor remembers at least a portion of a pass code, a talented hacker could potentially use software to decrypt it. For someone like Howells, however, who has no clues to go on, “hacking it would take a couple billion years and require all the energy of the sun.”\nInstead, he’s offered the town of Newport 10 percent of the bitcoins’ value if they’ll let him excavate the landfill. So far, they’ve denied his requests.\nFor the time being, Howells views the dump as the ultimate safe. “Nobody else can get in there and take my hard drive,” he said. “It’s like having $75 million in the bank, but you cannot get into the bank account.”\nTurner, however, has learned his lesson and is done.\n“I have no crypto now and have little desire to get more,” he said. “Some [aspects] of it are fascinating. But it also seems like a cult.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Facebook Messenger WhatsApp Email Copy", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5669481/Family-friends-mourn-death-crypto-currency-billionaire-Matthew-Mellon.html", "https://nyp.st/2ku60BS", "https://nyp.st/2kqiiei&#038;appId=823934954307605", "https://nyp.st/2J6PCFk", "https://pagesix.com/2018/04/16/banking-heir-matthew-mellon-dies-in-rehab-facility/?_ga=2.139355123.1166307224.1527020424-294738100.1492024655"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matthew mellon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "james howells", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "howells", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mellon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "daily mail", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "newport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T04:27:54.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aa7e7e76cc007e0c3c8dba685ed3b2942fdd67ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMqMmEk2S8h2Usv7aUZkMKzQELWao5EmStcXDV25msT3_8v5v25CVuYRrEtXI3Xe5sYcw5dw95LeLAIj8y0Ew.gC6AizV_tUr_ySrVGpbgNiF2iXGJuULuvJed4PsJkZk0Q-", "site_full": "thephaser.com", "site": "thephaser.com", "site_section": "http://thephaser.com/feed/rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Phaser", "title": "CATHERINE AUSTIN FITTS BLACK BUDGET BITCOIN & MIND CONTROL!

Traders were expecting the Blockchain Week in New York to trigger a new bullish momentum, but the market lost $52 billion after a disappointing event . \\n\nBitcoin stalled below the $10,000 area in early May and has been steadily returning to the 2018 lows. Willy Woo, a BTC technical analyst with 62,500 followers on Twitter, is not very optimistic about where the market is moving next. Woo expects the market to give in to bears for a downswing towards $5500-$5700. \\n \\n I think we are gonna go to $5500-5700 next, I can't see $7000 holding. Most likely we'll balance a bit, then we'll slide through.

Using this article from 2017, https://news.bitcoin.com/cost-full-bitcoin-node/\n\"Bitcoin nodes commonly use 200 gigabytes upload or more a month and download around 20 gigabytes per month.\"\n200 * 1716 = 343200 GB upload per month 20 * 1716 = 34320 GB download per month\nIf linear scale, which is unlikely but just for the lulz, $20.43 per month according to /u/foragodrolo (from the article) times 1716 is $35,057.88 a month or $420,694.56 a year.\nOk so what does this all mean? Assuming linearly increasing costs, which would be inaccurate since things get cheaper when you make bulk purchases, it would cost almost half a million a year to run a full node if Bitcoin became visa level.\nThis is not actually too bad; hear me out.\n1) We're not there yet. We don't need 6.5 gig block size right now so the blocksize can just go up and up slowly, allowing technology to keep up which will constantly improve the ratio of hardware and other costs to performance.\n2) According to https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/v/financials?query=income-statement\n$10,827,000 (net income) - $5,438,000 (gross profit) = 5.38900 billion US$ expense in their annual income statement. This number includes the Cost of Revenue but if we didn't, that would add another 1.9 billion to the expense.\n$5.3 BILLION DOLLARS per year is what it costs to keep this huge centralized monster of a payment system up and running. That's 5.3 thousand millions when your full node would only cost half a million a year to run.\nHalf a million a year is quite expensive but cheap enough for large firms and sovereign powers to arbitrarily run full nodes.\nThere could also be future improvements where light nodes become a common thing with pruned data and full nodes only existing in archives for historical data.\nSo in conclusion, it's possible to amp it up to VISA levels right now if we're willing to accept a modicum of centralization. It would still be far more decentralized than what we have and a huge improvement but not the total decentralized utopian dream.

The strategy game was created by two cryptocurrency investors who were tired of hearing about people doing unbelievable things like selling their home or using their student loan money to go ‘all in’ on a portfolio of digital assets.\nAlso read: Project to Build Satoshi Statue Gains Support in Kiev Win Big or Lose it All Playin ‘Bitcon’\nTwo guys named Brandon and Sam who call themselves the ‘two stupid investors,’ created a tabletop card game that replicates cryptocurrency investing called ‘Bitcon.’ Basically, players are dealt a hand of five cards each and players draw cards in sequence to find out if the market goes up or down, or maybe even collapse. Alongside cards that move the market, there are also other action cards like the ‘Reverse the Market’ card which changes the direction of the current market trend. There’s also the ‘Cash Out’ card which can enable a player to cash out and cause the next player to pick up the remaining cards. Moreover, each deck of Bitcon cards has three ‘Pop’ cards — a card that serves as market collapse warning and when the last card is used the bitcoin market crashes and the game ends.\nThe two creators who designed the Bitcon card game say they kept hearing about individuals doing wild and unbelievable things to obtain bitcoin. Then soon scouring Reddit forums and social media their game concept became an amusing simulation showcasing the risks and rewards tied to cryptocurrency investments.\n“If you like fast-paced strategy games, laugh at people that sold their house to buy bitcoin, or simply want to show grandma how to lose all your cash online,” explains the creators of Bitcon.\nBuy Bitcon — You’ll soon be addicted to losing all your money. A Representation of What it Feels Like Riding Markets Up and Down\nThe Bitcon creators say they wanted to create a game that allows the “ thrills of being a big money investor with zero risks.” According to the Kickstarter campaign, a Bitcon strategy tournament can be roughly fifteen minutes of gameplay.\n“Bitcon is our perfect representation of what it feels like riding markets up and down, using strategy to protect yourself but also attack opponents, and be ready to cash out your position before your investment is fully lost,”\nIts 15 minutes of pure strategy, pace, and gambling. Betting addicts we’ve found you a solution .\nBitcon is not the first Kickstarter card game campaign featuring a bitcoin-esque theme as news.Bitcoin.com reported on Bitcoin Empire back in January of 2017. The game featured many cryptocurrency luminaries within the industry and even a Pepe the frog playing card. However, the Bitcoin Empire funding on Kickstarter was unsuccessful as the team didn’t meet the £5,000 goal.\nWhat do you think about the Bitcon card game?

Whereas increasingly more Preliminary Coin Choices (ICOs) emerge today, the not too long ago funded firms face the very obstacle that has haunted the Blockchain trade for the reason that begin - cashing out cryptocurrencies into a checking account. Firms launched by way of an IPO must pay taxes, with traders having to pay capital gains tax, whilst for ICOs, the corporate might not be topic to direct tax, solely the investor being required to pay capital beneficial properties tax. Pre-ICO funds don't have anything to do with the ICO, which is just a crowdsale of tokens by a Smart Contract. It is not uncommon to incrementally elevate the price of an ICO coin as more money is earned, and displaying earnings may also help rapidly accelerate interest within the ICO. Absolutely no bona fide financial know-how agency, innovation investor or electronic buying and selling company would elect an individual who's banned from operating, and no accountancy firm would log out any incorporation certificates with somebody of such business character as a key particular person, https://ico.echat.io/ however in the crypto currency and ICO world, there is no such https://ico.echat.io/ thing as a such factor as officialdom. In echat for mining accordance with The Economist, ICOs are digital coupons, tokens issued on an indelible distributed ledger, or blockchain, mining of the kind that mining underpins bitcoin, a crypto-foreign money. The strategic objective of the platform is to supply a network which enables participants to securely communicate, conduct monetary mining rig cooling transactions and manage their money all via our Telegraf cell Messenger bank app. Actually, OneGram's unique worth proposition combines a solid funding - gold - with full Sharia-compliance and some great benefits of crypto-secured digital cash. Most individuals managed to recoup their investment, but many of them grew to become wary of ICOs. \"Crypto-traders can join by investing in the existing portfolio companies and turn into a part of the brand new fund. FinanceFeeds has made its place very clear with regard to the hysteria that presently surrounds Preliminary Coin Choices (ICOs) which are presently pervading each facet of technological and financial media globally, and might be written off as a buzzword-infused non-entity of hipsters trying to make a name for themselves on social media channels, as clearly any skilled with a modicum of expertise in monetary know-how development or the parts of digital financial markets will absolutely steer properly clear. Retail investors aren't the one South Koreans excited about cryptocurrencies; a number of the country's biggest companies are pouring cash into digital-forex companies and associated applied sciences. In the simplest of phrases, the method of the ICO boils down to this: You ship some ether to an handle, and after the ICO's carried out, you get tokens in an amount proportionate to the quantity of ether you have despatched. And also you really find yourself dropping your investment as a substitute of earning money from ICO. Due diligence tends to be expensive and in relation to cryptocurrency economies and ICOs, the market is starting to see the presence of score agencies, who conduct the due diligence, finishing up the necessary analysis of the information at hand, with the rating businesses publishing their analysis decreasing a few of the dangers related to investing in ICOs, self-policing coming in forward of any extra formal regulatory oversight. (By no means send cash to an ICO from an exchange; always ship from a wallet such as Parity or MEW.) On the time of the ICO, you will ship this ether to the ICO contract address. After largely letting the ICO market develop with no guidance, the SEC this summer season warned startups that they could be violating securities laws with the token sales. The investors count on the worth of the obtained tokens to rise over time, with the option to promote the tokens on on-line exchanges like Bittrex or Poloniex at a higher price than the preliminary purchase price. A variety of extra ahead-thinking enterprise capitalists, similar to Fred Wilson at Union Sq. Ventures and Tim Draper at Draper Fisher Jurvetson, have been a few of the most vocal believers in ICOs. Now, the STK Token will advance our mission to supply a universally accessible platform to retailer money safely, entry it immediately and transact with it anywhere, in any currency, together with crypto. The funds are paid via Ethereum or Bitcoin and in alternate for these funds, the traders get back tokens. You may make some huge cash with ICOs, but you too can lose them fast if you are not cautious. The individuals running a blockchain laptop undertaking referred to as Tezos staged a massively successful fundraiser in July. Among the calendar sites, like ICO Scores , even provide free detailed reviews on ICOs, and whether they're price investing in. If you find something you are involved in investing, go to the developer's web site and ensure they are a professional business. The shift in focus away from the use of venture capitalists for fund raising has taken the market by storm and the numbers of ICOs proceed to rise, with the liquidity associated with ICOs over VC funding driving buyers into a frenzy.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://matinbank.ir/component/k2/itemlist/user/1615629.html", "http://103.pp.ua/?option=com_k2&view=itemlist&task=user&id=428328", "http://matinbank.ir/", "https://ico.echat.io/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "darrin darley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ico", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T03:08:01.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b763c48985816213ce990f314a5937a708634518", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeqQMe90ltUbkow9LuvTJSls5RWUs1sydqHdlJUrJ2GRQxQiLECMoKASRuqTvt7qGOq9BSicX3zpCt7Sw7XOKj9ytnxDc2NV4JL7sJKsibYqyd0mdaCSWfe3.XIxAuHUFu2IO41UoFvQ--", "site_full": "alterminds.xyz", "site": "alterminds.xyz", "site_section": "http://alterminds.xyz/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Alter Minds", "title": "Rapid Growth of Lightning Network Payment Channels Paints a Bright Future for Bitcoin", "title_full": "Rapid Growth of Lightning Network Payment Channels Paints a Bright Future for Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-27T03:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b763c48985816213ce990f314a5937a708634518", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeqQMe90ltUbkow9LuvTJSls5RWUs1sydqHdlJUrJ2GRQxQiLECMoKASRuqTvt7qGOq9BSicX3zpCt7Sw7XOKj9ytnxDc2NV4JL7sJKsibYqyd0mdaCSWfe3.XIxAuHUFu2IO41UoFvQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alter Minds", "published": "2018-05-27T03:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "Rapid Growth of Lightning Network Payment Channels Paints a Bright Future for Bitcoin", "text": "\nThe Bitcoin ecosystem is set to undergo some major changes. One of the bigger upcoming developments is the Lightning Network. Over the past few months, thousands of new payment channels have been established, signalling a major step in the right direction toward mass adoption of this new technology. The Lightning Network Payment Channels Scaling Bitcoin to offer instant and cheap transactions requires major developments. This code upgrade is known as the Lightning Network. It allows users to open direct payment channels between one another on a global scale. Doing so requires the necessary network participation. Without sufficient support, the Lightning Network will not make any meaningful impact. Earlier this year, things did not look all that promising. Just 89 channels existed on January 19th. To some people, it showed how this scaling solution is unfeasible. Others considered it to be a lack of adoption because the technology is still not finished. Instead, it is being tested under open beta rules and caution remains advised at all times. Fast forward to a few days ago, and the number of channels has grown significantly. As of May 24th, over 6,600 direct connections exist. It is still a drop in the proverbial bucket when looking at the financial sector. However, it also confirms there is genuine interest in this technology. Scaling Bitcoin will remain an ongoing process for some time to come. These numbers may look very different a year from today. Looking Ahead Even though this growth is impressive, not everyone is convinced. Until the Lightning Network technology is fully developed, adoption will remain relatively low. Various important aspects still need to be implemented. There is no double-sided funding, no watching for offline transfers, and so forth. All of these issues will – hopefully – be addressed by the developers in the future. Most small and traditional purchases do not necessarily require all of those advanced features. However, the current implementation of the Lightning Network will not necessarily suit everyone. Giving users a lot of different options will remain one of the top priorities. After nearly nine years of development, it seems things are finally looking up for Bitcoin. Scalability has always been the Achilles heel of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. The Lightning Network may not solve all of the problems in one go. With constant updates and refinements, it will eventually turn into a global payment ecosystem. That is, if enough people embrace this new technology for everyday purposes. Featured image from Shutterstock.

However, one might have not known that the new regulations also had severe consequences for some services that had to shut down.\nOn Monday we reported that team behind Parity Technologies, the developers of the Parity multi-signature wallet, have announced that due to GDPR they are shutting down PICOPS, a service used by ICO campaigns to comply with KYC/AML regulations by validating that the owner of an Ethereum wallet has already passed an ID background check. Crypto Revolution Reshaping Global Politics\nThe intersection of politics and cryptocurrency was our main focus on Tuesday. We reported that Iranian and Russian lawmakers are jointly examining the idea of using cryptocurrency to bypass international and American sanctions. And in the US, Congressional candidate Brian Forde raised $100,000 in cryptocurrency donations, and an opponent attacked him for this, referring to his donors as “bitcoin speculators that oppose cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.”\nWe also reported that Vitalik Buterin has co-written a short manifesto of sorts with the young political economist Glen Weyl, unapologetically titled “Liberation Through Radical Decentralization.” In it they explain how the cryptocurrency ecosystem is suited for developing and testing new models for governance, voting and more, in a way that can fundamentally change how both democracy and capitalism work. McAfee Predicts Bull Run as Crypto Markets Dip\nJohn McAfee’s prediction of a bull run on the cryptocurrency markets in the near future was one of the most discussed issues on Wednesday. Billions will be pumped by institutional investors, the internet security expert expects. McAfee claims this will lead to significant changes in the market capitalizations of the leading cryptocurrencies, but also those of most altcoins.\n“Institutional investors are preparing to enter the cryptocurrency market with a vengeance,” McAfee said. He explained that they are generally long term investors that will spend billions on the market. “Expect the top ten coins to go through the roof fairly quickly. The bulk of altcoins will soon follow,” the software guru wrote. Admitting he had no more information than his followers, John McAfee advised them to check the recent news and use their heads. Main Street Adopts Bitcoin Ahead of Wall Street\nOn Thursday we reported that Deutsche Börse AG, the group which operates the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, is actively examining its options for launching cryptocurrency derivatives. This was revealed by Jeffrey Tessler, CEO of the post-trade services provider owned by Deutsche Börse Clearstream and member of the group’s executive board. And changes to the Volcker Rule give Americans a new reason for moving their money away from big banks to cryptocurrencies, according to the latest analysis by Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratings. Luxury Jets, Cheap Air Tickets Offered for BCH\nThe growing number of bitcoin cash adoptions has been in the headlines on Friday. White Company, founded by former executive at Formula 1 and LVMH, Elizabeth White, which offers high-end products and luxury brands, including fine watches and sports cars, has become the latest business to accept BCH payments. And the online travel agency Cheapair.com has also announced it started accepting bitcoin cash for booking flights and hotels. Man Goes All In on Crypto\nThe most commented on story of the week talked about a guy living is his car while working two jobs just to invest it all in crypto. The Canadian man explains that he parks his car in his friend’s garage to sleep, for which he pays $40 CAD per month. Despite the cramped conditions, he hasn’t forgone all home comforts, finding space to squeeze in a memory foam mattress and comfy quilts. He’s also able to shower at a friend’s house and store some items there. As for his crypto portfolio, the unnamed Canadian is currently pinning his hopes on Collosusxt, Fundrequest, Policypal, and Dero.

An early morning rally saw Bitcoin break into $7,600 levels with an intraday high $7,624.1, coming within reach of the day’s first major resistance level at $7,634.53 before easing back to $7,500 levels and a particularly range bound afternoon that left the day’s support and resistance levels untested until a late in the day sell-off. Bitcoin fell through the day’s first major support level at $7,298.63 to an intraday low $7,281 before recovering to $7,300 levels by the day’s end. Failing to break through the day’s first major resistance level, while testing the day’s first major support level reaffirmed the bearish trend formed in early May, with Bitcoin coming nowhere near the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level at $7,906.4 and $8,000 levels needed to begin a bearish trend reversal. There was no materially negative news hitting the wires to pin Bitcoin back through the day, with investor sentiment continuing to be on the bearish side following news out of the U.S, South Korea and Japan in recent weeks on probes into cryptomarket exchanges and trading practices. Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down 0.81% to $7,268, with the late Saturday sell-off spilling into the early hours of the day. A start of the day intraday low and new swing lo $7,220 managed to hold above the day’s first major support level at $7,191.9 before recovering to current levels, though the Bitcoin bulls are certainly not out of the woods yet, with Bitcoin’s first major resistance level at $7,535 and 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $7,906.4 some way off. For the day ahead, a move back through the morning’s $7,330.8 high to $7,410 would support a run at the day’s first major resistance level at $7,535 before any reversal, with Bitcoin investors likely to face plenty of resistance at $7,500, pinning back any run at the day’s second major resistance level at $7,751 and the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $7,906.4. Investors have continued to lock in profits early, leading to the downward trend in daily highs, with Bitcoin now having failed to touch $8,000 levels for a 3 rd consecutive day. Failing to move back through to $7,400 levels would support another day in the red, with Bitcoin likely to test the day’s first major support level at $7,191.9 and the second major support level at $7,064.9 before any recovery. How far Bitcoin slides before a bearish trend reversal kicks in remains to be seen, but sub-$6,000 levels will likely be in sight, particularly when considering what’s to come for the cryptomarkets this summer, global and ‘in-country’ regulations expected to hit the markets hard. With Bitcoin in the red, the rest of the majors followed, Stellar’s Lumen seeing the heaviest losses, down 2.97%, with Monero down 2.33% and Bitcoin Cash down 2.37% and things could get worse should hopes of a weekend rally continue to fade through the morning.

The appropriate responses were, “that is not valid, once the trustee cash is made, no extra vitality is required.”\nPresently, by far most of individuals are contrasting bitcoin power utilization and the generation of paper cash in national banks like the Central bank, disposing of difficult work, vitality and power expected to convey and exchange cash. Fiat requires business banks, national banks:\nATMs, shielded vehicles, a huge number of representatives, in addition to other things, to work. The national bank, for this situation the FED, does not mysteriously disseminate the US dollar to each individual in the nation that is around the bend. The FED circulates its US dollar to banks and their companions, who at that point convey cash in the expectation of separating the dollar to the base of the economy. Money requires a genuinely monstrous foundation to work:\nIn the Assembled States alone, there are in excess of 6,000 banks that procedure money exchanges. The vast majority never again utilize trade out their physical shape to make exchanges. They depend on outside specialist co-ops and banks, for example, JPMorgan, Visa and MasterCard to process installments. The measure of assets and vitality devoured by these organizations and their a huge number of workers ought to be incorporated into the examination between the vitality utilization of bitcoin and the banks.\nBitcoin is a shared budgetary system and because of its decentralized nature, an outsider isn’t required to perform exchanges. Alice can send Weave $ 100 transmitting the exchange to mempool, which the diggers gather for preparing. Consequently, mineworkers are urged to get bitcoin and exchange expenses incorporated into the square.\nConsequently, in spite of the fact that it might be precise to state that it requires greater power to remove cryptographic forms of money, it is false to state that to make or produce bitcoin, a bigger number of assets are required than to make money or paper cash, since the vast majority of the vitality utilized by the Diggers are owing to the affirmation and approval exchanges, which most banks perform all inclusive.\nChange John Lilic, individual from the blockchain advancement consider Ethereum, ConsenSys:\nexpressed that the cost per exchange is essentially higher with crypto and that is without a doubt revise. Real banks like JPMorgan process trillions of dollars every day. Lilic said that, in the long haul, blockchain tasks should discover better approaches to process exchanges and data all the more productively. “The cost per unit of every tx is fundamentally higher with crypto:\nThe server farm banks they utilize are considerably more effective than mining activities and heritage frameworks process requests of size more tx every day than cryptographic ones. The genuine inquiry is whether the gross expenses of crypto vitality wastefulness are justified regardless of the advantages, for example, the care of the assets.Your sentiment is yes! It is justified, despite all the trouble, yet just if our industry organizes and keeps on attempting to get upgrades in vitality proficiency like Evidence of Stake. ” As digital currencies and blockchain innovation develop:\nthey will explore different avenues regarding more effective strategies for agreement calculations and mining techniques that can diminish the long haul vitality generation of cryptographic forms of money.

He then recalled that instead of throwing the empty thumb drive, he mistakenly threw away the thumb drive with his private keys.\n“I mined more than 7,500 coins over one week’s time in 2009; there were just six of us doing it at the time, and it was like the early days of a gold rush. Four years later, I had two hard drives in a desk drawer. One was empty, and the other contained my bitcoin private keys. I meant to throw away the empty drive — and I accidentally threw away the one with the bitcoin information,” said Howells.\nBitcoin is a unique digital asset because it forces its users to take responsibility over their funds and eliminates the possibility of central institutions or third party service providers gaining access to user funds. One downside of this aspect of BTC is that if and when a user loses private keys to a wallet, it is impossible to recover the funds, however large the amount may be.\nAfter realising that he had thrown away millions of dollars, Howells admitted that he had felt physically sick. Howells stated:\n“I looked up the price, did the calculation . . . and thought, ‘S –– t. [My investment is] worth around $2 [million] or $3 million.’ A few months later it was worth $9.9 million. I was annoyed, pissed off, sick. I spoke to the people at the landfill and told them that I threw away a hard drive worth $10 million. They looked at me stupidly.” Bitcoin is Undervalued\nMillions of bitcoin are permanently lost from its immutable blockchain network because of cases like the loss of funds of Howells. A study done by Chainalysis , a blockchain-focused digital forensics company, found that 3.79 million BTC are potentially lost permanently and can no longer be re-obtained.\n3.79 million is more than 18 percent of the maximum supply of BTC, 21 million. Given that the price of bitcoin is calculated by dividing the market valuation of the digital asset by its circulating supply, when the supply of bitcoin maxes out at 21 million, the price of bitcoin should be 18 percent higher than its actual price.\n“On the one hand, direct calculations about market cap do not take lost coins into consideration. Considering how highly speculative this field is, those market cap calculations may make it into economic models of the market that impact spending activity. Yet the market has adapted to the actual demand and supply available – just look at exchange behavior,” Chainalysis enior economist Kim Gauer said.\nImages from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T00:39:50.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "68ad629ebc293958836e3186cd70b127577c9830", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSzjtu0HDW9OgbLj8lGazfVs-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "68ad629ebc293958836e3186cd70b127577c9830", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSzjtu0HDW9OgbLj8lGazfVs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nYou can trust us with 100%, we always pay!

Another Japanese Exchange Wants to Borrow Your Cryptocurrencies Date:\nExchanges Sponsored Links\nAnother government-approved Japanese cryptocurrency exchange has launched a program to borrow cryptocurrencies from its members. The exchange seeks to borrow 1 BTC or more. Initially, only BTC will be borrowed, but the exchange plans to add other cryptocurrencies including BCH, XRP, ETH, and LTC.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Bitbank Will Pay for Crypto Loans\nBitbank is one of the 16 fully-licensed cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan. Announcing a new service on Friday for customers to rent out their cryptocurrencies, the company explains:\n‘Virtual Currency Lending’ is a service that allows customers to enter virtual currency lending transactions with Bitbank and receive up to 5% virtual currency per year…When we reach the expiration date of one year, we will reimburse by adding the specified usage fee to the virtual currency lent by customers in the month of offering.\nMembers with an account at Bitbank can start using this service, the exchange detailed, adding that only BTC can be rented out currently, “but we will also sequentially support other virtual currencies” such as “ripple, litecoin, ether, monacoin, bitcoin cash etc.” Program Terms\n“In principle, the virtual currency lent by the customer is locked until the predetermined loan period has elapsed,” therefore it cannot be sold or transferred “unless the loan term expires or we return it,” Bitbank described.\nThe loan period is 12 months. Before the loan period begins, Bitbank will hold a “recruitment month” for customers to apply for the program. For example, “If the recruitment month is January 2018, the period of use fee will be from February 1st to January 31st, 2019,” the exchange clarified. Fee chart provided by Bitbank.\n“The usage fee is calculated by the quantity of the target virtual currency in which the transfer was made within the period for each recruitment month,” Bitbank elaborated. The minimum amount the company will borrow is 1 BTC and the maximum is 25 BTC. Bitbank will pay 3 percent to borrow any amount less than 5 BTC, 4 percent for an amount of 5 BTC but less than 10 BTC, and 5 percent for an amount 10 BTC or more.\nIf customers cancel the loan contracts mid-way, a five percent fee, which includes applicable taxes, will be levied. Competing with GMO\nAnother fully-licensed Japanese crypto exchange, GMO Coin, operated by GMO Internet, launched a similar service in April. Initially, only BTC was supported but the company extended its offerings to BCH, ETH, LTC, and XRP earlier this month.\nGMO’s loan terms are 90 days for BTC and 150 days for other coins, which are shorter than Bitbank’s terms. In addition, GMO seeks to borrow a larger amount of coins, from 10 BTC to 100 BTC, paying a fee of 5 percent for all loans.\nWhat do you think of Bitbank’s offerings?

Bitcoins and Basset Hounds\nLast weekend, Patricia Howell lost her basset hound, Happy. She quickly took to local online forums and in-town pet communities, posting pictures of the dog and her telephone number while asking people to call her right away if they had seen him.\nWithin a few days, she received a text message from a burner phone demanding $600 in Bitcoin or else Happy would be sold off or even killed. The scammer claimed to be using a burner phone, supposedly so that the call couldn't be traced, and advised Howell not to go to the police.\nThe only issue was Howell had been reunited with Happy earlier that day thanks to the help of someone who had seen the online post. Apparently, the scammer had found her personal phone number from the lost dog advertisements.\nHowell immediately recognized it as a scam as she could literally see her dog. She reported the call to the police, who said that they had heard of similar cases from around the country. Fake Threats Becoming Common\nAnother North Carolina resident and his duo of dogs also fell victim to the same scam. After posting his information on websites that look to help people find lost dogs, he received an all-too-similar text message from a burner phone, demanding approximately $2,000 in Bitcoin or his dogs would be killed in less than ten days. Like the case with Howell, the dogs were already back with the owner before the text message was sent out.\nIt seems scammers are hoping that the attachment that owners have for their pets will convince them to pay up. Not to mention the ease of Bitcoin transactions along with the lack of actually having to physically receive any ransom demand. In the end, Howell says it best when she states:\nThey need to find a better way to make money. They need to leave people alone and realize that what they're doing is hurtful and so cruel.
