in this case and the Pune Police arrested Bhardwaj and his brother Vivek from Delhi earlier.\nBhardwaj reportedly was behind ventures like GainBitcoin, GBMiners, MCAP and GB21, and the investors were allegedly duped after transactions on these portals.\nThe central agency has expanded its probe into this case and is also investigating related bitcoin or cryptocurrency transactions that are under

+ Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty’s husband and businessman Raj Kundra hetty has reportedly been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with an alleged bitcoin scam. He is presently being questioned in Mumbai, according to ANI. Kundra was questioned in connection with a Rs 2000-crore Bitcoin scam that ED is probing. His name came up when Amit Bharadwaj, an accused in the case, was being questioned. In May, the cyber cell of Chandigarh police booked six people, including Bhardwaj, who was arrested from Delhi by the Pune police in April in connection with an alleged multi-crore bitcoin Ponzi scheme. Bhardwaj, director of Gainbitcoin, was charged with duping investors after promising them handsome returns on investing in bitcoin. Bhardwaj allegedly duped more than 8,000 people to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore from across the country. The Income Tax Department had recently sent notices to bitcoin users who were dealing in bitcoins worth Rs 1 crore or more daily.

This is according to a research conducted by Google Trends .\nCNBC , which reported these findings, talked with the co-founder of Datatrek Research and Wall Street Bitcoin analyst, Nicholas Colas, who believes that this statistics is linked to the drop in Bitcoin price during that time frame. The price of the leading cryptocurrency has dropped by over 50% since the start of the year.\nWhile addressing his clients via email, Colas stated that;\nBitcoin needs a new narrative in order to reestablish global attention.\nGoogle Trend conducts research and analyzes the popularity of some web searches at different times. According to their ranking, a web search that reaches 100 has attained peak popularity. The popularity of Bitcoin on web searches was 37 at the start of the year but has dropped by 75% over time to now stand at a low of 9 at the start of this month.\nColas further added that the decrease in the number of new Bitcoin wallets since the start of the year compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 also played a huge factor in this statistic. The growth of newly created Bitcoin wallets has dipped to 3.7% this year, which is low compared to the 7.6% recorded month in the fourth quarter of 2017. He concluded that;\nBitcoin wallet growth needs to be +5 percent/month to see meaningful price appreciation.\nBitcoin isn’t the only cryptocurrency facing this dilemma, with the web search of other major cryptocurrencies also in decline. The second largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap, Ethereum has seen its search drop by 70% since the start of the year, while the third and fourth placed Ripple and Bitcoin Cash dipped by 87% and 82% respectively. Though, Ethereum’s search volume dropped but still it managed to surpass 100 million searches .\nUnsurprisingly, fifth-placed EOS has seen a reverse in fortune as its web searches have surged by 97% this year alone, with CNBC attributing that rise to Block.one’s recently concluded ICO, which lasted for a year and raised a record-breaking $4 billion in the process.

The cryptocurrency had been allegedly earned through the provision of illicit pornographic content.\nA Case Stretched in Time A legal case took place last year involving 33-year old Ahn, who had been operating an illegal pornography site in South Korea since December 2013. He was arrested in May 2017. The prosecution found that the individual had accumulated a total of 216 bitcoins at the time of his arrest.\nUnder the premise that Ahn had acquired Bitcoin through criminal activity, the prosecution demanded that the convict's cryptocurrency should immediately be confiscated.\nYet, applying the laws by the letter, Suwon's District Court ruled that:\nIt is not appropriate to confiscate bitcoins because they are in the form of electronic files without physical entities, unlike cash. […] Virtual currency cannot assume an objective standard value.\nThe decision of the court was appealed, leaving it to the discretion of the country's Supreme Court.\nNew Development Taking Place On May 30, 2018, South Korea's Supreme Court banged the gavel and ruled in an entirely different light. The country's highest magistrates confirmed the appeal, allowing the prosecution to seize 191 of the 216 bitcoins.\nThe court ruled that exactly 191 units of the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had been accumulated through the website distributing illegal online content.\nThe Supreme Court's merit for the ruling was that:\nThe cryptocurrency is recognized to have value so it can be confiscated.\nGoing further, taking the Penal Code of South Korea into account, the court also stated that:\nThe bitcoins were earned from the proceeds of crime. […] If we return the bitcoins to Ahn, it will be giving him back profits that were earned illegally from running an online porn site.\nA loss for Ahn, A Victory for Cryptocurrencies While it's true that not all of Ahn's bitcoins fell under the range of the ruling, the Supreme Court's decision offers some legislative clarity on the matter of cryptocurrencies — for once, it recognized them as a traditional asset class.\nThe Supreme Court in South Korea is second only to the country's Constitutional Court in terms of legislative capabilities. While its rulings do not constitute laws or even legal directions, the fact that such a high legislative authority recognizes Bitcoin as an asset class surely carries some weight.\nFor what is worth, we've seen a lot of movement on that front in the past month. First, the country's Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) declared that the government is set to review the currently existing regulations. Later on — at the end of May — we saw the country's National Assembly proposing a permit for domestic Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).\nDo you think South Korea is moving in the right direction towards transparent regulation for cryptocurrencies?

Kundra’s name turned up in the report following alleged links with Bitcoin scamster Amit Bhardwaj. He is currently being questioned in the ED’s Mumbai branch. According to media reports, Bhardwaj had started the country’s first online marketplace which accepted bitcoins and had also started bitcoin mining start-ups. He reportedly lured in investors with promises of hefty returns, assuring the investors of access to the bitcoin mining system that would let them mine their own bitcoins. Kundra had allegedly promoted one of Bhardwaj’s operations. In May, the Gujarat branch of Criminal Investigation Department (CID) had arrested Kirit Paladiya for stealing bitcoins from his partner. According to the police authorities, Paladiya stole 176 bitcoins worth over Rs 9 crore from his partner, Shailesh Bhatt. Also, Amreli’s Superintendent of Police Jagdish Patel, Amreli local Crime Branch inspector Anant Patel and two other constables were arrested for being involved in the case.

Wozniak responded by saying that he hopes that vision works out.\n“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking,” said Wozniak.\nThe Apple co-founder reiterated that he isn’t an investor but rather a supportive technologist. Wozniak bought bitcoin when it was $700, but recently sold most of his holdings after finding that he spent too much time watching price movements.\nWozniak said that while he may not necessarily believe what Dorsey predicted, he still thinks that bitcoin is “pure” and the true equivalent of digital gold.\n“Bitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed… and it’s pure and there’s no human running, there’s no company running and it’s just… growing and growing… and surviving, that to me says something that is natural and nature is more important than all our human conventions,” he said.\nWozniak aslo said that many other cryptocurrencies lack qualities that make bitcoin special.\n“Only bitcoin is pure digital gold… and I totally buy into that,” he said. “All the others tend to give up some of the aspects of bitcoin. For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control. That’s the first one they have to give up to try to have a business model.” Search for:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david pimentel apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amsterdam", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T08:16:54.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4540057b9cf103d6f8f10aa00ad2e180bf27e654", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va7ySrBJbKaFBkv0wwlo18jgV919O4oglMeto0lQypKtEgZe.LHZsKVHtkrxv1x.y_EETtsmfN.Zr9ybArbjwZBMGxHrhbEFVO2w--", "site_full": "bitcoin.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Bitcoin Stack Exchange", "title": "What transactions didn't make it to the Bitcoin blockchain?", "title_full": "What transactions didn't make it to the Bitcoin blockchain?", "published": "2018-06-05T11:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/bitcoin/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=462e8b9b382b", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 179, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4540057b9cf103d6f8f10aa00ad2e180bf27e654", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va7ySrBJbKaFBkv0wwlo18jgV919O4oglMeto0lQypKtEgZe.LHZsKVHtkrxv1x.y_EETtsmfN.Zr9ybArbjwZBMGxHrhbEFVO2w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jack Casas", "published": "2018-06-05T11:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "What transactions didn't make it to the Bitcoin blockchain?", "text": "up vote 0 down vote favorite\nBitcoin,I want to transfer some Amount so I broadcast a transaction that is picked up by miners.

BTC\\/USD could correct higher, but upsides are likely to be capped. Bitcoin Price Analysis\nAfter trading above the $7,700 level, bitcoin price faced selling pressure against the US Dollar. The BTC\\/USD pair topped at $7,779 and started a downside move. The price declined and moved below the $7,600 and $7,500 support levels. The most important move was a close below the $7,550 pivot level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nMoreover, there was a break below a major ascending channel with support at $7,520 on the hourly chart of the BTC\\/USD pair. The pair even moved below the $7,400 level a formed a new intraday low at $7,369. At the moment, the price is consolidating losses around $7,400. An initial resistance is around the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,779 high to $7,369 low. Any further gains could push the price towards the $7,550 pivot level, which is a major barrier . Additionally, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,779 high to $7,369 low is at $7,574.\nLooking at the chart , the price likely moved into a short-term bearish zone below $7,550.

June 5, 2018 109\nFiat currencies are in turmoil across the globe, and as trade wars and the crushing blow of sanctions are hoisted on various nations by western powers, the alternative currency market may be attracting a number of world leaders looking to bypass the US dollar. For countries like Iran and North Korea, desperate to get their goods back on the market, it seems cryptocurrencies may become a viable way around the hegemony of the US dollar. And as the nations most affected by a growing series of brutal sanctions and draconian trade tariffs are forced into seeking alternatives, the enforcers of global policy would be missing a golden opportunity if they weren’t themselves already invested in the very currencies available to these ‘enemies’ of the free world.\nDonald Trump himself has made a number of remarks regarding Bitcoin (BTC) and the coin market since taking office. While being careful not to take a hard stance for or against the trading of alternative currencies, it is clear that he is watching the markets with some interest. And as his global trade wars escalate, forcing the hand of partners and foes alike, it would stand to reason that Bitcoin will most likely be the coin of choice for rogue nations like Iran and North Korea.\nBitcoin (BTC) is still the undisputed king of the alternative currency market, although Ripple CEO believes it will come to an end. And with the power of name recognition alone, the less savvy players of the developing world may look immediately into the benefits of secure person-to-person transactions available through the world’s best-known cryptocurrency. The delayed transactions and hefty fees the original blockchain is known for can be easily over-looked as nations damaged by sanctions seek to push their products back onto the market.\nAnd if smart contracts are necessary to facilitate the more intricate trading needs of nation-states, Ethereum (ETH) could provide the framework necessary for exchange to occur. While lesser known currencies are quickly developing the means to do Ethereum’s job with less friction, the number two token available to consumers is by far the more recognized currency for legal transactions tracked on the blockchain.\nBut Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum aren’t the only game in town these days. Ripple (XRP) , currently fighting the Securities and Exchange Commission over a series of potential violations, has proven itself quite effective at cross-border transactions where the parties involved may not be holding the US dollar as a preferred medium of exchange. With over one hundred institutions experimenting with the token, it could easily fit the bill for countries looking to trade their goods without the worlds policemen watching too closely.\nAs the world reels from the sanctions placed on their countries by Trump and the US State Department, the nations most affected may look to the cryptocurrency market as a viable way to navigate around the barriers of US dollar hegemony. Whether with Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) or Ripple (XRP) , the benefits of the alternative currency market will allow many nations to create unconventional trade deals, benefitting savvy investors, already hodling the chosen currencies in question.\nWith these facts in mind, it isn’t hard to imagine Donald Trump (and other members of US leadership) pushing nations further into cryptocurrency markets and driving prices to new highs.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

He is presently being questioned in Mumbai, according to ANI. The income tax department recently sent notices to bitcoin traders who were trading more than Rs1 crore daily. ED is examining these cases further on the alleged grounds of money laundering and fraud. Bitcoin is a virtual currency that works on the decentralized ledger. Unlike your bank where all transactions are centralized, Bitcoin transactions are validated by the group of miners, who are rewarded with a new Bitcoin for validating the transaction. RBI has cautioned bitcoin users many times given the high risk involved with trading in virtual currencies. Recently, Reserve Bank of India in its last monetary policy committee meeting said banks are no more allowed to deal with crypto-currency exchanges. Currently, there are around 3 million people in India who have been dealing in Rs 100 to 200 crore worth of crypto-currencies every day. RBI stated in a circular that was released on April 6, 2018, “Reserve Bank has repeatedly through its public notices on December 24, 2013, February 01, 2017 and December 05, 2017, cautioned users, holders and traders of virtual currencies, including Bitcoins, regarding various risks associated in dealing with such virtual currencies. In view of the associated risks, it has been decided that, with immediate effect, entities regulated by the Reserve Bank shall not deal in VCs or provide services for facilitating any person or entity in dealing with or settling VCs. “ The notice further stated, “Such services include maintaining accounts, registering, trading, settling, clearing, giving loans against virtual tokens, accepting them as collateral, opening accounts of exchanges dealing with them and transfer / receipt of money in accounts relating to purchase/ sale of VCs. Regulated entities which already provide such services shall exit the relationship within three months from the date of this circular.”\nSource: India.com Related", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.india.com/business/enforcement-directorate-summons-raj-kundra-in-connection-with-bitcoin-scam-case-3092936/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "enfor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shilpa shetty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raj kundra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ed", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reserve bank of india", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T12:07:11.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c824f1bb6886e068423c6d46ec662aa77d0e3a54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR38J5TX0DNaekMOpkE2LbuCMeCBwENxfB7xu1qLSCQlHLr1vVdxcIQGzG7p498hdNSzN7TG4iyf6bFqTlFnYCEDOMhqJxX7yKVdjVd.m37eCFkG_S.YYPr6XC0cf32mG8-", "site_full": "www.aninews.in", "site": "aninews.in", "site_section": "https://www.aninews.in/category/business/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "ANI Business News - India Stock Market, Sensex, Business and Financial News", "title": "Bitcoin scam: Raj Kundra summoned by ED", "title_full": "Bitcoin scam: Raj Kundra summoned by ED", "published": "2018-06-05T11:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://aniportalimages.s3.amazonaws.com/media/details/ED_June5.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 35926, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c824f1bb6886e068423c6d46ec662aa77d0e3a54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR38J5TX0DNaekMOpkE2LbuCMeCBwENxfB7xu1qLSCQlHLr1vVdxcIQGzG7p498hdNSzN7TG4iyf6bFqTlFnYCEDOMhqJxX7yKVdjVd.m37eCFkG_S.YYPr6XC0cf32mG8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "aninews.in", "published": "2018-06-05T11:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin scam: Raj Kundra summoned by ED", "text": "Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], June 05 (ANI): Businessman and actor Shilpa Shetty 's husband Raj Kundra , was on Tuesday summoned by the Enforcement Directorate ( ED ) in connection with the Bitcoin scam.\nKundra's name turned up in the report following alleged links with Bitcoin scamster Amit Bhardwaj .

Now he’s back, with radical plans for bitcoin â€“ and the states of Western Europe\nBy GIAN VOLPICELLI 06 Mar 2018 F ebruary 2018, a Fab Lab on the east side of Barcelona. The venue is filled with plywood models, old monitors, small potted plants, and one toy robot. About ninety people are listening to a young man wearing black clothes and a black beret, with a close-cropped beard that gives him an air of martial intensity. He speaks with hesitant deliberation, leaving long pauses between words. The screen behind him shows the floorplan of a five-room flat: one toilet, one office, a large living room, and two bedrooms.\nâ€œWe want to establish a headquarters here in Catalonia. To gather together a team of hackers, that we can then train and send to manage our projects,â€ the man says, in English. â€œIt will be like a startup accelerator, only a politicised one. Not driven by profit, but by social change.â€\nThe man is looking for five people â€” not necessarily tech-savvy people, but preferably young people, women (for reasons of gender equality), or ideologically radical individuals â€” to join his â€œdojoâ€. These â€œmonk hackersâ€ â€” or â€œautonomous polytechnicsâ€, â€œspiritual warriorsâ€, or simply â€œrevolutionariesâ€ â€” will live together, observe quasi-monastic discipline, and work towards a common goal: using technologies like bitcoin, blockchain, and open-source software to empower revolutionary movements around the globe, starting from pro-autonomy Catalonia. Their long-term objective, according to a 18-page handout distributed before the talk, is the â€œcomplete collapse of the world state system.â€\nThe man has already found a potential place to set up the dojo, he says, pointing at the floorplan. But if anybody knows better, they should let him know. His details are on the handout, he says, as he scans the room quickly. â€œYou can also find the contacts on my website. Itâ€™s AmirTaaki.org .â€\nYanis Varoufakis: ‘Bitcoin is the perfect bubble, but blockchain is a remarkable solution’ Blockchain\nYanis Varoufakis: ‘Bitcoin is the perfect bubble, but blockchain is a remarkable solution’ I n early 2015, British bitcoin developer Amir Taaki vanished. His media appearances, until then frequent and outrageous, stopped abruptly. On Twitter, bitcoin nerds complained they couldnâ€™t get hold of him. None of the hacktivists who used to live with him in a London â€œbitcoin squatâ€, had any idea of his whereabouts.\nThen-27-year-old Taaki was a figure of worship in the bitcoin community, and a source of worries for governments, which â€” post Silk Road â€” were increasingly leery of how cryptocurrency could be used for illegal purposes. An outspoken anarchist, Taaki had sprung to notoriety when he started developing Dark Wallet , a payment system that would make bitcoin transaction totally untraceable. The idea was that individuals should be free to buy anything without banks or governments interloping; inevitably, though, Dark Wallet also appealed to criminals and money launderers â€” and to Isis, which recommended the technology in online posts. That had earned Dark Wallet, and Taaki, some rather bad press. It was more or less at that point that he had disappeared.\nADVERTISEMENT He resurfaced in September 2015. Not in the flesh, but in a series of out-of-the-blue emails to anarchist mailing list Unsystem. Most of them mentioned Rojava, a Kurdish-controlled de facto autonomous region in Northern Syria. This wasnâ€™t just an academic interest: Taaki was actually in Syria , fighting on the side of Rojava against Isis. He felt it was his duty to defend Rojavaâ€™s unique blend of federalism and direct democracy from the terrorists trying to obliterate it.\nTaaki offered his technology skills, but the Kurds handed him a Kalashnikov and sent him to the frontline. He had no military training, but, he says, he quickly picked up the art of fighting. He learnt to appreciate the technical aspects of war â€” the way you need to clean and oil your guns every day; the way snipers have to factor in gravity pull and wind direction when trying to snuff out an enemy far away â€” but he often caught himself yawning. â€œNinety-nine percent of the time you sit around waiting,â€ he says. â€œWar is really boring.â€\nOf course, there were some moments when Taaki did experience the terror of the battlefield, during gunfights, in which he may or may not have killed Isis fighters (he says battles were fought at a long range, so itâ€™s impossible to tell); near-missing bullets; black-clad goons closing in on his post.\nâ€œThinking you can die is a very scary experience. But when you get to the front, and you have a gun in your hand, the fact that you could die it’s something you can deal with,â€ he says. â€œWhat’s more difficult is losing your friends: dozens of my friends died.â€\nTaaki spent three months and a half fighting, before finally managing to get hold of Rojavaâ€™s economic committee and focusing his energies on civilian projects such as the crowdfunding and construction of fertiliser factories.\nHe eventually flew back to Britain in 2016, and like everyone returning from Syria he was stopped by the police, and put under house arrest. He managed to get his passport back some months later, and immediately left the country. When I called him on Signal, in September 2017, he was in Argentina. I asked him how he was spending his days, and whether he had any plans for the near future.\nâ€œI want to visit hackers, anarchist hackers, and anarchists groups,â€ he said. â€œI am studying a lot of different literature to understand where technology should go over the next 20 years.â€œ He wanted to meld his identities of bitcoin coder, anarchist bete noire, and Rojava foreign fighter, and forge a new political programme. He wanted to become a full-time revolutionary.\nNow Taaki is back â€” in Europe, if not in the UK, where the police wonâ€™t leave him alone â€” and he wants to take bitcoin back. Over the last three years, while Taaki was busy toting kalashnikovs and studying sociology tomes, the cryptocurrency he helped build changed profoundly. Its price rose from $200 in March 2015 to over $19,000 in December 2017, before falling back to todayâ€™s $10,000. The crowd associated with it transmogrified from a cluster of libertarians, idealist techies, and darknet dwellers, to a hodgepodge of day-traders, Lamborghini buffs, and token-peddling chancers.\nWhatâ€™s more, Taaki says, the technologyâ€™s politically incendiary potential has faded. â€œBitcoin doesn’t have any vision behind it, any vision of where it’s going,â€ he told me. â€œAll the original ideas about using bitcoin for challenging power â€” or privacy, or new forms of economic systems â€” are falling by the wayside. Now it’s simply a small community obsessed with the price going up.â€\nIn Taakiâ€™s opinion, bitcoin â€” like most of todayâ€™s technologies, from personal computers to social media â€” has become a toy, a tool that is inane at best and oppressive at worst.\nReclaiming it will require an ideology, a set of strong principles channelling bitcoin towards political ends. And Taaki has found that ideology in the depths of the Syrian conflict.\nAmir Taaki poses with a Kalashnikov in Syria\nAmir Taaki I f you want to understand Amir Taaki, you first have to understand Abdullah Ă–calan. The founder of Kurdistan Workers’ Party, Ă–calan fought for decades against Turkey with the aim of creating a Kurdish state. He was eventually captured by Turkish intelligence in 1998, and he has since been confined on the island-jail of Ä°mralÄą. From there, he developed a doctrine that rejects the idea of nation state and promotes the emergence of self-governing, environmentalist, feminist, direct-democratic local communities. Ă–calanâ€™s theory formed the blueprint for Rojavaâ€™s model of government, the one that mesmerised Taaki to the point that he took up arms to defend it. He called his vision democratic confederalism .\nAccording to Ă–calanâ€™s doctrine, communities breaking out from a nation state can theoretically achieve independence through peaceful means. But they can resort to any means â€” including violence â€” if a state or hostile actor (in Rojavaâ€™s case, Turkey or Isis) threaten their freedom.\nThatâ€™s where bitcoin enters the picture: Taaki thinks that the cryptocurrency can be the catalyst for the global spread of democratic confederalism. First of all, bitcoin would allow communities such as Rojava to exchange money and goods outside of the purview of states and financial authorities. (At just seven transactions per second, the network is still too slow to power large communities, which is why Taaki set scalability as one of the early goals for his dojo.) But Taaki envisions many possible uses for blockchain technology: his manifesto mentions decentralised messaging systems, digital governance applications, and online black markets â€” â€Like a new Silk Road, but one we’re not liable for,â€ he says.\nTaakiâ€™s monk-hackers will initially develop these projects â€” alongside non-cryptocurrency-related initiatives, such as mobile telephone networks, open-source software, sustainable industrial technology â€” with the aim of supporting the beleaguered Rojava community, with which Taaki is still in touch. But that is just the beginning of Taakiâ€™s master plan. Which brings us back to Catalonia.\nThe $3.8bn cryptocurrency bubble is a huge deal. But it could break the blockchain Blockchain\nThe $3.8bn cryptocurrency bubble is a huge deal. But it could break the blockchain S pending time with Taaki, one realises that he has two distinct modes of carrying himself. When on a stage, or giving a sit-down interview, he speaks in chapters and verses, rattling out references to Mao and Lenin, Ada Lovelace and Lewis Mumford, defining basic words and concepts (â€œstateâ€; â€œviolenceâ€; â€œhierarchyâ€) as they are mentioned, and embarking on disquisitions from first principles. In informal situations, he is friendly but fiercely laconic, and he loves to lure his interlocutors into self-contradiction.\nNow, Taaki is in the latter mode. He is standing outside a bar near the event venue, surrounded by a small crowd of people who attended his talk. It is an unusually cold evening in Barcelona, and those who are not holding a beer keep their hands stuffed in their pockets. Taaki is not drinking; he is munching a banana he fished out of a cardboard box half-full with a bundle of conference handouts.\nHe was here when during the Catalan independence referendum, and the post-referendum turmoil, he says. But he did not take part in the street squabbles: they were unworthy of his energy. Catalans were not really ready to put their lives on the line.\nâ€œThe whole thing was a joke. A couple of Catalan friends of mine got out and joined the protest, really believing that a revolution was about to happen,â€ Taaki says. â€œTwo hours later they were drunk and they went home to have sex. And then [Catalan president] Puigdemont flying to Brussels, running away like a coward. What sort of message did that send?â€\nA woman nearby accuses him of â€œreductionismâ€. A Catalan man in his thirties, the face covered with thick stubble, makes the case against independence by appealing to our shared humanity: people have more in common than things dividing them.\nâ€œWhat do you share with Isis? What do you have in common?â€ Taaki asks calmly. The Catalan bumbles. Taaki grins.\nFor all his skepticism about Octoberâ€™s disorders, Taaki still thinks there is something brewing in Catalonia, something worth his energy. Originally, he planned to launch his revolutionary hacker operation in Greece â€” but when he looked closer he realised the Greek bitcoin community was negligible. Cataloniaâ€™s scene was more developed, if not huge; plus, the regionâ€™s political tumult presented a great testing ground for Taakiâ€™s ideological fervour and technical skills.\nIs he trying to engineer Cataloniaâ€™s independence? I ask. The answerâ€™s complicated.\nHe has met up with some pro-independence organisations, and with people working with Barcelona en ComĂş, a citizen platform launched by mayor Ada Colau and inspired by the ideas of Murray Bookchin â€” a philosopher Taaki admires. Not much came out of it (â€œThey probably thought I was just a crazy Britâ€), although Taaki is still interested in working with and within those groups.\nThe main problem is that, for most Catalans, independence means creating a new nation state; Taaki thinks states should be obliterated in favour of a global swarm of self-governing communities Ă -la Rojava.\nIf Catalans wanted to achieve that kind of model, then Taaki and his five-people army will be there to provide technical and ideological ammunition. For instance, he says, adopting cryptocurrency would allow the Catalans to stop paying taxes to the Spanish state. And the blockchain might be used to create a secure digital voting system to rerun the referendum without the interference of truncheon-wielding gendarmes.\nWouldnâ€™t that anger Spainâ€™s central government, and elicit its reaction (regardless of any subtlety on nationhood and state)? Taaki nods. â€œYeah, I hope so. And the Europeansâ€™. And other governmentsâ€™.â€\nIndependence protesters wave Catalan flags as they demonstrate against the Spanish government in October, 2017. Taaki calls the protest “a joke”\nSean Gallup/Getty Images T he day after his talk, I meet Taaki at AureaSocial, a squat near GaudĂâ€™s Sagrada Familia, where he currently occupies a three-by-two meter room on the second floor. He is still wearing the same black outfit as last night, only this time without the beret. We walk to a nearby park. I have a question for him, something that still eludes me after listening to his talk: What would Catalonia look like if his plan succeeded?\nHe pauses, thinking. â€œFirst of all, there would be a very strong rural movement of agricultural producers. There would be strong local and national identity in culture and fashion. People would organise politically, democratically at a local level.â€\nâ€œFreedom is the ability to satisfy our needs at a local level. As long as Catalans keep eating McDonald’s, buying clothes from H&M, watching MTV, they won’t be free.â€\nTaakiâ€™s vision is not something you usually come across among the most politicised fringes of the bitcoin community. Cryptocurrency tends to appeal to libertarian Davos Men â€” think of â€œBitcoin Jesusâ€ Roger Ver: US-born, Saint Kitts and Nevisâ€™ citizen, Japan-resident â€” who see bitcoin as a ticket for personal, taxless, freedom. For them, blockchain is a hammer for smashing centralised power (financial, administrative, commercial) and give it back to individuals criss-crossing a globalised world; for Taaki, the hammer should be used to smash globalisation and bring about a loose federation of regional, culture-based communities.\nThe way he sees it, â€œneoliberal globalismâ€ is destroying local identities, flattening cultural differences, and muffling dissenting opinions through technology-enforced filter bubbles. â€œWe are living the last days of the second version of the Roman Empire,â€ Taaki says. The Empire that, his theory goes, collapsed because of multiculturalism and lack of unifying values.\nThere are glaring points of contact between Taakiâ€™s analysis of modernity and the worldview of thinkers on the far-right. Taaki says thatâ€™s because far-righters are onto something.\nâ€œWhen I see [white nationalist] Richard Spencer I think that a lot of the things he says are true â€” he is not a stupid guy,â€ he says. â€œPeople in the west have to engage with these ideas, not ignore them. There are some elements of truth in the critique the far right is making.â€\nBut Spencer and his ilk are hell-bent on creating a â€œcentralised fascist stateâ€ with a racist ideology, whereas he aims at facing neoliberalismâ€™s shortcomings with grassroot democracy and culture. Hence Taakiâ€™s urgency. He believes democratic confederalism is the Westâ€™s last chance against the onslaught of the dark forces of Islamism and far-right extremism.\nâ€œAs I told the police when they arrested me in England: it’s in their interest to support my work or other bigger forces will rise up in Europe,â€ he says. â€œAnd, unlike those forces, I am on a side that doesn’t seek open conflict with the state. We should start a conversation.â€\nThe most important conversation, though, is probably going to happen within the bitcoin universe itself. Taakiâ€™s objective is to make sure that bitcoin is weaponised, rather than being the butt of endless sports cars jokes, â€œhodlingâ€ chants and Wolf-of-Wall-Street-like chicanery. Todayâ€™s bitcoiners â€” the politically cynical or oblivious ones, rather than the libertarians, who could even enjoy the intellectual duel â€” are doomed to be the first casualties of Taakiâ€™s crusade. They are the ones who are convinced the world, and themselves, that bitcoin is an unusual asset class at best, and a financial hazard at worst. Taaki is out to to show everyone that itâ€™s much more powerful and dangerous.\nAs I write this, Taaki is in the process of recruiting the first five members of his academy: they will have to relinquish any other responsibility or commitment, undergo a period of â€œideology trainingâ€, and live an ascetic life in the property Taaki will rent. There will be no salary other than â€œparticipation in historic actionâ€. Over time, Taaki plans to open other chapters around the world â€” specifically in politically fractious regions such as Indiaâ€™s Kerala, Mexico, and Argentina.\nShould we take this whole thing seriously?\nYes and no: Taakiâ€™s plan is ambitious to the point of megalomania, and quite a lot of things will have to fall in place for a five-person hacker team to be able to bring down the global state system. But it would be wrong to discount Taakiâ€™s ability to effect change â€” after all, Dark Wallet made it to a European Union paper on cryptocurrenciesâ€™ challenges, in a box included in the terrorism and money laundering section.\nAs a bitcoin early adopter, Taaki is likely to have enough money to fund his project, and he carries significant clout among core developers and ideologues. Plus, he has the motivation, the relentless, destiny-driven drive of the true revolutionary.\nI ask Taaki what would make him waver. â€œDeath,â€ he replies. Whose death? â€œMy own death. I derive my power from my own death.â€\nUPDATE (8 March 2017): This piece has been changed to clarify that Amir Taaki is looking for male and female recruits for his “dojo”, not solely female as may have accidentally been implied.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "amir taaki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gian volpicelli", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "isis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catalonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western europe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T11:36:20.034+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "310c9ddcb9904a9a22148f64d828932c43ae61dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmT1uAwxFa2HNBAYCPlNNMik-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=4.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Technical Support", "title": "Can I save Bitcoins in a USB?", "title_full": "Can I save Bitcoins in a USB?", "published": "2018-06-05T11:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "310c9ddcb9904a9a22148f64d828932c43ae61dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmT1uAwxFa2HNBAYCPlNNMik-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "danielberryfy", "published": "2018-06-05T11:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can I save Bitcoins in a USB?", "text": "Quote: from: GreencoinToken on May 17, 2018, 11:33:57 PM Which is the safest way to store bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?\nThere are bunch of ways to store bitcoin.

Bitcoin transactions have reportedly slipped to around 200,000 per day, down from a peak of around 400,000 in December.\nWozniak said he initially bought Bitcoin (at $700) to experiment on how to ‘buy things online’. “So I sold off all my Bitcoin except one, which I kept to experiment with now. And I have two Ether (the payment token of the the Ethereum network).”\n“I am not an investor, that was not my purpose at all,” Wozniak said.\nHe said that Ethereum is a platform. “Only Bitcoin is pure digital gold…that’s the phrase that’s used and I totally buy into that. All of the others tend to give up some of the aspects of Bitcoin. How is the math on Bitcoin so correct that it still works.”\nTwitter founder and CEO Jack Dorsey recently said he expects to see Bitcoin adopted as global means of payment. “I buy into what Jack Dorsey says – not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking,” Wozniak told CNBC .

Bitcoin transactions have reportedly slipped to around 200,000 per day, down from a peak of around 400,000 in December.\nWozniak said he initially bought Bitcoin (at $700) to experiment on how to ‘buy things online’. “So I sold off all my Bitcoin except one, which I kept to experiment with now. And I have two Ether (the payment token of the the Ethereum network).”\n“I am not an investor, that was not my purpose at all,” Wozniak said.\nHe said that Ethereum is a platform. “Only Bitcoin is pure digital gold…that’s the phrase that’s used and I totally buy into that. All of the others tend to give up some of the aspects of Bitcoin. How is the math on Bitcoin so correct that it still works.”\nTwitter founder and CEO Jack Dorsey recently said he expects to see Bitcoin adopted as global means of payment. “I buy into what Jack Dorsey says – not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking,” Wozniak told CNBC .

Bitcoin is struggling to maintain its ground in the mid $7,000s, and has again fallen $200 below where it was trading during yesterday’s afternoon hours. This position had previous been held for roughly two days, and it was widely wondered whether bitcoin would be able to strike $8,000 once again.\nThat doesn’t appear to be the case as bitcoin has ultimately lost support, and is once again struggling to push itself beyond $7,600 . One source suggests the currency is likely to find support where it is (between $7,400 and $7,500), and that a respective bull run could push the currency to as high as $7,900. However, if the bears have their way, bitcoin could again fall back to an even $7,000 in the coming weeks.\nStrangely, however, bitcoin is now getting support from an unlikely candidate: computer mogul Steve Wozniak. While the Apple co-founder has been vocally positive towards Ethereum in the past, Wozniak has been relatively silent on bitcoin. That all changed when in an interview with CNBC, he expressed his hope that bitcoin would become a single, global currency within the next ten years.\nComparing it to the internet bubble of the mid-1990s, Wozniak says he is confident the price and value of bitcoin could surge again . He also referenced Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, and his previous statement that bitcoin could do just as Wozniak now claims – become the single currency for all countries in the next ten years.\n“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says,” Wozniak explains. “Not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way. Bitcoin, because it’s regulated in its quantity, you get down to supply and demand, and there’s more and more people who want it and demand it, and there was a hype going on for a period and it went up to $20,000 , then down. I don’t know where it is because I never track it.”\nIt is interesting to hear Wozniak’s words for several reasons, the main one being that he doesn’t seem to follow the news or trends surrounding bitcoin. It’s clear, by his own statements, that Wozniak isn’t even particularly interested in bitcoin, nor is he really convinced by the power or dominance it holds. He just sees how much it’s brought people in the past, and he’s hoping for that unification once again.\n“If the demand increases and it becomes more and more popular for more things, and people start using it, there is no extra supply. It’s limited,” he continued. “In terms of dollars, bitcoin will go up over time, but it won’t happen fast. It may be sloppy at first, and things that change so much in life take a very long time to change. They tend to go slowly. Blockchain in all forms, however, is so popular and being studied by so many people and in demand by so many companies to examine changing their businesses in the future, that it may be long term.”\nBITCOIN AND BANKING CAN WORK TOGETHER\nMt.

Personally, to maximize my investments, I avoid focusing into one coin since I diversify my investments by acquiring multiple cryptocurrencies at once.\nI agree that my opinion on Bitcoin is subjective but generally Bitcoin does not rank high among cryptocurrencies in terms of volatility, that makes Bitcoin the best to hodl for long-term purpose.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T10:16:25.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "119ebe139ab9f4deb321bcb90db87b1912a5ddea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQujfav8g98PjRMi_ogV.5EwBTfg476RyQTDSgxkAAVMORB7ZZhCLmowj21YN8XWA6vMpCa9h8ROjyutuMxrOKWLJWeHCOxusu5jXoF7EFtt58ajYzm4nzn51V8t_8s6dcIGM3RzVgegA--", "site_full": "www.thelincolnianonline.com", "site": "thelincolnianonline.com", "site_section": "http://www.thelincolnianonline.com/feed", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "The Lincolnian Online", "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Reaches One Day Trading Volume of $4.71 Billion", "title_full": "Bitcoin (BTC) Reaches One Day Trading Volume of $4.71 Billion", "published": "2018-06-05T11:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/1.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "119ebe139ab9f4deb321bcb90db87b1912a5ddea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQujfav8g98PjRMi_ogV.5EwBTfg476RyQTDSgxkAAVMORB7ZZhCLmowj21YN8XWA6vMpCa9h8ROjyutuMxrOKWLJWeHCOxusu5jXoF7EFtt58ajYzm4nzn51V8t_8s6dcIGM3RzVgegA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Donald Scott", "published": "2018-06-05T11:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Reaches One Day Trading Volume of $4.71 Billion", "text": "Bitcoin (BTC) Reaches One Day Trading Volume of $4.71 Billion Posted by Donald Scott | Jun 5th, 2018\nBitcoin (CURRENCY:BTC) traded 2.6% lower against the dollar during the twenty-four hour period ending at 4:00 AM ET on May 13th.

Its launch date was January 3rd, 2009. Bitcoin’s total supply is 17,076,237 coins. The official message board for Bitcoin is bitcointalk.org . Bitcoin’s official Twitter account is @bitcoin and its Facebook page is accessible here . The official website for Bitcoin is bitcoin.org . The Reddit community for Bitcoin is /r/bitcoin and the currency’s Github account can be viewed here .\nAccording to CryptoCompare, “Balances – block chain The block chain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions – private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing – mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends. “\nBuying and Selling Bitcoin\nBitcoin can be traded on these cryptocurrency exchanges: BCEX, Binance, DragonEX, Zaif, Bibox, OOOBTC, BtcTrade.im, Upbit, Iquant, Huobi, Coinone, BTCBOX, CEX.IO, Bitstamp, Octaex, fex, itBit, GDAX, RightBTC, Kraken, CoinTiger, Bitfinex, Quoine, Poloniex, Trade By Trade, Coinsuper, Coinhub, Luno, Coinroom, Bit-Z, OKEx, CoinEgg, EXX, B2BX, LakeBTC, xBTCe, Ethfinex, Neraex, ZB.COM, OTCBTC, Hotbit, Fisco, Lbank, CoinsBank, Fatbtc, Bittrex, BTCC, IDAX, YoBit, Gemini, TOPBTC, Bitinka, BitBay, BitMEX, GOPAX, Livecoin, Cobinhood, HitBTC, Tidex, Omicrex, Coinrail, Kucoin, Gate.io, CoinEx Market, Bitbank, Exrates, Simex, bitFlyer, Bithumb, Paribu, Korbit, OEX, CoinBene, Exmo, Sistemkoin, C2CX, BitForex, WEX and Negocie Coins.

One of the main concerns of FSA is the compliance of exchanges with Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) requirements. Inspections carried out by the agency revealed that several cryptographic exchanges do not apply sufficient Know-Your-Customer (KYC) controls to confirm the identity of their users. The supervisory authority also expressed concerns about cases in which customer assets are not properly separated from the exchange assets.\nNew regulator orders have been issued for a total of twelve crypto stock exchanges, two of which are officially licensed stock exchanges, and ten of them are \"quasi-operators\", which means that their application for an FSA license still awaits consideration. The FSA is expected to publish a report summarizing the results of its audits later this month, as well as providing further guidance on the required customer protection measures.\nTwo high-profile scandals involving Japanese cryptographic exchanges - the unprecedented January Coincheck hack at $532 million, and the infamous fall of Mt. Gox - led to the intensification of intervention by the national financial supervisory authority.\nFrom April 2017, the Japanese Payment Services Act requires all cryptographic exchanges to be registered under the FSA license - the first licenses were approved in September. This year, the regulator tightened the conditions even more, focusing on compliance with AML and KYC.\nLet's now take a look at the Bitcoin technical picture at the H4 time frame. The market has so far failed to break out above the important technical resistance at the level of $7,740 and now it testing the golden trend line from below. Any break out below the technical support at the level of $7,232 will open the road to the key technical support at the $6,984 swing low.

He states that Bitcoin goes along with his personal ideology of mathematics, purity, and science. He likes how Bitcoin is not controlled by any individual or organization, instead it is decentralized and controlled by mathematics. He sees Bitcoin as a naturally evolving force of nature.\nHe said all this during an interview by CNBC on 4 June 2018 at the Money 20/20 conference in Amsterdam , an event where the financial tech, payments, and financial services industry experts came together to discuss the future of money.\nHe expects the price of Bitcoin to continue going up since Bitcoin has a limited supply according to a mathematical formula, unlike fiat currency like the USD which can be printed at will, and also since demand for Bitcoins will be going up long term. Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey said Bitcoin would become the single global currency , and while Steve Wozniak doesn’t agree with that, he hopes it will come true.\nWozniak is a technology pioneer, having designed and developed the Apple I in 1976 as well as the Apple II in 1977 , which are the first widely used personal computers in history. Without him, Apple computers would have never existed, so some feel it is perhaps appropriate to consider him the true founder of Apple.\nWozniak purchased Bitcoin for experimentation purposes when its price was USD 700 and watched as it went all the way up to USD 20,000. He never wanted to be a Bitcoin investor, so he sold all but one Bitcoin, and is keeping it so he can keep experimenting. He also has 2 Ether, and says he sees lots of potential for Ethereum since it is a platform and platforms tend to grow since there are lots of people developing applications on it.\nHe believes only Bitcoin is pure digital gold since it is fully decentralized and mathematically correct, and that other cryptocurrencies stray from this purity in their attempts to have a business model.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-hopes-bitcoin-will-become-global-currency.html", "https://t.me/bconews", "https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom", "https://www.money2020.com/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak", "https://bitcoinnews.com/apple-twitter-founders-upbeat-on-future-of-bitcoin-and-blockchain/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amsterdam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T16:52:54.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8ea18d9c771669a62487c80ebb2ba253a6980a44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeBnUpJeAW31mUwsOXBDvxv8XublUlrEC0SftZHamToEwP25t.C3Jx8w3Ymu6RI2qxJYWKpSWj_Y4A--", "site_full": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin24on.blogspot.se/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "title": "South Korea’s Supreme Court: Bitcoin is an Asset", "title_full": "South Korea’s Supreme Court: Bitcoin is an Asset", "published": "2018-06-05T11:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8ea18d9c771669a62487c80ebb2ba253a6980a44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeBnUpJeAW31mUwsOXBDvxv8XublUlrEC0SftZHamToEwP25t.C3Jx8w3Ymu6RI2qxJYWKpSWj_Y4A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin 24on (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-05T11:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "South Korea’s Supreme Court: Bitcoin is an Asset", "text": "Home » bitcoin » bitcoinist » crypto » news » South Korea’s Supreme Court: Bitcoin is an Asset South Korea’s Supreme Court: Bitcoin is an Asset bitcoin , bitcoinist , crypto , news #bitcoin # invest #money\nThe Supreme Court of South Korea overturned a pre-existing law in order to seize some 191 bitcoins, thus legally recognizing them as assets. The cryptocurrency had been allegedly earned through the provision of illicit pornographic content. A Case Stretched in Time\nA legal case took place last year involving 33-year old Ahn, who had been operating an illegal pornography site in South Korea since December 2013. He was arrested in May 2017. The prosecution found that the individual had accumulated a total of 216 bitcoins at the time of his arrest.\nUnder the premise that Ahn had acquired Bitcoin through criminal activity, the prosecution demanded that the convict’s cryptocurrency should immediately be confiscated.\nYet, applying the laws by the letter, Suwon’s District Court ruled that:\nIt is not appropriate to confiscate bitcoins because they are in the form of electronic files without physical entities, unlike cash. […] Virtual currency cannot assume an objective standard value.\nThe decision of the court was appealed, leaving it to the discretion of the country’s Supreme Court. New Development Taking Place\nOn May 30, 2018, South Korea’s Supreme Court banged the gavel and ruled in an entirely different light. The country’s highest magistrates confirmed the appeal, allowing the prosecution to seize 191 of the 216 bitcoins.\nThe court ruled that exactly 191 units of the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had been accumulated through the website distributing illegal online content.\nThe Supreme Court’s merit for the ruling was that:\nThe cryptocurrency is recognized to have value so it can be confiscated.\nGoing further, taking the Penal Code of South Korea into account, the court also stated that:\nThe bitcoins were earned from the proceeds of crime. […] If we return the bitcoins to Ahn, it will be giving him back profits that were earned illegally from running an online porn site. A loss for Ahn, A Victory for Cryptocurrencies\nWhile it’s true that not all of Ahn’s bitcoins fell under the range of the ruling, the Supreme Court’s decision offers some legislative clarity on the matter of cryptocurrencies — for once, it recognized them as a traditional asset class.\nThe Supreme Court in South Korea is second only to the country’s Constitutional Court in terms of legislative capabilities. While its rulings do not constitute laws or even legal directions, the fact that such a high legislative authority recognizes Bitcoin as an asset class surely carries some weight.\nFor what is worth, we’ve seen a lot of movement on that front in the past month.

Well, that’s not exactly true–but there has been a significant drop in the amount of web searches for BTC. In fact, CNBC reported that Google searches for the word “ Bitcoin ” have dropped a whopping 75 percent since the beginning of 2018. But what does that really mean?\nIt means that interest is waning–right along with Bitcoin’s valuation. BTC’s value has dropped roughly 50 percent since early January, and isn’t showing much sign of recovery.\nHelp us to make Finance Magnates better!\nIf things don’t turn around soon for Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency could go the way of Los Del Rio or Soft Cell, a one-hit wonder whose impact changed the global scene forever, but ultimately wasn’t a part of the future of its industry.\nIn fact, the Bitcoin network has a lot of problems that experts argue are preventing it from becoming the global currency that so many hope it will be. Scalability on the Bitcoin network remains a nightmare; its anonymity has been largely disproven, and the onboarding and offboarding processes surrounding BTC usage remain far from practical. BTC’s Major Problems Remain Unsolved\nAt the same time, other cryptocurrencies who have directly or indirectly sought to improve on some of the Bitcoin network’s biggest issues continue to grow in popularity and industry adoption. Ripple is continually adding a steady stream of financial institutions to its list of RippleNet adoptees; DASH is growing its merchant pool, and IOTA continues to build high-profile technological partnerships.\nBitcoin’s lack of efficient governance and continual problems may just leave the network in the dust. Of course, BTC still has its believers. Mike Novogratz has remained stalwart in his beliefs that the value of a single Bitcoin could “easily” reach $40,000 by the end of this year; John McAfee has made some rather interesting promises regarding what he’ll do if Bitcoin doesn’t hit $500,000 by 2020. BTC “Needs a New Narrative”\nOne of the main problems keeping Bitcoin from moving into the future have been arguments about the role that the cryptocurrency should be playing. On the one hand are those who believe that Bitcoin should be used as it was originally intended, a form of digital cash that can be easily used for everyday purposes. Second-layer solutions like the Lightning Network could certainly make this possible.\nOn the other hand are those who believe that Bitcoin is more useful and valuable as a long-term investment. Because of Bitcoin’s scalability issues, this is more reflective of BTC’s current reality.\nEither way, “Bitcoin needs a new narrative in order to reestablish global attention,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. The future of BTC hangs in the balance.\nFinancemagnates.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/ripplenet-adopted-uae-exchange-one-worlds-largest-forex-firms/", "https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/edward-snowdens-big-problem-bitcoin-privacy-not-scalability/", "https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/cryptocurrencynewsstellar-gears-implement-lightning-network-2018/", "https://www.financemagnates.com/executives/moves/dash-technologies-hires-jamie-bogen-director-execution-services/", "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRisHN0415X-E5Ru16ORunEn_qNxIuhGgZIlFqtW8ul0HEpg/viewform?usp=sf_link", "https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/interview/bitcoin-will-become-new-gold-standard-says-bladetec-managing-director/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "los del rio", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T12:56:17.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b79e0786d67828bc040096827e0776c8045d4e07", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSS1KyjLFtb913YSWwG3DeJn_Uzc7QKPmhJ1tREQq3gDanmVhtIPn_nqiEMGR9IGfLtzLK8npK_N1", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "\"I am on vacation, let me play for a while\" -

The co-founder of Datatrek Research and analyst Bitcoin from Wall Street. Nicholas Colas, quoted by CNBC, links the decline in Internet searches with currency price rates, which have fallen approximately 50 percent this year. In an email to his clients, Colas adds that “[ Bitcoin ] needs a new narrative to restore global attention. ” Google Trends analyzes different popularity periods of certain web searches. A value of 100 is taken as a peak of popularity for a specific search term. In early January, Bitcoin’s popularity was 37, dropping to 9 at the beginning of June. Colas also mentions the decrease in the number of Bitcoin wallets recently created, comparing the current period with the last quarter of 2017, when Bitcoin prices approached $ 20,000 . The growth in the number of new wallets in 2018 until now was only 3.7 percent, while at the end of 2017 it was 7.6 percent monthly. “The growth of the Bitcoin portfolio has to be +5 percent / month to see a significant price appreciation,” concluded Colas. Google searches for other cryptocurrencies are also in decline, according to CNBC. Ethereum the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has fallen by 70 percent since the beginning of 2018, Bitcoin Cash has lost 82 percent and XRP It has dropped 87 percent. Even so, searches for the fifth largest cryptocurrency, EOS , have increased 97% in 2018. CNBC linked this with the recent fundraising efforts of the company .

Fiat currencies such as the dollar have advantages when things go awry, because governments can enforce their use and act as lenders of last resort, Chanos said in an interview with the Institute for New Economic Thinking published on Monday.\nDigital coins, on the other hand, have no such backing. “For those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that’s exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least,” he said.\n“The last thing I’d want to own is Bitcoin if the grid goes down.” Food would be better, he said. The past year’s euphoria over Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fits into the “fraud cycle,” in which people grow less skeptical during long periods of market gains, plowing into investments that would normally seem too good to be true, he said.\nThe bull market of the 1990s culminated with accounting scandals such as Enron’s. Later, another run led to the global financial crisis of 2008, he said.\n“We’re now nine years into this bull market, same as the ’90s, so I suspect that now things are starting to percolate,” he said, singling out Bitcoin and initial coin offerings for other tokens. “This is simply a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough in monetary policy.” Read more from bloomberg.com…\nthumbnail courtesy of bloomberg.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-04/chanos-calls-bitcoin-last-thing-i-d-want-to-own-in-a-crisis"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jim chanos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chanos", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "enron corp.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institute for new economic thinking", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fiat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enron", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T11:35:47.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "df37c4b3e45b0df136c26b2981ac248ed3cf8526", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va7ySrBJbKaFBktmczE6cFdFuhZ4NQN1Fww8D7h7YFb8BfOfX1dwAeSn7eZsXTZVkgoNt.dfDncOXFdNh3Bbp6KySQXgaw_micYA--", "site_full": "bitcoin.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Bitcoin Stack Exchange", "title": "bitcoin-cli createrawtransaction and purpose of \"scriptPubKey\"?", "title_full": "bitcoin-cli createrawtransaction and purpose of \"scriptPubKey\"?", "published": "2018-06-05T11:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/bitcoin/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=462e8b9b382b", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 179, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "df37c4b3e45b0df136c26b2981ac248ed3cf8526", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va7ySrBJbKaFBktmczE6cFdFuhZ4NQN1Fww8D7h7YFb8BfOfX1dwAeSn7eZsXTZVkgoNt.dfDncOXFdNh3Bbp6KySQXgaw_micYA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "pebwindkraft", "published": "2018-06-05T11:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin-cli createrawtransaction and purpose of \"scriptPubKey\"?", "text": "Raghav Sood 2,130 7 24 You are right, I've been working with all addresses types and I've never attached it. so yes, it's totally not required. you don't even have to pass anything. – Adam 9 hours ago Yup, this was also my assumption, based on my tests (and perception).

He got arrested last month at Delhi Airport by the Pune Police. He is accused of running Ponzi schemes through the GainBitcoin website. Bitcoin is a virtual currency that works on the decentralized ledger. Unlike your bank where all transactions are centralized, Bitcoin transactions are validated by the group of miners, who are rewarded with a new Bitcoin for validating the transaction. The income tax department recently sent notices to bitcoin traders who were trading more than Rs1 crore daily. ED is examining these cases further on the alleged grounds of money laundering and fraud. RBI has cautioned bitcoin users many times given the high risk involved with trading in virtual currencies. Recently, Reserve Bank of India in its last monetary policy committee meeting said banks are no more allowed to deal with crypto-currency exchanges. Currently, there are around 3 million people in India who have been dealing in Rs 100 to 200 crore worth of crypto-currencies every day. RBI stated in a circular that was released on April 6, 2018, “Reserve Bank has repeatedly through its public notices on December 24, 2013, February 01, 2017 and December 05, 2017, cautioned users, holders and traders of virtual currencies, including Bitcoins, regarding various risks associated in dealing with such virtual currencies. In view of the associated risks, it has been decided that, with immediate effect, entities regulated by the Reserve Bank shall not deal in VCs or provide services for facilitating any person or entity in dealing with or settling VCs. “ The notice further stated, “Such services include maintaining accounts, registering, trading, settling, clearing, giving loans against virtual tokens, accepting them as collateral, opening accounts of exchanges dealing with them and transfer / receipt of money in accounts relating to purchase/ sale of VCs. Regulated entities which already provide such services shall exit the relationship within three months from the date of this circular.”\nPublished Date: June 5, 2018 1:06 PM IST | Updated Date: June 5, 2018 5:48 PM IST Topics:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "raj kundr", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shilpa shetty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raj kundra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ed", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reserve bank of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india.com business desk the enforcement directorate", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T11:37:59.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "982a91ec53c1df2c837bd18e6103aa6b9a5d2c82", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStiE70832pjs13P.xV0kUeQsFQnU.uCzR0ZeszmyC_Lo2cKnmVxxQl3lWpsQqe3RY-", "site_full": "www.instaforex.com", "site": "instaforex.com", "site_section": "http://news.instaforex.com/en/analytics/rss/?x=BAED", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Forex analysis review", "title": "Bitcoin analysis for 05/06/2018", "title_full": "Bitcoin analysis for 05/06/2018", "published": "2018-06-05T10:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8457, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "982a91ec53c1df2c837bd18e6103aa6b9a5d2c82", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStiE70832pjs13P.xV0kUeQsFQnU.uCzR0ZeszmyC_Lo2cKnmVxxQl3lWpsQqe3RY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-05T10:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin analysis for 05/06/2018", "text": "05.06.2018 09:36 Bitcoin analysis for 05/06/2018\nThe Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) issued orders to improve the business of the twelve national cryptographic exchanges. One of the main concerns of FSA is the compliance of exchanges with Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) requirements. Inspections carried out by the agency revealed that several cryptographic exchanges do not apply sufficient Know-Your-Customer (KYC) controls to confirm the identity of their users. The supervisory authority also expressed concerns about cases in which customer assets are not properly separated from the exchange assets.\nNew regulator orders have been issued for a total of twelve crypto stock exchanges, two of which are officially licensed stock exchanges, and ten of them are \"quasi-operators\", which means that their application for an FSA license still awaits consideration. The FSA is expected to publish a report summarizing the results of its audits later this month, as well as providing further guidance on the required customer protection measures.\nTwo high-profile scandals involving Japanese cryptographic exchanges - the unprecedented January Coincheck hack at $532 million, and the infamous fall of Mt. Gox - led to the intensification of intervention by the national financial supervisory authority.\nFrom April 2017, the Japanese Payment Services Act requires all cryptographic exchanges to be registered under the FSA license - the first licenses were approved in September. This year, the regulator tightened the conditions even more, focusing on compliance with AML and KYC.\nLet's now take a look at the Bitcoin technical picture at the H4 time frame. The market has so far failed to break out above the important technical resistance at the level of $7,740 and now it testing the golden trend line from below. Any break out below the technical support at the level of $7,232 will open the road to the key technical support at the $6,984 swing low.\n*The market analysis posted here is meant to increase your awareness, but not to give instructions to make a trade.

Bitcoin transactions have reportedly slipped to around 200,000 per day, down from a peak of around 400,000 in December.\nWozniak said he initially bought Bitcoin (at $700) to experiment on how to ‘buy things online’. “So I sold off all my Bitcoin except one, which I kept to experiment with now. And I have two Ether (the payment token of the the Ethereum network).”\n“I am not an investor, that was not my purpose at all,” Wozniak said.\nHe said that Ethereum is a platform. “Only Bitcoin is pure digital gold…that’s the phrase that’s used and I totally buy into that. All of the others tend to give up some of the aspects of Bitcoin. How is the math on Bitcoin so correct that it still works.”\nTwitter founder and CEO Jack Dorsey recently said he expects to see Bitcoin adopted as global means of payment. “I buy into what Jack Dorsey says – not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking,” Wozniak told CNBC . He said that cryptocurrencies will achieve their full potential in a decade.\nA contrasting view\nMeanwhile, short seller Jim Chanos, who predicted the fall of Enron Corp, said of Bitcoin: “It will fail in a crisis”.\nFiat currencies such as the dollar have advantages when things go awry, because governments can enforce their use and act as lenders of last resort, Chanos said in an interview with the Institute for New Economic Thinking published on Monday. Digital coins, on the other hand, have no such backing.\n“For those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that’s exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least,” he said. “The last thing I’d want to own is Bitcoin if the grid goes down.”\nFood would be better, he said.\nThe past year’s euphoria over Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fits into the ‘fraud cycle’, in which people grow less skeptical during long periods of market gains, plowing into investments that would normally seem too good to be true, he said.\nThe bull market of the 1990s culminated with accounting scandals such as Enron’s. Later, another run led to the global financial crisis of 2008, he said.\n“We’re now nine years into this bull market, same as the ’90s, so I suspect that now things are starting to percolate,” he said, singling out Bitcoin and initial coin offerings for other tokens. “This is simply a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough in monetary policy.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-hopes-bitcoin-will-become-global-currency.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T11:05:02.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1756e2d6bc9a5ede1a79965a64e4260a8e81bcf7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCroP6tLYIcXcaAG7QXt9v9VYzjkb16cKdT3LoiMw1r4GbPFs.U.w1_Oh5IIDYdjQ7v4Z..nDB.KuA--", "site_full": "blog.fortfs.com", "site": "fortfs.com", "site_section": "http://blog.fortfs.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Fort Financial Services - EN", "title": "Bitcoin About To Bounce?", "title_full": "Bitcoin About To Bounce?", "published": "2018-06-05T10:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CZ", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1756e2d6bc9a5ede1a79965a64e4260a8e81bcf7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCroP6tLYIcXcaAG7QXt9v9VYzjkb16cKdT3LoiMw1r4GbPFs.U.w1_Oh5IIDYdjQ7v4Z..nDB.KuA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Valentine (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-05T10:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin About To Bounce?", "text": "\nWe get it. Bitcoin’s performance has been a little disappointing since the beginning of 2018, especially compared to that $20,000 reached not long ago.\nEarlier today, the world’s most famous cryptocurrency was trading at $7402, down 1.15 percent. Bitcoin remains on a difficult spot as bears continue to push prices down and the digital currency has failed several times to consolidate above resistances.\nFine. It’s true. Analysts are not entirely positive about the short term perspective for Bitcoin, but what if we took a wider look at the chart?\nTechnical analysis shows that Bitcoin might be reaching a bottom soon, which opens the doors to a fruitful recovery ahead. As a potential bounce target, the $10,000-$12,000 range is seen.\n“While it is premature to conclude the correction is over, there was a positive technical development this week suggesting the first stage of a three-stage bottoming process is developing,” wrote Rob Sluymer, technical strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors, to his clients.\nSluymer explained that the three stages of a bottoming include:\n1. A deceleration of the downtrend\n2. A recovery above the downtrend\n3. A reversal of the actual downtrend\nAccording to the chart, Bitcoin’s downtrend has been losing strength and there was a recovery slightly above the downtrend. Now again, the $7,000 support is calling for a bearish attack, but it could be an opportunity to rebounce back to previous levels.\n“The 15-day moving average has been a good proxy for trends,” said Sluymer, adding that Bitcoin bulls keep their forecast at $25,000 by the end of this year.\nWhile Sluymer is not going full aboard with the idea of a bullish movement, he thinks reducing the sell positioning might be a good idea for investors.\n“We recommend tactical investors/traders begin reducing BTC short positions and begin phasing in long positions”.\nFortFS ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fundstrat global advisors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T10:35:35.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f5b619bd3caa51f149512e960ba3cd6ef42aec3a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQibdhzJFXSBPUC7zqwOJ0a0YOLhjQDxm3WmplZk1q_p0wU54rm2W8.LVYFDdw_u.KgCL5YqouBJw9S.79ecCZkHOxdrUfp0Vi_o4E0fu_sZMIE9vw0.M5B", "site_full": "www.nasdaq.com", "site": "nasdaq.com", "site_section": "https://www.nasdaq.com/", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Daily Stock Market Overview, Data Updates, Reports &amp; News - Nasdaq", "title": "South Korean Supreme Court Rules Bitcoin Is an Asset", "title_full": "South Korean Supreme Court Rules Bitcoin Is an Asset - Nasdaq.com", "published": "2018-06-05T10:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/images/dreamit.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2975, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f5b619bd3caa51f149512e960ba3cd6ef42aec3a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQibdhzJFXSBPUC7zqwOJ0a0YOLhjQDxm3WmplZk1q_p0wU54rm2W8.LVYFDdw_u.KgCL5YqouBJw9S.79ecCZkHOxdrUfp0Vi_o4E0fu_sZMIE9vw0.M5B", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Magazine", "published": "2018-06-05T10:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "South Korean Supreme Court Rules Bitcoin Is an Asset", "text": "Shutterstock photo\nSouth Korea's Supreme Court just ruled that bitcoin is a legally recognizable asset. The landmark ruling occurred on May 30, 2018, and it overturns a decision made by one of the country's lower courts in a case dating back to last year.\nIn September 2017, the Suwon District Court charged 33-year-old Ahn with the sale and distribution of child pornography. Operating a website since 2013, Ahn was arrested in May of 2017 for disseminating some 235,000 obscene files. Even though the court handed Ahn a guilty verdict and 18 months in prison for his actions, it did not confiscate the 216 bitcoins Ahn accumulated in exchange for the porn.\nAccording to the court, the government could not seize Ahn's bitcoins because, unlike other assets tied to illicit dealings, they aren't tangible.\n\"It is not appropriate to confiscate bitcoins because they are in the form of electronic files without physical entities, unlike cash,\" the court ruled. \"Virtual currency cannot assume an objective standard value.\"\nNow, the country's Supreme Court thinks otherwise. The Suwon District Court's decision was appealed, and, upon being challenged in South Korea's highest court, it didn't hold up.\nSeeing as Ahn accrued his digital fortune in exchange for an illegal service, the court reversed the decision and mandated that it is lawful for the government to confiscate it.\n\"Korean law stipulates that a seizable hidden asset ranges from cash, deposits, stocks, and other forms of tangible and intangible objects holding standard value,\" the ruling from this Tuesday reads. \"Bitcoin is intangible and comes in the form of digitized files, but it is traded on an exchange and can be used to buy goods. Therefore, receiving bitcoins is an act of taking profits.\"\nAhn's sentence will remain the same, but he'll have to forfeit 191 bitcoins, worth roughly $1.4 million at press time along with some $654,000 in cash. Tracking Ahn's transactions on Bitcoin's ledger, the court was able to determine how many bitcoins he received as payment.\n\"[Ahn] received bitcoins by giving a certain bitcoin address to pornography watchers online. Records stored on the Bitcoin blockchain proved that bitcoins sent to him should be seen as profits online,\" the court ruling states.\nThe ruling is a decisive, if roundabout, benchmark for cryptocurrency's legal status in the country. It gives digital assets like bitcoin enhanced legitimacy at a time when South Korea is also in the process of legalizing and regulating Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).

The businessman was summoned at the ED office here and was asked questions about his involvement in the trade, termed as illegal by the government, they said. There are some instances of the case that are linked to Kundra and hence, he has been asked to record his statement, the officials said without elaborating.

the Business World by Richard Stanley\nAbout Up on Game: From Robbing Banks to Stacking Bitcoin, My Involvement with Gangs, Bank Robbery, Prison, and Success in the Business World by Richard Stanley\nIn a crazy twist…Bank Robber Turns to Bitcoin and No Longer Needs Banks\nThe “Skinny Bandit”—a whiter-than-cocaine kid from the gang-filled streets of Otay in San Diego—who robbed banks to eat ironically no longer needs banks because of his steady success in Bitcoin trading and other cryptocurrencies.\nMeticulous and calculating, Richard Stanley continually evaded capture and grew brazen with each additional bank heist in the early 2000s.\nThe robberies continued, and it appeared that the FBI would never catch the elusive yet polite robber who went from teller to teller saying, “Put the money on the counter…” and walked away with thousands in cash in a clear plastic bag.\nUpon his sudden arrest, the shocking truth was finally revealed when this criminal mastermind who repeatedly outwitted authorities turned out to an eighteen-year-old kid from the Hispanic gang-filled streets of Otay in San Diego.\nWhy Did He Rob Banks?\nThe first time was for cash to buy a Taco Bell grande meal.\nToday, the Skinny Bandit is a successful entrepreneur, in legit business in the adult marketing world and escorts and exotic dancers, and a day trader in Bitcoin cryptocurrency.\nRichard Stanley did his time—seven-plus years in Donovan, a rough Southern California prison, where he hustled to stay up on game and where he experienced the real Orange Is the New Black—and where he witnessed the worst horrors of the prison system, from guards killing inmates to rampant drug use and the lengths desperate people go to get what they need (such as snacks, drugs, cell phones, and warm clothing).\nWARNING to readers: This book contains offensive language and graphic descriptions of criminal activity.\nThe Story of the Neighborhood Struggle\nRichard Stanley recounts his tumultuous childhood of growing up in the dangerous neighborhood of Otay, surrounded by gangs, drugs, violence, and poverty.\nHis crimes started with petty shoplifting before graduating to bank robbery. After a short time, Stanley had perfected his craft and hit multiple banks. Each time, he and his crew evaded capture, but one critical mistake cost him everything. The FBI finally tracked him down, and Stanley was sentenced to hard time in one of Southern California’s worst prisons, but his story was only beginning.\nStanley details his time in prison and how he sold drugs from behind bars. He also illustrates what daily life was like in jail, his interactions with the other inmates, and the dark side of the correctional officers whose jobs are to maintain law and order. He wondered just who the criminals were—the guards or the inmates. Maybe both.\nMaking the Case for Prison Reform\nAfter his release, Stanley learned the ropes of—and became very successful in—adult online marketing with exotic dancers and professional escorts where he was introduced to Bitcoin as a form of payment.\nHe schooled himself in Bitcoin trading and other cryptocurrencies. Although he doesn’t say he’s an expert, he’s moved up in the world to swanky Newport Beach, where his business is based, and where he lives a life far from the hellhole of the two-man prison cell at Donovan. [This book contains bootlegged graphic photos of prison life taken by the cellies behind bars.]\nWith his degree in “business” from one of California’s finest institutions where he was given a free ride in their eight-year program (with a seven-month sabbatical in solitude), Richard Stanley graduated from bank robbery to stacking Bitcoin as a legit entrepreneur and shares a vital message: People can change.\nLIMITED TIME discount priced", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "richard stanley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank robbe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bank robbery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank robber turns to bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san diego", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T17:18:40.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "20a74b8b9b545cddd9f5eb7d7b07036a7520c42e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRfy4UHGN1lvmIX5q11IOR4p0eSmXe6PTsB77erYT2CTRUFq8z77qns0YQTA6AVau95iluE9Hjie8uNoDAD6avOWORSLV2PYGuGZzejnaYSLHbB9bSe_wOxgWsp2KWo6UEqI4ey2.Xcwg--", "site_full": "www.exchangerates.org.uk", "site": "exchangerates.org.uk", "site_section": "http://www.exchangerates.org.uk/news/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Exchange Rates UK - Currency News", "title": "Bitcoin Price Today: BTC Fades Gains as Low Volumes Haunt the Crypto Currency Marketplace", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Today: BTC Fades Gains as Low Volumes Haunt the Crypto Currency Marketplace", "published": "2018-06-05T10:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 39881, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "20a74b8b9b545cddd9f5eb7d7b07036a7520c42e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRfy4UHGN1lvmIX5q11IOR4p0eSmXe6PTsB77erYT2CTRUFq8z77qns0YQTA6AVau95iluE9Hjie8uNoDAD6avOWORSLV2PYGuGZzejnaYSLHbB9bSe_wOxgWsp2KWo6UEqI4ey2.Xcwg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "François Auré", "published": "2018-06-05T10:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Today: BTC Fades Gains as Low Volumes Haunt the Crypto Currency Marketplace", "text": "Bitcoin Price Today: BTC Fades Gains As Low Volumes Haunt The Crypto Currency Marketplace Bitcoin Price Today: BTC Fades Gains As Low Volumes Haunt The Crypto Currency Marketplace Facebook BTC/USD back below $7500\nThe run in cryptocurrency markets over the weekend came to abrupt end at the start of the week as an unfortunate dip in the price has now taken a decent chunk out of any optimism which was surfacing for Bitcoin. While $8000 was once almost in sight there is now considerable daylight between the major cryptocurrency and that crucial psychological level. As the rest of the conventional markets remain fixated with developments in trade wars, Bitcoin is attracting less and less attention. Low market volumes are plaguing the space and there is no apparent reason for anyone to jump in with little to no news or developments as the financial regulators of the world are planning on how they will deal with tariffs on steel and aluminium rather than the cryptocurrency space which is now apparently way down on the list of concerns. Price action turns bearish once more for Bitcoin\nTechnical analysis is still looking relatively constructive but the dangers of low volume remain. Omkar Godbole, an analyst at Coindesk is once again noticing that the lack of speculation is creating a potentially dangerous false signal for the bulls, creating a potential trap if they start to put too much credence in the price extending higher,\n“The upside break of the falling trendline has opened the doors for a rise to $8,000. However, low volumes may indicate a false breakout. A downside break of the rising wedge seen in the 4-hour chart would allow a drop to $7,040. Only a high-volume break above $7,700 could yield a sustainable rally to $8,000.”\nSpecifically, Mr. Godbole also specifically detailed the drop in volume, which has now been demonstrated to be a considerable dip from the typical, as we are now beneath $5 billion dollars in amounts traded,\n“Daily trading volume fell 1.77 percent to $4.85 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Further, rolling 24-hour trading volume currently stands at $4.95 billion – down 22.5 percent from the current quarterly average of $6.38 billion.\nThe cryptocurrency markets might be dead at the moment but space continues to attract investment. Job postings still continue to flow into sites like Angel-list, and it appears entrepreneurs are using this opportunity to continue to develop their businesses. People were talking about Bitcoin needing to be less volatile to be more useful as a currency, it could be that we are on our way there. François Auré Traded Forex for 6 years.

because he was the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2013. But when it comes to talking about Bitcoin, man does not chew his words.

The market has cracked the $7500 level, and it looks likely that we are ready to go a bit lower as we are closing at the bottom of the daily candle. I think that the market could go down to the $7000 level. This candle is a very negative, but we do have a little bit of support just below. I think that if we get some continuation today, we will more than likely go looking towards the lows again, especially near the $7000 level. Rallies at this point should continue to have plenty of resistance above, as the $8000 level should be a bit of a “ceiling” in the market. I think that it’s only a matter time before the sellers get involved even if we do rally. The US dollar has been strengthening quite a bit, but beyond that the crypto currency market continues to struggle in general.\nBTC\\/JPY\nBitcoin also fell against the Japanese yen as you can see, using the ¥850,000 level as resistance. The market looks likely to continue to go lower, perhaps reaching towards the ¥800,000 level, perhaps even reaching down to the ¥700,000 level. That is the bottom of this overall range, and I think it makes sense that we would test that area again. If we break down below the ¥700,000 level, that would be extremely negative as it would be yet another sign of weakness, and the fact that we could not reach the top of the consolidation area the last time we rally, gives me pause to think that we are in fact going to see a break down eventually. At that point, I suspect ¥600,000 would be the next target.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T20:07:12.012+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 28308, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=3900", "requestsLeft": 623}
