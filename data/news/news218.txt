He said that in the long-term Ethereum can become just as influential as Apple is. He added:\n“Ethereum interests me because it can do things and because it’s a platform.”\nAccording to Forbes, Wozniak happened upon Bitcoin and Ethereum in its early days, although he divested from crypto in early 2018. Wozniak said he still owns one Bitcoin (BTC) and two Ethereum (ETH) to “experiment with paying for different things.”\nOn Thursday, in his opening speech at the conference, Wozniak called blockchain “the next major IT revolution that is about to happen.” He said that both blockchain and cryptocurrencies will achieve their full potential in a decade. In October of last year, Wozniak said at the Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas that Bitcoin is better than gold or the US dollar.\nAfter Apple, Wozniak has remained part of the the tech world, founding the coding academy Woz University that has 31 coding centers across the US.

They’ll message you, out of the blue, asking if you know any private sellers, and will offer to set up a deal for your mutual benefit. The majority of these men (for they are always men) are genuine in their intentions. This does not disguise the fact, though, that BTC brokers are little more than sharks circling the same prey.\nAlso read: Research Paper Finds Transaction Patterns Can Degrade Zcash Privacy Brokers Outnumber Buyers and Sellers 100:1\nAnyone can become a bitcoin broker: change your Linkedin title to “OTC Bitcoin Broker” and you’ve done it. Brokerage is a job that, like most cryptocurrency roles, outside of development, requires no formal qualifications. Just as anyone can call themselves an ICO advisor, anyone can assume the mantle of bitcoin broker, consigning them to start spamming Linkedin users for buyers and highly coveted sellers.\nTo understand the viral spread of brokers, it’s necessary to understand the conditions that led to large OTC sellers coming about. Back in the day, it was possible to acquire a lot of bitcoin for very little money. A lot of people mined it; some made it from trading shitcoins; and a few simply bought a bunch of BTC and then had the presence of mind to hodl, through thick and thin, for years.\nMost brokers will take on anything from 500 BTC upwards as an OTC deal, often operating on behalf of family funds seeking to acquire bitcoin in bulk. But what brokers are really chasing is the big one – deals of 10,000 BTC or more, in which a brokerage commission of 3% is worth millions of dollars. The number of bitcoin addresses containing between 10k and 100k BTC sits at little more than 100, however, and while some sellers have their coins distributed across multiple wallets, bona fide whales looking to sell are rare. Because the rewards for finding one are so great, a swarm of brokers, each chasing “the big one”, has proliferated. How an OTC Deal Works\nSellers want to sell OTC to avoid the sort of slippage that occurs when unloading large amounts of BTC on an exchange. Whales also value their privacy, and while they are still required to undergo KYC to complete an OTC deal, their identity is only going to be shared with the broker, their attorney, and the escrow service. Normally, even the buyer won’t know the identity of the person they are buying the coins from. The seller provides “proof of satoshi” by moving a fraction of a bitcoin from the wallet they control, the buyer provides proof of funds in the form of a bank certification of deposit or credit and a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and a letter of intent (LOI) are signed. The process usually works as follows: Attorney for the buyer prepares LOI detailing terms including BTC purchase amount, commission, net discount and other details Proof of funds is provided within a specific timeframe of signing the LOI. A screenshot is not accepted: cryptographically provided proof of coin, sent via the blockchain, is required Master Fee Protection Agreement as well as Draft Purchase Agreement and Escrow Agreement may then be circulated and signed by all parties Money is placed in escrow, escrow verifies receipt of funds and BTC is sent to buyer’s wallet Transfer may be done in full or in tranches depending on the agreement\nGiven the desire of buyer and seller to preserve their privacy, and the need for each party to be connected in the first place, brokers play a vital role. But due to the lucrative prize at stake, it’s a job that attracts a lot of chancers – and a lot of Linkedin requests, much to the chagrin of other cryptocurrency users.

Shares No matter how you acquire Bitcoins , it will likely not be anonymous. This section highlights a few options for acquiring Bitcoins that are relatively private, or at least not overwhelmingly invasive. To increase your privacy, do not carry devices with you that have SIM cards in them, and never log your location with GPS.\nBuy Bitcoins in person You can buy bitcoins in person at Bitcoin meetups, through the “marketplace” option of the Mycelium wallet (the marketplace exists on the Android version only), or by finding traders on the LocalBitcoins platform.\nThe best place to meet traders in person is in a busy but not crowded place that offers free Wi-Fi. Public libraries or cafes are great venues for these appointments.\nBoth parties should allow enough time to wait for at least one confirmation of the Bitcoin transaction. To make sure your Bitcoin transaction gets confirmed by the network, you don’t need to bring a Bitcoin wallet with you; just knowing your address is enough. Enter the address into the search field on Blockcypher or any other blockchain explorer and watch as the transaction comes in and confirms.\nGet Bitcoin From an ATM Bitcoin ATMs are common in some countries but rare in others. Check Coin ATM Radar to see if there’s one near you! Make sure to check the “other services” box in the bottom-left corner, or you might be missing out on some places where bitcoins are sold as vouchers.\nEach machine differs in how it handles your personal information. Some might not ask for anything other than your Bitcoin address and cash, while others might want your phone number, fingerprint or passport. Just try the machine out with a small amount. Asking the machine’s operator can be tricky, because there’s a risk they might file a suspicious activity report.\nIf there is video surveillance at the Bitcoin ATM, you might not be able to hide from it. Even still, showing up at a Bitcoin ATM with a ski mask would make you look too suspicious, no matter how much you value your privacy.\nAccept Bitcoins as a Payment or Donation If you’re regularly spending bitcoins, it makes perfect sense to accept them as payment too as you will no longer need to worry about how to acquire them. The bitcoins you accept will not be anonymous either since there might be a record somewhere that they were paid to you, but they are likely already more difficult to link to you for a passive observer than the bitcoins you buy at an exchange, where records are kept in detail and made available to several parties.\nMine Bitcoins Mining Bitcoin is not a profitable endeavor for hobbyists, but if you need a steady flow of Bitcoin and you have access to cheap electricity and free cold air, along with excess capital lying around, it can be an interesting alternative for acquiring bitcoins.\nTo mine Bitcoin, get yourself a Bitcoin mining machine , paid with cash or credit card, plug it in, point it to a mining pool, and watch the earnings come in daily.\nBe aware, though: you are making an immense bet on the Bitcoin network, and there are many ways you might lose your investment. Make sure to read a lot about this topic before you start!\nAlso, there are many dubious services offering you mining contracts. They promise you gains from a Bitcoin mining operation without the hassle of acquiring machines or electricity. Most such mining contracts are accidental or deliberate ponzi and pyramid schemes, and you will lose all your money.\nAlso take a look at the best GPUs for mining Obfuscate Transfers Between Identities Every time you move funds between your identities you will need to obfuscate them. To do that, you can “obfuscate”, “tumble” or “mix” your bitcoins.In this section we recommend services that use the concept of Coinjoin, in which the transactions of many users are combined into one transaction to obfuscate which user controls which funds.\nHelix Helix uses a long chain of Coinjoin transactions to tumble your bitcoins.\nGrams, the makers of Helix, is trying to be the Google of the dark web by indexing dark websites, building reviews, and allowing users to mix and tumble their coins.\nUsing Helix requires a membership, but you can use Helix Light without a membership. Just navigate to the official site with the Tor Browser and enter the recipient address (or the address of your identity that you want to send bitcoins to). You can add a random delay (which might be a few hours) and ask for more layers of transactions to make your payment more anonymous.\nYou can record your helix status ID or the URL if you want to come back later to check your transaction status. The fee per transaction is 2.5% and a 0.02 bitcoin minimum transaction amount.\nAs a member, Grams allows you to use the regular Helix service, which supposedly differs from Helix Light by handing you coins that have never been used on a dark market before. Of course this is difficult to verify, as Grams has no way knowing where the funds come from either. A membership will cost you 0.01 BTC as an entry fee, although this fee will be applied to your balance.\nJoinmarket Joinmarket is a decentralized network that allows you to use Coinjoin with other users without the need for a centralized party and without requiring you to put trust in the other users. Unlike using a centralized service, when you use Joinmarket, your bitcoins never leave an address that you control, and you don’t run into the risk of the service shutting down during your transaction, or the service maliciously stealing your bitcoins.\nInstalling and using Joinmarket requires a considerable amount of technical knowledge. Despite this, we encourage you to read their guides and try it out because the lower risks and fees are worth climbing the learning curve!\nDarkwallet Darkwallet was developed by Peter Todd, Amir Taaki, and other distinguished privacy advocates. Unfortunately, it’s still in alpha version and has been for a while, which means it is untested software that likely contains a few bugs. It is not recommended to use it on a day-to-day basis, as unexpected behavior might even lead you to lose your Bitcoin.\nLexie M writes about information security, bitcoin, and privacy. She is excited about empowerment through technology, space travel, and pancakes with blueberries and blogs for ExpressVPN who is TechRadar’s number one VPN provider .

There was free beer served from an ID-validating dispenser, Warren Buffet was criticized for his “rat poison” view of cryptocurrency, and there were plenty of business announcements, including news from eToro, Netki, Bitmain and Circle. Catch up on these stories and more in this week’s Bitcoin Magazine review.\nFeatured stories by Amy Castor, Colin Harper and Kyle Torpey\nStay on top of the best stories in the bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. Subscribe to our newsletter here . Fred Wilson Explains Why Warren Buffett Doesn’t Get Bitcoin\nIn his 2018 annual shareholder meeting at Berkshire Hathaway recently, Warren Buffet referred to bitcoin as “rat poison.” Venture capitalists Fred Wilson and Balaji Srinivasan had a chat with Wall Street Journal reporter Paul Vigna on the mainstage of Consensus 2018. The pair of tech investors pointed out the differences between Buffett’s approach to investing and how the crypto asset market works. Civic Demos Proof of Concept With Beer Vending Machines, Launches ID Codes\nBlockchain identity verification platform Civic has emerged from Consensus 2018 with a project that imagines a network of validators and service providers who work together to verify individual identities. Conceptually, new users would put identity information on a smart contract that would get validated with references on the blockchain that attest to its validity. Then service providers can request to validate said information, which would streamline ID checks and help prevent against fraud.\nCivic showed a working proof of concept using their Civic app. Anyone verified on the platform can scan a QR code to prove that they’re of legal drinking age. In a partnership with Anheuser-Busch, Civic unveiled the vending machine at Consensus 2018, offering anyone who used it a free brew from the “world’s first crypto beer vending machine.” Digital Identity Company Netki Launches Investor Validation Solution\nLos Angeles based Netki just made it easier for companies launching token sales to onboard their customers in a way that supports compliance with existing security laws, using their digital identity confirmation platform. The company is adding investor validation to its existing know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) solution. The service allows investors to upload requisite documents via a web browser or mobile app. Compliance is a huge concern for ICO projects right now. Regulators are in the midst of trying to decide how to label virtual currencies, and it is looking as if they may rule that many existing tokens are non-compliant securities. Social Cryptocurrency Trading and Brokerage Firm eToro Is Expanding to U.S.\neToro is a regulated global brokerage firm located in Israel that trades in cryptocurrencies, stocks, commodities, ETFs and more. Having recently received $100 million in funding, the company is currently in talks with U.S. financial institutions, regulators and regulatory advisors, and has already registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The company is opening an office in New Jersey and plans launch a crypto wallet later this year. Bitmain Leads Circle’s $110 Million Round; Teams Up to Create Stable Coin\nBitmain continues to make news. The largest of the Bitcoin mining operations is putting its muscle behind mobile payments and cryptocurrency trading firm Circle by leading a $110 million Series E round of funding, the companies announced at Consensus this week.\nThey are also joining forces to create a “stablecoin,” a cryptocurrency that is pegged to a stable asset. The goal is to eventually have lots of stable tokens, all backed by different fiat currencies, managed by CENTRE, but the first will be Circle USD Coin (USDC), a coin backed one-to-one by the U.S. dollar with the fiat to be stored in an auditable bank account and redeemable by verified buyers.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .

There was free beer served from an ID-validating dispenser, Warren Buffet was criticized for his “rat poison” view of cryptocurrency, and there were plenty of business announcements, including news from eToro, Netki, Bitmain and Circle. Catch up on these stories and more in this week’s Bitcoin Magazine review.\nFeatured stories by Amy Castor, Colin Harper and Kyle Torpey\nStay on top of the best stories in the bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. Subscribe to our newsletter here . Fred Wilson Explains Why Warren Buffett Doesn’t Get Bitcoin\nIn his 2018 annual shareholder meeting at Berkshire Hathaway recently, Warren Buffet referred to bitcoin as “rat poison.” Venture capitalists Fred Wilson and Balaji Srinivasan had a chat with Wall Street Journal reporter Paul Vigna on the mainstage of Consensus 2018. The pair of tech investors pointed out the differences between Buffett’s approach to investing and how the crypto asset market works. Civic Demos Proof of Concept With Beer Vending Machines, Launches ID Codes\nBlockchain identity verification platform Civic has emerged from Consensus 2018 with a project that imagines a network of validators and service providers who work together to verify individual identities. Conceptually, new users would put identity information on a smart contract that would get validated with references on the blockchain that attest to its validity. Then service providers can request to validate said information, which would streamline ID checks and help prevent against fraud.\nCivic showed a working proof of concept using their Civic app. Anyone verified on the platform can scan a QR code to prove that they’re of legal drinking age. In a partnership with Anheuser-Busch, Civic unveiled the vending machine at Consensus 2018, offering anyone who used it a free brew from the “world’s first crypto beer vending machine.” Digital Identity Company Netki Launches Investor Validation Solution\nLos Angeles based Netki just made it easier for companies launching token sales to onboard their customers in a way that supports compliance with existing security laws, using their digital identity confirmation platform. The company is adding investor validation to its existing know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) solution. The service allows investors to upload requisite documents via a web browser or mobile app. Compliance is a huge concern for ICO projects right now. Regulators are in the midst of trying to decide how to label virtual currencies, and it is looking as if they may rule that many existing tokens are non-compliant securities. Social Cryptocurrency Trading and Brokerage Firm eToro Is Expanding to U.S.\neToro is a regulated global brokerage firm located in Israel that trades in cryptocurrencies, stocks, commodities, ETFs and more. Having recently received $100 million in funding, the company is currently in talks with U.S. financial institutions, regulators and regulatory advisors, and has already registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The company is opening an office in New Jersey and plans launch a crypto wallet later this year. Bitmain Leads Circle’s $110 Million Round; Teams Up to Create Stable Coin\nBitmain continues to make news. The largest of the Bitcoin mining operations is putting its muscle behind mobile payments and cryptocurrency trading firm Circle by leading a $110 million Series E round of funding, the companies announced at Consensus this week.\nThey are also joining forces to create a “stablecoin,” a cryptocurrency that is pegged to a stable asset. The goal is to eventually have lots of stable tokens, all backed by different fiat currencies, managed by CENTRE, but the first will be Circle USD Coin (USDC), a coin backed one-to-one by the U.S. dollar with the fiat to be stored in an auditable bank account and redeemable by verified buyers.

From November to December 2017, it increased by 223 percent . It fell by 59 percent between January and February 2018, increased by 64 percent from February to March and then dropped again during March by 40 percent.\nWhile this isn’t necessarily a reason to give up on Bitcoin, it does serve as a stark warning to those who plan to invest in it.\nWhy does this digital currency have so many ups and downs? Many of the same factors that influence changes in the value of other items affect the price of Bitcoin. Because it’s so new and different than other currencies though, many of these impacts are exaggerated.\nHere are five of the primary factors influencing the price of Bitcoin.\n1. Supply and Demand\nThis one will be obvious to anyone who has taken an introductory economics course. Bitcoin, like other currencies, is subject to the impacts of supply and demand.\nThe supply of Bitcoin is analogous to that of gold. Just as there is a pre-determined amount of gold in the earth, the Bitcoin protocol has a predetermined number of Bitcoins within it. People need to mine gold to bring it into the marketplace.\nSimilarly, people must mine Bitcoin by using computing power to solve a complex mathematical equation. When miners successfully solve this puzzle, they earn Bitcoins, which increases their supply.\nThe demand side of the equation works the same for Bitcoin as it does for gold and other resources. The more people that want Bitcoin, the more the price of a coin increases.\n2. The Media and Peers\nResearch has shown that media coverage is one of the biggest influencers of the price of Bitcoin. The more media coverage it gets, the more people are aware of it and may invest in it. Positive media coverage typically causes price increases, while negative coverage results in drops in prices.\nThis pattern doesn’t only apply to media. Opinions and behaviors of investors often influence the actions of their peers and, therefore, Bitcoin’s price.\nSimilarly, when new businesses decide to take cryptocurrencies as payment, awareness, investment and prices tend to spike.\nMore online and brick-and-mortar stores are starting to accept Bitcoin, causing more people to view it as legitimate. You can now even pay for doctor’s office visits with cryptocurrency in various places around the world.\n3. Political Changes\nAs with other currencies, political events influence the price of cryptocurrencies.\nHowever, the change in value is often opposite that of the relevant government-sponsored currency. Lack of certainty in a country’s economy causes people to put their trust in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin instead because it isn’t tied to any government.\nThe 2015 economic crisis in Greece led to a surge in interest in Bitcoin from Greek traders . Similar effects occurred when Britain decided to leave the European Union and when the United States elected Donald Trump as president.\n4. Changes in Government Regulation\nBecause Bitcoin is such a novel concept, governments have struggled to determine how, and whether, to regulate it.\nBitcoin isn’t tied to any government, yet regulations can directly impact how the system works. Regulatory decisions involving digital currency have led to both surges and drops in their prices.\nWhen China, the world’s biggest crypto market, cracked down on Bitcoin and shut down several coin exchanges, the price of Bitcoin fell dramatically . When the Japanese government officially recognized Bitcoin as legal tender, its price shot up over the next several months.\n5. Changes to the Rules of Bitcoin\nNo single entity controls Bitcoin, but the Bitcoin community occasionally makes decisions that affect how the system, known as a blockchain, works. Miners run the software that verifies Bitcoin transactions and, so, determine the rules of what a valid transaction is.\nAttempts to change these rules sometimes results in the creation of a fork , which causes the formation of two separate chains that each follow different rules. As long as there are miners willing to work on each chain, though, they are both valid.\nIn the past, the period before a fork occurs caused uncertainty and a drop in price .

For the past two years, Harris ran JP Morgan’s In-Residence program which was focused on finding and partnering with fintech startups. He will now report to the head of blockchain initiatives at JP Morgan, Umar Farooq.\nAlthough Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan’s CEO, had previously condemned the cryptocurrency industry in September 2017, stating that “bitcoin is a fraud” and “bitcoin is worse than the tulip bubble,” he told CNBC in December 2017 that “I’m open-minded to uses of cryptocurrencies if properly controlled and regulated.” A Swedish firm then reported him for market abuse, suggesting the JP Morgan CEO was trying to sway markets.\nFinancial institutions which were once weary and uncertain of the impact of cryptocurrencies are now exploring various uses of the technology. According to Thomson Reuters , one in five finance firms are planning to be involved with cryptoassets in 2018. These firms are also looking to enter the market within the next six months.\nAdvertisement\nadvertisement\nJP Morgan Heads Deeper into the Crypto and Blockchain Sector\nFinancial News broke the news on Harris’ new role seen on his personal LinkedIn profile. Harris’s new role as the head of crypto-assets strategy will involve identifying and leading new cryptocurrency projects for JP Morgan. He will also analyze cryptocurrency custody services and assess how JP Morgan can leverage blockchain technology in their payments business. Harris will also work closely with Christine Moy, JP Morgan’s program lead for the Blockchain Center of Excellence.\nAs reported by Fortune , JP Morgan has experimented with Bitcoin’s underlying technology, the blockchain, over the last two years. One of JP Morgan’s experiments even led to Quorum, an enterprise-ready distributed ledger and contract platform. Bloomberg also reported that the banking company considered making Quorum an independent entity.\nIt remains uncertain whether JP Morgan will trade cryptocurrencies like Goldman Sachs.\nJP Morgan’s Head of Corporate and Investment Banking mentioned to CNBC that “we are looking into the space. I have no doubt that in one way or another, the technology will play a role. If we need to clear futures of Bitcoin, can we do it? Yes. Have we done it? No.”\nFinancial Institutions Explore Ways to Enter Cryptocurrency Market\nAlthough JP Morgan, is entering the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, it’s not the first major bank to do so. Goldman Sachs is even setting up a trading desk focused on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The goal is to commence trading by the middle of the year, in June 2018. The bank mentioned to Bloomberg that “in response to client interest in digital currencies, we are exploring how best to serve them.\nSam Chadwick, director of new content initiatives at Thomson Reuters, was significantly shocked that 20 percent of financial institutions plan to be involved with cryptoassets in 2018. These financial institutions did not have any interest in exploring cryptocurrencies in 2017 but instead focused purely on blockchain technology and different implementation possibilities.

Not all of those forks have been successful, which is only to be expected. It now seems there will be another fork that users should be aware of, which goes by the name of BitcoinZap. Not too much information has been unveiled at this time, but it is evident that this is another attempt at bringing two currencies together in a meaningful way. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT BITCOINZAP?\nSo far, only the briefest of announcements has been made regarding BitcoinZap . As the community has noted with various Bitcoin hard forks in the past, such projects mainly rely on hype and speculation to build interest. Bitcoin will always be Bitcoin, and anything derived from it through a hard fork or otherwise will be an altcoin.\nBitcoinZap will not fare any better in this regard, even though most of its specifics have yet to be unveiled. That will occur on May 21, even though it is not necessarily a date most people will put on their agendas. Hyping a project prior to releasing its details usually hints that nothing significant will be announced when people expect it.\nThe BitcoinZap project is a fork of some sort, and it will focus on aggressive transparency and a clear developed roadmap. Since that roadmap won’t be revealed until a few days from today, it is evident there will be a fair amount of speculation regarding what BitcoinZap entails exactly. The promise of a “coin that will not only innovate but also conflate into a bright future” leaves a lot of room for speculation, although it is important to keep one’s expectations in check.

The CNBC reporter raised a doubt which is shared by many people who are new to cryptocurrencies; with the price of bitcoin being “several thousand dollars, how do you buy a little deodorant with bitcoin?”\nSchmidt insisted that bitcoin payment method applies to all purchases — be it a bar of soap, or ten bottles of your favorite hair conditioner, reinforcing the fact that transactions can be of any fraction of bitcoin. A single bitcoin is divisible up to 100 million units called satoshi . Advertisement advertisement\nBTCManager takes this opportunity to educate its readers; bitcoin is more divisible than a dollar. You can send any fraction of bitcoin to anyone. You don’t need a whole bitcoin for anything (Except for HODLING it like a boss). You can buy a fraction of bitcoin, store it, sell it, trade it or do anything else with it. Read More here in our primer, ‘ Breaking Down the Bitcoin: Bits, Finneys and Satoshis .’\nAdditionally, Cammarata pointed out that most shoppers are likely to use bitcoin to purchase yearly or monthly subscription packages. He also emphasized on the point that customers are welcome to pick their preferred subscription packages. They are all customizable, he added, explaining that the online store allows shoppers to place orders on a long-term basis while letting them choose how much of a product they want. “Most yearly subscribers of Schmidt’s products are parents who are buying the company’s products for their college kids.”\nFor now, the company is only accepting bitcoin which was the default choice since it offers most liquidity. They are going to see “how it goes” and might consider adding more cryptocurrencies . Other Major Online Stores Adopting Bitcoin Payments\nSchmidt, however, is not the first online store to accept bitcoin for payments. Many retailers and services are already recognizing the world’s leading cryptocurrency.\nOverstock , for example, began accepting digital currency payments way before – starting January 2014, precisely. The online retail giant allows consumers to pay bitcoin for pretty much everything including television sets and laptops to ottomans and throw pillows.\nOther businesses that accept bitcoin payments include the likes of Newegg, Expedia, and Shopify.

Already operating in five countries with a plan to launch in more in the near future, the exchange aims to construct a global network of crypto transactions.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Building Global Network\nBitpoint Japan was among the first crypto exchanges to be fully licensed by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA). It is a subsidiary of Remixpoint (3825.T), a listed company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\nBitpoint has started a new round of expansion overseas, after entering a few countries last year. The company announced on Thursday that its Malaysian exchange has begun operations.\nThe Kuala Lumpur-based Bitpoint Malaysia opened its doors on May 17, offering spot trading and leverage trading. The fee for spot trading is 0.5% while leverage trading carries no fee. Deposits and withdrawals in Malaysian Ringgit are free during the grand opening. The exchange wrote:\nWe offer leverage of 2, 5, 10 and 25 times.\nFive cryptocurrencies are supported: BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, and XRP. Bitpoint Japan says it “will support Bitpoint Malaysia as a system and liquidity provider.” Global Operations\nIn addition to Malaysia and Japan, Bitpoint is also operating in South Korea , Taiwan, and Hong Kong . The exchange also opened an office in China in July last year before the Chinese government shut down all crypto exchanges in the country.\nIn addition, the exchange is reportedly preparing to enter Singapore, Thailand, and other Asian markets in the near future. Bitpoint detailed:\nBy continuing to provide overseas exchanges using the Bitpoint system in the future, we will continue to realize the construction of a global network of virtual currency transactions. Tougher Rules and Competition in Japan\nSince the hack of Coincheck, one of the most popular crypto exchanges in Japan, the FSA has tightened its cryptocurrency oversight. The country still has 16 fully-licensed crypto exchanges, which have recently formed an association to focus on self-regulation in an effort to rebuild public trust in the crypto industry.\nHowever, out of the 16 “deemed dealers,” which are those allowed to operate while their applications are being reviewed by the FSA, only 8 remain. The agency recently revealed that the other 8 have indicated that they are withdrawing their applications.\nMeanwhile, the agency confirmed that over 100 companies are seeking to enter the space, including Yahoo!

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

Billboards have appeared outside his office to convey the message of the crypto community. Also, a report suggests that the US cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase may apply for a banking license. Some conflicting views on the future of the Internet and its money complete Saturday’s roundup.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Friday: UN Backs Crypto-Solar Project in Moldova, Malta Uses Blockchain in Public Transportation “Warren: Maybe You’re Wrong About Bitcoin?”\nBillionaire investor Warren Buffett, known for his negative attitude towards cryptocurrencies, has been targeted in a bitcoin advocacy campaign lead by one of the largest cloud mining companies. Genesis Mining has recently posted billboards in front of Buffett’s office reminding him that he was wrong about Google and Amazon, and telling him that he may very well be wrong about bitcoin, as well.\nThe initiative has received a lot of support from the crypto community on social media. Genesis co-founder Marco Krohn posted on Twitter photos of the message to the investment guru with a short note saying: “Some new billboards outside of Warren Buffetts office! :)”\nEarlier this month, the American business magnate issued another warning in regards to bitcoin and the like. “Cryptocurrencies will come to a bad ending,” he said during the annual Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholder meeting, but he didn’t stop there. “If I could buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies, I’d be glad to do it but I would never short a dime’s worth,” he said, concluding that bitcoin is “probably rat poison squared.” Needless to say, Buffett’s comments provoked reactions and even inspired new business ideas. A tokenized marketplace called Ecoinmerce has announced the “Rat Poison Squared clothing line.” Т-shirts and hats are already offered online, but one can also order a mug with the winged phrase. The Money of the Internet and the Internet of Money\nSquare CEO Jack Dorsey has recently reiterated his views about bitcoin. “The internet is going to have a native currency, so let’s not wait for it to happen, let’s help it happen,” he said during a blockchain conference, adding: “I don’t know if it will be bitcoin but I hope it will be.” Dorsey, who is also the chief executive of Twitter, wants his payment processing company to be at the forefront of the efforts to achieve adoption of cryptocurrencies as global means of payment. In an interview in March, he predicted that there will be a single world currency in the next ten years. The billionaire believes that will be bitcoin, although he admits the cryptocurrency is still slow and costly.\nCircle co-founder and President Sean Neville, however, has a different vision of what’s to come for the digital space and the digital currencies. “Very excited about the idea of reimagining what global finance can be,” he says that a dollar token is the future of the Internet of money. “One of the things that’s interesting for us is how we take fiat money and put in on blockchains, how do we get the benefits of a public blockchain infrastructure, which might underpin something like HTTPS of money,” he told Bloomberg .\nNeville thinks there is a problem with using existing crypto assets for payments and settlements – they are very volatile. “So, it makes sense to have something like the US dollar represented as a token that can transfer anywhere in the world, to any digital wallet and any exchange that can support it,” he explained. Sean Neville, whose company raised $110Mn USD in a fundraising round led by Chinese giant Bitmain , believes that “we need a replacement for SWIFT .” He also predicted that eventually everything of value will be tokenized in a “hybrid world” of centralized and decentralized services. Boston based Circle has announced plans to issue a dollar-backed cryptocurrency called USD-C. Coinbase May Apply for a Banking License\nBy attracting some serious investments, Circle has actually joined the club of the most well-funded cryptocurrency companies. Another of its members, Coinbase , seems tempted to expand its financial business to include banking services. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal , representatives of the crypto brokerage have met with US regulators to talk about the possibility to apply for a banking license.\nA source quoted by the WSJ has revealed, that the company, which operates the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, has contacted officials from the US Office of the Comptroller of Currency earlier this year to discuss the matter. Beside the opportunity to broaden the types of products it offers, a banking license would allow Coinbase to operate without the need to partner with banks.\nWhat are your thoughts on today’s Bitcoin in Brief stories?

One startup has released a different kind of digital asset hardware wallet that is the same size and shape as a credit card. Due to the design of the new ‘Coolwallet S,’ the wallet can be hidden very easily alongside the option of being carried effortlessly in your back pocket.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Saturday: Warren Warned By Billboards, Coinbase Tempted by Banking The Credit Card Size and Shaped Coolwallet S Cryptocurrency Hardware Wallet\nCoolbitx is a Taiwanese financial-tech company founded by Michael Ou in 2014 that creates digital asset hardware wallets as well as smart contract development platforms. Back then the wallet creators started an Indiegogo campaign featuring the credit card shaped hardware wallet that allowed the secure storage of bitcoin private keys. During the Indiegogo campaign, the team raised $21,686 USD through 184 backers, 108 percent of their goal. Moreover, the startup Coolbitx is backed by firms such as Bitmain Technologies, SBI Holdings, Kyber Capital, Midana Capital, and more. The Coolwallet S specs.\nBasically, the Coolwallet S is the size of a traditional credit card at roughly 85.60 × 53.98 mm with rounded corners. It has a display on the upper left side which shows the wallet’s data like sending and balances. The creators of the Coolwallet S device claim that cryptocurrencies are held in an isolated offline environment and the card’s tactile button ensures an owner’s two-factor authentication process. The Coolwallet S holds five popular digital assets such as Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Core (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Ripple (XRP), and an assortment of ERC-20 tokens. What you get for $189 USD. Coolwallet is NFC & Bluetooth Compatible and Also Works With Mobile Phones\nThe wallet developers have made the card flexible, waterproof, and fire resistant as well. The Coolwallet S syncs data via encrypted Bluetooth technology and its NFC (Near Field Communication) charger powers the device with its own power dock. Moreover, the new Coolwallet S can be tethered to a mobile application for Android and iOS devices.\n“Keep it private, keep it safe, keep it Cool,” says the Coolbitx developers.\nHave total, end-to-end control over your cryptocurrency with an EAL5+ certified Secure Element microchip on a tamper-proof physical device.\nThe Coolwallet S is a bit more expensive compared to other hardware wallets on the market like Keepkey, Digital Bitbox, Trezor, and Ledger. The Coolwallet S costs $189 but users can purchase a ‘Duo’ package for $299. One thing we noticed when proceeding to the checkout is the wallet has to be purchased with a credit card, as there was no option to pay for this product with a cryptocurrency. This post will be followed up with a step-by-step review of the Coolwallet S as soon as our device arrives.\nWhat do you think about the Coolwallet S hardware wallet?

Major cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, Ether and EOS increased in the 3 to 7 percent range, pushing the cryptocurrency market towards the $400 region. Ethereum and Tokens\nEther, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain network, has been the best performing cryptocurrency amongst major digital assets in the likes of bitcoin, EOS, and Cardano. The price of Ether recovered to $713, rising by more than 5 percent.\nThe daily trading volume of Ether has started to near its previous levels in early January and February, during a period in which the price and volume of Ether achieved an all-time high. The rise in the volume of Ether has demonstrated the increase in the demand for cryptocurrencies from investors in the global market, especially in regions like Japan and South Korea.\nAccording to CryptoCompare, a cryptocurrency market data provider, the daily trading volume of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Japan and South Korea had significantly dropped from May 15 to 18, by nearly 30 percent.\nSome experts including Bithumb and UPbit executives previously stated that the imposition of impractical policies by the South Korean government led the volumes of exchanges to fall, but it remains unclear as to why the volume of Japanese exchanges suddenly fell within a 3-day period. It is possible that rumors surrounding bitFlyer caused the market to lose confidence temporarily, as the volume of the Japanese market started to recover after bitFlyer executives refuted rumors of potential hacking attacks.\nAs seen in the chart below, the volume of bitcoin has continuously declined since it tested the $10,000 support level earlier this month. After reaching $9,900, the price of bitcoin dipped below $7,900 and the volume of the global market declined.\nUnlike bitcoin, the daily trading volume of Ether has been relatively stable and in comparison to its volume in January, when the valuation of the cryptocurrency market was still in the $500 billion region, the volume of Ether has not fallen substantially. As such, in the short-term, it is highly likely that Ether will outperform most cryptocurrencies in the market.\nInvestors in the cryptocurrency market often reallocate their funds in major cryptocurrencies to tokens and small-scale cryptocurrencies if they start to become more confident in the short-term future of the market.\nOver the past 24 hours, tokens such as 0x (ZRX), Aelf (ELF), and Polychain (POLY) increased by around 10 to 20 percent, signifying the improvement of market conditions and increase in confidence from investors in the global cryptocurrency market. With the exception of some tokens such as DigixDAO, Binance Coin, and Storm, the majority of tokens outperformed bitcoin over the past 24 hours, gaining by more than 5 percent in value. No Consensus Pump\nEarlier today, Tom Lee, an analyst at Wall Street firm Fundstrat, stated that the cryptocurrency market did not benefit from the Consensus 2018 event, which Fundstrat previously described as a potential catalyst that could lead the cryptocurrency market to rebound.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

Mohammad Reza Pourebrahimi, the head of the Iranian Parliamentary Commission for Economic Affairs, referred to cryptocurrencies as a promising way for both countries to avoid US dollar transactions, as well as a possible replacement of the SWIFT interbank payment system. At a meeting with Dmitry Mezentsev, the Chair of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy, Pourebrahimi said that they have “engaged the Central Bank of Iran to start developing proposals for the use of cryptocurrency.” Pourebrahimi added that he discussed this topic in the State Duma’s Committee on Economic Policy the day before and that Iran had established cooperation with Russia on this issue: “They [Russia] share our opinion. We said that if we manage to move this work forward, then we will be the first countries that use cryptocurrency in the exchange of goods.” In turn, Mezentsev noted that “interbank relations between our countries should be of great importance” against the backdrop of international sanctions currently in place against both Russia and Iran. The meeting of the interbank working group on financial and interbank cooperation will be held in Tehran on July 5 of this year, RBC reports. Last week, Pourebrahimi had reported that without access to the international banking system, Iranian citizens have so far succeeded in siphoning a staggering $2.5 bln out of the country in crypto. Venezuela, another country facing international sanctions, recently released its own oil-backed cryptocurrency, the Petro, in a move that some critics saw as an illegal way to enter the international financial markets. After the Petro’s launch, both Turkey and Iran had expressed interest in releasing their own state-backed cryptocurrencies as well, with Russia’s own CryptoRuble reportedly set to launch in mid-2019.

There was free beer served from an ID-validating dispenser, Warren Buffet was criticized for his “rat poison” view of cryptocurrency, and there were plenty of business announcements, including news from eToro, Netki, Bitmain and Circle. Catch up on these stories and more in this week’s Bitcoin Magazine review.\nFeatured stories by Amy Castor, Colin Harper and Kyle Torpey\nStay on top of the best stories in the bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. Subscribe to our newsletter here . Fred Wilson Explains Why Warren Buffett Doesn’t Get Bitcoin\nIn his 2018 annual shareholder meeting at Berkshire Hathaway recently, Warren Buffet referred to bitcoin as “rat poison.” Venture capitalists Fred Wilson and Balaji Srinivasan had a chat with Wall Street Journal reporter Paul Vigna on the mainstage of Consensus 2018. The pair of tech investors pointed out the differences between Buffett’s approach to investing and how the crypto asset market works. Civic Demos Proof of Concept With Beer Vending Machines, Launches ID Codes\nBlockchain identity verification platform Civic has emerged from Consensus 2018 with a project that imagines a network of validators and service providers who work together to verify individual identities. Conceptually, new users would put identity information on a smart contract that would get validated with references on the blockchain that attest to its validity. Then service providers can request to validate said information, which would streamline ID checks and help prevent against fraud.\nCivic showed a working proof of concept using their Civic app. Anyone verified on the platform can scan a QR code to prove that they’re of legal drinking age. In a partnership with Anheuser-Busch, Civic unveiled the vending machine at Consensus 2018, offering anyone who used it a free brew from the “world’s first crypto beer vending machine.” Digital Identity Company Netki Launches Investor Validation Solution\nLos Angeles based Netki just made it easier for companies launching token sales to onboard their customers in a way that supports compliance with existing security laws, using their digital identity confirmation platform. The company is adding investor validation to its existing know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) solution. The service allows investors to upload requisite documents via a web browser or mobile app. Compliance is a huge concern for ICO projects right now. Regulators are in the midst of trying to decide how to label virtual currencies, and it is looking as if they may rule that many existing tokens are non-compliant securities. Social Cryptocurrency Trading and Brokerage Firm eToro Is Expanding to U.S.\neToro is a regulated global brokerage firm located in Israel that trades in cryptocurrencies, stocks, commodities, ETFs and more. Having recently received $100 million in funding, the company is currently in talks with U.S. financial institutions, regulators and regulatory advisors, and has already registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The company is opening an office in New Jersey and plans launch a crypto wallet later this year. Bitmain Leads Circle’s $110 Million Round; Teams Up to Create Stable Coin\nBitmain continues to make news. The largest of the Bitcoin mining operations is putting its muscle behind mobile payments and cryptocurrency trading firm Circle by leading a $110 million Series E round of funding, the companies announced at Consensus this week.\nThey are also joining forces to create a “stablecoin,” a cryptocurrency that is pegged to a stable asset. The goal is to eventually have lots of stable tokens, all backed by different fiat currencies, managed by CENTRE, but the first will be Circle USD Coin (USDC), a coin backed one-to-one by the U.S. dollar with the fiat to be stored in an auditable bank account and redeemable by verified buyers.\nPublished at Sat, 19 May 2018 13:12:33 +0000\nBitcoin Gold Bitcoin Commemorative Round Collectors Coin Bit Coin is Gold Plated Coins $0.99 End Date: Sunday Jun-10-2018 4:32:47 PDTBuy It Now for only: $0.99 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "warren buffet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balaji srinivasan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy castor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colin harper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyle torpey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul vigna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "big gathering  bitcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine's week", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T21:30:18.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b208e9616599a41c35428e05ce406cbb36c0ef81", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS2n246YqA9BwBr1XEo.xDds-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "title_full": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "published": "2018-05-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b208e9616599a41c35428e05ce406cbb36c0ef81", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS2n246YqA9BwBr1XEo.xDds-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInstall our official extension in Mozilla Firefox Store to start earning BTC – To get started visit ------> https://btctarget.blogspot.com/2018/04/guide-to-earn-btc-in-2018.html\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can trust us with 100%, we always pay!

Also, that Warren Buffet’s own Berkshire Hathaway is heavily invested in crypto’s incumbent competitors:\nWells Fargo – 23 billion Bank of America – 16.5 billion Goldman Sachs – 2.7 billion M&T Bank Corp – 850 million MasterCard – 500m Visa – 730m\nLook to DCEBrief for the entire story.\nDCEBrief is committed to focus on bringing issues that matter to your attention, utilizing an “Executive Summary” without fluff and filler.

But the question remains, do these billionaire heavyweights know what they’re talking about?\nGates insisted that Bitcoin was a ‘greater fool’ investment, as well as “one of the crazier, speculative things” he had ever seen, and then doubling down by saying he would “short it if there was an easy way to do it.”\nThe funny thing is that at the end of last year, shorting Bitcoin through derivatives was made possible. It’s surprising that someone like Gates doesn’t currently know what he can or cannot do in the Bitcoin investment landscape.\nFor his part, Buffett bashed Bitcoin by stating that “when you’re buying nonproductive assets, all you’re counting on is the next person is going to pay you more because they’re even more excited about another next person coming along.”\nThe Oracle of Omaha said the same thing about commodities several years ago. It’s true that it remains difficult to accurately predict commodity prices over time due to the challenges of maintaining consistent profit margins in a fluctuating market, but by no means is an investor not able to turn a profit with a properly timed investment, which is the case with Bitcoin or any other investment.\nMunger jumped in by saying Bitcoin was “worthless artificial gold,” and that it reminded him of “Oscar Wilde’s definition of fox hunting: the pursuit of uneatable by the unspeakable.”\nAll the Bitcoin bashing didn’t go unnoticed, causing the digital asset’s value to slip all the way down to $9,300. It’s true that these three billionaires are the best of the best and deserve to have their opinions heard, but this story has been played out over and over again.\nWhy is it that older successful men who are already dominating their respective industries continue to trash-talk Bitcoin? To be honest, I would not expect anything less. Bitcoin is a threat to the way we currently do things. It’s disrupting both the technology and financial industries, and those who have made a fortune in these sectors have nothing to gain from the digital currency and everything to lose.\nDoes a highly profitable centralized software company like Microsoft want a decentralized currency to come along? Of course not! The super-rich have nothing to gain from Bitcoin succeeding. There’s only so much wealth that can exist in the world, and if Bitcoin continues to advance on fiat currencies like the dollar, then those holding most of their wealth in dollars will possess less overall value.\nI would put people like Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and Charlie Munger at the top of this list. And let’s not forget about other Bitcoin haters like JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon or BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who called Bitcoin a fraud.

Augur’s reputation token will also be delisted next month. The exchange made this decision after receiving a business improvement order from the country’s financial regulator following the NEM hack.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Coincheck Delisting 4 Cryptocurrencies\nFollowing reports that Coincheck was going to delist monero (XMR), zcash (ZEC), and dash (DASH), the exchange has now confirmed that those cryptocurrencies will be delisted along with Augur’s reputation token (REP).\nThe four cryptocurrencies will be delisted on June 18, Coincheck emphasized, adding:\nThe target currencies [XMR, ZEC, DASH, and REP] held on the discontinued date will be sold at the market price and converted into Japanese yen.\nThe sales’ proceeds will then be credited to the customers’ accounts. Before that date, customers can sell or transfer these cryptocurrencies. The exchange says it has received many transfer requests, warning that it may be several days to complete the transfers. Business Improvement Order\nFollowing the NEM hack in January, Coincheck received a business improvement order from the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) on March 8. The exchange is a “deemed dealer,” meaning it has been allowed to operate while its application is being reviewed by the agency. The exchange has now been acquired by Monex Group. After delisting the above cryptocurrencies, Coincheck will continue to support BTC, ETH, ETC, LSK, FCT, BCH, XRP, XEM, and LTC.\nIn complying with the FSA order, the exchange says it is “drastically reviewing” its internal control and management control systems, as well as rethinking its “management strategy that thoroughly protects customers,” the announcement reads, adding that:\nIt is necessary [for us] to further develop and strengthen the management system of AML / CFT [Anti-Money Laundering/ Counter-Terrorist Financing] in the future.\nMonex CEO Oki Matsumoto “expects the exchange to secure an official license in Japan next month,” Fortune reported on Friday. FSA Cracks Down on Privacy Coin Listings\nNikkei reported earlier this month that the FSA has set new criteria for crypto exchanges. One of them concerns the types of cryptocurrencies listed on exchanges. “Those granting a high level of anonymity and easily used for money laundering will as a general rule be banned,” the news outlet described.\nThe FSA “strongly requests money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures not only for Coincheck but also for other virtual currency exchange operators,” News24 wrote.\nOut of the 16 licensed crypto exchanges in Japan, none have listed XMR, ZEC, DASH, or REP on their applications with the FSA.\nWhat do you think of Coincheck delisting the four cryptocurrencies?

Now you have the opportunity to take part in the creation of the exciting blockchain universe that opens new galaxies for you.\nLast Tuesday, the first Nordic blockchain game ICO commenced following on from a successful pre-sale earlier this year.\nThe Parsec Credit token will be used in the game making it the core of the economy. It can also be exchanged for Ethereum. And as the players accumulate wealth in-game, they also accumulate real world money. The developers aim to get Parsec tokens on as many cryptocurrency exchanges as possible and make it a liquid currency not just in the game, but also in the real world.\nBlockchain and Game Parsec Frontiers is regarded as one of the most exciting blockchain games in development, as it’s one of the first full games that deploys blockchain technology at the core of it’s virtual economy.\nJust recently Parsec Foundation and Artplant opened the auction for the first spaceships to be available in its game. The ARK-class ships is a limited edition available to the first 100 players, beginning with an auction that started on May, 15.\n“It’s a very natural step for a game like this to embrace blockchain technology to empower the virtual economy driving the game.” says Henning Rokling, the founder of the Parsec Foundation and COO in Norwegian game developer Artplant. “Not only will it give players full transparency of what assets, ships and resources are available and tradable, but it will also allow players to invest time or money into a game and also bring those investments out of the game if they want to.”\nLargest NEO Based MMO Early in May, Parsec Frontiers developers also made the key decision choosing Neo customized networks instead of EOS.IO.\nIt was a well-considered choice, as Neo has very advanced smart contracts which support several mainstream languages including C# and Java, which will be used by players along with the diagram-based solution they’re considering implementing. Parsec Frontiers is by far the largest game to choose NEO. For more information about Parsec Frontiers, please visit www.parsecfrontiers.com\nAbout Parsec Frontiers A rich and immersive space MMO with focus on trading, exploring and populating the galaxy in the years after Earth has been rendered uninhabitable by our own actions. With the virtual economy in the game backed by blockchain technology «Parsec Frontiers» adds a completely new element to such games, allowing players to trade and make a profit even before the game launches. The full game is set to launch in December 2019.\nAbout Artplant Artplant a Norwegian online game developer founded by Funcom and Innerloop veterans in 2001.

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

The satisfaction of saying “I told you so” to all the powerful naysayers who scoffed at crypto years before it became today’s most profitable trend.\nAnd that’s what the new documentary “Bitcoin: Beyond the Bubble” does so well, capturing the establishment freakout we in the crypto world have painstakingly endured for so many years.\nIt was only a few years ago that I was sitting on the set of Fox Business’ Varney & Co TV program, where a flabbergasted and skeptical Stuart Varney sneered at the notion of “taking my real dollars and...then you give me virtual money in return!”\nToday, we can look back and savor these moments of hilarity---while looking forward to crypto’s sweet continuing rise.\n“Bitcoin: Beyond the Bubble” explores the history of decentralized digital currency and speaks with industry experts---including yours truly---about where it’s going next.\nThe world is wising up to Bitcoin fast, which is fantastic news yet also offers unique new opportunities for investors.

As of April, its monitoring platform has found 421 fake cryptocurrencies, 60% of which are deployed overseas. The Committee has also outlined major red flags of these cryptocurrencies.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space 421 Fake Cryptocurrencies\nThe National Committee of Experts on the Internet Financial Security Technology (IFCERT), a Chinese government-backed industry organization, published the results of its analysis on fake cryptocurrencies on Friday.\nCiting that “In recent years, virtual currencies represented by bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, etc. have received continuous attention,” IFCERT pointed out that “some criminals are engaged in financial fraud or pyramid schemes under the cover of virtual currency.” The Committee added that fake cryptocurrencies frequently appear, “causing investors to suffer major losses.”\nIFCERT’s National Internet Financial Risk Analysis Technology Platform continuously monitors fake cryptos, the Committee detailed, elaborating:\nAs of April 2018, the technology platform has found 421 fake virtual currencies, of which more than 60% of fake virtual currency website servers are deployed overseas. Such platforms are difficult to find and difficult to track. The Red Flags\nThe Committee outlined some major red flags of these fake cryptocurrencies. Firstly, they adopt “pyramid-based” business models, claiming that their cryptocurrencies will generate high returns.\nSecondly, they have no real code, IFCERT described, noting that they either do not have a blockchain or cannot generate blocks for one.\nThirdly, they will not be traded on legitimate cryptocurrency exchanges, “so they often trade on over-the-counter or proprietary exchanges,” the report detailed, adding that:\nThere is a phenomenon that prices [on these platforms] are highly controlled by institutions or individuals, which tends to cause the illusion of rapid price increase. However, users often cannot conduct transactions or withdraw cash.\nIFCERT emphasized that fake cryptocurrencies have no value and are illegal, asserting that “Many of these platforms do not have business premises and business information, and servers are often deployed overseas,” so it will be difficult to recoup any losses for victims. 271 Fake ICOs\nOn Thursday, the Wall Street Journal independently published its finding after a review of documents produced for 1,450 initial coin offerings (ICOs). The publication “has found 271 with red flags that include plagiarized investor documents, promises of guaranteed returns and missing or fake executive teams.”\nInvestors have poured more than $1 billion into these 271 ICOs, the publication detailed, adding that “some of the firms are still raising funds, while others have shut down. Investors have so far claimed losses of up to $273 million in these projects, according to lawsuits and regulatory actions.”\nDo you think there are many more fake cryptocurrencies?

Also, I realized how much they have improved over the last few years, and I thought — they deserve a lot more buzz 😄! So here is a post that shows some of the things you can do with them, with some nice GIFs to make it easier to have a quick grasp at each topic. Screenshot tricks\nTake a screenshot of the whole page\nEnable the screenshot button in the settings, and press it to create an image that contains the page screenshot. It will be saved in the default downloads folder, using the current page width.\nTake a screenshot of a single node\nSelect an element in the Elements Inspector and right click it, then choose Screenshot Node : Remove a class from an element\nSometimes an element has multiple classes and you can’t immediately find out which class introduces a particular styling attribute. By selecting an element and clicking the .cls button at the top-right of the Rules panel, you can see a list of all the classes and you can easily disable/re-enable them.\nFrom there, you can also add a new class to that element: Drag-and-drop in the Elements panel\nIn the Elements panel, you can drag and drop any HTML element and change its position across the page Reference the currently selected element in the Console\nSelect a node in the Elements panel, and type $0 in the console to reference it.\nSelectors API shortcuts\nOne totally cool feature of the Firefox Dev Tools Console is the shortcuts for the Selectors API: $() is a shortcut for document.querySelector() $$() is a shortcut for document.querySelectorAll() Use the value of the last operation in the Console\nUse $_ to reference the return value of the previous operation executed in the Console\nReference any element from the Inspector, in the Console\nRight click any element and select Use in Console . It will be assigned to a temporary variable. Debugging JavaScript\nYou can set breakpoints on your JavaScript source files from the Debugger panel, and you can set any expression in the JS file to be watched:\nReloading the page, the breakpoints and watch expression settings are kept intact, and the script will halt at the desired position: Find out which font is actually used\nfont-family in CSS allows you to set a list of fonts to use, in case the first one is not found it falls back to the second and so on. But how do you know which font is actually applied when you look at the page? It’s the one underlined: Inspect CSS Grid\nCSS Grid is a recent new and amazing CSS feature.\nFirefox Dev Tools have a great inspector that helps us so much when using grids:\nIf you use grid template areas , you can display them using the “Display area names” checkbox:\nThanks for reading through this article!

Not all of those forks have been successful, which is only to be expected. It now seems there will be another fork that users should be aware of, which goes by the name of BitcoinZap. Not too much information has been unveiled at this time, but it is evident that this is another attempt at bringing two currencies together in a meaningful way. What do we Know about BitcoinZap?\nSo far, only the briefest of announcements has been made regarding BitcoinZap . As the community has noted with various Bitcoin hard forks in the past, such projects mainly rely on hype and speculation to build interest. Bitcoin will always be Bitcoin, and anything derived from it through a hard fork or otherwise will be an altcoin.\nBitcoinZap will not fare any better in this regard, even though most of its specifics have yet to be unveiled. That will occur on May 21, even though it is not necessarily a date most people will put on their agendas. Hyping a project prior to releasing its details usually hints that nothing significant will be announced when people expect it.\nThe BitcoinZap project is a fork of some sort, and it will focus on aggressive transparency and a clear developed roadmap. Since that roadmap won’t be revealed until a few days from today, it is evident there will be a fair amount of speculation regarding what BitcoinZap entails exactly. The promise of a “coin that will not only innovate but also conflate into a bright future” leaves a lot of room for speculation, although it is important to keep one’s expectations in check.\nAs the name somewhat suggests, it seems BitcoinZap will try to ride Bitcoin’s coattails. Whether or not doing so will pay off remains to be seen. Various other hard forks have tried to do so, and Bitcoin Cash is the only one that’s scored any major success in this regard. Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Private, and the upcoming Anonymous Bitcoin are all in far worse shape, but that is somewhat to be expected.\nWith the BitcoinZap mainnet not launching until August 18, there isn’t much to be excited about until that date comes around. There’s also the question of who the developers of this project are and whether or not they can actually deliver on their promise to launch the mainnet by that date. Unsurprisingly, there will be an attempt to get BitcoinZap listed on at least three exchanges prior to the launch of the mainnet, which seemingly confirms this will be another ‘money grab’ first and foremost.\nIt is evident that there will be a lot more Bitcoin hard forks moving forward, as this is the new preferred method of launching altcoins. Whether or not the world needs more versions of Bitcoin which may not necessarily bring anything new to the table is up for debate. Until we know what BitcoinZap attempts to achieve exactly, there will be a lot of speculation as to what this project is really all about.

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

With all these new mining facilities popping up, cryptocurrency mining’s energy usage has also reached new heights.\nAn energy research company based in the UK found that in the year 2017, the amount of electricity used to mine Bitcoin surpassed the annual energy usage of some 159 countries. Moreover, the energy spent globally on Bitcoin mining exceeded the electricity consumption of Ireland and most African nations. Issues that Bitcoin Miners are Facing There are serious problems as far as proof-of-work mining is concerned. Networks like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dash are becoming even more centralized. The power to control these networks have been placed in the hands of a few industrial scale mining operations that burn through electricity. To compete, individual miners have to rely on mining pools. Those mining pools contribute to network centralization. Mining is now becoming more of a problem than a solution. The Reasons for Mining Problems\nSuch mining issues are occurring because Bitcoin mining is accomplished with the help of energy-hungry mining computers which run 24 hours a day. These computers include the Batman S9, which consumes up to 1400 watts of electricity.\nMassive factory-style operations dominate today’s mining, and Iceland is a popular location for such activity. A warning has been issued by the Icelandic government stating that the country is running out of resources required to feed the endless demand for more energy from mining operations.\nThe Icelandic government stated that they would be unable to keep up with demand if every investor who is interested in mining operations were allowed to enter the country. READ Cryptocurrency Market Begins Recovery, Ethereum up 5%, Ontology and Storm up 12% Electricity Costs Remain a Key Concern for Miners\nIn the previous year, creating cryptocurrency became more profitable as prices reached new highs. A rapid global expansion of mining activity led to the introduction of hundreds of new tokens. Bitcoin alone had a total value of more than $325 billion in December, which exceeded the market capitalization of Wal-Mart. Its price rose to nearly $20,000, from less than $800 a year earlier.\nAccording to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, in order to retain and sustain Bitcoin, mining devices require an amount of energy that’s equivalent to 30 nuclear power reactors running at full capacity. Moreover, the industry is already using more power than all the world’s electric vehicles combined.\nMore efficient technologies might evolve around cryptocurrencies requiring less energy. But electricity costs remain a key concern for miners because Bitcoin fell to below $8,000 this month.\nEven in places where electricity prices are low, older operations are under pressure from investors and regulators due to compounding risks from volatile prices.\n“Miners are looking for where they can have higher margins,” said ETF Securities’ executive director and head of research and investment strategy, James Butterfill. Why Energy Sources are getting more Attention\nThis is happening because of the increasingly difficult computations which are needed to create new blocks. Even more powerful computers are required by the encrypted digital ledgers that underpin cryptocurrencies.\nTo keep from overheating, many of the big server farms require air conditioning. Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that in the past year, the industry’s electricity use jumped almost eightfold. It’s believed that total annual spending on power can eat up 30 to 60 percent of miners’ total revenues. READ Cryptocurrency Market Surge Imminent, Build Positions\n“The price of electricity mostly drives where mining is taking place,” said the founder of Cryptoeconomics Lab, Christian Catalini. “If the price of electricity increases in one location, mining will likely just move somewhere else.”\nIn addition to Bitcoin’s environmental sustainability, there’s also some doubt as to the financial viability of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency because of the exploding prices observed in recent months.\nAn article in Newsweek stated that by the year 2020, Bitcoin computer operations might consume the entire world’s energy. Another website, Digiconomist, claimed that the energy consumption of Denmark was equal to that of all Bitcoin operations. That’s equivalent to 3,071,823 US households’ energy consumption.\nSome experts opine that it’s difficult to measure the amount of electricity that Bitcoin consumes, as it’s spread all over the world. Other experts stated to the Washington Post that the energy consumption of Bitcoin was equal to the output of one to three nuclear reactors, because Bitcoin likely uses 1 to 4 gigawatts of electricity. That amount is equivalent to less than 1 percent of America’s electricity consumption, or no more than 0.14% of global electricity generation.\nThe Bitcoin network operates in a different way, and it becomes difficult to determine how much energy is consumed by mining operations. This digital currency is not controlled by any commercial clearinghouse or central bank. It’s controlled by a network of users who expend enormous amounts of computing power to build a blockchain comprised of Bitcoin transactions.\nMike Reed, who is the director of Intel’s Blockchain Program Office, believes that Bitcoin will continue to use more energy if its price continues to rise. Conclusion\nAll cryptocurrencies using proof-of-work mining algorithms are facing growing problems, including rising energy costs, increasing electricity usage, and centralization of mining. All these cryptocurrencies need to unite so that they can solve the current issues related to proof-of-work consensus. There’s a solution to every problem, and as time goes on, the problem involving energy and cryptocurrency mining is going to become more and more apparent. If nothing is done about this, government regulation of mining could be the next step.

Some new billboards outside of Warren Buffetts office! :)\n— Marco Krohn (@mkrohn5) May 16, 2018 Billboards Constructed to Troll Warren Buffett Draw Community Support\nThe billboards have drawn a lot of support from people on Twitter, some of whom speculate the investing guru doesn’t have any need for cryptocurrency given his wealth.\nOne tweeter suggested cryptocurrency will get Buffet’s attention when it is eventually used to tokenize conventional stocks.\nGenesis Mining’s bitcoin awareness billboard campaign is an effort to educate the public about bitcoin. One goal is to provide balance to the negative impressions that mainstream media often gives bitcoin.\nEarlier this month, Genesis Mining organized a “Bankers Against Bitcoin” demonstration at the 2018 Consensus blockchain conference in New York City. The protesters, who presented themselves as bankers, carried anti-bitcoin signs to convey the banking industry’s opposition to bitcoin.\nMarco Streng , CEO of Genesis Mining, noted on the Bankers Against Bitcoin website that decentralized technology marks the biggest competition banks have faced and noted that the protest represents what will happen to companies that fail to accept change. Campaign Supports Bitcoin And Blockchain Warren Buffett, the “Oracle of Omaha,” is one of bitcoin’s most outspoken critics. | Source: Shutterstock\nThe website noted the #ExploreBitcoin project began two years ago to raise public awareness about bitcoin and blockchain and has already executed numerous campaigns to raise support for the nascent cryptocurrency.\nIn 2016, The campaign attacked JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a strident bitcoin critic , with mobile billboards circling the Miami Bitcoin Conference.\nIn 2017, the campaign criticized journalists for negative coverage of bitcoin.\nThe campaign has also sponsored signs on top of taxis in Florida that pointed out that the 10,000 bitcoins that purchased two pizzas in 2010 would be worth $2.4 million at the time they were printed. Another taxi sign noted that bitcoin is a technology, not a company or an organization.\nHighway billboards in San Francisco and Los Angeles advised people that they can send money for free using bitcoin.\nPeople carrying signs at Western Union stores in Chicago, Washington, D.C. and New York saying “It shouldn’t cost money to send money. Send money for free with bitcoin. Anytime, anywhere.”\nThe campaign has also provided images that can be posted on social media quoting Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google, saying “Bitcoin is a remarkable cryptographic achievement and the ability to create something that is not duplicable in the digital world has enormous value.”\nMore campaigns, Streng says, will be coming.\nFeatured Image from Twitter ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marco krohn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ge", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "troll warren buffett draw community", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T05:57:07.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2f9b10e523413103d99e1f56ab05edebbe127965", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSw2M3CgVrrqpEWzcUPzL3wM-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Ncmax Bitcoin Auto Claim Code", "title_full": "Ncmax Bitcoin Auto Claim Code", "published": "2018-05-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2f9b10e523413103d99e1f56ab05edebbe127965", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSw2M3CgVrrqpEWzcUPzL3wM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ncmax Bitcoin Auto Claim Code", "text": "<?php\ndate_default_timezone_set(\"Lome/Togo\");\nerror_reporting(0);\n \n \nfunction call($addr) {\n    $data= \"address=$addr&sponsor=69038\";\n    $cok = tempnam('tmp','avo'.rand(1000000,9999999).'tmp.txt');\n    $c = curl_init(\"https://thebestbitcoinfaucet.com/\");\n    curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_REFERER, \"https://thebestbitcoinfaucet.com/\");\n    curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, true);\n    curl_setopt($c, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1;

In many regions of the world, governments appear to be taking a more serious approach to monitoring the activities of the crypto ecosystem. KYC and AML Procedures\nThe EU has been at the forefront of creating a robust regulatory framework for the burgeoning crypto market with a lot of emphasis on Know your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. On May 14, 2018, the EU agreed to a renewed drive at enforcing KYC and AML compliance in the crypto market.\nAccording to the working group, robust KYC and AML regulations makes it difficult for criminal elements to use cryptos as a vehicle for perpetrating crimes or hiding the proceeds from the illicit activities. As a result, different segments of the market including exchange platforms and wallet providers must carry out the same identity verification processes as banks.\nVetting the identity of customers is also essential in the fight against terrorist organizations who might take advantage of anonymous cryptocurrency transactions to fund their nefarious activities. In fact, together with money laundering, terrorist funding is the primary worry of many governments in the crypto sphere.\nThe EU aren’t the only ones calling for stricter KYC and AML regulations. In South Korea, anonymous trading is banned, and financial watchdogs regularly inspect the accounts of traders in search of inconsistencies and irregularities. Japan, via its Financial Services Agency ( FSA ), has also come down hard on exchange platforms concerning KYC. In the United States, exchange platforms are mandated to observe strict KYC guidelines which must be satisfied before a user is allowed to trade. Will Transparency Drive Crypto Adoption?\nThe mostly unregulated and anonymous nature of crypto transactions has made them a likely haven for criminals. Many experts believe that part of the meteoric rise in the prices of cryptocurrencies can be attributed to this aura of anonymity.\nPresently, the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market stands at over $400 billion . Cryptos have been identified as providing a conduit for illegal cash flows and the purchase of prohibited items, especially on the dark web platforms . Thus, commentators like Larry Fink, the chairman of BlackRock has described digital tokens as an “index of money laundering.”\nWith these new EU regulations, much of this anonymity should be eroded, paving the way for a more legitimate feel to transactions. Further to that, law enforcement and regulatory officials will be able to track and monitor crypto payments.\nOn the flip side, illegal cryptocurrency transactions can be moved from online exchange platforms into dark web domains where they become virtually impossible to track. If that happens, at least, legitimate crypto traders can rest assured in the knowledge that their transactions will not be deemed suspicious.

Co-founder Thomas Lee posted the group’s predictions that the bitcoin price would reach up to $64,000 by the end of 2019, citing the future trajectory of Bitcoin mining infrastructure growth as an underlying cause. He also predicted $91,000 in two years . CRYPTO: Our quant/data scientist @fundstratQuant publishing #bitcoin mining white paper. Crypto mining economics lead/explain $BTC price—suggests $39,000 per bitcoin by YE19. key takeaways below… pic.twitter.com/f5ZQ4py3jS\n— Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) May 10, 2018\nLee, a financial research analyst and Wall Street strategist, has in the past voiced his opinion that bitcoin will overtake gold as a store of value for the newer generations, and made another prediction prior to the fourth annual Consensus conference in New York regarding the crypto market overall.\nLee wrote to clients to point out that during the last Consensus conference, the bitcoin price rose by 69 percent and then 138 percent in the two months afterward. Last year’s conference saw attendance double from the year before, and this year the attendance also looked set to double from around 2,750 to over 7,000. The event took place from May 14 to May 16, with estimates on the actual attendance now reaching as high as 9,000 .\nPerhaps due to prior performance and the same conditions arising again, Lee predicted that the market would see a major rally during this year’s conference as well. While Lee pointed out that talks of mass regulation may put a damper on things, the overall message was clear:\n“Bottom line: We expect BTC and cryptocurrencies to behave similarly to prior years and rally during Consensus.”\nUnfortunately, it didn’t happen. Not only was there no rally but the market lost over $40 billion in value during the conference, with major currencies losing value across the board. Source: CoinMarketCap\nThe bitcoin price, meanwhile fell 3.25 percent to $8,250 by the end of the conference, even dipping below the $8,000 mark today before recovering to $8,262 at the time of writing. Source: CoinMarketCap\nInvestors have attributed the dip to a number of factors, including the perception that the conference did not seem to be designed to attract the industry’s core supporters. The ticket prices were considered to be unaffordable at $2,000 a head, and the fact that cryptocurrency was not accepted as payment was criticized as a lack of faith in the technology the conference was held to promote.\nThe talks were seen as overly shallow and pandering to an audience of newcomers, which was not in keeping with the high cost of the tickets, one of the reasons Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said he boycotted the event.\nFundstrat’s Thomas Lee called the lack of a rally “very disappointing”, citing a lack of regulatory clarity as the main issue and stated that the space needed major institutions to buy in in order for the space to grow and move past the “ blockchain not bitcoin ” mentality echoed by several major figures in business and finance. CRYPTO: #Consensus2018 rally did not happen, very disappointing. What we needed was a trifecta of progress: (i) institutional custody/tools; (ii) buy-in by banks/investment managers; (iii) regulatory clarity (3 of 3 needed), but we got progress on (i) and (ii).
