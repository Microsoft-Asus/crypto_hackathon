Called mining, individuals or companies engage in this activity in exchange for transaction fees and newly created bitcoins. Besides mining, bitcoins can be obtained in exchange for fiat money, products, and services. Users can send and receive bitcoins electronically for an optional transaction fee using wallet software on a personal computer, mobile device, or a web application. Bitcoin as a form of payment for products and services has seen growth,and merchants have an incentive to accept the digital currency because fees are lower than the 2-3% typically imposed by credit card processors. The European Banking Authority has warned that bitcoin lacks consumer protections. Unlike credit cards, any fees are paid by the purchaser not the vendor. Bitcoins can be stolen and chargebacks are impossible. Commercial use of bitcoin is currently small compared to its use by speculators, which has fueled price volatility. Bitcoin has been a subject of scrutiny amid concerns that it can be used for illegal activities. In October 2013 the US FBI shut down the Silk Road online black market and seized 144,000 bitcoins worth US$28.5 million at the time. The US is considered bitcoin-friendly compared to other governments. In China, buying bitcoins with yuan is subject to restrictions, and bitcoin exchanges are not allowed to hold bank accounts.

Co-founder and CEO Michael Cammarata claims Bitcoin has accounted for 5 to 10 percent of online sales since they started accepting the cryptocurrency on May 14.\n\"It's starting to be a percent of sales more than we expected,\" he said in an interview with Cheddar .\nThe all-natural deodorant comes in scents like lavender, tea tree, bergamot, and cedar and will set you back about $9, or 0.0011 BTC, a stick. Schmidt's is the first company owned by hygiene giant Unilever to accept cryptocurrency as a payment method.\nCammarata said:\nIt kind of was actually a last minute surprise. We got a lot of consumers that are like, 'Can we pay with Bitcoin'? We were playing around with the idea a little bit and our tech team was like, 'Should we do this should not do it?'\nBut he admitted they \"weren't that shocked\" when the company's social media savvy consumers asked to pay with Bitcoin.\n\"We have a lot of millennials and highly socially active consumers,\" he said.\nShopping with Bitcoin You can make purchases on Schmidt's Natural's site using Bitpay, a widely available Bitcoin payments provider found on Shopify and in popular mobile games by Zynga. When it comes to e-commerce and online shopping, Bitpay is the most ubiquitous.\nBut the service has had its fair share of controversy. Newegg is a Canada-based online computer and electronics seller that uses Bitpay. The payment provider came under fire last month when a Newegg shopper accused Bitpay of taking more than their share when it comes to network costs.\nRegardless, Bitcoin is becoming more widespread as a way to shop online. And as Schmidt's Naturals co-founder said, it will take consumers demanding more payment options to see it more commonly accepted.\n\"Whether it be a scent or a payment method, we are very highly engaged with our consumer,\" Cammarata said.\nWhat do you think about paying for goods like deodorant with Bitcoin?

Only 20% of the 1 billion complete tokens being provided within the ICO. Polybius, a regulated bank for ico.echat.io the digital generation, just launched an ICO with tokens that include the best to obtain 20% of profits. So what Byrne stated at the time Overstock started to allow Bitcoin for use to conduct sales, was that he believed it echat for mining blasting was inevitable that a company like Amazon ( AMZN ) would sit again and let it take the market share away from it. By market share I am thinking by way of Bitcoin market share, not essentially market share in its common each day transactions. Cryptocurrency venture Tezos raised over $200 million in July by selling digital tokens so it may construct out a secure network for good contracts. Overstock has wisely been rapidly embracing the cryptocurrency market, and if it manages to boost its objective of $500 million with its ICO, which is able to launch on November 15 and go echat for mining through December 31, it'll increase more capital than the market cap of the corporate in August of this year. ICOs present a win-win situation for buyers, because it presents ease of access to liquidity by means of exchanges of between members of the community. If you have any issues with regards to where by and how to use recent copper mining news at echat , you can make contact with us at our own website. The constructions to assist ICOs succeed and thrive in the mainstream are nonetheless evolving—like the Argon Group, which longtime Wall Streeter Stan Miroshnik founded to assist oversee ICOs. The result's Onegramcoin, the first cryptocurrency to be backed by gold and stay compliant with Sharia law. Equibit is a blockchain platform for issuing, buying and selling, and managing each public and personal equity. SALT has already secured investments from enterprise capital firms, meaning that the venture has already passed due diligence of these institutional traders. It's true that the worth could go up and down wildly as soon as the initial token offering is complete, but there is a important query as as to whether there may be any basic worth right here. Shopping for ETH isn't notably sophisticated; you can do so on exchanges akin to Kraken or Coinbase Then, throughout an ICO, you usually just have to ship ETH to a designated handle — though different rules might apply, so always learn the terms of every ICO very rigorously earlier than collaborating. October was the most mining neo at e-chat important month for ICOs at ninety, but additionally the month with the weakest success rate at 17 percent, in keeping with TokenData. Nonetheless, the SEC suspended the buying and selling of the corporate's shares on OTC Markets from August 10 to 23. The shares still have not resumed trading at press time. That is just like traditional investments - the value of an illiquid chunk of equity is normally determined by the corporate valuation of the latest funding round. The preliminary Value Coin token worth will likely be determined after the ICO by dividing the overall capital raised by the amount of tokens issued (a hundred million). An necessary distinction to make about UnikoinGold is that not like the various token gross sales launched by inexperienced startups with no present product and vague idea of future revenue, Unikrn is already a frontrunner in its respective industry of eSports. ICO Group Restricted is an funding holding company principally engaged in the information technology (IT) related companies. The number of MNT tokens might be fastened upon the conclusion of the Sale and no additional creation is feasible after the distribution period. Our purpose is to ascertain a mining secondary marketplace for startup fairness by providing a simple but robust way of representing startup shares as Blockchain tokens.

Whereas it is cheap to imagine that that is partly as a result of novelty of the ICO system and the hype\" around it, our expectation is that buyers will hesitate less to acquire shares and invest in primary startups market if they know they can subsequently sell them within the secondary market within foreseeable periods of time. While the SEC hasn't directly dominated on this particular settlement, they did lately say that ICOs must comply with present security registration legal guidelines, but Filecoin (and of course many costly lawyers) think that this settlement is totally SEC-compliant. Within the meantime, regulators around the world are taking a closer have a look at the burgeoning ICO market. Users must acquire SALT tokens so as to take part on the platform and procure loans. An instance of a profitable ICO mission that was profitable to early traders is the good contracts platform referred to as Ethereum which has Ethers as its coin tokens. Participated in fin-tech projects together with the event of blockchain solutions for shoppers verification and alternate of information between banks (KYC). All of this has to be considered beneath the rising recognition of Bitcoin specifically, along with Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, and the blockchain basically.

They paid the owner Rs 1.50 crore at the time. “After the kidnapping of Dhaval Mavani, in the first week of March, Kanani and Desai paid the owner of the property Rs 9.77 crore.

We suspect the money was paid from the proceeds of the crime and have started gathering details of the property deal, to seize the money,” added a CID crime official.\nBhatt flees state with family\nCID sources said that after the kidnapping of Dhaval Mavani on February 1, Bhatt left Surat and spent most of his time in Saurashtra . “Two days after the kidnapping, Bhatt came back, pulled his two children out of school and left Surat with his family. We believe Bhatt on the move with his family to evade arrest,” said a CID crime official.\nAll accused fond of luxury cars\nThe persons accused in the Dhaval Mavani and Piyush Savaliya kidnappings own fleets of luxury cars. “Kanani has two high-end, automatic luxury cars.

This is nothing new, they ban everything that is great about the internet.\nThey have never banned Bitcoin outright. This seems to be a common misconception. They have banned ICOs, exchanges, P2P exchanges (that served as a loophole for the initial ban), and they're currently sitting the fence on mining. Holding and trading are still fair game, but who knows how long that will last.\nEither way, China is no longer the giant it once was in trading volume, and the remaining traders have already learned how to sidestep regulations. An outright ban at this point shouldn't be too crippling in the short term, FUD aside.\nRight you are! China has never banned bitcoin outright. Because that can't be possible for them. So they have taken a phased approach. First they banned ICOs because that was a channel of dirty money flowing in to their economy. I have seen a lot of Chinese scammers active in the ICO market prior to China ban so it was a good news for the entire crypto community.\nNow China is trying to ban the mining operations because a communist country doesn't believe in people empowerment by sidetracking them. They follow heavily centralized policies. Crypto is one way that can't be properly tracked and taxed because of its pseudo anonymous nature. So the Chinese government are not getting the proper revenue from these crypto related market. So they are trying to curb it down.\nBut China is not anymore the superpower of crypto market. If China ban all crypto related activities outright, the market will react for a short span. But I don't think any big impact will be seen for China's exit. Also the Chinese government knows that it is impossible to control the entire crypto market in China. So those who want to use it, they will continue using it. Absolute ban can't be achieved practically.\nYes, the market will not suffer much from the ban of bitcoin in China. But everyone knows that the news from China only to speculate. I think in the near future and this speculator\ncrypto market will win.

Every service is in money transfer, Convenience, Security, Investment and others because all of these things are in Bitcoin. We all know that bitcoin is most popular when it comes in investment. Surely everyone will pick the most popular cryptocurrency so bitcoin becomes number 1.\nI also say it's because the bitcoin market is on top. Since most of the transaction traffic is always made with trading, and much of Bitcoin's spending is really through Bitpay or any other proxy, which is very bad for Bitcoin adoption. There is still plenty of time for new things like Lightning Network before adopting real sellers to start around the world, and there are other factors such as volatility and legalization that prevent cryptocurrency from being used as a medium of exchange.

We gave a buy silver signal and fetched nearly 1200$ per lot profit. Currently prices are cruising at 16.66$ well above our yesterday’s resistance. President Trump cancelled meeting with North Korea’s leader which lead to fall in dollar index and gave a good rise to gold silver. US unemployment claims rises which was another reason for rise in precious metals.\nA good resistance on silver chart stands at 16.92$, If traders break this hurdle more firepower in silver price upto 17.12$- 17.35$ today.\nA good support on silver chart stands at 16.40$, If traders take this base out below our support. Then expect some pressure in silver price upto 16.20$- 16$.\nSilver analysis conclusion: Silver analysis is positive for today, We wont take any position today as US and North Korea’s new development may push market wild. But Buy in dips strategy would be better today. No selling at all as market has turned positive now. Bitcoin analysis\nBitcoin price ( BTC/USD ) trading at 7540$. As suggested on twitter it did not broke our support of 7150$ and bounced back from there smartly. A good support on bitcoin technical chart stands at 7150$, If traders tank this base below our support. Then expect more pressure on bitcoin price upto 7020$- 6900$ today.\nA good hurdle on bitcoin technical chart stands at 7820$, If traders take this hurdle out good recovery in bitcoin price upto 7980$ – 8100$ today.\nBitcoin analysis conclusion: Bitcoin trend is positive for now. So should you buy btcusd now? On current levels answer is no. Wait for dip near our support then buy else wait for resistance and then buy small qty there with 60-80$ stoploss and 100$ target.\nRead Gold forecast here\nMore will update to our signals subscribers.

The cryptocurrency's price stood at $7,545 at mid-day Thursday.\nThe probe \"will help the market,\" said Darryll DiPietro, CEO of Concierge Club .\n\"Once everyone gets put under a microscope, it will be difficult for some of those sh*tty companies launching dicey IPOs,\" he told the E-Commerce Times. \"I'm not for regulation per se -- I believe in a decentralized market -- but I'm for controlling those sh*tty companies. Legitimate projects will benefit from this.\"\nBoth DoJ spokesperson Nicole Navas Oxman and CFTC spokesperson Donna Faulk-White declined to comment for this story. Market Manipulation Murmurs\nBack in 2017, Hackernoon ran a story alleging A single entity dubbed \"Spoofy\" was responsible for dominating the price of bitcoin , according to a story Hackernoon ran last year.\nSpoofy was spoofing and engaging in wash trading, according to the report, and had come up with a scheme it named \"Tether.\"\nThat article sparked considerable comment .\nAn academic paper on price manipulation in the bitcoin system back in 2013, which focused on the Mt. Gox exchange in Japan, drew media attention earlier this year. .\nThe CFTC earlier this month issued guidance for listing virtual currency derivative products. Also, two CFTC officials mentioned the possibility of regulating cryptocurrencies, suggesting cooperation between the CFTC and the SEC.\nThe CFTC has issued an advisory warning of virtual currency pump-and-dump schemes.\n\"We're facing a speculative bubble in which the market hasn't firmly determined the balance of all the upside and the risk associated with cryptocurrencies,\" noted Andreas Scherer, managing partner at Salto Partners .\nCryptocurrencies are \"still a relatively small fraction of the global financial transaction volume,\" he told the E-Commerce Times, and trading platforms have not yet implemented all the common safeguards in place at established stock exchanges. \"So, known manipulation strategies such as spoofing occur unmitigated.\" Cryptocurrency Scams\nTwitter, Google and Facebook have banned cryptocurrency ads due to the high level of scams in the field.\nOf nearly 1,500 cryptocurrency offerings examined, 271 -- or about 20 percent -- were dubious, a Wall Street Journal investigation found. Among the suspicious findings were missing or fake executive teams, the use of plagiarized investor documents, and promises of guaranteed returns.\nBanks generally have downplayed bitcoin, and JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon last year took several shots at the currency, whose share prices fell each time he launched an attack.\nSeveral countries, including China, have banned bitcoin.\n\"The governments and major banks are trying to manipulate the market,\" DiPietro remarked.\nThe banks likely will be targeted by the DoJ because \"its big score will be taking down one of these big companies,\" he said, adding that Facebook reportedly has been working on its own cryptocurrency, and thus has an ulterior motive.

I followed the open innovation minor the study provides, where I can basically choose any subject that I want to learn about, and make something :). For me that subject was blockchain, being in bitcoin for almost 5 years triggered my interest to really learn about the tech behind it.\nWhen I started with the minor I was a little clueless about what exactly blockchain was good for, hearing mixed things about it online for so long. On one side blockhain promises huge potential for all sorts of usecases but when I started looking in to it I realized that there really aren't that many legit usecases and that money and bitcoin is what the discussion should really be about. BITCOIN IS THE KILLER APP.\nTeachers weren't very exited about my findings in the first place and kept pushing that there must be a lot of other things blockchain is good for, it took me a while to gather the right arguments to convince them that they shouldn't be looking a blockchain but instead focus a bit more(if not completely) on bitcoin. Anyway, one idea that stood out and that fitted limited time that I had in the minor was a gambling site, using the block hash as a random source. Not a new concept but I figured it would be a good one to learn about the tech. So I created https://www.blockhash.win/ where players can earn 2x their bet amount by guessing the right last digit of the blockhash that includes their transaction. I've spend many hours developing and I've learned a lot. I would recommend any software engineer or student like me to learn about the tech and build somthing. I learned a lot from the book that I picked up for this minor: Mastering bitcoin by Andreas M. Antonopoulos (I would really recommend the book if your a software guy or just technical!)\nI'm open for feedback and I'm really curious what you guys think of it, let me know :) If you would like to get started developing something bitcoin and don't know where to get started, hit me up! Don't cry about bitcoin's price, learn about the tech and develop something or contribute to an existing project.\n submitted by /u/pocketnl\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.blockhash.win/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T21:18:24.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "75f9b4d51d34175e67ff8b8b1dfda554c05c0c82", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYBgnt8JTZXvQ1WRqyOOTG6u", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp; Finance - 4chan", "title": "BITCOIN IS AN ALIEN MONETARY SYSTEM", "title_full": "/biz/ - BITCOIN IS AN ALIEN MONETARY SYSTEM - Business & Finance - 4chan", "published": "2018-05-25T01:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.045, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "75f9b4d51d34175e67ff8b8b1dfda554c05c0c82", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYBgnt8JTZXvQ1WRqyOOTG6u", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2018-05-25T01:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "BITCOIN IS AN ALIEN MONETARY SYSTEM", "text": "", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T22:42:27.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c48c50900284401beb3a8788eb782d5e2afe6c56", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQ2CFrJUDVVeuqqRERQqfl0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "South Africa Kidnappers demands Ransom in Bitcoin to free teenager", "title_full": "South Africa Kidnappers demands Ransom in Bitcoin to free teenager", "published": "2018-05-25T01:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.232, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c48c50900284401beb3a8788eb782d5e2afe6c56", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQ2CFrJUDVVeuqqRERQqfl0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Marma Kalari", "published": "2018-05-25T01:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "South Africa Kidnappers demands Ransom in Bitcoin to free teenager", "text": "Quote: from: richan on May 24, 2018, 08:51:53 AM A criminal gang in South Africa who kidnapped a teenage boy on Sunday are demanding a ransom in bitcoin crytocurrency of nearly $120,000, police said.\nHow will such news affect critics view of bitcoins?\nIt is a really unfortunate situation but the fact remains that the trail will remain when it comes to bitcoin and i understand why they are not demanding fiat currency because the serial number will be noted down, once the address is provided the authorities can monitor the wallet and once they move to any exchanges they can be caught, even if they try to use mixers when there are authorities that are monitoring the trail the mixers could confiscate the amount.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T21:02:01.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0cfcc4de81765be98794aabe778b7c7cbd53ecdf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjrDl7Vzcp4e0ArESXtgWna.xNeGbiz_QQjPaKt9YP5PD_9yVSTYilAje6bIPtiU5kFJ1zpNSogs4Iecr7DEhc.hM2_MgrwTIyZ9ggkNykFp7PUfDFUtKFycU8zuB7qi0-", "site_full": "www.fool.com", "site": "fool.com", "site_section": "http://www.fool.com/feeds/index.aspx?id=foolwatch&format=rss2", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "Motley Fool Headlines", "title": "Most Cryptocurrencies Are Rallying So Are Bitcoin and Ethereum Down?

First, blockchain is not a bubble, but Bitcoin is a bubble. Bitcoin is just a tiny application of blockchain. At least inside Alibaba, blockchain must be a solution that addresses the privacy and security issues in the digital era.\nThis follows hot on the heels of Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz' similar statement, and is one which has been echoed around the business world in the last year or so, which is (and I'm paraphrasing here):\nQuote: Bitcoin is different from blockchain.

And now it looks as if the government is cracking down more aggressively.\nIllustration: Getty Images The Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation into whether traders have manipulated the price of bitcoin and other digital coins, Bloomberg reported on Thursday , citing four unnamed sources.\nBitcoin traders clearly viewed the news as a negative, with the price falling to $7,400 from $7,558 within an hour of the report's publication. The price has since rebounded back to $7,550.\nThe Justice Department, according to Bloomberg, is working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , which oversees futures and options markets. It's not clear if regulators are also talking to CME Group (CME) or Cboe Global Markets (CBOE), both of which began offering bitcoin futures products last year. CME declined to comment, and Cboe did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice also would not comment, nor would the CFTC, which could \"neither confirm nor deny an investigation.\"\nThe SEC has already been cracking down on creators of digital currencies who regulators say are defrauding investors. And other agencies have been scrutinizing the industry for months. The CFTC has reportedly subpoenaed a top exchange called Bitfinex, though a spokesman for Bitfinex said he did not believe the investigation revealed on Thursday is connected to that exchange.\nBitcoin was designed to avoid regulation, because it's an asset that gets traded globally -- a kind of software that works simultaneously on computers all over the world. And yet, countries have laws against fraud that they can use to prosecute people manipulating markets even when those markets are technically off the grid.\nPeople involved in cryptocurrency trading have been complaining about abuses for months, even as millions of curious new investors began buying into the craze.\n\"All the worst abuses of the stock market pre-Glass Steagall are currently rife within crypto,\" Emma Channing , now the general counsel at Initial Coin Offering advisory firm Satis Group , said in an interview last year. \"If we are going to see institutional finance come in at the pace I would like to see it, we have to clean house before the regulators are going to do it.\"\nAccording to the Bloomberg report, investigators are looking at manipulation schemes that have been used in stocks for years, including spoofing, which involves creating fake buy or sell orders to fool other traders into reacting. Once the price starts moving, the original trader cancels the orders. Other schemes involve self-dealing.\nRegulators have made headway at reducing that kind of manipulation in traditional markets. But while they can put a ring fence around stock trades, enforcing stringent laws at exchanges, digital coins can't be so easily corralled. Bad actors can simply move to unregulated exchanges where they can continue to trade and cause prices for those coins to swing on a global basis. That in turn can impact futures markets, which are supposed to be more heavily regulated.\nSome entrepreneurs are watching warily -- but hopefully -- to see where the investigation leads.\n\"We believe regulatory oversight on the crypto-ecosystem is a long-term positive for all stakeholders involved,\" wrote Rohit Kulkarni , in an email to Barron's . Kulkarni is a managing director in charge of private investment research at Sharespost , a San Francisco company that is building a trading platform for digital coins that have been designed to operate as securities. \"Despite the huge potential of the Blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies and the ICO process has to go through several hurdles before being widely accepted. We view the recent regulatory scrutiny on ICOs and crypto- trading practices to lay out rules to prevent fraud and protect investors as a step in the right direction. However, long-term uncertainty around regulatory environment can become an enemy of innovation and capital formation.\"\nBitcoin's initial slump on news of the investigation did not surprise Thomas Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat and one of the most outspoken bitcoin bulls in the traditional financial world.\n\"These stories have pressured the crypto market, as regulatory action (and related headline risk) reduces risk appetite and also is a further deterrent for near-term inflows from new investors,\" he wrote in a note to clients. \"However, these actions signal that adult supervision is coming to crypto and adding such oversight incrementally improves the structural integrity and legitimacy for crypto-currency investor. In other words, in order for institutional investors to be more actively engaged in crypto markets, such adult supervision is a necessary precondition.\"\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/avibarrons", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe?mod=article_inline"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "avi salzman", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cme group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe global markets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T21:52:05.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3d60c60f3bfcbb82a3bad04d866f2ccffdca7748", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1o8kxCpM_vIeX4_5YRDdayR", "site_full": "nigeria.shafaqna.com", "site": "shafaqna.com", "site_section": "http://nigeria.shafaqna.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nigeria News (News Reader) |", "title": "Bitcoin Gold Hacked for $18 Million", "title_full": "Bitcoin Gold Hacked for $18 Million", "published": "2018-05-25T01:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5727, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3d60c60f3bfcbb82a3bad04d866f2ccffdca7748", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1o8kxCpM_vIeX4_5YRDdayR", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-25T01:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Gold Hacked for $18 Million", "text": "26 minutes ago Bitcoin Gold Hacked for $18 Million It appears Bitcoin Gold (BTG) has been double spend attacked over and over again, totalling something in the neighborhood of $18 million at current prices.

You can read more on how to claim your BTCP here .\nBITCOIN PRIVATE\nSimilar to Bitcoin, BTCP will support peer-to-peer transactions without an intermediary. These transactions will be verified by network nodes through the use of cryptography and recorded in a public ledger. Unlike Bitcoin, BTCP supports an increased block size and block time for faster transactions with lower fees. Furthermore, transactions can be performed on a private (z) ledger. When sending from one private address to another, the sender, recipient, and amount are all private.\nYou can read our whitepaper here .\nThe Importance of Bitcoin Private\nRecently, it has become clear that the crypto communitys privacy is at risk. Everytime one makes a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain in perpetuity for anyone to see. We have seen the BitFury Group use this information to de-anonymize over 15% of the entire Bitcoin network, along with many other examples. This led us to create Bitcoin Private (BTCP) - a fork-merge of the ZCL & BTC blockchains and introduction of the zk-SNARKS feature to Bitcoin.\nThe hard fork will allow users to safely transfer their digital currency without any threat to their privacy, known as shielded transactions, on the Bitcoin Private blockchain. For example, transactions would still take place on this Bitcoin based blockchain, except without being recorded on the public ledger -- leaving absolutely no trail of your transaction details to anyone other than the sender and recipient. This has never been done before with any Bitcoin hard fork. Ultimately, privacy was once a cornerstone of Bitcoin but can no longer be guaranteed today.\nAside from the shielded transactions, Bitcoin Private is also making transactions faster and more efficient by doubling the Bitcoin block size from 1MB to 2MB and decreasing the block time from 10 min to 2.5 min.\nThe Future of BTCP\nWe continue to post our most recent updates to our Medium . We have also released a highly ambitious roadmap which you can find here\nMoving forward, the Bitcoin Private team will continue securing appropriate partnerships to bolster the Bitcoin Private initiative. You should expect announcements around these partnerships to continue throughout 2018 as we seek to build a sustainable technology platform.\nWe anticipate our development team to continue growing in headcount and skill set, which allows us to build out our ambitious post-fork technology roadmap. The successful execution of our roadmap will allow Bitcoin Private to deliver superior value to other Bitcoin hard forks, especially around privacy and transaction speeds. Ultimately, we believe in a cryptocurrency world where everyone can trust their privacy will be respected.\nBTCP Specifications\nCirculating coin supply: http://explorer.btcprivate.org/status\nTotal coin supply: 21 million\nBlock reward: 1.5625 BTCP\nBlock time: 2.5 min\nBlock size: 2 MB\nHalving schedule: 210,000 blocks\nPrivacy protocol: zk-SNARKs\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nWho is on the BTCP Contribution Team?\nSee our team here .\nWas there a premine or a founder's reward?\nNo.\nBTCP Mining Pools:\nSee https://btcprivate.org/pools.html\nHow do I get involved in BTCP?\nPlease reach out to us on Reddit , Twitter , Discord , or Telegram .\nHow do I claim my BTCP from ZCL and/or BTC?\nSee this reddit post .\nCan I contribute to the team?\nYes you can!

BTG forums seem to have been tracking the hack, going as far back as last week, monitoring the controversial coin's hashrate, ultimately determining a 51% attack was under way.\nAlso read: Roger Ver and Ryan X. Charles Reveal the Future of Cash\nBitcoin Gold Gets $18 Million Haircut \"An unknown party with access to very large amounts of hashpower is trying to use '51% attacks,'\" Bitcoin Gold forum poster Mental Nomad announced a week ago, \"to perform 'double spend' attacks to steal money from Exchanges. We have been advising all exchanges to increase confirmations and carefully review large deposits.\"\nA founding economic principle of bitcoin was its alleviation of the double spend problem. It was a main stumbling block in the historical race to create a viable cryptographic monetary form – foiling a great many coders along the way. Satoshi Nakamoto solved it through a decentralized, distributed ledger confirmation process (blockchain). Going as far back as its genesis block from early 2009, users can be confident transactions aren't rebroadcast. Like clockwork, 6 times an hour, blocks are added – copied to nodes within the universal network.\nThe offending wallet, according to the BTG team. One way to achieve double spending is known as a 51% attack. It's accomplished by bogarting the network's computing power. With a majority, bad actors can get between the Nakamoto solution and transaction confirmations. By stymieing block completion in the usual manner, all sorts of mischief can arise: blockchain mining rewards redirected, users' transactions reversed, etc. Not too long after, a double spending attack can commence, acting as the fiat equivalent to counterfeiting. Needless to type, any crypto suffering from such a problem is certain to immediately lose user confidence.\nSuch attacks are interesting for another reason, as Mental Nomad is careful to point out. \"There is no risk to typical users or to existing funds being held. The only parties at risk are those currently accepting large payments directly from the attacker. Exchanges are the primary targets,\" he assured last week. \"It appears that actions on the part of the exchanges have deterred the attacker, for now.\" And hitting exchanges tends to elicit little sympathy, at least initially, due to users being insulated. Exchanges are particularly vulnerable because they generally covet large deposits, which only compounds the problem in cases like these.\nGTNjvCGssb2rbLnDV1xxsHmunQdvXnY2Ft Over period of days, batches of BTG were deposited into exchanges supporting the forked coin, only to be sent back to the depositor's wallet. The lag between such a transaction and some exchanges' discovery is sufficient enough to nab tokens, doubling the filthy lucre. Exchanges trading bitcoin gold have responded by upping transaction confirmation filters, but evidently to no avail as the attacker gains ever-more BTG network control.\nBitcoin Gold team members seem to have communicated with some exchanges. \"Requiring more confirmations greatly increases safety,\" the forum details. \"Until now, some Exchanges were operating with less than five confirmations required. We have been urging higher limits to prevent such an attack, and urging manual review of large deposits of BTG before clearing the funds for trading.\" Indeed, according to BTG, \"One of the targeted Exchanges reported that they strongly believe this attacker attempted to hit them with a double-spend of BTC in the past. In their words, 'we are 100% sure that it is the same person, we found many associations between the accounts.'\"\nThe traditional way BTC has been able to thwart double spend attacks. Evidence put forward by the BTG team points to address GTNjvCGssb2rbLnDV1xxsHmunQdvXnY2Ft as the attacker's wallet; mined coins, according to the forum post reside at GXXjRkdquAkyHeJ6ReW3v4FY3QbgPfugTx. More than 388,201.92404001 BTG were funneled through the wallet, totalling more than $18 million according to Bitcoin Gold Explorer . That a top thirty crypto by market cap can be so easily troubled is a giant of enough problem, but it could also take exchanges down in the process – something the ecosystem is very sensitive to since Mt. Gox. And though, for now, BTG is confident enough to suggest users are not at risk, history shows that can quickly be the case as an exchange freezes withdrawals in an effort to stop hemorrhaging.\nBitcoin Gold has been beset by controversies since its birth fork late last year, including a recent dust-up between BCH advocate Craig Wright and BTG founder Jack Liao . To be fair, however, it is not the only blockchain to suffer a 51% attack. Mere days ago, recently Chinese government highly rated coin verge (XVG) was made to heel, again. These pages reported XVG, \"On the morning of May 22, Suprvona, one of the largest altcoin mining pools, informed its 19,000 Twitter followers that verge was suffering yet another 51% attack, causing all blocks to be rejected.\"\nDo you think the BTG hack spells doom for the coin?

Now, an Argentinian Bank is continuing the celebration after announcing on May 22, 2018, that its customers can use the pioneer cryptocurrency as a cross-border payment option.\nPartnership with Bitex Argentina's Banco Masventas ( BMV ) has developed a similar remittance mechanism as Ripple, but will instead use bitcoin rather than XRP . Local exchange Bitex will also be called upon to aid in the development. According to BMV's announcement , interested parties will be able to make payments to over 50 countries within 24 hours and will only incur a three percent fee on the payment.\nMore important, certainly to bitcoin maximalists, is the fact that the bank has chosen bitcoin over the expected Ripple network. This decision is not without its slight disadvantages, however. Primarily, bitcoin transfers are much slower than those along Ripple's blockchain, which is outlined in the 24-hour timeline. Comparatively, Ripple offers settlements within two minutes within its American and Mexican payment corridor.\nIn any case, the possibilities of a bank deciding to partner with a cryptocurrency exchange seem to unveil new opportunities in the sector. In the case of the BMV and Bitmex collaboration, clients can now conveniently transfer and exchange any fiat currency in any of the fifty countries. Further to this point, such an innovation, regardless of the blockchain network used, far outpaces any legacy remittance networks.\nArgentina Emerging as Crypto Hub in Latin America BMV's move, while a positive global step for crypto, also points to Argentina's growing identity as a hub for crypto innovation. The CEO of Buda , a Chilean cryptocurrency exchange, Guillermo Torrealba explained how coming to Argentina was a breath of fresh air:\n\"There are even banks [in Argentina] that have executives that are exclusively dedicated to cryptocurrency companies.\"\nFor context, in March 2018, Chilean banks issued a notice to cryptocurrency businesses about the indefinite closure of banking services to companies in that sector. Torrealba is apprehensive about the harsh decision and considers the banks to have \"killed the industry\" in Chile.\nEchoing the thoughts of Torrealba, was \"Bitcoin Day\" organizer Adriel Araujo. He believes that Argentina is one of the most progressive blockchain-friendly nations, with many top-notch projects being developed.\nLiquid Democracy and OpenVino Proving these pro-blockchain sentiments, are Santiago Siri, the founder of Democracy Earth , and Mike T. Barrow of the OpenVino Project .\nDemocracy Earth, which was founded in 2015, was launched with the purpose of building governance tools to align with the internet's early vision – to attain decentralization, transparency, and incorruptibility.\nTo achieve this, Siri utilizes the blockchain in three areas: Decentralization of data, Voting Systems, and Liquid Democracy.\nSiri is a longtime blockchain proponent and is active on Twitter in voicing his centralization and data ownership concerns. In his latest tweets, Siri fired shots on Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, who was under trial for alleged data misuse.\n– who is yout biggest competitor?\n– senator we have a lot of competitors.. apple, amazon..\n– do you provide the same service than them? can i replace facebook like my ford for a chevy?\n– we have sev..\n– don't you think you have a monopoly?\neveryone laughs. senator graham.\n— Santi 🌿 🇦🇷 (@santisiri) April 10, 2018\nExpressing his thoughts on the concept of \"liquid democracy,\" Siri believes that \"the basic concept of liquid democracy is that voters can express their wishes on an issue directly or delegate their vote to someone else they think is better-placed to decide on their behalf.\" Ultimately, he hopes that the project allows for a more dynamic and granular voting process in which voters can unpack their vote and participate in the democratic process more precisely.\nBTCManager also spoke with Barrow regarding his open-source project to cryptographically commodify bottles of wine. Each year, roughly around May 6, the Open Vino project will launch an ICO in which the tokenized versions of each real bottle of wine will be sold at a discounted price. The number of tokens for sale is equivalent to the number of bottles produced, allowing the market to define the fair price for the wines, reflecting both quality and demand.\nBarrow explained that the \"2018 Harvest arrived on April 2, 3, and 4, of which will determine how many bottles can be made with this crop.\" These tokens will be titled \"MTB18,\" but next year's harvest will be \"MTB19\" and so on. This harvest yielded approximately 12,670 liters of MTB 2018, which is the equivalent of 348 bottles of 750ml. For those interested, the year's batch was co-fermented with Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, and Petit Verdot.\n( Source : costaflores.com )\nThe wine then follows standard processes such as barrelling and aging. After which point, Barrow explains, the token can be exchanged in a number of different ways:\n\"The buyer can choose to wait up to ten years to exchange the token for a bottle and thus speculate even further with the value of the token before exchanging it for a bottle. After ten years, though, I'm drinking whatever is left over, or auctioning it off. Otherwise, I have to pay for cold-storage for an indefinite amount of time, and some people will lose/forget their tokens.\"\nMore importantly, and from a regulatory perspective, this token will not need to be registered as a security. Barrow told BTCManager that the sales from the ICO were in fact invoiced as wine sales:\n\"We are a registered Argentine corporation. The token, as far as regulators are concerned, is merely a voucher that can be redeemed at a later date to pick up the purchased wine. We will actually be selling the token with the sales tax that is required for wines, just to ensure that we are tax compliant. This way, we avoid all the issues related to declaring revenue for token sales, etc.\"\n(Source: wiki.costaflores )\nThe idea behind such a sale, as well as allowing speculation on something like a bottle of wine, is to determine a fair-market price for the bottle.\nConcluding, Argentina is undoubtedly taking a firm stand in the crypto community. From projects like Democracy Earth, the Open Vino Project, the Open Science Network , OpenZeppelin , RSK , and Kleros , the technical and visionary prowess is palpable. For interested parties in Buenos Aires, there will also be an Ethereum hackathon with workshops beginning on May 25 and ending on May 27, 2018.\nSpecial thanks to Mike T. Barrow for providing insight on the blockchain space in Argentina.

Market manipulation has been an increasingly popular topic in crypto world – particularly since prices started their historic surge.\nLast summer, the SEC established the legal precedent that all digital tokens should be treated like legitimate securities and required them to be registered with the agency. Meanwhile, the CFTC, which is also working with the DOJ, declared bitcoin a commodity back in 2015, and is responsible for regulating bitcoin futures.\nInvestigators will likely look to bring charges against traders who engaged in spoofing – flooding the market with fake orders to push a price up or down depending on one’s position. Another illicit tactic that the DOJ is looking into is called wash trading, which is also prevalent in equity and futures markets. Wash traders trade with themselves to create the illusion of volume in an otherwise illiquid market.\nThe probe is reportedly focusing on bitcoin and ether, according to Bloomberg’s sources.\nThe investigation, which the people said is in its early stages, is the US’s latest effort to crack down on an industry that was initially embraced by those who were distrustful of banks and government control over monetary policy.\nBut Bitcoin’s meteoric rise – it surged to almost $20,000 in 2017 after starting the year below $1,000 – has been a lure for mom-and-pop…", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-05-24/doj-launches-criminal-probe-bitcoin-market-manipulation", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-24/bitcoin-manipulation-is-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "doj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T01:13:54.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "13fba7b53394c7149b7e0dd85acfd248803cac53", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgvt5m5Ip7pS_3ILZlpR2huXBIDFPC70iKHheJqr7FuH4ny72AOHjijGuoeONYjDyKoNDWxXQtYDjWw9K1NB82mnGR3LIpBRETqJvRUyMxVrg_etXTl0hkcA--", "site_full": "internetdo.com", "site": "internetdo.com", "site_section": "http://internetdo.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Internet Do", "title": "Bitcoin Today: Prices Continue Skid Toward $7,000 as DOJ Launches Investigation", "title_full": "Bitcoin Today: Prices Continue Skid Toward $7,000 as DOJ Launches Investigation", "published": "2018-05-25T01:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "13fba7b53394c7149b7e0dd85acfd248803cac53", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgvt5m5Ip7pS_3ILZlpR2huXBIDFPC70iKHheJqr7FuH4ny72AOHjijGuoeONYjDyKoNDWxXQtYDjWw9K1NB82mnGR3LIpBRETqJvRUyMxVrg_etXTl0hkcA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-25T01:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Today: Prices Continue Skid Toward $7,000 as DOJ Launches Investigation", "text": "Bitcoin faced the prospect of falling to $7,000 Thursday as prices continued this week’s downward momentum.

The result is an incredibly misleading ad that says Bitcoin fans are for drug deals and human trafficking.\nFellow Democrats Dave Min and Brian Forde clashed over accepting cryptocurrencies as donations while running for California’s 45 th Congressional race.\nForde is promoted by the media as amongst the earliest politicians to start accepting cryptocurrencies as donations. With that said, Bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies, have made their way into mainstream politics over the last couple of years. Back in September 2017, Austin Petersen, a Senate candidate in Missouri also began accepting Bitcoin for campaign contributions.\nCryptocurrency and politics is a relatively new phenomenon. Winston Edmonson, a four-time mayoral candidate in the Texas city of Lewisville, proposed the issuance of a municipal cryptocurrency as means of funding the local police force without having to raise taxes. Then there was firebrand Ron Paul putting forward a bill to allow competing currencies.\nAs reported by multiple outlets, Brian Forde has stated that his campaign has managed to raise upwards of $130,000 in different cryptocurrencies. This clearly shows that Forde is currently a favorite among the world of crypto enthusiasts. Another proof for that is that he’s managed to get more Bitcoin contributions than all of the previous candidates for Congress combined, according to Bloomberg.\nNaturally, this fires up the spark of competition. A rival Democratic candidate of Forde – Dave Min, who’s also a former SEC attorney, launched a TV ad which contained the following line about…", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-politics-fellow-democrats-clash-accepting-cryptocurrency-donations/", "http://bitcoinist.com/missouri-senate-candidate-accepting-bitcoin-campaign-contributions/", "http://bitcoinist.com/republican-ron-paul-on-bitcoin/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-08/bitcoin-s-candidate-for-congress", "https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/05/22/california-congressional-candidate-goes-after-fellow-democrat-with-anti-bitcoin-attack-ad/", "http://bitcoinist.com/texas-mayoral-candidate-choosing-cryptocurrency-over-taxes/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "georgi georgiev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin petersen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian forde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "winston edmonson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave min", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoinist.com two democratic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congressional", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "californi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lewisville", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T08:42:43.052+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "795a6717577bb59bdb4e85fad39919f37b522c5f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TRShG6rZQ7ckFOOGTAn36Erjyc7xqyjdvlJTq464MnLs11rmmoP23ChR4dS0rmgyir512a8.RzV6Vd_I2qTLSsLURa2TkxipzHlkkA.BWzYr25AsWpw5UG", "site_full": "abc11.com", "site": "abc11.com", "site_section": "http://abc11.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "abc11.com RSS Feed", "title": "Triangle owners of lost pets targeted in Bitcoin scam", "title_full": "Triangle owners of lost pets targeted in Bitcoin scam", "published": "2018-05-25T01:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.abclocal.go.com/content/wtvd/images/cms/automation/vod/3517963_1280x720.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 28361, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "795a6717577bb59bdb4e85fad39919f37b522c5f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TRShG6rZQ7ckFOOGTAn36Erjyc7xqyjdvlJTq464MnLs11rmmoP23ChR4dS0rmgyir512a8.RzV6Vd_I2qTLSsLURa2TkxipzHlkkA.BWzYr25AsWpw5UG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-25T01:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Triangle owners of lost pets targeted in Bitcoin scam", "text": "Triangle owners of lost pets targeted in Bitcoin scam SHARE: <iframe width=\"476\" height=\"267\" src=\"http://abc11.com/video/embed/?pid=3517964\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\nWatch out for Bitcoin scams involving lost pets. (WTVD) SHARE 06:00PM FUQUAY-VARINA (WTVD) -- A Fuquay-Varina man says he was targeted by a scammer after posting his phone number on a site about his missing dogs.\"My Rottweiler is a 5-year old service dog. I am a military veteran with PTSD. And my other dog was my grandfather's before he passed away,\" said Raymond Brunet, who served in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division.Now, back in the Triangle, Brunet's two dogs recently escaped.To spread the word, he posted online and included his contact information.\"Your animals are just like your kids. You love them. You'll do anything you can to get them back,\" Brunet said.A day later, he received a threatening text message demanding $2,000 worth of Bitcoin for the safe return of his pet. The sender included a Bitcoin account address and said the phone number was a throwaway that could not be traced. They said that Brunet had 10 days to come up with the money, or they would kill the pet.One big problem with the scam: Brunet had already found both his dogs.\"Whoever is doing that is basically trash. There's a lot of people that are gullible and will fall for this scam, unfortunately,\" Brunet said.Brunet responded directly to the scammer, who did not contact him again. He also posted about the scam attempt on Facebook to warn others.Off-camera, a Granville County woman said she received a similar threat after posting about her missing pets, which she reported to the Granville County Sheriff's Office.If you have any information on this scam, call police.

In fact, all of the 25 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap (excluding Tether, which is based on the U.S. dollar) are down today.\nHere’s a look at the latest cryptocurrency prices and what might be behind this massive drop.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nToday’s cryptocurrency prices\nHere’s a look at the 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and how much each has changed over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is down by more than 7% over the last 24 hours, and is actually the best-performing of the 10 largest cryptocurrencies. Six of the top 10 are down by double digits, and only three of the top 100 cryptocurrencies are positive on Wednesday. In short, this is about as broad of a sell-off as you can get.\nCryptocurrency Name (Code)\n$1.48\n(14.5%)\nData source: www.investing.com. Prices and daily changes as of May 23, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. EDT, and prices are rounded to the nearest cent where appropriate.\nWhy are cryptocurrencies plunging?\nThere are a few possible negative catalysts. For example, some of the hype surrounding the well-publicized “Blockchain Week” in New York City may have bolstered prices, and now that it’s over, we could be seeing lower investor interest.\nPerhaps the biggest catalyst driving down cryptocurrency prices is regulatory fears.\nFears of increased global regulation have been the culprit in several big cryptocurrency sell-offs this year. The South Korean cryptocurrency saga in particular caused quite a bit of volatility.\nThis time, it’s closer to home. On Monday, regulators in the U.S. and Canada announced “Operation Crypto-Sweep,” which is being led by the North American Securities Administrators Association and has more than 40 states and provinces participating.\nTo be clear, the crackdown is focused on cryptocurrency investment schemes, particularly initial coin offerings, or ICOs. It is not targeting major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC-USD) or legitimate businesses such as cryptocurrency exchanges. Even so, it seems to have the market on edge.\nThis comes on the heels of increased cryptocurrency scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), whose chairman has issued strongly worded warnings to cryptocurrency and ICO investors in recent months.\nA good thing?\nAs I’ve written before, cryptocurrency regulation isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Rather, it is the uncertainty surrounding regulation that drives the market crazy.\nRegulation could be a good thing over the long term for cryptocurrencies. A regulated market would likely attract more institutional investors, and I don’t think any legitimate cryptocurrency believer thinks that getting rid of scams is a bad thing for the industry. And, the implementation of global cryptocurrency regulation could help provide much-needed stability to the market, which could solve one of the biggest obstacles standing in the way of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption — volatility.\nIn the meantime, however, it remains to be seen whether the current sell-off is nearing its end or if investor jitters will continue to send cryptocurrencies downward.

Iskra explained that the victims of the attack were not the end-users, instead the hacker targeted exchanges.\n“An unknown party with access to very large amounts of hashpower is trying to use “51% attacks” to perform “double spend” attacks to steal money from Exchanges . We have been advising all exchanges to increase confirmations and carefully review large deposits.” wrote Edward Iskra, Director of Communications.\n“There is no risk to typical users or to existing funds being held. The only parties at risk are those currently accepting large payments directly from the attacker. Exchanges are the primary targets.”\nThe technique allowed the attacker to control the blockchain and modify transactions making possible to spend the same amount of money two times.\nThe Bitcoin Gold team explained that due to the high cost of such kind of attack, the only way to make profits was to target exchanges to automatically withdraw a large amount of money.\nThe attacker monetized its effort by transferring large amounts of BTG coins at exchanges and at the same time sending the same amounts to his wallet.\n“The cost of mounting an ongoing attack is high. Because the cost is high, the attacker can only profit if they can quickly get something of high value from a fake deposit,” states Bitcoin Gold team. “A party like an Exchange may accept large deposits automatically, allow the user to trade into a different coin quickly, and then withdraw automatically. This is why they are targeting Exchanges.”\nWith this attack scheme, the hacker was able to withdraw funds before being discovered.\nIn the attempt of mitigating the attacks, exchanges have raised the threshold needed to confirm a transaction.\n“Requiring more confirmations greatly increases safety. Until now, some Exchanges were operating with less than five confirmations required. We have been urging higher limits to prevent such an attack, and urging manual review of large deposits of BTG before clearing the funds for trading.” continues the advisory published by Bitcoin Gold.\n“It appears that actions on the part of the exchanges have deterred the attacker, for now.”\nThe Bitcoin Gold team was able to follow the stolen funds from exchanges to the BTG address GTNjvCGssb2rbLnDV1xxsHmunQdvXnY2Ft , the hacker transferred more than 388,000 BTG coins (roughly $18 million).\nEven if users are not affected, the attacks could have severe consequences on the exchanges that could end in bankrupt.\nAccording to one of the exchanges involved in the attacks, the mysterious attacker is the same actor that attempted a double-spend attack on the original Bitcoin network in the past.\n“One of the targeted Exchanges reported that they strongly believe this attacker attempted to hit them with a double-spend of BTC in the past. In their words, “we are 100% sure that it is the same person, we found many associations between the accounts.” concluded Iskra.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Illegal business tactics that include the Department of Justice investigates identity theft and clothing trade, and federal prosecutors working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in the investigation, according to \"four people in the know. \" create false purchase orders to attract other merchants (usually robots) to enter, with the intention of manipulating the market price to obtain a profit by actually selling it.

Will US’ big crypto cleanup be final nail in coffin for bitcoin? May 24, 2018\nBy Lionel Laurent Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies make up just a tiny slice of the global economy. But that doesn’t mean regulators can ignore the wave of scams, fraud and market manipulation designed to snare gullible punters.\nWith U.S. law enforcers now probing trading practices such as “spoofing” – illegal and aggressive order cancellations designed to move markets – this looks very much like the beginning of a sustained crypto cleanup. Drawing investors back in, even with the promise of a less Wild West-style market, will take longer than cheerleaders expect.\nProbing price manipulation in crypto market was a natural next step for the authorities., which have ramped up scrutiny of everything from new token sales to crypto-hedge funds in recent months. There’s plenty of data evidence to dig into, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and SEC have demanded information from a lot of companies.\nThere are the “pump-and-dump” chat-rooms where traders take advantage of thinly traded digital currencies. Elsewhere, exchanges have been accused of being open to spoofing or so-called “wash” trading, where one entity buys and sells the same order. The popular Coinbase exchange faces allegations from clients of insider trading.\nOf course, it’s natural to question the authorities’ track record of putting spoofers and manipulators behind bars, even those working in traditional financial markets. It’s a fairly recent phenomenon. The practice of spoofing was only made illegal in the U.S. in 2010, and the first conviction was in 2015. In January, the CFTC announced the creation of a new Spoofing Task Force to “root out” the practice. So there’s still no established model for building a successful anti-spoofing case – for example, what a jury would deem to be a suspicious level of order cancellations.\nBut the drive by law enforcers to dig into the crypto world and demand more transparency is here to stay. This can only dent the aura, and price, of Bitcoin. We don’t know the true “worth” of a crypto-currency – although there are many wacky price targets – but there’s evidence that the price is closely linked to the ecosystem where it is traded. One recent research paper found that a near-tenfold rise in Bitcoin’s price in 2013 was driven primarily by two bots engaging in suspicious activity in a thin market.\nThe market today is very different, with more traders, more coins and more exchanges, but greater transparency is bound to have an impact. Bitcoin fell to its lowest price in more than a month after Bloomberg’s report on the U.S. criminal probe.\nWhat happens next? Crypto-evangelists will no doubt argue that a better maintained market is a healthy development, and one that will pave the way for the flood of institutional Wall Street money that always seems to be right around the corner. Plenty of market participants have been asking for more transparency. New crypto exchange Legolas, for instance, has criticized the incumbents as being opaque and vulnerable to manipulation.\nStill, the idea that big risk-averse institutional investors will jump in just as authorities start to trawl the depths of this murky market seems fanciful. Speculation has been Bitcoin’s chief appeal, of course, but the necessary cleanup operation will drag on its price for some time to come.\n(This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of economictimes.com, Bloomberg LP and its owners)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lionel laurent bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T01:12:34.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d2ae39f15a446d3e50403e45ce1de9c3c9d199ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSNRsYDMo0CSJ7BBE686qM8UBLb_7.92ViKnjEar54netfoVVVVTxjuwTPWmDzPEGJWr9q6.vIssF89NFl6r75wm9eKSAGf0HOrfp1oSD7w68Y8wtTmjQ._6Wi2StXtD1a0Ly_tq7G5kQydp4fBMiwC", "site_full": "cryptozap.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://cryptozap.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Letter to those who “like blockchain and not bitcoin” – CaptainAltcoin (blog) – CryptoZap", "title": "Letter to those who “like blockchain and not bitcoin” – CaptainAltcoin (blog)", "title_full": "Letter to those who “like blockchain and not bitcoin” – CaptainAltcoin (blog)", "published": "2018-05-25T00:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d2ae39f15a446d3e50403e45ce1de9c3c9d199ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSNRsYDMo0CSJ7BBE686qM8UBLb_7.92ViKnjEar54netfoVVVVTxjuwTPWmDzPEGJWr9q6.vIssF89NFl6r75wm9eKSAGf0HOrfp1oSD7w68Y8wtTmjQ._6Wi2StXtD1a0Ly_tq7G5kQydp4fBMiwC", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Fork The Banks", "published": "2018-05-25T00:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Letter to those who “like blockchain and not bitcoin” – CaptainAltcoin (blog)", "text": "Letter to those who “like blockchain and not bitcoin” – CaptainAltcoin (blog) https://ift.tt/2xaTy3c ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T00:40:10.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2d9a83d1371e41c8f46911ebb0d3b1a567f92acd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8EKhX1l4Jf.EXXzOCEr_pMFL0vdcz7cc4FRp3n84p0CtWnf3oQyaAeeGjIDJMtO1uNPYxVFoeP9w--", "site_full": "www.forocoches.com", "site": "forocoches.com", "site_section": "https://www.forocoches.com/foro/forumdisplay.php?f=91", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "Planes amigo y otros referidos - ForoCoches", "title": "[CMF] Cómo empezar minando Bitcoins y sacar beneficios en Cryptominingfarm +serio - Página 5", "title_full": "[CMF] Cómo empezar minando Bitcoins y sacar beneficios en Cryptominingfarm +serio - Página 5 - ForoCoches", "published": "2018-05-25T00:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2297, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2d9a83d1371e41c8f46911ebb0d3b1a567f92acd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8EKhX1l4Jf.EXXzOCEr_pMFL0vdcz7cc4FRp3n84p0CtWnf3oQyaAeeGjIDJMtO1uNPYxVFoeP9w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sotavent00", "published": "2018-05-25T00:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "[CMF] Cómo empezar minando Bitcoins y sacar beneficios en Cryptominingfarm +serio - Página 5", "text": "up", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T01:13:23.038+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4736b3e300e90e377254acfcd6aaf634111eb3ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQVnuM8.NLpOjSxvKSfnMQ4kXEk6Me7AVtb5WaUvBdMJ2leZBYwip2efIMBYVIGupMv8F.6.BqzBuEH1r1sHDTDaHPf04eTm_XkzGX1LxMNrTGaSUBpemqXiKqX4.f3AdqJb8gndD1ylQ--", "site_full": "www.cnbc.com", "site": "cnbc.com", "site_section": "http://www.cnbc.com/id/100003114/device/rss/rss.html", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Top News &amp;

Thirty-five enforcement actions are pending or completed.\n\"These actions signal that 'adult supervision' is coming to crypto and adding such oversight incrementally improves the structural integrity and legitimacy for the crypto-currency investor,\" Fundstrat's Tom Lee said in a Thursday report. Lee maintained his midyear price target of $20,000 on bitcoin and a year-end forecast of $25,000.\nThat said, it may take longer for the cryptocurrency market to recover from the regulatory uncertainty that has contributed to bitcoin's more than 50 percent plunge at the start of this year.\nLee had predicted bitcoin would get a boost last week from Consensus and other cryptocurrency conferences during New York City's \"Blockchain Week.\"\nBut the regulatory overhang persisted. On the Friday heading into the week of conferences, bitcoin fell to its lowest since April 20, a three-week low, after news prosecutors raided the largest cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea.\n\"The crypto market is still in its infancy — we are in the stone ages comparatively — and very sensitive to news and manipulation,\" said Matthew Roszak, co-founder of blockchain company Bloq and chairman of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.\n\"As the market matures with better infrastructure (exchanges, futures, etc.) along with increased participation from global institutional investors,\" he said, \"the market will get past these growing pains.\"\nWATCH: DOJ opens bitcoin manipulation probe show chapters DOJ opens bitcoin manipulation probe 8:39 PM ET Thu, 24 May 2018 | 03:41", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian kelly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bkcm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T00:19:30.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f6ef8538768dcc6155f9039140fb51fc23d15ea1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQVnuM8.NLpOtKVKI48LhUKUf75pecEUEXhxuwT1r8MU2AQqBse3kODEEjpJJwnJO3N8L8AnnriB0FnLzJTUT_Vcr6qSMaBl.8EQamnivQMeTqEoFtcPe1.tM6sQEm.bRQ-", "site_full": "www.cnbc.com", "site": "cnbc.com", "site_section": "http://www.cnbc.com/id/100004038/device/rss/rss.html", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Latest Video", "title": "Crypto insider believes regulation is bullish for bitcoin", "title_full": "Crypto insider believes regulation is bullish for bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-25T00:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/05/24/105230520-5ED3-CB-CRYPTO-INSIDER-052418.600x400.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 767, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 31, "comments": 0, "shares": 31}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f6ef8538768dcc6155f9039140fb51fc23d15ea1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQVnuM8.NLpOtKVKI48LhUKUf75pecEUEXhxuwT1r8MU2AQqBse3kODEEjpJJwnJO3N8L8AnnriB0FnLzJTUT_Vcr6qSMaBl.8EQamnivQMeTqEoFtcPe1.tM6sQEm.bRQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-25T00:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "Crypto insider believes regulation is bullish for bitcoin", "text": "Crypto insider believes regulation is bullish for bitcoin 5:38 PM ET Thu, 24 May 2018 CNBC's Seema Mody on the crypto crackdown.

Piyasamızdaki Yeri / SessizKalpler\nMerhaba arkadaşlar ben SessizKalpler bu konu çerçevesinde gündemi düzenli olarak meşgul eden insanların ilgisini oldukça çekmeye başaran kafa yakan bir unsur olan Bitcoin kavramı hakkında konuşarak bu konuda bilgi sahibi olmanızı ve daha iyi sindirmenizi sağlayacağım. O zaman lafı fazla uzatmadan konumuza girişimizi yapalım ilk olarak Bitcoin en kısa tanımı ile nedir? Arkadaşlar Bitcoin en kısa tanımı ile Dijital Para birimidir, 2009 yılında hayatımıza girmiştir ฿ şeklinde bir sembolü ve BTC şeklinde bir kısaltımı bulunmaktadır. Dijital para birimi demişken Dijital yârine Teknolojik şeklinde de kullanabiliriz. İkisi aynı kapıya yol açmaktadır. Gelelim bu şaheserin babası kimdir? Satoshi Nakamoto ismini okuduğunuz zaman aklınıza direk Japon yada Çin bir vatandaş olduğu gelebilir olması da zannımca muhtemeldir ancak işin ilginç yanı bu adam hakkında doğru dürüst elle tutulabilir hiçbir bilgi gerek Reel gerekse Sanal alemde bulunmamaktadır. Yani adama başlı başlıca hayalet. Peki Piyasaya bu Para Teknolojisini nasıl sürdü sorusunun kafanızda çınladığına eminim şu şekilde; Nakamoto 2009 yılının kasım ayında bir gece ansızın o zamanlarda Kriptografik içeriklerin yani Şifrelenmiş bileşenlerin tanıtıldığı bir dönemde Mail yolunu kullanarak gerekli birimlere Protokolü yayınlamıştır. Yaptığı bu şaheser Protokol sayesi de ise pekte kısa bir süre olmasa da yavaştan sinsice tüm piyasayı avcunu almış Amerikan dolarını geçmeyi bırakın zirve yapmıştır anlık olarak 1 BTC yaklaşık olarak 35,630.85 TL ve 7501.26 Dolara denk gelmektedir ne kadar dudak uçuklatan bir rakam değimi? Sizin de içinizden kurucusunun şuan Para havuzunda yüzdüğünü düşündüğünüze eminim.\nŞimdi Bitcoini teknik açıdan incelemeye devam edelim konu girişimizde en kısa bir şekilde Dijital para diyerekten tanımımızı yapmıştık şimdi bu tanımı ayrıntılı bir incelemeye tabi tutalım. Bitcoin Algoritmalardan ve Protokollerden oluşan bir tür sayı yığını bu benzerliği yönünden buna Maden diyebiliriz. Bizimde Madeni kazan bir Madenci olduğumuzu düşünürsek yapmamız gereken madende o kadar değersiz taş türevleri arasından nadir bulunan Elmas ve türevlerini kasmak olacaktır. Bu örnekten yola çıkarsak arkadaşlar Bitcoin algoritmasıda aynı şekilde milyonlarda işe yaramaz karmaşık sayı yığınları arasından ihtiyacımız olan sayıları kazmak aslında birazda şans işi şeklinde yorum yapan Profesörler bulunmaktadır ancak bu Profesörlerin söylediklerine katılmıyorum çünkü Nakamoto bey öyle bir Algoritma kullanmıştır ki bu algoritma kendini her saniye daha da şifreleyerek ve karmaşıklaştırarak işin şansa bırakılmasını günümüzde imkansız hale kılmıştır. Arkadaşlar son cümleyi tekrar edeyim günümüzde Bitcoin kazmak gerçekten çok zor çünkü algoritmasının kendini her saniye zorlaştırıldığını söylemiştim ancak ve ancak yeni çıktığı dönemde 2009 ufak bir yatırım ile oldukça fazla Bitcoin alabilmek mümkündü günümüzde de ufak bir miktar ücret ile alınan birkaç tane Bitcoinin bile bu kadar değerleneceğini düşünürsek insan bazen keşke zamanda geriye yolculuk yapsam diyor. Hazır bu konudan bir örnek vermişken geçenlerden bir Teknoloji haber platformunun bir haberini okumuştum ondan bahsedeyim adamın biri ilk çıktığı senelerde yani 2009 yılında 27 Dolar gibi ufak bir ücret ile 5000 BTC almış daha sonra aradan geçen 8 yıl sonrasında unutmuş bir gün hesabına giriş yaptığında ise şok olmuş. Şuan o kişi 900 bin dolar civarında bir paraya sahip. Ne diyelim kafasını kullanmış hak etmiş.\nKonumuza devam edersek arkadaşlar konuya giriş yaptığım sırada hatırlarsanız maden örneği vermiştim bu örnekte elmas ile BTC kazma olayının birbirleri ile mizahi açıdan benzerliği olduğunu söylemiştim aynı şekilde Elimizdeki Kazı aracının mesela baltanın boyutu, kalitesi, sağlamlığı, kuvveti ne kadar fazla olursa o kadar daha kolay kazar değil mi? Aynı şekilde sizin de Bitcoin kasmak için kullandığınız bilgisayar üzerinde bulunan İşlemci ne kadar kuvvetli olur ise bir yığın karmaşık sayı arasından doğru değerleri bulabilmek o kadar kolaylaşır. Bu arada bahsetmem gereken bir şey var ilk zamanlar olsa elinizde bulunan Standart ortalama donanımsal özelliklere sahip bir bilgisayar yada laptop ile kasmak mümkündü ancak şuan bırak ortalamayı ortalamanın on katı yüz katı üstün bir düzüne yan yana dizilerek aynı anda çalışan makine bile 0, 1 gibi değerler üzerinden kasabiliyor. Konumuzun devamında bazı arkadaşlar Bitcoini nerede saklayabiliyoruz şeklinde sormuştur muhtemelen arkadaşlar Bitcoini internet üzerinden hizmet veren bir çok platform üzerinden Cüzdan açarak saklama işleminizi yapmanız mümkündür, Cüzdan şu şekil çalışır size 2 tane İD verir ilk değeriniz alış veriş yapabilmek için diğer değerinizde Para aktarabilmek içindir bu arada Online bir Cüzdan kullandığınız zaman Cüzdanınızın tehlikeye düşebilme olasılığı olduğu için hatta geçenlerde duymuşsunuzdur Rusya bir hizmet verenin sistemini patlatarak cüzdanları boşaltmış sizde bu ve bunun gibi durumlara karşın alacağınız güzel bir önlem Online cüzdan kullanmak yerine Donanımsal yani Fiziksel cüzdan kullanmaktadır bir nevi Sabit disk şeklinde düşünebiliriz. İnternet üzerinde Fiziksel Cüzdanı uygun fiyatlar üzerinden bulabilirsiniz.\nPiyasamızda kullanım durumu ne derseniz? Arkadaşlar her ne kadar Türkiye de kullananını içeri atıp müebbet veririz gibi bir anlayış bulunmada Türkiye de Legal olarak bakılmamaktadır. Çünkü Bitcoin denetimini yapmanın imkansız olduğu bir Para birimidir zaten ortaya çıkmasının sebebi de budur güvenlik açısından devletlerin dahi denetimi altında olamaz kolay para aklanabilir ve en kötüsü genellikle derin ağda kullanılmaktadır bu para birimi ile derin ağ üzerinden silah, uyuşturucu, yasal olmayan teknolojik ürünler gibi bir çok şeyi temin edebilirsiniz ha olayı abartıp içinizden bana küfür etmenizi istemiyorum ama BTC ile Kiralık katil tutup adam öldürttüğünü iddia edenler dahi var tabi siz ne kadar inanırsınız o tartışılır. Ayrıca ilk ortaya çıkıldığı günden itibaren miktarı belirlenmiş ve sabitlendiği için Enflasyondan hiçbir şekilde etkilenmemektedir onun yerine bir dolar dahi olsa alıma göre daha çok basılır ve değeri düşer ancak BTC ihtiyaca göre basılabilen bir şey değildir ve Enflasyonu bu zekası sayesinde çok kolay alt edebilmektedir.\nŞimdi arkadaşlar bu kadar övdük göklere çıkarttık ancak olumsuz tarafları nedir dersek? Ülkeler teknolojiye yavaştan sindirerek alışma noktasında Yani Amerika bile zar zor kendini alıştırdıysa hele biz bu para birimine tam olarak alışmamız birkaç yıl daha sürmektedir demek istediğim bu parayı harcayabilmek için yada çekebilmek için bu sisteme uygun çalışan Post makineleri, BTC bankaları henüz Türkiye de yaygınlaşmadı ama hiç yok diyemeyiz geçen günlerde İstanbula bir adan BTC Bankamatiği yapıldı. Ne kadar aktif kullanılır bilemem veyahut kullanıcıların uyum sağlamsıda önemli dediğim gibi Türkiye belki teknolojik açıdan sindirebilir ve BTC Legal bir sistem ile buluşturulabilir ise belki de geleceğin parası olabilir. Evet arkadaşlar bir konumun daha sonuna geldik umarım sizlere ışık tutabilmiş ve bilgi katabilmişimdir. Başka bir konumda görüşmek üzere hayattan hep zevk almanız dileğiyle iyi günler iyi forumlar dilerim konuyu teşekkür etmeyi unutmayınız diğer konularımı okuyarak güzel bilgiler edinebilirsiniz.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T03:31:15.003+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 17208, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=15000", "requestsLeft": 512}
