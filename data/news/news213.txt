Among other things, it went to Blockchain implementation of large enterprises and General technical innovations. What can we take away from the conference.\nThe Consensus of 2018, went yesterday evening with a “Bold Prediction” to the end. This term is used in the English like to have a daring prediction for the future. To those of Jack Dorsey, CEO of Square, a mobile payment service provider, as well as co-founder of the Blogging service, Twitter, ventured. Bitcoin as the “currency of the Internet”?\nHalf in hope, half in expectation of the future Dorsey formulated his Vision of the Bitcoin or other crypto-currency, could one day become the “currency of the Internet”. In his opinion, the Internet deserves its own currency for all transactions you make via the Internet.\nWhether the currency will, however, necessarily of the Bitcoin, Dorsey does not want to set. He hoped, however, that it will be Bitcoin, because he referred to himself as a “big Fan” of bitcoin. Dorsey’s preference for the Bitcoin can be easily explained if you look at the Background of his Start-ups Square. Bitcoin payments are an integral part of the Payment service provider. So you have made a company more than once thought about whether or not the Bitcoin will one day be the Basis for all payments on the Internet. What remains of the conference?\nThe big thing, as it was in the last year about the announcement of Segregated Witness as a compromise solution to the Bitcoin-scaling debate, did not take place this year. Instead, have been adjusted in addition to the usual Promo-Show for crypto-companies more long-term developments. So it went in this year than in previous years, the interweaving of the “Old Economy” and the emerging Blockchain-scene. Well-known traditional companies announced Blockchain projects or were in prospect, to invest in the exploration of the technology. Also Blockchain-Start-ups were given a platform to present yourself and your project.\nAs a second major theme of the conference, the topic of regulation can be considered. Appropriate regulation of Blockchain applications, and in the first line of crypto-currencies, your choice on both sides. Companies and Start-ups hope to gain from a organizing framework that gives them security and support, so that they can make their projects work. Government and regulators also want to establish clear rules to prevent abuse and protect investors and consumers. However, representatives of the legislature also emphasized the difficulty of such an undertaking without professional Expertise. A too tight strangling over-regulation that could impede in the worst case, the innovations, but opposed to both sides.\nEspecially ideas and hopes for the future of the crypto world from the conference in New York in addition to the images of almost 10,000 visitors, including Lambo owners.

An ETF that made a big winning bet on bitcoin has now sold most of it\nJust over a month ago, the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) took home ETF.com’s “ETF Of The Year” award for delivering on its purpose of serving up access to disruptive technology in 2017, and doing so really well.\nCrucial to that recognition was its unique allocation to bitcoin. For much of the fund’s history, that allocation was relatively stable in number of shares, and hovered between 6 percent and 10 percent of the portfolio, according to FactSet data. Bitcoin often led the list of top holdings in ARKK. Only one other ETF on the market offered parallel access to bitcoin ARKK’s internet-focused counterpart ARK Web x.0 ETF (ARKW).\nMore from ETF.com:\nThe next bond crash: An ETF story\nWhy I don’t use target date funds\nWorld’s cheapest ‘do good’ ETF\nBitcoin, accessed through the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), was a major driver behind both these funds’ returns last year. ARKK and ARKW were each up more than 87 percent in 2017. GBTC itself was up a whopping 1,550 percent.\nHere’s the ETFs’ rally last year, and that impressive rally relative to GBTC’s, in two charts:\nBut these ETFs’ big bet on bitcoin is no longer the case. In mid January of this year, ARK began trimming exposure to bitcoin in both funds, and today bitcoin represents only 0.5 percent and 0.6 percent in ARKK and ARKW, respectively. The cryptocurrency is almost a negligible allocation in these portfolios now.\nWhy? According to ARK, the “complicated decision” to dramatically trim bitcoin exposure was more driven by regulatory and tax-related concerns than by the “merits” of bitcoin itself.\nBut performance probably played a major role in this portfolio shift. Bitcoin as measured by GBTC rose dramatically in 2016 and in early 2017, and then began to fall later in the year. So far in 2018, GBTC has already dropped 37 percent, bringing its losses from its mid-December 2017 high to more than 63 percent in just five months. (ARKK and ARKW are each up about 15 percent year-to-date.)\nshow chapters\nEarly bitcoin investor reveals which cryptocurrencies he would HODL or FODL 21 Mins Ago | 10:16\nIt could very well be that ARK was simply taking profits on its bitcoin allocation earlier this year, and has been trimming that position since as bitcoin prices continue to struggle. If GBTC price performance did in fact motivate the move, any recovery in bitcoin prices could mean an increase in allocation down the road.\nFor now, however, given that the Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve the launch of a bitcoin ETF many issuers have thrown their hats into that ring investors who want access to the cryptocurrency through an ETF wrapper have slim pickings at best.\nBy Cinthia Murphy, ETF.com.

12, 2018, 10:15:33 AM Quote: from: abel1337 on May 10, 2018, 03:54:15 PM I dont really need to have a record of my wins and lost on gambling , Before I am considering the loses I have that I need to regain and If I am regaining it I am making my game worst, I am having a greedy feeling about it and not being contented on the winning that I have and in the end I keep loosing because of the unsatisfactions that I am experiencing. Because of that I stop recording my wins and lose and Im happy that it has positive impact on my gambling experience.\nIt is not like you should write down every win or loss but you must have an idea how much money has gone or else you might end up losing more than you ever planned to. This is the beauty of this game. It never let the player realize how much time or money he is wasting there.Moreover, you should not play this game even it is according to your satisfaction. Things can grow really bad.\nKeeping record is difficult because for a regular gambler it is impossible to know how much he lost and win. He can only remember winning and losing for one or two days but not the whole. I won several times and lost as well but never have the exact data how much money I won and how much I lost. I gamble just for fun and not for making money from gambling.\nIt was really a fantastic and wise decision from your side about quitting gambling. Actually whosoever use his mind and full attention towards this problem, he must be taking decision to leave this thing. Reason is, it is just natural to be a bad game at all. Things are quite stupid here with no basic and legal logic. Everyone knows we would be getting in just to lose money so why to go in.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T14:41:03.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4c2654cda6479f1ce39d34cdd02c88aef85b6d92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZdc25oqgLPZl9jkbsPf07M-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Really?

May at 4 PM in the afternoon (UTC time) the Bitcoin’s Cash network with a Hard Fork. The Software Upgrade brings the old functions back into the BCH-Ecosystem, and increases the block size to 32 megabytes. Roger Ver, advocates of the Bitcoin-Hard-Fork, is optimistic in terms of the BCH-price development until the end of the year.\nAs we are already at 20. April reported that planned the Bitcoin-Cash-Community a Hard Fork for the 15. May. The Update was successful for Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash itself is the result of a Hard Fork of the Bitcoin-network on 1. August 2017. A higher block limit\nThe biggest news of the Hard Fork, the four-fold increase in the block size. In August 2017 Bitcoin Cash had raised already the Limit of 1 MegaByte to 8 MegaByte. Now these 8 megabytes have been increased to 32 megabytes. Thus, the Bitcoin-to-Cash-network should be able to process over 60 transactions per second. With an average transaction size of 200 bytes, a Block can accommodate, therefore, to 160,000 transactions. Per day can now be over 20 million transactions.\nCurrently, the 20,000 transactions on the Bitcoin Cash Blockchain per day approximately. The daily capacity is currently maxed so only 0,087 percent. The Website TXHighway visualizes the transactions of the Bitcoin and Bitcoin-to-Cash-Blockchain. Although the Bitcoin Cash highway now has “32 tracks”, however, the “cars” there is only sparse.\nCritics of the Big Blocks suggest that the increase in the block size may lead to centralization. So the costs go up to Operate a Full Node, and the dissemination of geminter blocks is delayed (a MegaByte is faster than 32 megabytes). Currently processed in the Bitcoin network has more transactions than Bitcoin Cash. Functional Extensions\nIn addition to the increased block size of the Bitcoin-Cash-Hard-Fork also activates scripting commands such as OP_GROUP and OP_RETURN. OP_GROUP can be used for the creation of your own tokens on the BCH-Blockchain itself. This means that the Bitcoin Cash will get a functionality similar to Ethereum. With OP_RETURN additional information can be stored on the Blockchain. This function could be used for Smart Contracts in BCH. The price after the Hard Fork\nEven if the Bitcoin-to-Cash Ecosystem, a lot of excitement around the Hard Fork stock, responded to the price, a negative impact on the Software Upgrade, and it fell to about ten percent. However, one must not forget that the BCH-price had doubled in the April quickly. The price level remained above the 1,000-U.S.-Dollar mark, however, stable.\nBitcoin Jesus, Roger Ver, optimistic about the price trend for 2018 and assumes that the BCH-price until the end of the year could double.

Tucker Editor, The Casey Report\nEditor’s Note: In recent weeks, Bill has outlined the potential upsides to bitcoin. And regular readers know that Jeff Brown, Bill’s top technology analyst, is very bullish on the crypto space. But today, we offer a very different opinion.\nE.B. Tucker is the editor of Casey Research’s Strategic Investor. Today, E.B. shares an excerpt from his new book, Surviving Fedcoin , and details why he believes governments will come together to ban cryptos.\nIt’s very different from what you’ve heard from other editors in these pages. But cryptocurrencies are still a new, emerging asset with an uncertain future. Because of that, it’s healthy – and reasonable – to consider all possible outcomes.\nSo many things in life are inevitable.\nBut are they imminent?\nWhat you’re about to read is a dangerous scenario that I believe is on the horizon. And while I may not be able to predict whether this scenario will happen in a month, two months, or two years… I am absolutely convinced it will happen .\nWhat’s going on?\nCryptocurrencies, as I’m sure you’ve noticed, have now gone mainstream…\nIn late 2017, bitcoin briefly almost topped $20,000 (per coin!)… and as much as $800 billion went into “cryptos.”\nSince then, more and more governments around the world have moved to regulate (and even ban) cryptos…\nThey have simply gotten too big to ignore.\nRemember: Every dollar invested in a cryptocurrency is a dollar that doesn’t benefit a money-hungry government.\nThat’s why countries are banding together to STOP cryptos.\nMajor credit card companies have already banned cryptos from being bought on their cards…\nAdvertisers on some of the world’s largest websites – including Google and Facebook – are now prevented from including any mention of bitcoin or cryptocurrencies…\nAnd several high-ranking officials and intellectuals have warned of the dangers of private cryptocurrencies.\nWhat all these global elites agree on, however, is that the only cryptocurrencies that should be allowed to survive are the ones backed by governments.\nAccording to a study by Cambridge University, a full 80% of countries surveyed were either researching or actively developing their own cryptocurrencies.\nVenezuela has already raised almost $1 billion for its oil-backed cryptocurrency, the “petro”…\nAnd the Marshall Islands also announced their own state crypto.\nThis is just the beginning…\nHere in America, there’s been serious talk about issuing a state-backed crypto called the “Fedcoin.” Recommended Link\nThe government, you see, is in real trouble…\nOur national debt has now topped $21 trillion…\nAnd interest rates are starting to creep up, which means it will soon cost BILLIONS more to service our debt.\n(As then-candidate Donald Trump said back in 2016, “What happens if that interest rate goes up 2, 3, 4 points? We don’t have a country.”)\nThat’s a big reason why the government has been cracking down on cash purchases… and why this will likely accelerate in the future.\nThe government can’t afford to let any cash purchase go untaxed.\nEach year, the “underground economy” costs the IRS $450–$500 billion in lost taxes.\nEnter Fedcoin…\nWith physical cash on the way out… and a new state crypto like Fedcoin on the way in… all of our savings would essentially be “trapped.”\nThat way, the government would greatly minimize how much it loses in unreported taxes each year…\nOn top of that, it would be very easy to implement a nasty, new tax, too – like the wealth tax in France, where 1–2% of your net worth gets taxed each year, regardless of whether you have income or not…\nOr like the “savings” taxes in many countries around the world.\n(These are the bizarre, so-called “negative” interest rates. This is when you pay the bank for lending it your money.)\nCentral planners like having these negative interest rates as an option because they say it’s one sure way to “stimulate” the economy when times get tough… They figure that people would rather use their money on stuff like new cars and houses than see it taxed away in a bank.\nFedcoin lets you do this. Recommended Link\nVice President Ford: $6,133 every month…\nChief Deputy Whip Dan Rostenkowski: $14,667 monthly…\nCalifornia Representative Duke Cunningham: $3,500 a month…\nEven President Nixon collected from this obscure yet lucrative Social Security alternative. He collected $200,000 a year (in today’s money).\nAs one insider put it: — An “Added Policy Tool”\nFedcoin, of course, would be nothing more than a type of “bitcoin” issued by the Federal Reserve.\nTo understand how this works, let’s have a little refresher on bitcoin…\nBitcoin surfaced back in 2009.\nThe idea behind this digital-only currency was to have a new type of money that was safe, had a limited supply (to prevent massive inflation), and was outside government control.\nThe currency flourished…\nFrom a price of less than $0.01 per coin, it rose to over $1,000 per coin back in 2013, and now trades for around $8,000 per coin.\nSo what does bitcoin have to do with the Federal Reserve?\nSimply this: The technology behind bitcoin – something called the “blockchain”– can be used to create other digital currencies. That means the Fed could issue its own type of bitcoin – hence the name “Fedcoin.”\nIf this sounds far-fetched, consider this… Back in 2014, François R. Velde, senior economist at the Chicago Fed, said that the blockchain was an “elegant solution to the problem of creating a digital currency.”\nAnd David Andolfatto, vice president at the St. Louis Fed, actually proposed “Fedcoin” (mentioning that exact name) in 2015. He’s spoken publicly about this multiple times, and says that Fedcoin could give the central bank an “added (policy) tool.”\nJust imagine the benefits of having a digital-only currency… How can you have a bank run if you can’t withdraw physical money? That’s exactly the point. You can’t! With a digital-only currency, you…\nCan’t have bank runs.\nCan easily implement negative interest rates if you want to (how will people withdraw their cash?).\nMake it easier for the government to tax people at will.\nThat’s why we believe it’s an absolute lock that we’ll have some kind of “Fedcoin”-like currency in America very soon…\nConsider that over 40 million Americans are on food stamps. Our Social Security program is practically bankrupt. And everybody knows about our out-of-control debt problem.\nIn fact, David Walker, former comptroller general of the United States from 1998 to 2008, says that taxes need to DOUBLE… Otherwise, the country will go bankrupt.\nAmerica is in dire straits. Right now, as we said, the government loses an estimated $450–$500 billion each year in lost tax revenue because of the “underground” (cash) economy.\nSo you can see where this is heading… By getting rid of cash and introducing a cashless currency, the government could dramatically increase its tax revenue.\nThis idea of a “cashless” economy is gaining more and more traction. That’s why former Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers has said that it’s time to kill the $100 bill. And several countries around the world have already started outlawing higher-denomination bills. (For example, the European Union recently banned €500 banknotes.)\nWe believe it’s the right of every American to purchase what they choose in total privacy. Not everybody who uses cash is a criminal.\nBut limiting cash is only part of the equation. Some of the features we could see with a new monetary system like Fedcoin are incredibly Orwellian in nature… Recommended Link Eccentric Millionaire Warns New Trump “Monetary Accord” Coming\nForget NAFTA, tariffs, and the tax bill. This could become the defining deal of the Trump era…\nIn short, a new monetary accord is being discussed. A move that could ban bitcoin in America. This is controversial. But one group has learned of a private meeting that could set the ban in motion.\nWorst of all: This could lead to a big change for retirees, even those who have never touched cryptos. — Perfectly Trackable\nImagine a world where everything you buy (or can’t buy) is controlled by a single card… a world where any government bureaucrat can instantly look at your entire history of purchases on a single record.\nThanks to blockchain technology, that’s exactly what’s at stake with Fedcoin. If this sounds crazy, just take a look at some of the government controls we’re currently subject to…\nWith FATCA (the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act), Americans now need to report all their non-U.S. financial accounts to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).\nBanks must now send a “currency transaction report” to FinCEN for any withdrawal that exceeds $10,000.\nEven if you withdraw less than $10,000, if the bank thinks you’re doing so to avoid reporting, you could be found guilty of “structuring.”\nThere’s also civil forfeitures: Today, even if you are not charged with any wrongdoing, law enforcement officials can “legally” seize your assets. In 2014 alone, federal agents seized more than $5 billion – an amount greater than what was lost in every single burglary in America that year.\nAnd that’s to say nothing of other regulations like FBAR (Foreign Bank Account Reports), PFIC (passive foreign investment companies), and “know your customer” rules… along with things like “cigarette” and “soda” taxes for anything the state deems dangerous to your health.\nI mean, just think about this: There’s already a federal law that says food stamp recipients can’t use their benefits to buy liquor, cigarettes, or any non-food items.\nNow, we’re not in favor of the welfare program. But the point is, with Fedcoin, you could control everything very easily since, unlike cash, it’s a “programmable” currency. (Fedcoin would likely be administered as a type of debit card… or perhaps as an app on your smartphone… But behind it all, it would run like a big computer program.)\nWhat would this look like?\nWell, imagine if 17-year-old “Johnny Junior” tries to buy liquor. His purchase would automatically be denied. No need to look at a driver’s license. Or if “Fred Foodstamp” tries to go to the strip club using his government-issued EBT card – sorry, no dice.\nWhat if, all of a sudden, the president decides a certain type of gun shouldn’t be purchased by certain people… or maybe all guns? Well, again, once you get rid of cash and use a perfectly trackable digital currency, it becomes very easy. No costly gun registry needed.\nRemember, the government already controls what types of things you can and can’t buy – think drugs, medication, and online gambling… They control where you can buy things – for decades, Americans couldn’t travel to Cuba…\nAnd they also control when you can buy things – just think of the legal drinking age. Now, I don’t think anyone wants to see a 10-year-old drinking booze… and we’re not here to make a political statement…\nBut we do believe that for liberty-loving Americans – and those who want to safeguard their savings – certain steps need to be taken in anticipation of what seems like a mere eventuality: a type of digital-only currency.\nThat’s why we wrote this book – to help you make sure that you are able to protect everything you’ve worked hard for… to purchase the things you want in privacy… and also, to come out ahead.\nAnd even if Fedcoin turns out to be years away, or if by some miracle, we never see it… by following the steps in our new book, you’ll be no worse for wear.\nIn fact, you’ll be in a much better position to face any oncoming crisis – like another stock market crash – than 99% of Americans out there.\nRegards,\nE.B. Tucker Editor, Strategic Investor\nP.S. You need to position yourself today for if – and when – Fedcoin becomes a reality. And our new 125-page book, Surviving Fedcoin, is the best way to get started.

This innovation will allow the Company’s clients to buy BTC, perform trading operations with this asset, and convert the cryptocurrency back to fiat money. Along with an opportunity to buy Bitcoin, RoboForex clients can benefit from the difference of BTC exchange rates. Clients are not obliged to trade cryptocurrency – they can merely deposit funds to their Bitcoin accounts and receive profits in case of the asset growth.\nAs a matter of fact, this innovation from RoboForex is similar to the exchange Bitcoin wallet, but has several essential advantages: Depositing/withdrawing funds via many payment systems, including bank cards. Guarantee of funds security. RoboForex is a regulated broker, which has been successfully operating on the market for more than 8 years. Quick funds withdrawal. Opportunity to trade any currency pairs on Pro-Standard, ECN-Pro NDD, and Prime accounts using Bitcoin.\nWith these new opportunities to buy the cryptocurrency and deposit funds to Bitcoin Wallets, providing access to a new product to RoboForex clients which allows to investment in Bitcoin quickly and securely.\nHowever, it should be clear that the new product is not intended for conversion of the cryptocurrency into fiat money.

Billboards have appeared outside his office to convey the message of the crypto community. Also, a report suggests that the US cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase may apply for a banking license. Some conflicting views on the future of the Internet and its money complete Saturday’s roundup.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Friday: UN Backs Crypto-Solar Project in Moldova, Malta Uses Blockchain in Public Transportation\n“Warren: Maybe You’re Wrong About Bitcoin?” Billionaire investor Warren Buffett, known for his negative attitude towards cryptocurrencies, has been targeted in a bitcoin advocacy campaign lead by one of the largest cloud mining companies. Genesis Mining has recently posted billboards in front of Buffett’s office reminding him that he was wrong about Google and Amazon, and telling him that he may very well be wrong about bitcoin, as well.\nThe initiative has received a lot of support from the crypto community on social media. Genesis co-founder Marco Krohn posted on Twitter photos of the message to the investment guru with a short note saying: “Some new billboards outside of Warren Buffetts office! :)”\nEarlier this month, the American business magnate issued another warning in regards to bitcoin and the like. “Cryptocurrencies will come to a bad ending,” he said during the annual Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholder meeting, but he didn’t stop there. “If I could buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies, I’d be glad to do it but I would never short a dime’s worth,” he said, concluding that bitcoin is “probably rat poison squared.” Needless to say, Buffett’s comments provoked reactions and even inspired new business ideas. A tokenized marketplace called Ecoinmerce has announced the “Rat Poison Squared clothing line.” Т-shirts and hats are already offered online, but one can also order a mug with the winged phrase.\nThe Money of the Internet and the Internet of Money Square CEO Jack Dorsey has recently reiterated his views about bitcoin. “The internet is going to have a native currency, so let’s not wait for it to happen, let’s help it happen,” he said during a blockchain conference, adding: “I don’t know if it will be bitcoin but I hope it will be.” Dorsey, who is also the chief executive of Twitter, wants his payment processing company to be at the forefront of the efforts to achieve adoption of cryptocurrencies as global means of payment. In an interview in March, he predicted that there will be a single world currency in the next ten years. The billionaire believes that will be bitcoin, although he admits the cryptocurrency is still slow and costly.\nCircle co-founder and President Sean Neville, however, has a different vision of what’s to come for the digital space and the digital currencies. “Very excited about the idea of reimagining what global finance can be,” he says that a dollar token is the future of the Internet of money. “One of the things that’s interesting for us is how we take fiat money and put in on blockchains, how do we get the benefits of a public blockchain infrastructure, which might underpin something like HTTPS of money,” he told Bloomberg .\nNeville thinks there is a problem with using existing crypto assets for payments and settlements – they are very volatile. “So, it makes sense to have something like the US dollar represented as a token that can transfer anywhere in the world, to any digital wallet and any exchange that can support it,” he explained. Sean Neville, whose company raised $110Mn USD in a fundraising round led by Chinese giant Bitmain , believes that “we need a replacement for SWIFT .” He also predicted that eventually everything of value will be tokenized in a “hybrid world” of centralized and decentralized services. Boston based Circle has announced plans to issue a dollar-backed cryptocurrency called USD-C.\nCoinbase May Apply for a Banking License By attracting some serious investments, Circle has actually joined the club of the most well-funded cryptocurrency companies. Another of its members, Coinbase , seems tempted to expand its financial business to include banking services. According to a report by the Wall Street Journal , representatives of the crypto brokerage have met with US regulators to talk about the possibility to apply for a banking license.\nA source quoted by the WSJ has revealed, that the company, which operates the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, has contacted officials from the US Office of the Comptroller of Currency earlier this year to discuss the matter. Beside the opportunity to broaden the types of products it offers, a banking license would allow Coinbase to operate without the need to partner with banks.\nWhat are your thoughts on today’s Bitcoin in Brief stories?

Major cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, Ether and EOS increased in the 3 to 7 percent range, pushing the cryptocurrency market towards the $400 region. Ethereum and Tokens\nEther, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain network, has been the best performing cryptocurrency amongst major digital assets in the likes of bitcoin, EOS, and Cardano. The price of Ether recovered to $713, rising by more than 5 percent.\nThe daily trading volume of Ether has started to near its previous levels in early January and February, during a period in which the price and volume of Ether achieved an all-time high. The rise in the volume of Ether has demonstrated the increase in the demand for cryptocurrencies from investors in the global market, especially in regions like Japan and South Korea.\nAccording to CryptoCompare, a cryptocurrency market data provider, the daily trading volume of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Japan and South Korea had significantly dropped from May 15 to 18, by nearly 30 percent.\nSome experts including Bithumb and UPbit executives previously stated that the imposition of impractical policies by the South Korean government led the volumes of exchanges to fall, but it remains unclear as to why the volume of Japanese exchanges suddenly fell within a 3-day period. It is possible that rumors surrounding bitFlyer caused the market to lose confidence temporarily, as the volume of the Japanese market started to recover after bitFlyer executives refuted rumors of potential hacking attacks.\nAs seen in the chart below, the volume of bitcoin has continuously declined since it tested the $10,000 support level earlier this month. After reaching $9,900, the price of bitcoin dipped below $7,900 and the volume of the global market declined.\nUnlike bitcoin, the daily trading volume of Ether has been relatively stable and in comparison to its volume in January, when the valuation of the cryptocurrency market was still in the $500 billion region, the volume of Ether has not fallen substantially. As such, in the short-term, it is highly likely that Ether will outperform most cryptocurrencies in the market.\nInvestors in the cryptocurrency market often reallocate their funds in major cryptocurrencies to tokens and small-scale cryptocurrencies if they start to become more confident in the short-term future of the market.\nOver the past 24 hours, tokens such as 0x (ZRX), Aelf (ELF), and Polychain (POLY) increased by around 10 to 20 percent, signifying the improvement of market conditions and increase in confidence from investors in the global cryptocurrency market. With the exception of some tokens such as DigixDAO, Binance Coin, and Storm, the majority of tokens outperformed bitcoin over the past 24 hours, gaining by more than 5 percent in value.

For much of the fund’s history, that allocation was relatively stable in number of shares, and hovered between 6 percent and 10 percent of the portfolio, according to FactSet data. Bitcoin often led the list of top holdings in ARKK. Only one other ETF on the market offered parallel access to bitcoin ARKK’s internet-focused counterpart ARK Web x.0 ETF (ARKW).\nMore from ETF.com:\nThe next bond crash: An ETF story\nWhy I don’t use target date funds\nWorld’s cheapest ‘do good’ ETF\nBitcoin, accessed through the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), was a major driver behind both these funds’ returns last year. ARKK and ARKW were each up more than 87 percent in 2017. GBTC itself was up a whopping 1,550 percent.\nHere’s the ETFs’ rally last year, and that impressive rally relative to GBTC’s, in two charts:\nBut these ETFs’ big bet on bitcoin is no longer the case. In mid January of this year, ARK began trimming exposure to bitcoin in both funds, and today bitcoin represents only 0.5 percent and 0.6 percent in ARKK and ARKW, respectively. The cryptocurrency is almost a negligible allocation in these portfolios now.\nWhy? According to ARK, the “complicated decision” to dramatically trim bitcoin exposure was more driven by regulatory and tax-related concerns than by the “merits” of bitcoin itself.\nBut performance probably played a major role in this portfolio shift. Bitcoin as measured by GBTC rose dramatically in 2016 and in early 2017, and then began to fall later in the year. So far in 2018, GBTC has already dropped 37 percent, bringing its losses from its mid-December 2017 high to more than 63 percent in just five months. (ARKK and ARKW are each up about 15 percent year-to-date.)\nshow chapters\nEarly bitcoin investor reveals which cryptocurrencies he would HODL or FODL 21 Mins Ago | 10:16\nIt could very well be that ARK was simply taking profits on its bitcoin allocation earlier this year, and has been trimming that position since as bitcoin prices continue to struggle. If GBTC price performance did in fact motivate the move, any recovery in bitcoin prices could mean an increase in allocation down the road.\nFor now, however, given that the Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve the launch of a bitcoin ETF many issuers have thrown their hats into that ring investors who want access to the cryptocurrency through an ETF wrapper have slim pickings at best.\nBy Cinthia Murphy, ETF.com.

In the last 24 hours for example, it is down nine percent adding on to their weekly 13 percent loss. It might have been because of the mixed reaction following the upgrade from 8MB to 32MB happening at a time when the average daily transaction is around 20K at 80kb per block. When Bitcoin Cash shall utilize full capacity and fill 32MB per block we don\\u2019t know. Considering competition especially from Bitcoin and Ethereum-the latter plans on sharding, it might take a while before that happens. \\n From the News \\n\nIs Bitcoin Cash a wonderful product? Absolutely! Will it replace Bitcoin and dominate the crypto world? Well, maybe, who knows! For investors, speculators and traders, waiting on the sidelines and timing good entry positions can be prudent than trading with every slight swing. Yes, they had an upgrade this week but is it convincing enough for merchants and retail users to say switch from say Litecoin and use Bitcoin Cash to transact? Time is everything and right now, sellers are pressing the gas pedal with eyes set at $600. \\n\nWhat we do know for sure is that Bitcoin Cash has new capacity now that we have a 32MB block in place. There will be space for new user cases and yes, just to clarify, majority of the Bitcoin Cash network would be run by small data centers with better connections and which have the ability to carry out network back hauls. In my view, I don\\u2019t really think there would be problems of centralization as many people have been made to believe. \\n\nNot everyone can become a full node and forget about your smart phone ever becoming one. The issue of centralization might crop up not because of storage issue or bandwidth limitation but from centralization of hardware via economies of scale. It\\u2019s a design weakness and that\\u2019s why we have these huge mining pools who are set to get richer with every block size increment. So, will Bitcoin Cash becomes another centralized business in the future? I leave that to you. \\n Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Technical Analysis \\n Weekly Chart \\n Bitcoin Cash Weekly Chart by Trading View \\n\nIn the weekly chart, Bitcoin Cash prices are basically topping and after week ending May 13 double bar bear reversal pattern, it is likely that prices might dip lower. Notice that last week ended lower despite abnormal volumes suggesting that there were some form of liquidation and rejection of higher highs at resistance. So, unless otherwise, this week will likely end as a bear and in that case we shall continue holding our bear stance as we aim for week ending April 8 lows at around $700. \\n Daily Chart \\n Bitcoin Cash Daily Chart by Trading View \\n\nLike the weekly chart, BCH sellers are in charge and for sure, this might continue. As it looks, bears have already broken through the first level of distribution at $1200. From the look of things and basing this on the general trend, swing traders can initiate shorts at current prices and aim for $800, $700 and $600 round numbers. \\n\nThe post Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Analysis (May 19, 2018) ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T06:00:09.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "569bf6a8f9361053d6a1e030bbca660c70546f40", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTNHagZcf5W7Hu5uccV.3qTO0OpNq3G1s6fUimOwhj4xd1Bf6hjNkliS.H4C.1FzmBV7CbFSPlqrbmOhut2FyNVJ_YTnC1TnrOACiyZcek3AGlrcaM6z8cL", "site_full": "mycriptocurrency.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://mycriptocurrency.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The rise of the digital currency", "title": "Missed Out on the Bitcoin Boom?

These Other Cryptocurrencies maybe Worthy of Investment", "text": "The idea to have a sole internet currency that can be used all over the world was thought up by Satoshi Nakamoto , who released Bitcoin in 2009. Since then, the blockchain-based currency has grown in stature and boomed in price. It was virtually worthless, to begin with, but at its peak was being traded at over $19,000. The question is, will it be adopted on a global scale and one day negate the need for fiat currencies? The problem for Bitcoin is the fact that it has inspired a number of other cryptocurrencies, which are now vying for top spot. Could this be another case of Betamax and VHS where the original is usurped by a newer copy with a similar design?\nLitecoin Litecoin was one of the original forks of the Bitcoin chain, which occurred in 2011. It is technically nearly identical to its forefather but has a much larger supply limit of 84 million LTC to 21 million BTC. It also has a decreased block generation time of 2.5 minutes to Bitcoin’s ten minutes. For these reasons, the currency founded by former Google employee Charlie Lee has been dubbed the silver to bitcoin’s gold. Because of the size of Litecoin in comparison to Bitcoin, experts believe it should be worth about 25 percent of the value of its predecessor. As it stands, though, the altcoin is only worth around 2 percent of Nakamoto’s currency. This could mean that now is the perfect time to invest in Litecoin because going by this theory it should be worth over $2000 at the time of writing. Between its inception and 2017, Litecoin did very little, remaining virtually worthless and unheard of. But early last year the coin was added to the world famous cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase , and this brought it into the spotlight. In fact, Litecoin was in the top ten rising coins of 2017 with a 5046 percent gain. In mid-December, the coin hit a high of $375, highlighting its potential not just as an alternative to Bitcoin, but as a challenger. With its speedy transaction times, Litecoin has the capacity to be used for day-to-day payments, while Bitcoin has become a great option for moving larger sums of money. EOS EOS is a newcomer to the cryptocurrency scene, but people are getting extremely excited about its potential. It’s currently a token on the Ethereum network, but on June 1 will be released as its own open source software. Anyone holding it now needs to register their tokens before that date. According to Betway Casino, Ethereum has been the smarter choice for cryptocurrency enthusiasts to date due to its faster transaction times and smart contracts. But EOS is now being touted as a more advanced alternative to Vitalik Buterin’s coin. In fact, the newer platform is similar to Ethereum in many ways, but it aims to surpass its predecessor by solving the scalability issues and eliminating all fees for users. Fans of Ethereum will certainly be interested in investing in EOS, as the newer currency has been dubbed the “Ethereum Killer” with some believing that Buterin’s platform could be rendered obsolete. The fact that Ethereum is yet to gain mass adoption could work in the favor of EOS. If the new currency can prove to do all the same things as Ethereum and more, it might boom. The picture is likely to become a lot clearer after it is released properly in June. OmiseGo Among some of the most exciting cryptocurrencies on the market is OmiseGo, and it has been backed by Ethereum founder Buterin for success. OMG is a subsidiary of Omise, a leading online payment provider in Southeast Asia. The developers have been working alongside the Ethereum community since it began in 2015, and the coin is designed to combat the scalability issues of Ethereum. It also has a heavy focus on enabling payments and transactions in crypto and fiat currencies. In a big recent move, OmiseGo has collaborated with two of the top financial institutions in South Korea, Shinhan, and Woori. The huge banks will use OMG’s blockchain platform to execute their transactions. The company has also struck a deal with the government of Thailand to develop a payment and identification system for the country using its blockchain. These steps could pave the way for mass adoption in the near future, and with the currency currently trading around the $18 mark, it could be an ideal time to get involved. Of course, anyone wanting to invest money into cryptocurrencies should understand that it’s a purely speculative market. There is a chance that none of these coins will ever come into widespread usage and the money people have invested could be lost. There is no denying the potential of these Bitcoin rivals, though, and those HODLing the coins now could reap the rewards later down the line.

In fact, a 2009 Harris Poll revealed that 26 percent of Americans believe the stars control destiny. Now, it appears people are basing their decision to buy bitcoin on their horoscope. Planetary Movements Affect Bitcoin\nFor the sake of this article, no attempt will be made to wade into the debate of whether astrology is a science. According to experts in the field, there is an imminent shift in planetary positions. Uranus is moving from Aries to Taurus.\nThe planet Uranus symbolizes change and revolution leading believers to predict a coming paradigm shift. With Taurus being an earth sign, this impending changing of the guard should affect finance, agriculture, climate, etc.\nThese days, cryptocurrency and bitcoin, in particular, is a significant topic in the financial realm. Thus, some astrologers posit that the number one crypto is about to revolutionize the financial market. With this in mind, true believers are buying bitcoin in the expectation of another bull run. To spice things a little, the symbol for Taurus is the head of a bull with horns. As far as symbolic representations go, this might appear profound. A Growing Trend\nThe nascent nature of bitcoin makes it difficult to make predictions based on an established pattern. Thus, investors, many of whom are novices are left with confusing charts, “expert advice,” and now it seems horoscope. Proponents of astrology point to the correlation between previous planetary movements and several sweeping changes that occurred over the years.\nFor example, the last Uranus shift which brought into Aries saw the rise of social movements all over the world. Aries represents activism and individuality, and in the previous seven years, the world has seen the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, and many social justice movements, coincidence? Uranus shifts every seven years, and the next shift occurs this week.\nRecently, former NFL star, Ricky Williams revealed that astrology played a big part in his investment decisions. He also said that he is investing in bitcoin because Uranus is about to enter into Taurus.\nWilliams isn’t the only one, Marcus Thomas, a bitcoin trader based in Chicago told MarketWatch that he is investing in bitcoin for the same reason. According to financial analyst, Raymond Merriman, there is a correlation between planetary cycles and human activity.\nDo you believe astrology has any bearing on the price of bitcoin? Will you be investing in bitcoin when Uranus enters Taurus?

Ultimately, if we break down below the lows of the session, the market will probably go down to the $7000 level next, and it must be stated that the weekly chart looks very soft as well. Because of this, it looks very likely that the market will continue to be negative overall, but a short-term bounce could give us an opportunity to sell at higher levels or signs of exhaustion. The $8500 level is short-term resistant, followed by $9000 been massive in the way of a “ceiling” in the market.\nGet Into Bitcoin Trading Today\nBTC/JPY Bitcoin rallied against the Japanese yen as well, but I believe is going to find a bit of resistance just above. Because of this, I anticipate that the market participants will sell at the first signs of exhaustion, and it now appears that the bitcoin markets are going to struggle and roll over at this point. I believe that the market will probably go looking towards the ¥800,000 level, and then perhaps even lower to the ¥700,000 level which is the bottom of the overall consolidation area that we have been paying attention to for quite a while. If we were to break down below that level, we would not only break the consolidation, but we will have cleared the bottom of the massive weekly uptrend line. I believe at this point the sellers are starting to run the show again.\nBTC/USD Video 21.05.18 Buy & Sell Bitcoin Instantly\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\nMore From FXEMPIRE: US stock markets pulled back slightly during the week Ethereum falls during the week British pound rallies against Japanese yen at vital uptrend line during the week New Zealand dollar falls again during week Crude Oil markets rallied during the week again making fresh highs US dollar breaks out against Japanese yen during the week", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/us-stock-markets-pulled-back-slightly-week-503077", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/bitcoin-rallies-slightly-friday-trading-503017", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/crude-oil-markets-rallied-week-making-fresh-highs-503063", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/ethereum-falls-week-2-503091", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/us-dollar-breaks-japanese-yen-week-503053", "http://fxempire.engine.adglare.net/?348638767", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/XGAvNrHVrsE?feature=oembed", "http://fxempire.engine.adglare.net/?348638767&quot;", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/btc-usd/overview&quot;", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/british-pound-rallies-japanese-yen-vital-uptrend-line-week-503041", "https://www.fxempire.com/markets/btc-usd/overview", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/new-zealand-dollar-falls-week-503047", "https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/bitcoin-rallies-slightly-friday-trading-503017&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T08:18:17.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "980067253642e06d3161576d0ccfa29346991da2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSgZh9vBjKb9HjyKy3Ca8Vj_nbLPh6.zGeFLWIZEJzSgbwdxGhwK7.EAAljlty_lMIjmXhw_JmQ3p7OPXYv_0XaKhaasZOE14dCRwdHeVCuhjxoA2qFkaM6Q--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "reddit: the front page of the internet", "title": "[H] Paypal, Skrill, Bitcoin, good price, good rep [W] Dota2 items/ Inventory/ Cash out : Dota2Trade", "title_full": "[H] Paypal, Skrill, Bitcoin, good price, good rep [W] Dota2 items/ Inventory/ Cash out : Dota2Trade", "published": "2018-05-19T13:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "980067253642e06d3161576d0ccfa29346991da2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSgZh9vBjKb9HjyKy3Ca8Vj_nbLPh6.zGeFLWIZEJzSgbwdxGhwK7.EAAljlty_lMIjmXhw_JmQ3p7OPXYv_0XaKhaasZOE14dCRwdHeVCuhjxoA2qFkaM6Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "reaperelnino", "published": "2018-05-19T13:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "[H] Paypal, Skrill, Bitcoin, good price, good rep [W] Dota2 items/ Inventory/ Cash out : Dota2Trade", "text": "BUYING ITEMS Buying popular items/ full inventory 60-66% Steam Market\nHigh value betable (Dc hook, Staches DA cape, Kantusa, Mace of aeons, Golden) 66-70% Steam Market\nLooking for bulk betable items suppliers (add me to discuss)\nPayment: Paypal / Skrill / Cryptocurrency / WMZ (ask me if you want others payments)\nIf you want to use reddit's middleman, you'll pay fees.\nCheck my steam profile and my cash reputation theard before contact, chargeback and scam will not happen.\nStarted trading on reddit for 3 years.

Privacy was held as a core value of this new world. Eric Hughes wrote the cypherpunk manifesto and is credited as starting the cypherpunk movement along with Timothy C. May and John Gilmore . Before social media, medium and all other forms of communication everything came down to email. People like Eric Hughes and Hal Finney ran anonymous re-mailers. This allowed anyone to join the discussion while still maintaining their privacy. While lists were generally open it was essential that people could contribute with privacy because whistle blowers, developers of controversial technology and other individuals may not have reached out and shared their information or works. One of the biggest breakthroughs for online privacy and identity verification was Phil Zimmermann ’s creation of PGP in 1991. Of course back in 1991 Hal Finney was on the RFC proposal and was the second developer hired at the PGP Corporation . Phil Zimmerman was charged under the Arms Export Control Act for the development of PGP. It’s said all the lines of code were printed on paper, and flown in a huge stack by airplane to be retyped in some cases. Other folks peer-to-peer exchanged the code. Who knew a software tool could be considered a weapon, and while the case was dropped it forced a lot of developers to re-think their works. However, one of the main themes in the cypherpunk world is push code, ask questions later. Well, email is a theme here, because the lists and anonymous remailers were a great communication tool, but the rise of spam and other annoying issues forced the issue of how to improve communication while not cutting out good actors. How could someone allow an anonymous person to contribute but “check” that they’re worthwhile. Proof-of-Work! Some might think of it as an early version of anti-spam measures we see now where you prove you’re human by picking images. In comes Adam Back who was undoubtedly quite annoyed with spam and developed the Hash Cash system in 1997. A long-time contributor to mailing lists, and annoyed things weren’t working better he found a code based solution. It has been used in other systems like fighting denial-of-service attacks, but originally was purposed for email. A user who wanted to contribute would need to compute, like Bitcoin Mining, the answer to a challenge, and the time spent made it far less feasible for garbage to get on lists even whilst having anonymous options. I propose Adam Back didn’t have a grand vision in mind, he was annoyed with his email use and that propelled the creation of Hash Cash. There were a number of attempts at digital currency prior to Bitcoin, and I think it’s worthwhile to note, many people were trying to solve this problem. There was the long running DigiCash company founded in 1989 by David Chaum , and E-gold . They unfortunately failed because of legislation, centralization, and market timing. Other notable figures include Nick Szabo, Len Sassaman , Wei Dai and so many more, all of which had some ties to anonymous remailers. I can’t list all of the contributors but needless to say nothing fully succeeded until Bitcoin. Fast forward to August 2004, and Hal Finney announces RPOW (Reusable Proof-of-Work). He describes it as, “[a] system [that] receives hashcash as a Proof of Work (POW) token, and in exchange creates RSA-signed tokens which I call Reusable Proof of Work (RPOW) tokens.” It’s starting to sound like Bitcoin. In fact if you browse through the slides for the project, you’ll see it’s very similar. I recommend you take a peak, even if you’re not a developer, they can be found on archive.org: https://web.archive.org/web/20090813003453/http://rpow.net:80/slides/slide001.html , The main site unfortunately went dead around the middle of 2010. Here Hal Finney is taking Hash Cash one step further and creating a token. Imagine you had two separate anonymous remailers and you didn’t want the individual to be forced to recreate a token, but also not have to register information to be tied to one. With a distributed token, a person could have an identity across numerous remailers. I believe this was a big part of the initial impetus Hal Finney pursued creating this system. Now it would be easy to assume Hal Finney is Satoshi here. There’s circumstantial evidence, and a lot of technical history. However, Hal Finney in my observation writes fast and loose c code. Bitcoin is C++ and has a lot of extra care for GUI, warnings and an altogether different commenting style. You can do your own comparison, https://github.com/trottier/original-bitcoin and https://web.archive.org/web/20090812224109/http://rpow.net:80/rpow-1.2.0.tar.gz . It took a lot of work porting RPOW, adding networking and a friendly GUI that allowed little technical knowledge to use Bitcoin. The second contributor to Bitcoin, Marti Malmi helped a lot with clean up, organization, and could have been a good pair for a programmer rusty with C++. Regardless the debate goes on, and I’m not sure we will or need to know. What’s important is, that the bulk of this effort came from trying to stop email spammers, not necessarily reinventing the world. A lot of the greatest inventors simply get annoyed with a problem and look for a more efficient and effective solution. So the punch line of this whole thing is without spammers there may never have been a Bitcoin, at least not as soon. Thanks Spam. Like what you read? Give Gavin Knight a round of applause.

Augur’s reputation token will also be delisted next month. The exchange made this decision after receiving a business improvement order from the country’s financial regulator following the NEM hack.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Coincheck Delisting 4 Cryptocurrencies\nFollowing reports that Coincheck was going to delist monero (XMR), zcash (ZEC), and dash (DASH), the exchange has now confirmed that those cryptocurrencies will be delisted along with Augur’s reputation token (REP).\nThe four cryptocurrencies will be delisted on June 18, Coincheck emphasized, adding:\nThe target currencies [XMR, ZEC, DASH, and REP] held on the discontinued date will be sold at the market price and converted into Japanese yen.\nThe sales’ proceeds will then be credited to the customers’ accounts. Before that date, customers can sell or transfer these cryptocurrencies. The exchange says it has received many transfer requests, warning that it may be several days to complete the transfers. Business Improvement Order\nFollowing the NEM hack in January, Coincheck received a business improvement order from the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) on March 8. The exchange is a “deemed dealer,” meaning it has been allowed to operate while its application is being reviewed by the agency. The exchange has now been acquired by Monex Group. After delisting the above cryptocurrencies, Coincheck will continue to support BTC, ETH, ETC, LSK, FCT, BCH, XRP, XEM, and LTC.\nIn complying with the FSA order, the exchange says it is “drastically reviewing” its internal control and management control systems, as well as rethinking its “management strategy that thoroughly protects customers,” the announcement reads, adding that:\nIt is necessary [for us] to further develop and strengthen the management system of AML / CFT [Anti-Money Laundering/ Counter-Terrorist Financing] in the future.\nMonex CEO Oki Matsumoto “expects the exchange to secure an official license in Japan next month,” Fortune reported on Friday. FSA Cracks Down on Privacy Coin Listings\nNikkei reported earlier this month that the FSA has set new criteria for crypto exchanges. One of them concerns the types of cryptocurrencies listed on exchanges. “Those granting a high level of anonymity and easily used for money laundering will as a general rule be banned,” the news outlet described.\nThe FSA “strongly requests money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures not only for Coincheck but also for other virtual currency exchange operators,” News24 wrote.\nOut of the 16 licensed crypto exchanges in Japan, none have listed XMR, ZEC, DASH, or REP on their applications with the FSA.\nWhat do you think of Coincheck delisting the four cryptocurrencies?

There was free beer served from an ID-validating dispenser, Warren Buffet was criticized for his “rat poison” view of cryptocurrency, and there were plenty of business announcements, including news from eToro, Netki, Bitmain and Circle. Catch up on these stories and more in this week’s Bitcoin Magazine review.\nFeatured stories by Amy Castor, Colin Harper and Kyle Torpey\nStay on top of the best stories in the bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. Subscribe to our newsletter here . Fred Wilson Explains Why Warren Buffett Doesn’t Get Bitcoin\nIn his 2018 annual shareholder meeting at Berkshire Hathaway recently, Warren Buffet referred to bitcoin as “rat poison.” Venture capitalists Fred Wilson and Balaji Srinivasan had a chat with Wall Street Journal reporter Paul Vigna on the mainstage of Consensus 2018. The pair of tech investors pointed out the differences between Buffett’s approach to investing and how the crypto asset market works. Civic Demos Proof of Concept With Beer Vending Machines, Launches ID Codes\nBlockchain identity verification platform Civic has emerged from Consensus 2018 with a project that imagines a network of validators and service providers who work together to verify individual identities. Conceptually, new users would put identity information on a smart contract that would get validated with references on the blockchain that attest to its validity. Then service providers can request to validate said information, which would streamline ID checks and help prevent against fraud.\nCivic showed a working proof of concept using their Civic app. Anyone verified on the platform can scan a QR code to prove that they’re of legal drinking age. In a partnership with Anheuser-Busch, Civic unveiled the vending machine at Consensus 2018, offering anyone who used it a free brew from the “world’s first crypto beer vending machine.” Digital Identity Company Netki Launches Investor Validation Solution\nLos Angeles based Netki just made it easier for companies launching token sales to onboard their customers in a way that supports compliance with existing security laws, using their digital identity confirmation platform. The company is adding investor validation to its existing know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) solution. The service allows investors to upload requisite documents via a web browser or mobile app. Compliance is a huge concern for ICO projects right now. Regulators are in the midst of trying to decide how to label virtual currencies, and it is looking as if they may rule that many existing tokens are non-compliant securities. Social Cryptocurrency Trading and Brokerage Firm eToro Is Expanding to U.S.\neToro is a regulated global brokerage firm located in Israel that trades in cryptocurrencies, stocks, commodities, ETFs and more. Having recently received $100 million in funding, the company is currently in talks with U.S. financial institutions, regulators and regulatory advisors, and has already registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The company is opening an office in New Jersey and plans launch a crypto wallet later this year. Bitmain Leads Circle’s $110 Million Round; Teams Up to Create Stable Coin\nBitmain continues to make news. The largest of the Bitcoin mining operations is putting its muscle behind mobile payments and cryptocurrency trading firm Circle by leading a $110 million Series E round of funding, the companies announced at Consensus this week.\nThey are also joining forces to create a “stablecoin,” a cryptocurrency that is pegged to a stable asset. The goal is to eventually have lots of stable tokens, all backed by different fiat currencies, managed by CENTRE, but the first will be Circle USD Coin (USDC), a coin backed one-to-one by the U.S. dollar with the fiat to be stored in an auditable bank account and redeemable by verified buyers.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://netki.com/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/digital-identity-company-netki-launches-investor-validation-solution/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/social-cryptocurrency-trading-and-brokerage-firm-etoro-expanding-us/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitmain-leads-circles-100-million-round-teams-create-stable-coin/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/civic-demos-proof-concept-beer-vending-machines-launches-id-codes/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/subscribe/", "https://www.civic.com/", "https://blog.circle.com/2018/05/15/circle-announces-usd-coin-bitmain-partnership-and-new-strategic-financing/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/fred-wilson-explains-why-warren-buffett-doesnt-get-bitcoin/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "warren buffet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balaji srinivasan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy castor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colin harper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyle torpey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul vigna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "big gathering bitcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine’s week", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockchain week", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T01:08:49.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5f6f46ce0a7d554dfb2b66252206d2c736824f40", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSbadRCM1Bf4fx1ZaIq6yPUUYP3EIWovh437.vkGjCTz57wwztyJYQqs2TPYTahof8twb5tnBxFW5", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Apple, Twitter Founders Upbeat on Future of Bitcoin and Blockchain", "title_full": "Apple, Twitter Founders Upbeat on Future of Bitcoin and Blockchain", "published": "2018-05-19T13:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5f6f46ce0a7d554dfb2b66252206d2c736824f40", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSbadRCM1Bf4fx1ZaIq6yPUUYP3EIWovh437.vkGjCTz57wwztyJYQqs2TPYTahof8twb5tnBxFW5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-19T13:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "Apple, Twitter Founders Upbeat on Future of Bitcoin and Blockchain", "text": "Apple, Twitter Founders Upbeat on Future of Bitcoin and Blockchain\n/u/dragonstail1111\nsubmitted by /u/dragonstail1111\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T13:31:45.036+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "16d3a3efb7821cad9a203915ac0705096f485660", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ463V08y.PCdP0_.YokRQMI2A--", "site_full": "programadores.esforos.com", "site": "esforos.com", "site_section": "http://programadores.esforos.com/./viewforum.php?f=21", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Modem - PROGRAMADORES", "title": "Bitcoin was crashed with XEvil program!", "title_full": "Bitcoin was crashed with XEvil program!

After some early bad press attached to criminals using the coins, Bitcoin has started to be seen on its own merits as a rare technological advance that might actually upend the traditional way of doing things. Instead of relying on banks and other financial institutions to help us with our every financial move, we can use Bitcoin and eliminate all of that, dealing with people on a one-to-one basis without any meddling from a third party. It is an exciting prospect, and that is what has driven the stunning rise in the value of the coins, making many investors rich in the process.\nOf course, the old adage says that what goes up, must come down, and in the case of Bitcoin, investors are leery that it could be reaching the point where it is forming a proverbial bubble that could pop at any second. If you wish to invest in Bitcoin but are concerned about these signs and warnings, you should consider the assistance of a robot trader such as Bitcoin Code to help you sort it all out and proceed with caution when investing in these volatile coins. As for the bubble, you first have to understand what constitutes it and whether or not Bitcoin’s rise really fits the model.\n1. What Is It?\nA bubble is a proverbial term used by investors and market watchers when an asset is being driven up in value without any real reason behind it. Investors talk about fundamentals, which are the core characteristics of an asset that make it worthwhile. A bubble occurs when the value rises in the absence of these fundamentals to back it all up. People who are excited about the rising price jump on board to catch the wave, further inflating the bubble. The ultimate fear is that the asset will be exposed for the hollow shell it is, and the price will plummet and damage all of the investors. Why Bitcoin Could Be A Bubble\nThe concern about Bitcoin is that people are investing in it without having even the slightest understanding of what it is and what it does. Investors are reading stories about others of their kind getting rich and don’t want to miss out. But they haven’t studied anything about Bitcoin to see if it deserves investment backing. Why It Probably Isn’t\nThe funny thing is that these late-coming investors might actually be stumbling into something great. Because Bitcoin is based on sound technology, known as the blockchain , that does indeed the remove for financial supervision on the part of banks and the like. And it is also something that makes sense for people looking to eliminate unnecessary fees, protect their identities, and generally take back control of their personal finances. That is a fundamentally sound investment if ever there were one.\nThere certainly could be a time when Bitcoin’s value gets inflated beyond all reason. But we haven’t approached that point by a long shot, and the bubble doesn’t look like it will burst, or even form, anytime soon.

What is the Swiss Alps Energy ?\nSwiss Alps Energy AG is the first company with a revolutinary solution to save up to 50% of its electricity costs by using mining cubes powered exclusively by renewable energy and ORC recovery of waste heat from the mining equipment. This represents a solution for a global problem facing the industry. The much lower boiling point of water at high altitudes where the cubes are positioned makes energy recovery considerably more efficient. This makes mining significantly more profitable, protects Swiss cultural heritage, and saves energy.\nSwiss Alps Energy AG (SAE) is a distributed ledger-based energy supplier and an operator of flexible modular mining infrastructures that are intended for long-term stationary use. Thereby, SAE preserves unused buildings in the Swiss alps and uses them sensibly and without interference with either building structure or the environment.\nSwiss Alps Energy AG is Swiss Alps Mining & Energy’s operating business. Members of the team come from fields such as blockchain technology, crypto currency mining and hyperledger applications developers and specialists, as well as civil engineers, infrastructure engineers, and energy experts.The team has successfully developed and launched several products, solutions and applications based on the blockchain technology. The company is currently going through the application phase in order to become a member of a Swiss self-regulatory organization (SRO).\na. Story\nThe blockchain community worldwide faces strong headwinds due to the very energy-intensive mining process of crypto currencies and blockchain-based business applications. At the same time, in the Swiss alps, thousands of unused structures are disintegrating due to the fact that today’s spatial planning law does not allow for residential use of these buildings.\nSwiss Alps Mining & Energy connects these two worlds by offering environmentally friendly mining facilities in unused buildings in the Swiss alps, powered by renewable energy only.\nb. Company\nSwiss Alps Energy AG (SAE) is a distributed ledger-based energy supplier and an operator of flexible modular mining infrastructures that are intended for long-term stationary use. Thereby, SAE preserves unused buildings in the Swiss alps and uses them sensibly and without interference with either building structure or the environment.\nSwiss Alps Energy AG is Swiss Alps Mining & Energy’s operating business. Members of the team come from fields such as blockchain technology, crypto currency mining and hyperledger applications developers and specialists, as well as civil engineers, infrastructure engineers, and energy experts.The team has successfully developed and launched several products, solutions and applications based on the blockchain technology. The company is currently going through the application phase in order to become a member of a Swiss self-regulatory organization (SRO).\nc. Business model\nA sophisticated modular cube system allows Swiss Alps Energy AG (SAE) to build and implement prefabricated dust-protected mining components on-site. Ideal natural temperature conditions enable easy cooling of the mining facilities, which leads to a reduction of energy consumption of up to 30% in comparison to comparable installations. The flexible and modular mining cubes provide cutting-edge automation and\nrequire little maintenance. The individual cubes communicate with the central management platform, which in turn monitors the cubes and assigns to each cube the optimal parameter in order to maximize mining for maximum profit.SAE will rent out entire cubes or individual mining capacities from the SAM Cubes – while at the same time guaranteeing highly energy efficient and cost competitive mining. SAE will also give competitors and/or individual persons the possibility to rent mining facilities, and the power needed can be paid in SAM tokens.\n2. Swiss Alps operation\nSwiss Alps Mining & Energy is the first company in the world to use an ORC system to recover electricity from the waste heat generated by mining systems. The placement of the mining facilities in the Swiss Alps takes advantage of the fact that water has a lower boiling point at these altitudes, resulting in a much more efficient recovery of electricity from heat. Since the mining systems at these sites do not require additional cooling by air conditioning systems, the SAM cubes power consumption can be reduced by up to 50% compared to conventional mining systems. With this unique approach, SAM is solving a global problem in the field of mining.\n3. Roadmap\nAfter the initial development of SAE’s infrastructure and business activities in Switzerland, the expansion into foreign countries, especially in the area of renewable energies, is conceivable and desirable. The ability to pay by using crypto currencies and the settlement process via smart contracts is another novelty that can further help SAE to become the industry leader in the field of blockchain-based business models.\n4. Team\nThe Smart Mining Company – Connecting the world of blockchain with environmentally friendly mining in unused buildings in the Swiss alps. Swiss Alps Mining & Energy strives to enable environmentally friendly mining of crypto currencies in the Swiss alps. Swiss Alps Energy AG (SAE) is Swiss Alps Mining & Energy’s operating business. SAE is a Swiss startup company in the area of crypto mining and energy, located in Huenenberg, Canton of Zug.\n5. Token\nThe fact that SAM Power Plants operate with blockchain-based contract solutions enables the purchase as well as the settlement of transactions by means of crypto currencies and smart contracts. All services provided by SAE as well as the purchase of power and cubes can be paid in SAM tokens.\nA total of 239’682’53813 Sam tokens (100%) will be issued on the Ethereum blockchain using a smart contract. Sam will comply with the ERC20 standard and will be freely transferable on the Ethereum platform. These\ntokens will be the only Sam ever issued.\nOf this total:\n• 14’583’333 Sam (6.0844%) will be sold in the forthcoming token pre-sale. SAE aims to raise $5 in this initial funding round. Subsequent token sales will be made at significantly higher\nprices.\n• 65’178’571 Sam (68.9156%) will be reserved for the main token sale and for future token sales and activities (see below).\n• 23’968’250 Sam (10%) will be reserved for the founding team and partners, of which 16’777’775 (70% of the 23’968’250) will not be tradeable for one year.\n• 19’174’600 Sam (8%) will be reserved for early angel token owners and advisors, of which 11’504’760 (60% of the 19’174’600) will not be tradeable for 3 years.\n• 4’793’650 Sam (2%) will be reserved for bounty campaigns.\n• 11’984’125 Sam (5%) will be reserved for future contributors\nTOKEN DETAILS\nTicker: SAM\nType: Utility-token\nToken Standard: ERC-20\nAdditional Token Emission: No\nToken price in USD: 1 Token = 0.8 USD\nAccepted Currencies: BTC, ETH, USD\nBonus Program: Token Price:\nPre-ICO Tier 1 – $0.30\nPre-ICO Tier 2 – $0.40\nICO Tier 1 – $0.50\nICO Tier 2 – $0.60\nICO Tier 3 – $0.70\nICO Tier 4 – $0.80\nToken distribution:\n50.6% – ICO\n9.4% – Pre-ICO\n25% – Founders, Partners\n8% – Early Angel Token Owners, Advisors\n2% – Bounty\n5% – Future Contributors\nFunds allocation:\n60% – Mining Facilities, Hydropower Plants\n18% – Administration, Salaries, Rent\n10% – Marketing and Promotion Expenditures\n5% – Workshop (Cube Construction)\n5% – Development, Blockchain, Certification\n2% – Legal Costs\n6.
