The app will allow users to pair their phones with goTenna’s portable antennas in order to broadcast transactions.\ngoTenna produces consumer-grade hardware to facilitate mesh networking — a concept that echoes much of the decentralization ethos that we see across the cryptocurrency domain — which operates by allowing peers to connect directly to one another for the purpose of routing packets, sidestepping the need to rely on an ISP or cell tower.\n“What will happen when these massive centralized networks fail due to natural disasters, as they did after Hurricane Sandy in 2012, or due to some kind of outside cybersecurity attack? What will happen when providers decide to crank up prices just because they can?” said Rich Myers, goTenna’s Decentralized Applications Engineer.\n“Mesh networks are the only legitimate alternative to these traditional centralized communication networks. They are completely decentralized and democratized, leaving the power of communication in the hands of the people. Beyond that, they are much more resilient to unforeseen disasters — the only thing these networks need to function is a mesh networking device paired with a smartphone.”\nFor its part, Samourai Wallet has been focusing on censorship resistance and privacy-oriented tools since it began in 2015. With features such as direct interaction with trusted nodes, added hops to circumvent chain analysis, and SMS commands for remotely wiping wallets, it has seen widespread adoption by users wishing to incorporate an additional level of privacy into their Bitcoin transactions.\nSamourai has been curating Mule.tools , an R&D initiative to further reinforce the censorship-resistant properties of the Bitcoin blockchain and also published the code for Pony Direct , a proof-of-concept app for broadcasting transactions over SMS in January.\n“We believe one of the most fundamental value propositions that bitcoin provides is censorship resistance,” SW, the CEO of Samourai, told Bitcoin Magazine . “The freedom to transact freely and without permission is not a freedom to take lightly, or give up without a fight. We saw the open internet transform into a walled garden, captured by regulatory and corporate interest working together — and largely aided by red-herrings like ‘net-neutrality.’\n“The tools we are building arm the little guy — the individual — with the tools they need to level the playing field against the inevitable overstepping of bounds by hostile actors, oppressive regimes and overzealous governments,” said SW. “We're making some material changes to Samourai Wallet to allow for a greater high latency and offline experience. In conjunction with the release of txTenna, Samourai Wallet users will be able to theoretically keep their phone offline at all times and still be able to send and receive payments with minimal hassle.”\nThe concept explored by txTenna follows in the path of alternate methods to access the blockchain, previously seen with both the Blockstream Satellite and in the works of Nick Szabo and Elaine Ou. Not only does it provide more versatility to those wishing to avoid using censored systems, but it opens up a slew of use cases for Bitcoin in regions with less-developed infrastructures and those affected by natural disasters.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine . ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : bitcoinmagazine.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://www.gotenna.com/", "https://github.com/MuleTools/PonyDirect", "https://github.com/blockstream/satellite", "https://samouraiwallet.com/", "https://youtu.be/QkYXPJMqBNk?t=4968"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "samourai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samourai wallet", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T04:06:51.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bf30da0f02f5b2c8f5bea7b6bf5a62405e2e72d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWSUKtEk4sQ4venLwVj1tytcz6YsnTawNa7fKLxMY2IhyxxWMYIXyv7_JU0UhEeFU-", "site_full": "www.investopedia.com", "site": "investopedia.com", "site_section": "http://www.investopedia.com/feedbuilder/feed/getFeed?feedName=rss_headline", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "rss_headline", "title": "Bitcoin Wallet", "title_full": "Bitcoin Wallet", "published": "2018-05-14T23:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.investopedia.com/inv/genericcontentimages/all-purpose/thinkstockphotos_80410231.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 854, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 15, "comments": 0, "shares": 15}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bf30da0f02f5b2c8f5bea7b6bf5a62405e2e72d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWSUKtEk4sQ4venLwVj1tytcz6YsnTawNa7fKLxMY2IhyxxWMYIXyv7_JU0UhEeFU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Prableen Bajpai, CFA (ICFAI)", "published": "2018-05-14T23:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Wallet", "text": "HD Wallet (Hierarchical Deterministic ... BREAKING DOWN 'Bitcoin Wallet'\nA Bitcoin wallet is also referred to as a digital Wallet. Establishing such a wallet is an important step in the process of obtaining Bitcoins. Just as Bitcoins are the digital equivalent of cash, a Bitcoin wallet is analogous to a physical wallet. But instead of storing Bitcoins literally, what is stored is a lot of relevant information like the secure private key used to access Bitcoin addresses and carry out transactions. The four main types of wallet are desktop, mobile, web and hardware.\n[ Setting up a Bitcoin wallet is just the first step when investing in or trading the cryptocurrency. If you're interested in learning more, Investopedia's Crypto Trading Course provides an in-depth overview of cryptocurrency trading, covering topics ranging from wallet setup to technical analysis strategies. You'll learn everything you need to know to get started from a Wall Street veteran that has become a premier cryptocurrency trader. ]\nDesktop wallets are installed on a desktop computer and provide the user with complete control over the wallet. Desktop wallets enable the user to create a Bitcoin address for sending and receiving the Bitcoins. They also allow the user to store a private key. A few known desktop wallets are Bitcoin Core, MultiBit, Armory, Hive OS X, Electrum, etc.\nMobile wallets overcome the handicap of desktop wallets, as the latter are fixed in one place. These take the form of paid apps on youOnce you run the app on your smartphone, the wallet can carry out the same functions as a desktop wallet, and help you pay directly from your mobile from anywhere. Thus a mobile wallet facilitates in making payments in physical stores by using \"touch-to-pay\" via NFC scanning a QR code. Bitcoin Wallet, Hive Android and Mycelium Bitcoin Wallet are few of the mobile wallets. Bitcoin wallets do not generally work on both iOS and Android systems. It's advisable to research your preferred mobile Bitcoin wallet as several malware softwares posing as Bitcoin wallets can be\nAs for web wallets, they allow you to use Bitcoins from anywhere, on any browser or mobile. The selection of your web wallet must be done carefully since it stores your private keys online. Coinbase and Blockchain are popular web wallet providers.\nHardware wallets are by far the most secure kind of Bitcoin wallet, as they store Bitcoins on a physical piece of equipment, generally plugged into a computer via a USB port. They are all but immune to virus attacks and very few instances of Bitcoin theft have been reported. These devices are the only Bitcoin wallets which aren't free, and they often cost $100 to $200.\nKeeping your Bitcoin wallet safe is essential as Bitcoin wallets represent high-value targets for hackers. Some safeguards include: encrypting the wallet with a strong password, and choosing the cold storage option i.e. storing it offline. It's also advisable to frequently back up your desktop and mobile wallets, as problems with the wallet software on your computer or mobile device could erase your holdings.

Bitcoin Visionary Marco Streng Weighs Into Bitcoin and Blockchain SHARE ON: 87978293 - cryptocurrency golden bitcoin coin. conceptual image for crypto currency, toned\nLast week I had the opportunity to sit down with Marco Streng, the wunderkind bitcoin visionary behind Genesis Mining. Genesis, as many of you reading this might know, is the world’s largest cloud bitcoin mining company, with over 2 million customers worldwide. It calls Iceland home, whose cool climate and affordable green energy are ideal for mining newly minted virgin cryptocurrencies. Last year, Genesis helped connect the blockchain sector and traditional capital markets by partnering with HIVE Blockchain Technologies, the first publicly traded digital currency mining firm.\nThis week, Marco will be one of the panelists at the Consensus 2018 blockchain technology summit in New York, which I will also be attending. Below are highlights from our conversation.\nTell us how you got started in this industry.\nI’ve always had a passion for mathematics, science, physics. I wanted to understand how nature works. I used to spend days and nights in the library, and I was actually on my way to becoming a math professor.\nBut then blockchain and bitcoin came along, and that changed everything. At the time, the community was very small, but the ideas and visions were very big. No one fully realized then how fast it would all grow or just how revolutionary it could end up being. I watched as new marketplaces began to emerge, businesses began to bet on bitcoin and people started adopting it. More and more exchanges popped up. All of this happened within a year of me first reading about blockchain and bitcoin—it progressed that quickly.\nIt was clear that something big was happening. The world was changing, and I needed to be part of it.\nHow would you describe bitcoin to someone who knew nothing about it?\nWith bitcoin, you can send money anywhere in the world to anywhere else without worrying about boundaries or having the transaction controlled or stopped by a third party. It’s a completely independent, decentralized, peer-to-peer system. This is what makes it so revolutionary.\nThe conventional banking system really shows its limitations when we try to move money between developed and underdeveloped countries, particularly those in Africa. There are some serious inefficiencies that, frankly, many of the big banks just aren’t interested in fixing. But with bitcoin, you don’t have to worry about that. You can send money to, say, a coffee farmer in Africa, and he’ll receive it directly.\nMoney transfers are only one among a number of many other uses. Bitcoin is also a store of value. It’s one of the few assets that I would say are uncorrelated to the broader financial markets.\nAs for blockchain, it has innumerable world-changing applications across a wide range of industries. That’s why I believe it’s crucial that people have the right information about blockchain and understand it. If people don’t understand it, and it gets overhyped, I’m afraid it could start going in the wrong direction.\nWe recently mined the 17 millionth bitcoin, leaving only four million left. Explain why it becomes exponentially more difficult to mine coins the closer we get to that 21 million-coin ceiling.\nIt’s not that the mining itself becomes more difficult. To answer this, I think we have to look at two components.\nOne component is the daily supply of bitcoin. At the moment, only 1,800 bitcoins can be generated every day by the whole network, meaning all the miners worldwide. But it’s important to remember that after every 210,000 blocks that are mined, the rewards are halved. What this means is that after the next halving, which I believe is expected sometime in 2020, the number of bitcoins mined a day will fall from 1,800 to 900. And then after the next halving, it’ll be 450. This helps reduce the supply in a natural way.\nThe second component is a measure of how many miners and how much computing power is in the network. If more miners come online, then of course the competition becomes greater. Because the daily supply is already fixed, your market share shrinks.\nThink of it like the California Gold Rush. Mining gold at first was relatively easy because the metal was plentiful and there were few miners. By the end, it became more difficult because the easy gold had already been claimed, and you were competing with far more miners. We’re seeing the same thing happen with bitcoin and other mineable digital currencies.\nSpeaking of computing power, HIVE Blockchain just announced that it expanded to 24.2 megawatts (MW), up from 2.4 MW in August. What’s next in the pipeline for HIVE?\nYes, the last expansion was a massive build-out in Sweden. It was done in three phases. I think this was a remarkable achievement for HIVE, that it could add so much computing power so quickly.\nThis is only the beginning. The year is still long and you can expect to see some bigger expansions on the way. In September, for example, we’re going to ramp up another bitcoin mining facility worth 20 MW, which is very exciting. And from there it goes even further.\nG20 finance ministers are scheduled to share their plans for more uniform regulation of cryptocurrencies by July. What are your expectations?\nI personally think that this is very good and that it will bring more professionalism into the market. The momentum and adoption has grown so much and so rapidly that there really needs to be some kind of strategy—the world’s economic leaders can’t just leave this space untouched. Anyone who believes otherwise isn’t facing reality.\nHaving said that, regulating this market will not be easy because it’s in a whole other dimension than anything that has come before it. As an analogy, imagine someone trying to regulate flying cars using the same measures that have been written for cars driving on the street. It wouldn’t make any sense. So there will certainly need to be some innovation to get it right. I think it’s also important that the regulators talk to the right people, the industry leaders. They have good input, and I think it could be a very fruitful dialogue.\nAlong those same lines, South Korea’s central bank just announced that it was looking seriously into how the Korean economy might use blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Specifically, there’s talk of the country going cashless by 2020. Do you think that’s where the global financial systems are headed?\nI think there’s a natural incentive for governments to go in that direction because, of course, they want to have greater control over their economies. But as is the case with overregulation, too many controls—or going completely cashless—could be harmful to the economy. This is certainly part of a long and interesting debate, and I’m curious to see how it plays out, in South Korea and elsewhere.\nWhere do you see the best application of blockchain technology right now?\nBlockchain’s greatest contribution is its ability to erase boundaries. It completely removes the element of trust—or distrust, I should say—and adds a stabilizing effect to nearly every industry because of decentralization.\nTake the global banking industry, for example. You don’t need to look far to find some serious inefficiencies, as I mentioned earlier. We’re already seeing some very concrete instances where blockchain can be of help here. The banks recognize this and are getting together to make use of this technology to improve their services.\nWhat’s been the greatest challenge you’ve faced so far in your journey?\nFor me, the greatest challenge can usually be found in the moment that you’re currently in. I always compare this industry to the beginning of the internet—no one knew where it was headed or what it would eventually look like. Most people had a general idea that it was innovative and could benefit the world, but the full implications were unclear.\nSimilarly, no one knows where blockchain and cryptocurrencies might take us, and having to deal with this constant uncertainty is, I’ll admit, not trivial. You must always be prepared to act quickly in response to another bitcoin fork, a hack or some other unexpected event. These are things that keep you up at night.\nBut it’s exciting. I think what history has shown again and again is that it’s dangerous to be ignorant and to not have an open mind. Not everything was euphoric and wonderful when the internet first emerged. Problems still occur online, but I believe most people would agree that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.\nNo industry is without its challenges, and as long as you’re willing to address them, it can be very rewarding.

The app will allow users to pair their phones with goTenna's portable antennas in order to broadcast transactions.\ngoTenna produces consumer-grade hardware to facilitate mesh networking — a concept that echoes much of the decentralization ethos that we see across the cryptocurrency domain — which operates by allowing peers to connect directly to one another for the purpose of routing packets, sidestepping the need to rely on an ISP or cell tower.\n\"What will happen when these massive centralized networks fail due to natural disasters, as they did after Hurricane Sandy in 2012, or due to some kind of outside cybersecurity attack? What will happen when providers decide to crank up prices just because they can?\" said Rich Myers, goTenna's Decentralized Applications Engineer.\n\"Mesh networks are the only legitimate alternative to these traditional centralized communication networks. They are completely decentralized and democratized, leaving the power of communication in the hands of the people. Beyond that, they are much more resilient to unforeseen disasters — the only thing these networks need to function is a mesh networking device paired with a smartphone.\"\nFor its part, Samourai Wallet has been focusing on censorship resistance and privacy-oriented tools since it began in 2015. With features such as direct interaction with trusted nodes, added hops to circumvent chain analysis, and SMS commands for remotely wiping wallets, it has seen widespread adoption by users wishing to incorporate an additional level of privacy into their Bitcoin transactions.\nSamourai has been curating Mule.tools , an R&D initiative to further reinforce the censorship-resistant properties of the Bitcoin blockchain and also published the code for Pony Direct , a proof-of-concept app for broadcasting transactions over SMS in January.\n\"We believe one of the most fundamental value propositions that bitcoin provides is censorship resistance,\" SW, the CEO of Samourai, told Bitcoin Magazine . \"The freedom to transact freely and without permission is not a freedom to take lightly, or give up without a fight. We saw the open internet transform into a walled garden, captured by regulatory and corporate interest working together — and largely aided by red-herrings like 'net-neutrality.'\n\"The tools we are building arm the little guy — the individual — with the tools they need to level the playing field against the inevitable overstepping of bounds by hostile actors, oppressive regimes and overzealous governments,\" said SW. \"We're making some material changes to Samourai Wallet to allow for a greater high latency and offline experience. In conjunction with the release of txTenna, Samourai Wallet users will be able to theoretically keep their phone offline at all times and still be able to send and receive payments with minimal hassle.\"\nThe concept explored by txTenna follows in the path of alternate methods to access the blockchain, previously seen with both the Blockstream Satellite and in the works of Nick Szabo and Elaine Ou. Not only does it provide more versatility to those wishing to avoid using censored systems, but it opens up a slew of use cases for Bitcoin in regions with less-developed infrastructures and those affected by natural disasters.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\nBitcoin Magazine ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matthew breen samourai wall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samourai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rich myers", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T23:14:43.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "af2a2c57fe6c41b5d0a2e137db5805affb8608a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQLaZAXBJY1YouJ10nYWf84-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "bitcoin: is it the coin of the future ?", "title_full": "bitcoin: is it the coin of the future ?", "published": "2018-05-14T23:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "af2a2c57fe6c41b5d0a2e137db5805affb8608a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQLaZAXBJY1YouJ10nYWf84-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Thian778", "published": "2018-05-14T23:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin: is it the coin of the future ?", "text": "Gold replaces the system of transaction tools, and paper money replaces gold.

The app will allow users to pair their phones with goTenna’s portable antennas in order to broadcast transactions.\ngoTenna produces consumer-grade hardware to facilitate mesh networking — a concept that echoes much of the decentralization ethos that we see across the cryptocurrency domain — which operates by allowing peers to connect directly to one another for the purpose of routing packets, sidestepping the need to rely on an ISP or cell tower.\n“What will happen when these massive centralized networks fail due to natural disasters, as they did after Hurricane Sandy in 2012, or due to some kind of outside cybersecurity attack? What will happen when providers decide to crank up prices just because they can?” said Rich Myers, goTenna’s Decentralized Applications Engineer.\n“Mesh networks are the only legitimate alternative to these traditional centralized communication networks. They are completely decentralized and democratized, leaving the power of communication in the hands of the people. Beyond that, they are much more resilient to unforeseen disasters — the only thing these networks need to function is a mesh networking device paired with a smartphone.”\nFor its part, Samourai Wallet has been focusing on censorship resistance and privacy-oriented tools since it began in 2015. With features such as direct interaction with trusted nodes, added hops to circumvent chain analysis, and SMS commands for remotely wiping wallets, it has seen widespread adoption by users wishing to incorporate an additional level of privacy into their Bitcoin transactions.\nSamourai has been curating Mule.tools , an R&D initiative to further reinforce the censorship-resistant properties of the Bitcoin blockchain and also published the code for Pony Direct , a proof-of-concept app for broadcasting transactions over SMS in January.\n“We believe one of the most fundamental value propositions that bitcoin provides is censorship resistance,” SW, the CEO of Samourai, told Bitcoin Magazine . “The freedom to transact freely and without permission is not a freedom to take lightly, or give up without a fight. We saw the open internet transform into a walled garden, captured by regulatory and corporate interest working together — and largely aided by red-herrings like ‘net-neutrality.’\n“The tools we are building arm the little guy — the individual — with the tools they need to level the playing field against the inevitable overstepping of bounds by hostile actors, oppressive regimes and overzealous governments,” said SW. “We’re making some material changes to Samourai Wallet to allow for a greater high latency and offline experience.

All the cryptos have CRASHED. Good call!” Source: Shutterstock\nI didn’t address the crypto situation much as it unfolded because I didn’t want readers mistakenly buying into the bubble. Now that the air has come out of the crypto-mania, I hope it’s safe to talk about the real opportunity.\nI’m not talking about Bitcoin. I’m talking about the blockchain – and the dividend growth opportunities that will unfold as this “megatrend” plays out in the coming years and decades.\nThe blockchain is the nascent technology that serves as the backbone for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Today, I’m going to introduce you to five pioneering income plays that boast a “blockchain kicker.”\nFirst, a quick primer on blockchain.\nThe simplest way to describe the technology is to call it a digital ledger of sorts. It’s essentially just a group of encrypted records (“blocks”) that can be used to record transactions and other interactions.\nThe utilization of blockchain that people are most familiar with are cryptocurrencies – products such as Bitcoin that are meant to serve as digital currencies, but have quickly become extremely speculative investments as they’ve gained thousands of percent in just a few years. But companies are increasingly learning that blockchain can be used for so much more, from tracing medical histories to keeping voting records.\nAs a result, companies from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM ) to Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC )and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS ) are becoming increasingly involved in trying to exploit this technology. That has given rise to a few exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on this space, including one that’s surprisingly rife with dividend growth names. Compare Brokers Bitcoin Bubble Created These 5 Dividend Growth Buys: Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF (BLCN)\nThe Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF (NASDAQ: BLCN )is a portfolio of companies expected to benefit from blockchain in some way, with the stocks actually graded by their “potential for increased economic profit, operational efficiencies, and transformational business practices.” In short, it holds “companies working to utilize and incorporate blockchain technologies into their businesses.”\nWhat fascinates me about this fund, however, is the dividend growth potential in some of its component stocks.\nReality Shares’ BLCN is a deviation from its main focus: income. The ETF provider boasts another quartet of funds, all of which hold dividend stocks, and three of which are centered around the company’s proprietary “DIVCON” system.\nThe DIVCON system essentially measures a stock’s dividend health, assigning a score of 1 to 5, “where DIVCON 5 indicates the highest probability for a dividend increase and DIVCON 1 the highest probability for a dividend cut.”\nAnd right now, this system is flashing a ringing endorsement for five blockchain-linked stocks, which are all at “DIVCON 5.” In other words, they’re in the best position for dividend growth going forward: Bitcoin Bubble Created These 5 Dividend Growth Buys: Visa Inc (V)\nDividend Yield: 0.6% BLCN Weight: 1.39%\nA stock like Visa Inc (NYSE: V ) that yields just 0.6% hardly screams “income opportunity,” but it is. Visa has juiced its payout by 154% in five years. But it’s not just a prolific dividend grower – it’s a perfect example of the share-price growth you should expect when a company puts its shareholders first via increasingly generous cash payments. As Visa’s Dividend Goes, So Does Its Price\nVisa already is elbow-deep in blockchain. The company launched a pilot phase of a blockchain-based B2B payments service called B2B Connect last year in partnership with banks in the U.S., South Korea, Singapore and the Philippines.\nThe service will allow institutions to make payments to one another directly, and the second phase of the project is expected to go live later this year. Bitcoin Bubble Created These 5 Dividend Growth Buys: MasterCard Inc (MA)\nDividend Yield: 0.5% BLCN Weight: 1.40%\nVisa rival MasterCard Inc (NYSE: MA ) also has its hands in blockchain, making its moves through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In early April, the credit-card processing company filed a patent to help verify and store identity data on a blockchain system.\nLater in the month, it filed another patent, this time to create “fast track flags” within the blockchain that would allow nodes (any electronic device that performs a task within the blockchain network) to more quickly verify data, making the system work more efficiently. MasterCard (MA) Has Some Catching Up to Do – in a Good Way\nMasterCard might be an even more intriguing opportunity. While Visa’s share price and dividend growth have been roughly in line, MA shares – despite more than tripling over the past year – still haven’t caught up with the pace of the dividend, which has quadrupled and then some over the same time frame. Bitcoin Bubble Created These 5 Dividend Growth Buys: Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN)\nDividend Yield: 2.2% BLCN Weight: 2.04%\nTexas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ: TXN ) isn’t exactly known for being the flashiest of chip stocks. Its analog chips and embedded processors, which make up 80%-plus of revenues, are found in some of the simplest of devices, from calculators to alarm clocks. But they have a wide array of uses, from appliances to displays to motors drives and even avionics. Source: VEX Robotics via Flickr\nThe company is increasingly delving into more cutting-edge technologies, however, such as the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence.\nAnd its position as a chipmaker also puts it square in the world of enabling the devices that make the blockchain possible.\nThat said, TXN’s positioning in the less glamorous world of analog chips makes it a cash cow with the few companies that even want to compete with it. And Texas Instruments makes good use of that cash, more than doubling its dividend over the past five years. Bitcoin Bubble Created These 5 Dividend Growth Buys: Intuit Inc. (INTU)\nDividend Yield: 0.8% BLCN Weight: 1.31%\nIf the blockchain acts as a ledger of sorts, what better company to research its applications than Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ: INTU )– the well-known purveyor of accounting software such as TurboTax and QuickBooks.\nIntuit clearly spells out the blockchain opportunity in a post about the technology’s potential:\n“Some accounting and auditing firms already embrace blockchain technology. Blockchain transactions are simpler, more visible, and more transparent. Improvements in operational efficiency mean that much of the work accountants do, such as collecting and inputting data, sampling, and proving provenance, takes place automatically. This leaves accountants more time to provide valuable services to their clients.”\nAgain, this is another prolific dividend grower that has more than doubled its quarterly dole in five years. And its DIVCON rating of 5 implies that INTU is well-armed enough to continue the upward march. Intuit (INTU): Self-Service Taxes, Full-Service Dividends Bitcoin Bubble Created These 5 Dividend Growth Buys: Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)\nDividend Yield: 0.3% BLCN Weight: 2.06%\nOne of BLCN’s most exciting holdings is also one of the “healthiest” from a dividend perspective.\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ), maker of high-performance chips, is among the stocks most commonly connected with the booming blockchain technology. That’s because its GPUs are widely used by cryptocurrency “miners,” who need extremely powerful computers to do the processing necessary to generate new digital tokens. Source: Shutterstock\nIn fact, demand is so intense that Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang recently said the company needs to crank out more of the GPUs to catch up, as video gamers (Nvidia’s bread-and-butter market) are finding it difficult to procure the graphics chips their advanced games require.\nThe sky seems the limit, then, for its blockchain potential, and the same goes for NVDA’s income opportunity. Because despite the fact Nvidia has powered up its dividend by 76% since 2014, it currently boasts a mere 11% payout ratio.\nThat’s a large reason why Nvidia boasts DIVCON’s top score of dividend health, and why investors should be licking their chops over this dual-threat stock going forward. How to Earn 12% Annual Returns For Life!\nRobust dividend growth separates the winners from the losers.\nAnd I’m not just talking about the stocks.\nLow dividend growth goes hand-in-hand with slow and no growth – and even eventual decay. Hitch your wagon to the supposedly “safe” blue chips that most financial pundits shill for, and you’ll quickly be looking for part-time work a few years into your retirement.\nIf you want to retire fully funded and worry-free, it’ll take more – a lot more. In fact, it’ll take 12% in safe, annual returns.\nThat sounds impossible, but it’s not. It takes a special kind of portfolio that offers high current yield, and dividend growth, and the potential for double-digit capital gains in some years. But after months of research and weeding out numerous “ticking yield bombs,” I’ve identified a handful of stocks and funds that check all those boxes.\nThese stock picks will each reap at least 12% in annual returns – the magic number you need to meet to ensure the worry-free retirement you’ve labored so hard for decades to reach.\nMy “12% for Life” portfolio ditches pundit favorites such as Exxon Mobil, Coca-Cola or General Mills – yes, the same General Mills that has lost a quarter of its value this year! – and relies on these kind of picks instead: One stock that has juiced its dividend 800%-plus in just four years, and has at least another decade of double-digit growth ahead of it! A high-growth, high-yield “double threat” stock that threw off 252% gains the last time it was this cheap. A 9%-plus payer that hikes its payout multiple times a year, and is on track to double its payout by 2021!\nIncome. Dividend growth. Capital gains. Even nest egg protection. This all-weather portfolio is a diversified powerhouse that provides three times more income than most retirement experts say you need , while being built to be more durable against retirement-shattering downturns like in 2007-09.\nI don’t want you to ever have to worry about how you’ll pay next month’s bills in retirement. With this portfolio, you won’t have to. In fact, you’ll be able to pay all your monthly expenses from dividend income alone, with enough left over for the convertible, the new master bedroom or the island vacation – all those extras you should be enjoying in retirement.\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2018/05/bitcoin-bubble-created-5-dividend-growth-buys-ggsyn/.\n©2018 InvestorPlace Media, LLC", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://contrarianoutlook.com/new-12-for-life/NM-CTA051118KW", "http://rdf.data-vocabulary.org/#"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brett owens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shutterstock", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "contrarian outlook my college buddy ac", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T00:13:03.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ee6d85679912d64f0a1f194902835c46d6cb6a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFQ8d3TjIDN6VbJupjLRWSwaBoqjkqBflAHq7rKhBfrtmCOoKb98YBrHpfzUVnIKCVD8OHjmDqC17TVKWAq6jxR78Bx762cV_1CjP39rGQrjNNIlcuUpo7.fs6ojxyxCQc8-", "site_full": "forextv.com", "site": "forextv.com", "site_section": "http://forextv.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "retirement_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "ForexTV", "title": "Dispatches from the ‘Coachella of Bitcoin’: Lamborghinis, crypto-jewelry, and fake protests", "title_full": "Dispatches from the ‘Coachella of Bitcoin’: Lamborghinis, crypto-jewelry, and fake protests", "published": "2018-05-14T23:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1ee6d85679912d64f0a1f194902835c46d6cb6a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFQ8d3TjIDN6VbJupjLRWSwaBoqjkqBflAHq7rKhBfrtmCOoKb98YBrHpfzUVnIKCVD8OHjmDqC17TVKWAq6jxR78Bx762cV_1CjP39rGQrjNNIlcuUpo7.fs6ojxyxCQc8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin News Editor", "published": "2018-05-14T23:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Dispatches from the ‘Coachella of Bitcoin’: Lamborghinis, crypto-jewelry, and fake protests", "text": "Webmaster Tools Risk Disclaimer - By using this web site you agree to its terms and conditions.

Whether actual Bitcoin millionaires or hired marketeers, the drivers added to the cacophony and stoked hype for what the city’s calling Blockchain Week.\nThe price of the digital token also got a boost. Bitcoin jumped as much as 3.95 percent to $8,713 in early trading, rebounding from a more than three-week low reached earlier Monday.\nConsensus is expected to draw more 8,500, or twice as many people as last year, when one Bitcoin would have cost you about $2,500. Now the top digital token is worth almost four times as much, though that still pales in comparison to the $20,000 price tag it flirted with late last year.

An Exchange Traded Fund is a tradable security that tracks the price movement of a particular index or industry. ETFs are commonly used by investors to reduce risk and improve probable returns. The ETP as described by the patent will track the price movements of constituent cryptocurrencies.” Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust History\nThe Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust has been in the works for several years, but the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to approve any ETF tied to bitcoin or any digital currency.\nThe proposed COIN ETF is designed to track a basket of shares tied to the digital currency, which has experienced volatile pricing. The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust would have issued Winklevoss Bitcoin Shares. This is similar to how physically backed commodity ETFs are structured or structured as a grantor trust. Consequently, the COIN ETF would have held the underlying commodity to cover a portion of assets If bitcoin ETF sees huge inflows, the trust would be required to purchases bitcoins to meet creations.\nRelated: An Epic Bitcoin Forecast\n“Shares based on digital math-based assets may be redeemed using one or more computers by determining share price information based upon quantities of digital math-based assets held by a trust, electronically receiving a request from an authorized participant user device to redeem a quantity of shares, electronically transmitting a quantity of digital math-based assets from one or more origin digital asset accounts to one or more destination digital asset accounts associated with the authorized participant, and canceling the quantity of shares from the authorized participant,” according to the patent application .\nBitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, or cryptocurrency, based on a peer-to-peer network and can be exchanged through computers internationally without a financial intermediary. The system was first introduced by an unidentified programmer or group under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009.\nFor more information on the cryptocurrency market, visit our Bitcoin category .

This seems to be both the first and the second view different than the many of the previous Forks. Bitcoin Private will be a “hybrid” of Bitcoin and ZClassic. This means that the integrated Bitcoin Private in addition to the advantages of Bitcoin, the anonymity of ZClassic in the Form of zk-snarks will be.\nGoal of Bitcoin is Private, short-BTCP, it is, as the Name suggests, to make Bitcoin private, and completely anonymous. Although it is written in many media, Bitcoin transactions are anonymous and not traced. However, this is not proven to be the case.\nZk-snarks forming the basis to ensure that the transactions are stored in a public Blockchain, but the sender, recipient, and other meta data of the transaction are not accessible to the public. Zk-snarks is typical of the “Z-Coins” ZCash, ZClassic and ZenCash. Zcash was the first application, the zk-SNARKs implemented. Zclassic is a Fork of ZCash, only a few days after the release of ZCash on 05. February 2016 has taken place.\nThe face and founder of Bitcoin Private Rhett Creighton, co-founder of ZClassic. At the beginning of December, 2017, he announced that he teams up with the co-founder of ZClassic Joshua / @ movrcx and both want to be together to revive the Zclassic-project.\nThe naming of the ZClassic Bitcoin Fork was only decided five days later in a poll on Twitter and announced. At this time, it is also clear that it is actually a Rebranding of ZClassic:\nCreighton has declared that the development of ZCL is continued, whether and how the development is carried out after the publication of BTCP, however, is still open. Bitcoin Private Fork\n28. February 2018, will create a Snapshot of the Zclassic – and the Bitcoin Blockchain. The owner of these two cryptographic 1 Bitcoin currencies are in the ratio 1 : Private coins. Example: As the owner of a Bitcoin and 10 ZClassic the owner receives in addition the 11 BTCP (1 BTCP for a BTC and 10 BTCP for 10 ZCL).\nThrough the combination of the circulation of the Coins at the time of the Snapshot of ZCL (approximately 3 million) and BTC (expected to be about 17 million) to be created a little more than 20 million BTCP coins.\nAlready two days after the Snapshot of the BTCP to start-MainNet. Bitcoin Private use as well as Bitcoin, Gold and ZClassic the Mining algorithm Equihash and thus GPU Mining support.\nCurrently ZClassic is traded on Bittrex, Cryptopia and CoinExchange. Whether or not these platforms will be write to the Free coins well, is not fixed at the time of writing, but still. None of these exchanges has been expressed until now.\nSure is, that the Coinomi Wallet will support the Fork:\nAlternatively, the ZClassic can also be held on the official Wallet of ZCL.\nA few days ago, the Bitcoin Private Team, shared the following Tweet. Perhaps Binance Bitcoin Private support. Details are also not yet known.\nAs the Fork was in December last year, the rate of Zclassic at under 4 euros. After the announcement of the Forks and further Details of the course exploded and reached the 07. January an all-time high of 189,54 Euro. Why could be the Bitcoin Private Hard to be “different”?\nIn contrast to the many Bitcoin Forks in the past year, apart from Bitcoin, Cash, and maybe Bitcoin is Gold, seems to be Bitcoin Private to have a real-life case and removes an actually existing Problem.\nFurthermore, there is no anonymous Team, but the seasoned developer behind the project with the founders of ZClassic. Rhett Creighton is in the crypto-community a familiar face.\nIn contrast to many Bitcoin Scam-Forks, can Bitcoin Private show already in front of the Snapshot of a working program code. This is on Github for everyone to see and to control. It can also be understood when looking at the Github Repositories that the Code is actively being worked on.\nThe only reproach which you can make Rhett Creighton and his Team from our point of view, that the project be Rebranding using the name of Bitcoin to get more attention.\nAll in all, it is not impossible to estimate at the present time, from our point of view, how the project will develop. However, Bitcoin is one Private it is, in our opinion, one of the more interesting Bitcoin Forks.\nDisclaimer: — The trading with crypto-currencies carries a large financial risk, and can be up to a total loss of the invested capital.

Chanting “hey hey, ho ho, Bitcoin has got to go,” the group of self-described bankers and CEOs (one man told me he got his suit out of a dumpster) carried signs reading “paper checks use less electricity” and “we thought this was a bubble.”\nAccording to a rambling statement on the group’s website , the Genesis Mining -backed demonstrators were actually protesting aspects of the financial industry, but either way, they generated enough of a scene to draw a crowd and put conference attendees in what can only be described as an appropriately absurdist frame of mind.\nBecause as soon as those who came to hear the blockchain gospel made it past the aforementioned escalator bouncer and the formidable registration line, they were met with what can only be described as a hodler’s paradise.\nWant 18-karat gold crypto-jewelry to commemorate your ride-or-die status as a Bitcoin maximalist?

With bitcoin’s 2017 surge giving the entrepreneurial world a reason to explore non-fiat currency markets, even the inexperienced were itching the jump aboard the bandwagon. However, with the legal battle pouring cold water on many novice’s aspirations, financial trading in India may once again feel like a venture for the well-connected.\nBut, in practice, trading is alive and well in India. Moreover, it’s still something novices can take part in. Just as technology has opened up other industries, trading is now accessible even online and on mobile. Using the MetaTrader 4 (MT4) platform, traders of all skill levels can get direct access to 24-hour trading on thousands of financial markets and commodities. The software offers almost unrivalled access to the trading world while MT4 can automatically start/stop trades , which means that it requires less time commitment from traders. Algorithmic Trading Makes Investing Possible\nTechnically known as trading algorithms, these commands allow users to set their own take and loss limits. Additionally, the software can take live information and use to make investments/end investments. The end result is a system whereby market movements combined with each user’s personal settings and preferences dictate the trading process. For novices looking to use trading as a supplementary income, having the ability to do this invaluable. One of the toughest aspects of trading any commodity is time. Learning the fundamentals of how much you should invest based on your financial state, the hot markets and experts’ advice is all fairly easy.\nIndeed, you can go to any online trading site, watch YouTube videos and read books for all of that information. However, knowing the basics and then finding the time to implement them is a different story. Financial markets are particularly high-paced, which means the savvy investors will be scouring the markets all day for the best times to get in and get out. If you’re a novice investor brought into the market by the bitcoin buzz, you likely don’t have the time to make split-second decisions. Software like MT4 is there to fill in the gaps. A Necessary Interplay Between Humans and Technology\nAlthough technology isn’t a substitute for actual knowledge and insights, it is a facilitator. In much the same way price comparison websites have made it easier for consumers to find the best deals, there’s a certain amount of give and take on both sides. MT4 can collate the data and execute trades, but the user has to have some input. In other words, just as someone wouldn’t click the first result in a price comparison search, a novice trader wouldn’t just use the default settings for MT4. As long as investors are happy to embrace this reciprocal relationship with technology, the RBI’s issues with cryptocurrencies needn’t be a problem.\nBeing able to trade small amounts of money into well-established markets such as forex, gold and oil is a great alternative to bitcoin.

The Fundstrat team believes that the cost of mining per coin has proven to be a great asset in the past.

Are you one of the many persons concluding that it is too late to invest in and trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? Well, if you are, I am here to assure you that it is still very early times, cryptocurrencies are still in the infancy stages. If you feel the price of a Bitcoin is too high, then you should know that there are multiple other cryptocurrencies that are just starting to gain traction. Most of these other cryptocurrencies are fairly new so you can purchase some for less that 1 USD. One main reason why the average Joe hasn’t yet started investing in cryptocurrencies is because it is not as straight forward as buying a precious asset and storing it in a vault. To get started with trading and investing in cryptocurrencies you need to know where to buy the currencies and how to exchange them for other currencies, and at the end of the day you need to know how to get your money back out of the system. In this article I walk you through the entire process and also share a few very important trading and investing tips that I have learned.\nIn addition to whatever you learn in this article, I would recommend that you also do your own research so as to be as informed as possible if/when you do decide to start investing and or trading cryptocurrencies.\nBefore we begin I would like to invite you to take the time out to watch this extremely informative video on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies titled “ Andreas M. Antonopoulos educates Senate of Canada about Bitcoin “. What is important about this video is it helps you to understand what future impact the Bitcoin technology will have, and in doing so will give you an understanding as to why Bitcoin is currently successful, why Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are here to stay, and how they are revolutionary along with problems that they are solving worldwide.\nIf you have decided to take the leap towards investing in or trading cryptocurrencies then i’ll walk you through everything I know. In this post you will learn: Where and how to purchase Bitcoin How to trade Bitcoin for other cryptocurrencies Why You Should Consider Investing in cryptocurrencies Other Than Bitcoin My current top cryptocurrencies How to safely store your cryptocurrencies How to sell your cryptocurrencies for USD Other Useful tips Where and how to purchase Bitcoin\nTo safely purchase Bitcoin you need to do so from a Bitcoin exchange. A Bitcoin exchange allows you to do two things: Buy Bitcoin with United States Dollars (USD), trade Bitcoin for other cryptocurrencies. Most Bitcoin exchanges allow you to trade Bitcoin for other cryptocurrencies but not all exchanges allow you to buy Bitcoin with USD. You will first need to buy Bitcoin from an exchange that allows you to purchase it with USD then you can freely transfer it to another exchange that allows you to trade it for other cryptocurrencies.\nExchanges that allow you to buy Bitcoin\nFor persons outside of the US like myself, Bitcoin can be purchased with USD from Bitstamp, Kraken, and CEX.IO. There are multiple other exchanges, however, I am only familiar with these three and have only personally used two: Bitstamp and CEX.IO. I have signed up for a Kraken account, but have not yet utilized their services. Kraken is a very popular exchange and it has gotten good reviews, so it’s definitely worth a try.\nBitstamp – Bitstamp is a UK based Exchange, it allows international customers to join and you can purchase Bitcoin by wiring money (USD) to Bitstamp and also by using a credit card. My last bank wire to Bitstamp was done on a Thursday and Bitstamp received it on Monday morning which I thought was great. Typically a wire takes minimum three business days. If you are a Jamaican like I am, I recommend using NCB to do wire transfers, BNS literally turned me away with some stupid excuse that Bitstamp needs to provide an American bank for me to wire money to.\nBitstamp allows you to wire as low as $50 USD or even possibly a lower amount to buy Bitcoin, which is great if you just want to give it a try at first. If you plan on using a credit Card then you have a $100 USD limit.\nIf you plan on opening an account with Bitstamp please do so now! Bitstamp will require that you upload photos of a valid ID to them for the purpose of verifying your identity, due to the increase in customers wanting to register with Bitstamp, this registration process can take over a week.\nKraken –“Founded in 2011, San Francisco-based Kraken is the largest Bitcoin exchange in euro volume and liquidity and also trading Canadian dollars, US dollars, British pounds and Japanese yen. Kraken is consistently rated the best and most secure Bitcoin exchange by independent news media.”\nI have very little experience with using Kraken however, it is highly rated and seems to have all the options and services that you need. Kraken allows you to buy Bitcoin and possible other cryptocurrencies with USD.\nCEX.IO – CEX.IO is not very popular, however it does allow international customers to purchase Bitcoin using a credit card or by first wiring money to an account you have set up with them. If you choose to wire money to CEX.IO please note that you have to wire at least $5000 USD. If you plan on using a credit card for purchasing Bitcoin from CEX.IO, the least amount of Bitcoin you can purchase from CEX.IO is 0.01 Bitcoin. As of this writing, 0.01 Bitcoin is $220.35 USD.\nPlease note that all exchanges that allow purchasing of Bitcoin using a credit card will charge you a slightly higher exchange rate.\nLinks : Bitstamp – Kraken – CEX.IO How to trade Bitcoin for other cryptocurrencies\nMost exchanges do not allow you to buy cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin directly using USD, to get other cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin you need to first purchase Bitcoin then exchange it for another currency.\nAnother thing you should note is that Exchanges such as the one’s that I have listed which allow you to purchase bitcoin with USD have very few other cryptocurrencies that you can trade bitcoin for. In order to trade Bitcoin for other cryptocurrencies you need to send your Bitcoin to an exchange that has a huge volume of multiple cryptocurrencies. The exchanges that I am now referring to are those that do not allow you to buy Bicoin directly with USD. Examples of such exchanges are: Bittrex, Cryptopia, Binance.\nBittrex – Bittrex is currently my number one go to exchange for trading Altcoins (Altcoin is a popular term used to refer to the 100+ cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin). Bittrex is a United States based exchange and is largely used by US citizens, but it is accessible to international customers. It is safe to say that Bittrex has all the popular cryptocurrencies and then some.\nAs I have mentioned above, you need to buy Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, send that currency to Bittrex and then you can trade it for other currencies.\nBelow you can watch a video on how to trade cryptocurrencies on Bittrex. At first this might seem like a complicated task, but I assure you, this is only due to the fact that you are new to the interface of these exchanges. Once you get familiar with one exchange, then you will know how to use all of them because they all function pretty much the same way.\nCryptopia – Cryptopia is not as popular are Bittrex, but I do believe that you can find altcoins on Cryptopia that have not yet listed on Bittrex, so it is good to have an account on it just in case. One of my top altcoin is Electroneum, this particular coin has just launched and is three days old as of this writing. Cryptopia is currently the only exchange that has currently listed Electroneum so it’s always good having an account in case you want to be an early investor in new projects that are listed on Cryptopia.\nCryptopia works very similar to Bittrex, i’ve added a video below showing how to transfer Bitcoin to Cryptopia then exchange it for Electroneum. Please note that this is the same process you would use if you were exchanging Bitcoin for any other altcoin on Cryptopia.\nBinance – Binance is very similar to Bittrex, however, it has a more advanced user interface for those who prefer more options. Based on the cryptocurrency listings I would also assume that Binance has roughly the same amount of Altcoins available to trade as Bittrex. Binance is an international Cryptocurrency exchange with offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, Europe, South America and more. Binance was launched just July of 2017 and has quickly grown to become one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges.\nLinks : Binance – Cryptopia – Bittrex Why You Should Consider Investing in cryptocurrencies Other Than Bitcoin\nAs you become more familiar with other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Dash, Electroneum etc., you will quickly learn that they are not just some other coin like Bitcoin trying to compete for second place. These altcoins and many others are in fact new technological ideas created on top of the blockchain technology, and they are aiming to solve current real world problems which makes them solid future investments.\nRipple for example is utilizing the blockchain technology to help banks send and receive wire transfers at far lower prices and at super fast speeds solving two great issues that banks currently have. It literally takes minimum two-three business days to send a bank wire transfer to another country around the world, with Ripple banks can do that same transfer within less than a minute for a fraction of the cost.\nWhat you should also note about some of the popular altcoins is that they sometimes increase in price far faster than Bitcoin, so if you invest wisely you can make far better returns. My current top cryptocurrencies\nFor the short time that I have been learning about cryptocurrencies, I have chosen a few favorites which I think will be good future investments.

How to Avoid Cryptocurrency Scams", "text": "The price of Bitcoin grew over 250,000% in the last seven years. In May 2011, Bitcoin was worth around $7.00. Today…\nWell, it was when we started this blog post\nThese numbers make it easy for anyone to dream of quick riches and those dreams combined with the complexity of cryptocurrencies make it easy for con artists to scam unsuspecting people. Because these scams are usually online, it's up to you to guard yourself against them. Here are a few tips to protect your Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and other cryptocurrencies.\nDon't Send Crypto to Strangers Scammers will often offer you Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash or Ethereum… right after you send them some \"to confirm your address.\" That's not how it works.\nIt's like your email. Want someone to send you an email? Tell them your email address. Do you need to send them an email first? Not at all.\nTo receive Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash, you only need to provide your public address. You can find that on our BitPay wallet by pressing Receive .\nProtect Your Private Key Any information other than your Bitcoin address might put you at risk. If you send anyone your private keys or your twelve-word backup phrase, you risk losing all of your crypto. It would be like giving out your password for your email address. And unlike your email address, there won't be any Google or Yahoo or Microsoft or Apple to restore rightful ownership.\nThis includes companies and organizations. As for BitPay, we won't ask for your private key, your passwords, or your backup phrases. And we certainly will never ask you to send us money (unless you're paying a BitPay merchant invoice).\nIf you've never backed up your wallet, here's a video on how to backup the BitPay Wallet . If you keep your wallet on an exchange, you can read our blog post about the pros and cons of doing so . If you have a backup phrase, remember:\nCheck out our blog post on securing your private keys and backup phrase.\nDon't Click Suspicious Links Unless you know who is sending you a link and why, do not click on it. Most often, this is how malware is downloaded and wreaks havoc on your computer. This video will explain why you shouldn't trust links you can't see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ .\nIf you clicked the link, you were just Rickrolled. The reason it's so easy to Rickroll people is that there is no way to tell what video you'll watch from the YouTube URL (v=dQw4w9WgXcQ in the case of the Rickroll video). But there's no harm there, because the worst-case scenario is an annoying video.\nBut what about https://bit.ly/IqT6zt ? That will take you to the same YouTube video, but you have no way of knowing where it'll go. It might instead take you to a site impersonating an email provider or a cryptocurrency company and trying to collect your sensitive digital information.\nSo don't click suspicious links, download suspicious files, or install plugins and software that you aren't sure about. Cryptocurrency may be a new, complex technology, but these guidelines along with caution and common sense should help you stay safe and secure.\nGoing Forward To further help you identify crypto scams, BitPay has started compiling a list of scams that our users sometimes encounter . Please reach out to us with additional scams you've come across so we can add them to the list.

Detractors of the digital currency say its volatility makes it risky.\nEddie Ayala, spokesman for Orange County Tax Collector Scott Randolph, said his office isn’t considering allowing bitcoin payments.\n“We haven’t had any discussion,” Ayala said. “Frankly, I think the currency is so volatile that I don’t think it makes sense.”\nDavid Jordan, chief deputy for Lake County Tax Collector Bob McKee, said no customer has asked to pay taxes in bitcoin.\n“Our staff would have called and mentioned that,” Jordan said.\nHe said it was interesting but “not on our to-do list.”\nHe also said he was unsure if there was a statutory provision in Florida law that allows a tax collector to accept cryptocurrency as payment.\nBut BitPay, the payment processing company with which Greenberg reached a deal, said it eliminates the volatility from the transaction because it guarantees a price for bitcoin for 15 minutes after a bill is generated.\n“The county tax office won’t face any volatility risk,” BitPay head of compliance Jeremie Beaudry said.\nUnder terms of the deal, taxpayers would pay BitPay in the currency through the tax collector’s website, then BitPay would compensate Greenberg’s office in cash. BitPay keeps a 1 percent fee.\nGreenberg, a longtime cryptocurrency enthusiast, is bullish on the move and said it will help reduce fraud and identity theft because payments cannot be altered once they’re made.\n“The technology is so new and so promising,” Greenberg said, noting taxpayers would be subject to a 1 percent fee BitPay collects, lower than fees charged by credit-card companies.\nHe couldn’t cite instances of customers asking to pay in the digital currency but said some have complained about higher fees associated with banks and credit cards.\nSean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Economic Competitiveness, questioned how bitcoin payments for taxes or government services would be converted into dollars and cents — and how quickly after a transaction.\n“I’m not a cryptocurrency expert, but I know that Seminole County’s not paying its employees or its vendors in bitcoin,” he said. “Any payments [the Seminole County Tax Collector’s Office] receives would have to be converted presumably into dollars. Given the volatility of bitcoin prices...I think there’s some risk there that the value could depreciate.”\nHe noted that BitPay has sponsored a college football bowl game in St. Petersburg and some area businesses and stadium concessions accepted bitcoin payments.\n“I don’t think bitcoin will ever supplant the dollar in terms of becoming the medium of exchange,” Snaith said. “I don’t see this as something that’s going to be the norm going forward.”\nGreenberg didn’t receive permission from the state before making the decision, he said, nor does he think he needs to.\nThe state Department of Revenue didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nLast year, the agency poured water on Greenberg’s plan to sell off four branch tax collector offices for $13.2 million and then use the money to purchase shopping centers in distressed areas.\nThe idea was to rent out most of the space to tenants and use the remaining space for drivers-license operations for residents in Orange and Seminole counties.\nBut the revenue department, which oversees Greenberg’s budget, said taking on the risks of a commercial landlord was unrelated to the function of a tax collector branch office.\nStaffer Stephen Hudak contributed to this report. rygillespie@ orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5002.\n»\nCAPTION \"Odd Is Art” is an exhibit that showcases objects from Orlando-based Ripley Entertainment’s vast collection of unusual items.

Those in the sales and marketing industry involved in cryptocurrency were said to be at 14.49 percent.\nAdditionally, about 30 percent are people out of the job market, with 13.85 percent being students, 2.06 as retired and 14.74 having no jobs at all.\nThe same gender imbalance on cryptocurrency trading was also evident in relation to cryptocurrency developers with female developers’ representation falling short of men developers.\nAlongside other factors that could be at play, largely, bitcoin is located at the intersection of technology and finance, both fields that suffer from a severe gender imbalance. While other sectors like education and medicine are beginning to enjoy a huge female inclusion trend, the technology sector suffers huge deficit in female representation, a reason the results don’t seem all that surprising.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "etoro", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T02:03:13.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "865faab82e93402a1b5617ab0eb40e62b2ade8d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSstP7shghflF0N6MT.ZvbE2wU6Xb.oJSo3HRBLUhqWiH1YmP7qLxlouvrL7KZvsuNGxEYATWEXrcctRDZ_PRJjoXLvI6ZWVRzsm0Wn5f5zSw--", "site_full": "thenewsunit.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://thenewsunit.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The News UNIT", "title": "Bitcoin Ben announces that COINBASE is going to be smashed", "title_full": "Bitcoin Ben announces that COINBASE is going to be smashed", "published": "2018-05-14T22:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "865faab82e93402a1b5617ab0eb40e62b2ade8d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSstP7shghflF0N6MT.ZvbE2wU6Xb.oJSo3HRBLUhqWiH1YmP7qLxlouvrL7KZvsuNGxEYATWEXrcctRDZ_PRJjoXLvI6ZWVRzsm0Wn5f5zSw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The News UNIT (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-14T22:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Ben announces that COINBASE is going to be smashed", "text": "THE END of COINBASE\nBitcoin Ben is having another meeting on Saturday:\nBut where?

The office decided to accept the cryptocurrencies in an effort to streamline fee collection, reduce the potential for fraud and identity theft and increase the transparency and accuracy of payments.\nGreenberg’s office added that it does not perceive any “price volatility or risk to the County” in accepting the cryptocurrencies. Greenberg said in the statement: “The aim of my tenure in office is to make our customer experience faster, smarter and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st century and one way is the addition of cryptocurrency to our payment options.”\nThe collaboration with the Seminole County Tax Collector marks BitPay’s first government partnership. Head of compliance Jeremie Beaudry said the company was launched because “we recognized the potential for blockchain to revolutionize the financial industry, making payments faster, more secure and less expensive on a global scale.\n“With the Seminole County Tax Collector’s office, we have engaged our first government agency to accept bitcoin and bitcoin cash by making it easy and seamless for them,” he added. However, Greenberg’s office is not the only local government entity that has entertained the idea of accepting cryptocurrency for taxes.\nArizona and Georgia lawmakers both proposed bills this year that would allow citizens to pay their state tax liabilities in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, though neither bill made it through their respective legislatures.

New investors are flocking to the marketplace in record numbers and this investment capital is getting reinvested back into the BTC services marketplace.\nAs more people learn about the benefits of blockchain technology, the decentralized economy continues to expand. While most of the media’s attention is focused on how Bitcoin can assist you in acquiring your Lambo, many people are still unaware of the multitude of ways in which they can spend their Bitcoin earnings on day-to-day items. There is no shortage of services that allow you to pay your bills directly using Bitcoin and new platforms with even more innovative concepts continue to emerge in the market daily. Lamborghini Diablo\nYou hear all about the HODLers of BTC but rarely do you get to hear stories about the people that use their cryptocurrencies to do more mundane tasks such as pay their cell phone or electric bills. While these activities lack the luster of a cherry red Lamborghini Diablo, they are, in fact, much more important to mass scale Bitcoin adoption.\nBitcoin users from around the world are finding unique and innovative ways to avoid using fiat currencies in their lives and if you are bit more practical than a bright red Lambo, or just looking to use your hard earned Satoshis to get by, there are many ways in which you can spend your BTC on your living expenses. Below are just a few of the most popular ways that you can pay your bills directly from your BTC wallet and avoid paying any crypto-to-fiat transition fees. Bitcoin Debit Cards – Pay Your Bills with BTC\nBitcoin Debit cards are considered by many as the missing link between the cryptomarket and the traditional market space. Crypto Debit cards can function in a couple of different ways but most utilize a protocol that converts your crypto into fiat currency the moment you swipe your card. You will pay a small processing fee for the transaction but with most cards, it is far less than what Coinbase would charge you. Bitcoin Debit Card Featuring NFC Card\nSince the merchant is only receiving fiat currency, you can use your crypto debit card at any retailers that accept credit cards such as Visa. This makes crypto debit cards perfectly suited for paying your bills. You can even sign your card up for automatic bill payments just like a traditional credit or debit card.\nClick here to view a comprehensive list of the crypto debit cards currently available on the market. Welto.io\nThe Welto.io platform provides users the ability to pay their bills directly from their Bitcoin wallet. The platform boasts immediate transaction times and even allows you to use a combination of crypto and fiat currency to pay your bills. There is 2% flat transaction fee for their services; which is far less than fiat-based payment systems and despite the $300 payment limit, Welto is expanding quickly.\nThe Welto platform is currently working on a large-scale update that would allow for the use of more cryptocurrencies in the future. Currently, users can pay bills with BTC, LTC, ETH, ZEN, ETC, and CRW. There is also a mobile app available for download on the Android operating system.\nIf that isn’t easy enough for you, you can download the Amazon Alexa app and pay your bills with voice commands. The best part is that the Welto platform is not alone. Click here to see a list the most popular crypto bill pay platforms currently available. Living Room of Satoshi\nThe Living Room of Satoshi platform is an Australian-based cryptocurrency bill payment system that is already seeing substantial use in the country. This 2014 startup is currently processing around $1 million a week in small bills for BTC users in Australia. The system is integrated with the BPAY bill system to provide users access to the most popular service providers in the area.\nThis platform is excellent in its abilities and overall informative feel. You can see the actual payment statistics of the platform’s users by category for the last 14 days. A quick review of this data is truly eye-opening. Credit cards bills are the #1 bill paid on the platform followed by the internet, phone, electricity, and gas. The platform even allows you to pay your rent with crypto.\nThis is truly a remarkable tool for the BTC users of Australia and hopefully, they will expand their operation in the future. Pay Your Bills Directly\nYou should always ask your service providers if they accept BTC directly as a form of payment. You may be surprised to find out that they already do or are planning to integrate it in the near future. Corporations and governments from around the world are getting hip to the benefits of accepting cryptocurrencies and you may not be too far off from the day that you can even pay your taxes in crypto.\nIt was reported in February of this year that Arizona was considering becoming the first state to accept cryptocurrency payments for property taxes. This would be a huge step forward for the decentralized economy and more states will surely follow Arizona’s example in the coming months. Arizona State Capitol Building Is it Possible to Pay Your Bills by Using a Bitcoin Wallet?\nYes, it is very easy to pay your bills with your Bitcoin wallet and there are thousands of people already doing this every day. These are the individuals that are taking the decentralized economy forward by forcing retailers to take a serious look into cryptocurrencies such as BTC and as you probably already know, just a peek at BTC can be enough to take you down the blockchain rabbit hole.\nWhat do you guys think?

Vullo today announced that the New York State Department of Financial Services has authorized Gemini Trust Company, LLC to offer the custody services and trading of Zcash, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash, emerging cryptocurrencies, on its virtual currency exchange based in New York City.\nCryptocurrencies are alternative decentralized global digital currencies that provide users with a more secure and efficient means of payment.\nDepartment of Financial Services Superintendent Maria T. Vullo said, \"This action continues New York’s longstanding commitment to innovation and leadership in the global marketplace. With smart and thorough regulatory oversight, the development and long-term growth of the industry will remain thriving.”\nTyler Winklevoss, Chief Executive Officer, Gemini Trust Company, LCC said, “We are proud be the first licensed exchange in the world to offer Zcash trading and custody services and look forward to providing customers with a safe, secure, and regulated place to buy, sell, and store Zcash, an incredible new form of digital cash.”\nThe Department of Financial Services issued a trust charter to Gemini in October 2015 to operate a virtual currency exchange through which Gemini customers may purchase and sell virtual currency for U.S. Dollars and U.S. Dollars for virtual currency. In June 2015, the Department published final virtual currency rules after a nearly two-year inquiry into the appropriate regulatory guidelines. Virtual currency license applicants are subject to a rigorous review of anti-money laundering, capitalization, consumer protection and cyber security standards.\nThe Zcash network supports two kinds of transactions, transparent and shielded. Transparent transactions operate similarly to Bitcoin in that the balance and the amounts of the transaction are publicly visible on the blockchain. Shielded transactions utilize z-addresses and are entirely private. Transactions associated with z-addresses do not appear on the public blockchain. Zcash is the digital cryptography-based asset of the Zcash network, similar to how bitcoin is the digital cryptography-based asset of the Bitcoin network.\nAs a limited purpose trust company chartered under New York State Banking Law, Gemini can launch Zcash trading immediately, subject to ongoing supervision by the state. Gemini has also been approved for potential future offerings of Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "maria t. vullo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyler winklevoss", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "llc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york state department of financial services financial services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gemini trust company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of financial services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york state department of financial services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lcc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zcash", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T21:44:48.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d45b14cb4d20b33df132bebc729e70d84f72d0fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmU5QQV7wwlx4N9UkWGANjTE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Transaction price Bitcoin", "title_full": "Transaction price Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-14T21:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.029, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d45b14cb4d20b33df132bebc729e70d84f72d0fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmU5QQV7wwlx4N9UkWGANjTE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "paymentbit21", "published": "2018-05-14T21:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Transaction price Bitcoin", "text": "Quote: from: russaa8 on May 02, 2018, 02:17:49 PM Today I was amazed at how low the commission was when transferring 0.07 bitcoins.

Now instead of capitalizing on the rising tide of digital currencies, he’s struggling to find “purpose” or “value” in the market, saying at a convention in Hong Kong that the rise of bitcoin is being fueled only by “speculation” and fraud, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nHe said:\n“I don’t see the purpose of it. What value does cryptocurrency actually add? No one’s been able to answer that question for me.”\nHe’s joining the chorus of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has similarly railed against the cryptocurrency market. Meanwhile, Eisman has a history of agreeing with Buffett on topics like executive compensation.\nBerman, however, does appear to keep tabs on cryptocurrency regulation, saying he “doesn’t understand” why the market isn’t regulated “more heavily.” The answer is that policymakers while eager to place controls on the market don’t want to craft laws that will stifle innovation in any given region. To quote former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who Eisman once said was “the worst Chairman of the Fed in history”, it’s a “conundrum” that they’re working feverishly to solve. Source: Shutterstock\nPerhaps Eisman, whose career was a focal point in Michael Lewis’ bestseller The Big Short and who was portrayed as a hedge fund manager by Steve Carell on the big screen, has been looking in the wrong place for the answers.\nFor instance, he presciently forecast the US housing crisis following a $26 billion call on the mortgage market by Wachovia Corp a couple of years prior to the meltdown. He followed the signs, which led him to the famous “big short”. But when it comes to cryptocurrencies, Eisman admits he hasn’t taken the time to understand the mechanics of the market.\n“I don’t touch it. I don’t know what I’m looking at…I have no interest,” said Eisman at the conference, adding that he avoids investing in any currencies, not just the crypto kind. ‘No Systemic Risk’\nMeanwhile, if you were to ask him where the next “big short”, Eisman wouldn’t point to cryptocurrencies and like the Bank of England’s Mark Carney sees no systemic risk in the global economy. And unlike JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon , who similarly has no interest in bitcoin, Carney is not bracing for another US recession.\nWhere is most concerned about is the Canadian housing market, where there is evidence of a bubble that’s getting ready to burst. As a result, he’s taken short positions in more than half-a-dozen related stocks.\nNot surprisingly, Eisman owns no digital currencies.\nFeatured Image from YouTube ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.businessinsider.com/steve-eisman-interview-on-housing-bust-2016-3", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/steve-eisman-of-the-big-short-bashes-cryptocurrency-i-dont-see-the-purpose-of-it-1526292273", "https://hacked.com/us-economy-goldilocks-or-perfect-storm/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve eisman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eisman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve eisman bashes bitcoin eisman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neuberger berman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T00:52:52.008+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32210, "moreResultsAvailable": 5310, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=26900", "requestsLeft": 393}
