Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, evaporated from the web seven years ago. Laszlo Hanyecz, a developer who worked on bitcoin early on, told Business Insider that he exchanged hundreds of emails with the person known as Nakamoto over the course of 2010. The experience was mostly weird, said Hanyecz.\nTen years after murmurs of the world’s first cryptocurrency appeared online, there’s still no definitive clue as to the identity of its creator, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto.\nWhile Nakamoto vanished from the internet in April of 2011, he left behind a slender trail of breadcrumbs in the form of emails exchanged with early bitcoin developers, commentary in online forums, and bitcoin’s original whitepaper itself.\nWhile there’s plenty of speculation regarding Nakamoto’s true identity, all of the guesses hazarded thus far have led to inconclusive dead ends.\nOne bitcoin developer, Laszlo Hanyecz, best known for making the first real-world purchase in bitcoin for a pair of multi-million dollar pizzas , told Business Insider that he exchanged hundreds of emails with the bitcoin creator over the course of 2010.\nTheir interaction began when Hanyecz, who had been mining bitcoins on his laptop, expressed interest in contributing to the cryptocurrency’s development online. Nakamoto agreed, Hanyecz said, and over the course of the year, he sent over tasks for Hanyecz to complete.\nHanyecz said that his interactions with Nakamoto were always “kind of weird.”\n“I thought bitcoin was awesome and I wanted to be involved, but I had a regular developing job,” said Hanyecz. “Nakamoto would send me emails like, ‘Hey, can you fix this bug? Hey, can you do this?'”\nHanyecz said that even though his work on bitcoin was a side project that he worked on for free, Nakamoto treated him like he was a full time employee.\n“He’d say: ‘Hey, the west side’s down.’ Or, ‘We have these bugs, we need to fix this.’ I’d be like, ‘We? We’re not a team,'” said Hanyecz. “I thought that it was approval from him, that maybe he accepted me as a member. But I didn’t want the responsibility. I didn’t really understand all of the forces that were going on at the time.”\nHanyecz said that Nakamoto’s demands occasionally rubbed him the wrong way.\n“I’d say, ‘Hey, you’re not my boss,'” said Hanyecz. “I didn’t take it too seriously, though.” I asked a few questions – he always dodged them\nNakamoto didn’t seem too thrilled about Hanyecz’s burgeoning mining pursuits either, said Hanyecz.\n“He said, “Well, I’d rather not have you do the mining too much,'” said Hanyecz. “He was trying to grow the community and get more commerce-use cases. He fully recognised that mining would become a thing where a few people would get wealthy.”\nTypically, Hanyecz would contact Nakamoto throughout the week with technical inquiries usually related to bitcoin’s code, he said. When Nakamoto chose to respond, he’d do so all at once, usually towards the end of the week.\n“I just assumed he was busy working on other stuff,” said Hanyecz.\nDespite working on a strenuous, highly technical project together, Hanyecz said that Nakamoto always maintained his veil of anonymity, to the point that it struck Hanyecz as distinctly odd.\n“He or she or whoever it was never told me anything personal,” said Hanyecz. “I asked a few questions, but he always dodged them. Those questions never got answered.”\nBecause of Nakamoto’s name, Hanyecz assumed like many others, that he was conferring with a slightly eccentric man of Asian origins. There were several emails where Hanyecz said that Nakamoto struck him as paranoid.\n“There were a few times when I got messages that seemed off-base,” he said. “I brushed them off because I was like, ‘Who cares if this guy tells me to go pound sand and go away?’ This wasn’t my job or anything, it was a hobby. I was trying to be friends with him. He seemed very paranoid about people breaking the software. He kept calling it ‘pre-release,’ and I was helping him get it to release.”\nIn retrospect, Hanyecz said that Nakamoto’s paranoia was understandable.\n“If anything had happened to the code early on, we wouldn’t be heaving this conversation today,” he said.\nHanyecz said that he’s used to dealing with eccentric people over the internet, but that his interactions with Nakamoto consistently gave him what he called “a weird feeling.”\nUltimately, though, Hanyecz said that he has deep respect for both Nakamoto’s project and the person, or team, behind the name Nakamoto. Hanyecz believes that bitcoin might not exist today if it wasn’t for its creator’s decision to evade the public eye.\n“It’s exciting because people love a man of mystery, but I try to steer people towards the fact that it doesn’t matter who made it. He could be a psycho killer,” Hanyecz said. “People like to identify with heroes or villains, but in the cryptosphere your code has to speak for itself. Charisma and being an interesting person only gets you so far when you’re a developer. Ultimately, you’ll be judged on the quality of your code and your idea.” NOW WATCH: Tech Insider videos Want to read a more in-depth view on the trends influencing Australian business and the global economy?

BTC/USD is showing positive signs above 100 SMA and is facing a key barrier near $7,500-7,600.\nBitcoin Price Analysis The past few sessions were positive in bitcoin price as it moved above the $7,300 resistance against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair formed a support base at $7,050 and started a sharp upside move. It broke the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $7,450 high to $7,048 low to start the rally. Later, buyers succeeded in pushing the price above a major hurdle at $7,250.\nIt opened the doors for more gains and this week's followed important bearish trend line with resistance at $7,320 was breached on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.

At the moment, the price is trading near the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,936 high to $7,048. Buyers must push the price above the $7,500 and $7,600 resistance levels to more gains in the near term. The $7,600 level is the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,936 high to $7,048.\nLooking at the chart , if the price breaks the $7,600 barrier, it could easily rally towards the $8,000 level.

Instead, you will be able to see stuttering and freezing frames when performing graphics intensive tasks, such as gaming or full HD video processing. Some users may naturally come to the conclusion that their graphics card is about to break. Nevertheless, if you experience such symptoms, you should download software that can measure temperature and workload on your GPU, and check if Bitcoin Miner infection causes the malfunction.\nThere are many reasons [3] why your computer might be working slow – incompatible software or hardware, corrupt system files, outdated or corrupt registry entries and similar issues.

The evolution of Bitcoin miner virus: ransomware variant hit the surface\nBitcoin ransomware is a specific version of Bitcoin malware, which can infiltrate a computer without user’s approval and then encrypt each of his/her files. This threat has been noticed after encrypting the entire network of one medical center in the USA. However, it can also affect regular home users leaving them without the access to their files.\nOnce it finishes the encryption of victim’s files, Bitcoin ransomware displays a warning message asking him or her to pay the ransom of 1.5 bitcoin. Please, do NOT pay it as you may end up with nothing! Keep in mind that you are dealing with scammers who can take money from you and leave you without a special code needed to decrypt your locked files.\nIn this case, you should perform Bitcoin miner virus removal with Reimage and try to encrypt your files with the help of these tools: Photorec and R-studio. Keep in mind that dealing with cybercriminals is never an option! Bitcoin mining malware has been noticed spreading in Russia\nAt the end of July 2017, it was reported that cryptocurrency mining malware infected 25% of computer users in Russia. [4] However, some sources state that this cyber infection may have infiltrated 30% of Russian computers. [5]\nAccording to the official data, the majority of affected devices run in Windows OS. Meanwhile, Mac computers and iPhones haven’t suffered a lot from the virus.\nAuthorities published the information about Bitcoin mining virus [6] . However, security specialists and antivirus vendors claim that the scope of the attack is exaggerated. [7] Experts agree that in the past there were few issues with this malware, but not as vast as it is has been stated recently.\nA representative from Kaspersky Labs, which is one of the leading Russian antivirus vendors, claims that if such a massive attack were held, they would have noticed it. However, since the beginning of the year, only 6% of their customers have suffered from BitcoinMiner. [8] Ways to get infected with malware\nAccording to security experts, this virus is mostly spread via Skype network, but it has also been noticed on other social networks, so beware about that. Typically, this virus relies on a spam message, which claims something like „this my favorite picture of you” and includes a malicious file. Of course, virus seeks to convince its victims to download the file onto their computers. Certain versions of malware were also seen being spread using the EternalBlue exploit.\nIf you want to avoid it, stay away from such messages. Once victim downloads the “photo,” he not only lets malicious pieces inside the machine but allows the virus to connect PC to its command-and-control server.\nOnce inside and active, the virus turns the infected machine to the Bitcoin generator. However, it can also be designed to the virus, which steals banking details, records the keystrokes or downloads more malware on its target PC. Bitcoin miner virus removal guide\nIf you think that your computer is infected with malware, you should scan it with updated security software, such as Reimage or Plumbytes Anti-Malware Webroot SecureAnywhere AntiVirus . If your device is affected, your chosen security tool will remove Bitcoin virus immediately.\nMake sure you check the system immediately after noticing changes in your computer’s speed because it is the only way to get rid of this threat without additional problems. The appearance of other viruses and the loss of your sensitive information can be expected when having Bitcoin malware on a computer.\nThese programs should also help you perform Bitcoin virus removal from the system. However, sometimes viruses that are categorized as ransomware block anti-virus software to prevent their removal. If you are dealing with such problem right now, follow a guide below.

Some claim cryptocurrencies are the biggest scam in history, others believe them to be the next generation of secure peer to peer lending that could change the way we do business.\nOne thing is clear, digital currencies have become an attractive option for speculators and long term investors looking to make some serious cash.\nMore than 1,500 different cryptocurrencies are in circulation, available to be purchased online in a similar fashion to the way stocks and shares are exchanged.\nThe value of coins is underpinned and secured by blockchain technology to ensure currency rates can’t be manipulated.\nAlthough more than 100,000 venders now accept Bitcoin, the first and largest decentralised ledger currency, many view them more as commodities than currencies and are happy to buy and sell coins as their value rise and fall.\nInterest reached a zenith in late 2017 when a run on Bitcoin saw the value of a single coin climb from $900 (Dh3,000) to $20,000 in just a few weeks.\nThe surge drew in hundreds of thousands of new investors and although the price has since dipped to around $7,000 it remains an attractive proposition for some, but it can be a white knuckle ride.\nThe volatility of the currency makes it popular for gamblers willing to risk their savings, with the potential for huge returns, as well as gigantic losses.\nRELATED ARTICLES THE AMERICAS UAE hosts Special Olympic iftar in Washington MENA Four dead, hundreds injured as Gaza protests at border fence EUROPE UN labour body to draft sexual harassment treaty EUROPE EU’s Barnier criticises UK plans to avoid hard Irish border Videos WORLD WATCH: Sightline with Tim Marshall WORLD WATCH: Thousands protest in Jordan UAE WATCH: The future of buildings WORLD WATCH: Hundreds mourn Palestinian nurse killed by Israeli soldiers Recommended UAE Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global initiatives programme review - in pictures BANKING SoftBank hires ex-Deutsche Bank executive to lead Middle East arm of $100bn tech fund ENVIRONMENT UAE weather: High winds and humidity GOVERNMENT Saudi-Emirati Co-ordination Council the 'nucleus that brings all Arabs together', says Sheikh Mohammed", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T21:59:02.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1edbdc893a38235d6b9886cad03edf27de7fb737", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY6ijqaA.DDR0MKe3a4bMnGbWH4b6UEVT7U5dqxfmD1ucWBTgz_knVFWN934ewUYzTTTW_cNVNXnPqvH4.O0hhbTIYBwAyQgSY-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Big Blocks Can Scale | But Will It Centralize Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Big Blocks Can Scale | But Will It Centralize Bitcoin?

How to Buy Bitcoin Cash? How to Short Bitcoin? Prices Above $7500 The BTC prices are likely to be locked between the $7800 and the $6600 region for the short and medium term as the market begins to open up for the long term and the larger investors in a slow and steady manner over the next few weeks.

However, the argument may not be as convincing as some claim quite yet. More Concerns in Italy have some Cryptocurrency Analysts Making Correlations Bitcoin is trading near 7,500.00 U.S Dollars per coin as of this writing. The cryptocurrency has managed to gain the past day after stumbling to lows early this week which were the culmination of a near two-week downturn.\nThe VIX Index in Chicago has risen the past couple of days. And global equities lost swiftly yesterday on the major international stock indexes.\nThis has occurred as news from Italy has created further downdrafts for the EUR/USD pair. Gold is trading near 1300.00 U.S Dollars per ounce.\nHowever, the simple platitude that Bitcoin rose on fears because Italy is having political problems and is looking at the prospects on another election in July as some of its politicians point their finger at the EUR as a culprit may not actually have any link.\nThe fact is that the EUR has lost considerable ground to the USD because the U.S Federal Reserve is maintaining a hawkish interest rate policy, while the European Union has once again hit an oil slick and will probably have to maintain a dovish stance midterm.\nBitcoin’s Short-Term Rise Likely not a Safe Haven Move Stock markets have in fact stumbled and treaded water since January of this year, and while Bitcoin rose in value yesterday, it is no secret the cryptocurrency has also suffered a vast slide since January after seeing its values rise to record levels in December of 2017.\nMeaning that a desire to correlate one poor day of trading on the global markets, fear escalating because of Italy’s problems and a rise in the value of Bitcoin is probably a reach that will prove to have no significance.\nIt is doubtful that Gold has been replaced by Bitcoin as a safe haven asset quite yet. The value of Gold has been beaten down as the value of the U.S Dollar has soared the past two months of trading. The precious metal was near 1350.00 U.S Dollar per ounce two months ago. And Bitcoin is essentially straddling a price range it found itself in March before it was able to stage a rally in April before succumbing to its most recent slide.\nSuggested Articles\nGPU and ASIC – A Correlation and Barometer for Cryptocurrency Traders Bitcoin’s Lightning Network: How Can it Solve Bitcoin’s Biggest Problem How Bitcoin Can Destroy the World.

However, it also may prove to be a one day result which happened to move coincidentally in step with the VIX when the stock markets also happened to be suffering a downturn.\nAnd lastly, the VIX while it has gained substantially the past couple of days, is still below values it saw in March and it is far below its values of late January when broad market concerns in global equities shook corporate shares worldwide before recovering stability.\nYaron Mazor is a senior analyst at SuperTraderTV .\nSuperTraderTV Academy is a leader in investing and stock trading education.

Moreover, Since December 2017 that the market cannot recover. During the last months Bitcoin has been traded between the $6,000 $10,000 range, and now important price movement was able to change that.\nBut what will happen during the rest of 2018? Some experts have been predicting very bullish Bitcoin behaviours, but some others believe that the cryptocurrency market will not skyrocket.\nLower Crypto Market Capitalization During the last year we had an important bull run that moved Bitcoin prices up. The market capitalization and the price of virtual currencies couldn’t stop growing. Which was the roof? Nobody knew about it.\nAccording to Sean Williams, the market was primarily controlled by retail investors. Institutional traders were just a few, and these individual investors did not have possibilities to profit betting against digital currencies. The only option for them was to buy and sell at a higher price.\nSince the CME and the CBOE started to offer Bitcoin futures, the situation changed. During the last months, an important number of institutional investors is now in the market. These two platforms allow companies to easily place their bets in two different directions, up or down.\nLower Bitcoin Price Mr. Willians predicted at the beginning of the current year, that Bitcoin would lose at leas half of its value. And indeed, it moved from $14,100 to over $6,000. This is more than half of its value, and something that Williams believes that will happen again before 2019.\nHe explains that It is not clear what can produce this price movement. It can be important regulations taking place in the United States or South Korea, or another similar situation. Additionally, the entrance of institutional investors to the market may also cause the prices to drop.\nBitcoin Hegemony Lost? Can Bitcoin lose the first position in the market? According to Mr. Williams, that’s something that is very possible. According to him, Bitcoin would temporarily lose its place as the largest virtual currency in the world.\nThe cryptocurrency that would be able to do that is Ethereum, which has been usually occupying the number 2 spot in the cryptocurrency market. Additionally, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, the largest open source blockchain initiative, has more than 500 organizations working on it. Additionally, the different features that Ethereum has may let it grow faster than Bitcoin.\nStricter US Regulations In December, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton, warned that a lot of the trading activities take place outside the U.S. something that would make it difficult, for the SEC to protect American investors. According to Williams, this was a call for regulations.\nAt the beginning of the year, tax regulations tightened when the IRS put its foot down on cryptocurrency tax evaders. Additionally, gains and losses would now have to be reported on federal income-tax returns.\nWilliams advises new investors to be careful and understand that this is a very different market. Compared to stocks, cryptocurrencies cannot be valuated. There are no balance sheets, income statements or reports.

Shortly after, Bitcoin had reached it’s monthly top at the $10K mark.\nFrom here, Bitcoin is forming a bull pennant which, if the pattern gets extracted, we might see testing the $8,000 very soon. From the bullish side, creating a higher low on the $9K mark is very important for the mid-long term. The short term – very strong resistance level at $7,800 – $8,000 area.

District of Houston image Bitcoin farm in Houston one step closer to reality It’s still unclear how many jobs would be created May. 30, 2018 1:30 a.m.\nHouston council has recently issued a development variance permit to allow Miningsky Technology Ltd. to use up to 10 shipping containers as “accessory buildings for storage.”\nThe current bylaws only allow two shipping containers to be used for this purpose.\nMiningsky applied for the permit in late March to locate as many as 10 shipping containers on a parcel located at 1300 Morice River Road – the former site of Houston Forest Products, which shut its doors in 2014. The area is zoned as heavy industrial land.\nSince then, the District of Houston has notified owners and tenants of lands within 100 metres of the parcel boundaries that a permit may be issued. No comments were received from the public by the time council resolved to issue the permit, according to a district staff report.\nA land use application obtained by Houston Today states that employees would be present to monitor and maintain operation the facility, which would consume 10 megawatts of power.\nHowever, it’s still unclear how many jobs will be created.\n“I think that it is unfair to promise numerous jobs until we are further along; we are still very much in the planning stage at this point,” said Scott Young, managing director of Green Valley Mine Incorporated – a company that has recently announced a share exchange agreement involving Miningsky.\n“We have hired some local labour, only on a needs basis so far,” added Young. “I don’t know how many [jobs will be created] in the future… it depends on our client base.”\nAccording to the land use application, Miningsky considers shipping containers a good alternative to ordinary buildings.\n“It is quicker to use sea cans [containers], rather than to build buildings,” the application states. “We would like to increase our sea can amount from two to 10 within six months.”\nCryptocurrency — digital money that can be exchanged for goods and services online or for hard cash, but isn’t linked to any physical resource or central authority — has risen dramatically in popularity over the past few years.\n“At the moment there are many coins and currency in the market place,” said Young. “No doubt some consolidation will take place and mining technology will advance; however, we do feel this is the future of world currency.”\nBitcoin — the most well-known form of cryptocurrency — was created in 2009 and currently trades at more than US$8300 per unit, down from a peak of more than US$20,000 in December 2017.\nWith offices in Vancouver and Los Angeles, Miningsky describes itself as offering “a full-service solution” to cryptocurrency mining. The company, which was formed in November 2017, sells “mining rigs”— computer systems meant for mining bitcoins — and it provides services that include mining farm construction and miner hosting.\n– With files from", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "miningsky", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "miningsky technology ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston forest products", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "district", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morice river road", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T11:47:49.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "41801d00d4eb88864032dfc76e5b9411b910bf47", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmT_WdBOLI2.uV55iTUZNNsA-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Can bitcoin survive beggars?", "title_full": "Can bitcoin survive beggars?", "published": "2018-05-30T11:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "41801d00d4eb88864032dfc76e5b9411b910bf47", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmT_WdBOLI2.uV55iTUZNNsA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "barabarian1", "published": "2018-05-30T11:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can bitcoin survive beggars?", "text": "In my opinion. bitcoin has nothing to do with beggars. beggars is the most basic economic problem, it is caused by the absence of a person's ability to find work due to many factors such as uneducated, coming from poor families, not having families, people displaced. so it is the responsibility for the government to provide a place / organization for them, so that they can get education and compassion so that they can get out of their jobs to be beggars.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T06:53:00.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3dec7e11c7422cd60277a6d9a0f7683c90361f9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY6ijqaA.DDR3oqQIu7Cxa7pkBRiF.Jnf6j32qv9JtSwVMqBCJqB9UiLeKOj3UKRXVnh.aSLDr.PmnJqL3fl0jYYrZS_ZhEHG_RLYYMWgO.Hg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin -

However, we are most certainly negative overall, and it looks as if the $8000 level above will continue to be very resistive. When I look at the longer-term charts, the major support is closer to the $6000 level, so I think ultimately this will be an opportunity to start selling again. I think that signs of exhaustion are to be sold, especially considering how strong the US dollar has been as of late. On the other hand, if we were to break above the $8000 level, the market could go higher, perhaps reaching towards the $9000 level after that. I suspect it would take a significant amount of momentum building to have that happen, so it makes more sense that we would see selling on signs of exhaustion than anything else.\nBTC\\/JPY\nBitcoin rallied a bit against the Japanese yen as well, which of course coincides nicely with overall bitcoin strength. The ¥900,000 level above should be resistance though, just as the 100-day moving average is sitting just above there. I believe that the “ceiling” in the market is probably closer to the ¥1 million level, so I’m waiting for signs of exhaustion to start shorting again. I believe that we will go looking towards the ¥700,000 level, completing the move to the lower part of the consolidation. The market failed to reach the highs of the overall consolidation area that I have marked out on the chart, at least the last time we attempted to. Because of this, I suspect that we will see plenty of selling that eventually, and this is typically a very negative sign longer-term. I have no interest in buying.\nOriginal Source DailyForex provides daily fundamental and technical analysis and signals for those looking to trade based on trends in the currency markets.

From Japan’s real estate and stock market bubble in 1990 to the dot-com bubble and US housing bubble, each one had dire consequences for the economy and detrimentally impacted millions of people. Whether Bitcoin is destined for a similar fate remains a rife debate among investors and cryptocurrency experts alike.\nThis is according to Sameer Singh, Research Analyst at Old Mutual Wealth Private Client Securities, who says that of all the economic bubbles, none was more infamous than the Dutch Tulip Bubble that gripped Holland in the early 17th century.\n“Tulips, which were seen as a luxury item and status symbol, first boomed in popularity when a virus infected them, causing the petal colours of the flower to suddenly change into multi-coloured patterns. In 1634, speculators began to enter the market and saw how the new rich and middle class in Holland’s Golden Age were willing to pay extraordinary sums of money for a single bulb, and by 1636, stock exchanges were established to trade in bulbs and their future options.\n“Eventually though, in 1637, the market for tulips collapsed as people could no longer afford to purchase even the cheapest bulbs. This saw a tremendous drop in value and sparked a financial catastrophe for many,” explains Singh, adding that while the flower still remains popular in Holland, the story should serve as a reminder that markets can be extremely irrational at times.\nWhile Bitcoin has increased in acceptance, Singh notes that it still falls well short of mainstream fiat currency and the price movement over the recent past makes it quite unpredictable as a store of value. “Perhaps over time it could stabilise and gain mass appeal as a means of exchange. However, for now its volatility makes it more attractive for speculation than for facilitating trade.\nAs such, Singh says that those investing in Bitcoin as a currency should adopt an opportunistic trading strategy, pay attention to price action, analyse momentum indicators and utilise buy/stop orders regularly over short periods of time.\n“The alternative is to hold Bitcoin for the long term with the faith that its price will stabilise, its acceptance (as a means of trade) becomes more widespread and its purchasing power slowly increases over time. This, unfortunately, is still yet to be exhibited,” he adds.\nHowever, Singh believes that purchasing Bitcoin as a collectible because it was the first cryptocurrency, has a slightly better footing and similarities to being used as a store of value, as is the case with gold. “Within its code, Bitcoin was designed to reach a maximum number of units, 21 million Bitcoins to be exact. By most calculations, the total number of Bitcoins will reach their zenith in the year 2140.”\nThis brings about two consequential implications, he explains “Firstly, Bitcoin is scarce and, secondly, as a result, increasing demand should realise a higher value. Additionally, owing to the Blockchain existing outside of the financial system, it could serve as a store of value, a digital gold, for those seeking an alternative to the status quo of central banks, financial regulation and industry middle-men.\n“However, as it stands, the regulatory environment around Bitcoin remains a source of much uncertainty. Critically for purchasers, as with any investment, the price paid will be a defining element of the potential for future returns,” he adds.\nSo what does the future hold? This is the real “million Bitcoin” question, says Singh. “Blockchain as a technology and platform, we believe, is here to stay. There are numerous advantages that the platform maintains over traditional transaction networks which have seen organisations from central banks to private banks utilising the technology and creating their own closed loop networks for internal transactions.\n“These advantages coupled with the increased adoption of artificial intelligence portend an exciting future where, at the very least, the cost to transact (being measured in both time and money) should decrease.”\nSingh says that the future for Bitcoin, however, is somewhat more uncertain. “As we know, there are many more cryptocurrencies in circulation, most are quite similar in nature while others are quite different, such as Ether. The issue for Bitcoin, specifically, is that it is the first cryptocurrency and has benefitted from this advantage.\nHowever, this leaves it open to disruption from new superior entrants, he concludes. “With the state of technology continually in flux and improvements in efficiency and productivity gains being the eternal pursuit, it would be bold to think that Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency to rule them all. Most importantly, when the next evolution of cryptocurrencies rises to the fore, astute investors and traders would be mindful not to get caught up in the hype, understand the critical aspects of the underlying technology involved and manage their expectations accordingly.” Share this:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.omwealth.co.za/Solutions/PrivateClients"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sameer singh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "research analyst", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T14:33:39.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "266dd5b23ea79c239d68c9a93e9c43f05c985443", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9SjFKWdfb2eOTHnXBFuthwPev3LG8m6uoWntPvaD.cHVQ.VbhzT2.QxA4cJuCtUwIhfoIlrBYk5okoZm7hPiX6c.ilPgauxhLojDE4ALPwabcQcwMOGI9mggjEpooq2H2Nuv2OU_QV4FlW5qGXMIYX", "site_full": "www.cointalk.tv", "site": "cointalk.tv", "site_section": "http://www.cointalk.tv/feed/atom", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Coin Talk", "title": "If Satoshi Nakamoto Didn’t Register Bitcoin (BTC) as a Trademark, Who Did? – GlobalCoinReport", "title_full": "If Satoshi Nakamoto Didn’t Register Bitcoin (BTC) as a Trademark, Who Did? – GlobalCoinReport", "published": "2018-05-30T10:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "TV", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "266dd5b23ea79c239d68c9a93e9c43f05c985443", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9SjFKWdfb2eOTHnXBFuthwPev3LG8m6uoWntPvaD.cHVQ.VbhzT2.QxA4cJuCtUwIhfoIlrBYk5okoZm7hPiX6c.ilPgauxhLojDE4ALPwabcQcwMOGI9mggjEpooq2H2Nuv2OU_QV4FlW5qGXMIYX", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-30T10:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "If Satoshi Nakamoto Didn’t Register Bitcoin (BTC) as a Trademark, Who Did? – GlobalCoinReport", "text": "If Satoshi Nakamoto Didn't Register Bitcoin (BTC) as a Trademark, Who Did?

Various studies on this topic have been published over the years. In Chelan County, Washington, a major development is taking place. Rural electric utilities are taking an aggressive stance against various Bitcoin mining firms over their “disruption” of the local power grid. Chelan County Turns on Bitcoin Mining Over the past two to three years, various Bitcoin mining firms have set up shop in Washington’s Chelan County . This part of the state has an abundance of renewable energy, and its power grid seems more than capable of supporting large energy draws. While this situation has worked out quite well for several years, local residents are getting fed up with these Bitcoin miners, by the look of things. In fact, a crusade of sorts has been taking place in Chelan County. Rural electric utilities have conducted a hearing regarding the future of these local Bitcoin mining firms. This event took place two weeks ago but only made media headlines over the weekend. There was so much public interest in the hearing that a second room had to be opened so everyone could attend it live. Chelan County has become increasingly appealing to Bitcoin mining firms due to its access to hydropower. This form of renewable energy allows mining firms to benefit from cheaper power in rather large quantities. As such, multiple companies have set up shop in the county, although a few problems have arisen. One of the primary issues is that there are a lot of farms and other areas previously used for other purposes which have been transformed into Bitcoin mining operations. While this is a positive trend for the cryptocurrency industry, no success goes by unpunished. All three public utilities in Chelan County are determining how best to deal with all of these mining firms. One possible outcome is that they could choose not to increase their energy offerings to these companies, which would hinder the companies’ growth plans. While the demand for electric power in Chelan County tends to grow each year, the latest increase has been well beyond expectations. Since January of 2017, there has been a demand for 210 megawatts just to power Bitcoin mining operations. This is virtually the same amount as the entire county and its 73,000 residents are using right now. Doubling the electric power output of the region is no easy feat, and it seems the utility providers are looking for ways to avoid having to do so. Moreover, there is the problem of how large energy purchases work exactly. Some miners think they can simply talk to an official in order to purchase electricity for their Bitcoin mining operation. That is not how things work in the real world. Furthermore, there are the unusual spikes in power usage which utility crews have to deal with. Bitcoin mining is a booming business in Washington, but it is also causing a lot of problems for the companies delivering the required electricity to miners. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "chelan county utilities are fed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chelan county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T08:46:54.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2b73c57d05ab18a66e85be42e13734c046d5e293", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCCRZ2pTsbW1fpMMFDpam1irrDkUS9ZKourI4ebS0o5zkcMVDe4NXzbefZDL8nlHBS8AeipeZtsAc3A41BioL6TppMxjmS86BCJUtIaCba_ck-", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "Dominance of Big Banks in UK Means London Might Miss the Boat on Bitcoin", "title_full": "Dominance of Big Banks in UK Means London Might Miss the Boat on Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-30T10:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1527620912_58686252.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2b73c57d05ab18a66e85be42e13734c046d5e293", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCCRZ2pTsbW1fpMMFDpam1irrDkUS9ZKourI4ebS0o5zkcMVDe4NXzbefZDL8nlHBS8AeipeZtsAc3A41BioL6TppMxjmS86BCJUtIaCba_ck-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-30T10:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "Dominance of Big Banks in UK Means London Might Miss the Boat on Bitcoin", "text": "10 hours ago International Bitcoin.com 74 London has enjoyed a status of a global financial hub for centuries and served as a pioneer for brand new trading options for decades. However, some fear it is now in danger of getting left behind by the hottest emerging asset class – cryptocurrency. One of the main reasons for this appears to be the dominance of the big banks over the UK economy. Also Read: Niall Ferguson Tells Bank of England Bitcoin Is Financial System of the Future Banks Hindering Progress Despite having a thriving fintech startups scene, an established trading ecosystem and a leading role in the traditional fiat currencies market, London appears to be missing the boat with regards to the rush of institutional money flowing into crypto finance. Locations such as Tokyo, Chicago, New York and even San Francisco are taking the lead with regards to regulated platforms, OTC and hedge funds, as well as exchange-traded derivatives such as futures. And many people in the industry believe this is mainly due to the outsize influence that the banks have in the City. “Banks have been unusually strict in dealings with crypto,” Max Boonen, a former Goldman Sachs trader and current CEO of B2C2, a London cryptocurrency market maker, told FT . “It’s nearly impossible to open an account for crypto in the UK. The problem is that in the UK there is a perception that banks have issues with anti-money laundering and decided to be a lot more conservative.” And David Mercer, CEO of LMAX, an FCA regulated FX trading venue which recently announced a physical cryptocurrency exchange dedicated to serving just institutional clients, expects UK banks would only join the market next year. “London is very bank-driven and we see it as being a late adopter,” he explained. Not Too Late? There are also factors that support London’s position in the crypto market, such as CFD brokers like IG Group and Plus500 achieving success with retail traders as well as Barclays agreeing to open an account for Coinbase. Additionally, there are those that think that the matter is overstated. “The City of London, taken as a whole, has the collective experience to make considered and forward-thinking decisions. This experience manifests itself in many ways, from the efficiency of trade execution to KYC & AML regulations and from the strength of our legal system to our culture of effective corporate governance. These reasons are why London dominates the international foreign exchange markets, and it is unthinkable that the City will not continue to be a dominant player in crypto markets,” commented to news.Bitcoin.com Nauman Anees, Co-founder of Think Coin, a multi-asset financial & cryptocurrency trading exchange. Anees added: “London is the dominant player in global financial markets thanks to the strength of its regulatory infrastructure and position as a gateway & conduit between every key global market – and while the crypto markets are novel in many ways, these key contextual advantages still apply. Moreover, events in recent years show the crypto space is one where ‘first mover advantage’ does not apply. Repeated hacks of key exchanges along with the slow pace of international regulation has meant that many ‘early adopters’ have not been positioned to fully develop and grow with the market, meaning that a more cautious approach will likely prove to pay the biggest dividends later. That said, the idea that there is a corporate resistance to crypto adoption in London is misguided. Most of the major investment banks have opened crypto desks, and the ones which haven’t already announced are undoubtedly experimenting behind the scenes.” How should London ensure that the crypto revolution does not pass it by?

Despite its niche appeal, it was incredibly easy to mine in rather large quantities. Unfortunately, a lot of people have since lost their Bitcoin holdings. One particular holder lost close to $60 million worth of Bitcoin due to a lost hard drive. Securely Storing Bitcoin is Important Considering that Bitcoin has been around for over nine years now, it is safe to assume that not all of the minted coins are still in circulation today. Given the vast number of hacks, thefts, and lost currencies over the years, the actual Bitcoin supply is closer to the 15 million mark than the 17+ million which have been mined to date. A scarce currency only becomes more scarce over time, especially when users do not take the best security precautions. While Bitcoin-related hacks and thefts make most of the headlines, they are not necessarily responsible for the largest losses in the cryptocurrency world. Rather, it seems human error is the main cause of many Bitcoins having been lost over the years. Granted, storing the world’s leading cryptocurrency is not necessarily all that straightforward, but things have improved dramatically in the past few years. Even so, users who have ever mined Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency will need to take the proper precautions. Storing funds in a safe and secure manner requires one to pay attention at all times. Unfortunately for James Howells, things did not work out in that manner. While he stored a Bitcoin wallet on a hard drive for some time, the drive was thrown out “ accidentally “. That in itself is not unusual, but it seems Howells had done a lot of things right up to that point. Rather than throwing the hard drive out with his old computer, he tossed it after storing it in a desk drawer. It had been in there with another drive which should have been thrown out, yet it seems this is where the mix-up occurred. Considering that the drive in question held the keys to a Bitcoin wallet containing around 7,500 BTC, Howells’ losses amount to roughly $60 million at current prices. Recovering such hard drives always proves rather difficult, for obvious reasons. In this case, it is a bit unclear where the hard drive ended up, especially since the mistake wasn’t noticed until a few weeks after the fact. It is not the first time issues like this one have arisen, as various Bitcoin holders have suffered similar setbacks in the past few years. Storing a Bitcoin wallet securely for longer periods of time is difficult, especially when one doesn’t label things correctly or fails to use the proper hardware. All of this further confirms that Bitcoin has always been relatively popular among speculators and investors. Unfortunately, it also means millions – if not billions – of dollars worth of Bitcoins have been lost throughout the years, mainly due to hard drives and USB sticks getting thrown out, misplaced, or malfunctioning. In this era of cryptocurrency hardware wallets , taking security more seriously has become easier, but still requires people to pay close attention. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T08:46:51.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "97b96671c18fd16ec7672954215e411bc0ab5d21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fChobv0veSwrMiZ8q7aiXSKX9PbG7ZnSEoaoKVhTK0QjtWIZmvkzbwBgny_wHQ316N1rdJcMLt_t2wz3Wu4bA0Y2oN_HDGYmkR7.BjcQBAc3c-", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "Bitcoin Beats Euro As Brewing Italian Crisis Delivers 6% Monthly Losses", "title_full": "Bitcoin Beats Euro As Brewing Italian Crisis Delivers 6% Monthly Losses", "published": "2018-05-30T10:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "97b96671c18fd16ec7672954215e411bc0ab5d21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fChobv0veSwrMiZ8q7aiXSKX9PbG7ZnSEoaoKVhTK0QjtWIZmvkzbwBgny_wHQ316N1rdJcMLt_t2wz3Wu4bA0Y2oN_HDGYmkR7.BjcQBAc3c-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-30T10:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Beats Euro As Brewing Italian Crisis Delivers 6% Monthly Losses", "text": "10 hours ago Crypto and Laws Bitcoinist 67 The euro has declined more against the dollar than Bitcoin since April as Italian political turmoil riles markets.

Italy will head towards fresh elections in 2018, but the results will be anything but an improvement, former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis warned May 28. The refusal of president Sergio Mattarella to appoint eurosceptic Paolo Savona as finance minister will give strength to some of the more virulent populist voices in Italian politics, Varoufakis warned, notably Northern League leader Matteo Salvini: In short, (Mattarella) fell right into Mr Salvini’s trap. The formation of another ‘technical’ government, under a former IMF apparatchik, is a fantastic gift to Mr Salvini.

After reaching initials lows earlier in the day of just above US$7,000, Bitcoin saw a huge jump to above $7,400, and is continually inching higher. If things play out well, this could lead to a summer frenzy, similar to was witnessed at this time last year. In the month of April, Bitcoin saw an almost 50% growth- from lows of US$6,600 to local highs above $9,600. While this was a strong indication that the bear cycle had ended, May’s woes have acted as a reinforcement of the bleed seen between January and March of this year. However, Bitcoin’s appreciation of close to 5% marks the highest performing day since the first week of May. Perhaps more exciting is the performance of altcoins alongside BTC. Out of the top 100 coins listed on coinmarketcap, all have seen dollar appreciation within the past 24 hours. The worst performer, of course, is Tether, which remains pegged at US$1. Almost half of the top 100 has seen double digit appreciation, more than doubling that of Bitcoin. This surge is led by Bytecoin (BCN) and Nexus (NXS), with 35% and 25% growth, respectively. Altcoins globally saw an increase in market cap from US$182 billion to $201 billion, or roughly 10%. Unfortunately, today’s performance alone does not cancel out May’s losses. The global market cap of all cryptocurrencies is down 30% from early May highs. To reach similar valuations, today’s activity would have to sustain itself and spill into June. Fortunately, sentiments surrounding the cryptocurrency space seem to be improving. Cryptocurrency magnate and John McAfee Tweeted his prediction of a US$15,000 Bitcoin by the end of June. While this 100% increase would be significant, McAfee’s altcoin calls are far loftier. The antivirus entrepreneur suggests that both Bitcoin Private (BTCP) and Golem (GNT) will see more than ten times growth by July, accompanied by 3-5x increases from a handful of other altcoins. My short term price predictions: in a major dip, with nearly everything dropping, the price of Docademic doubled since my prediction. The market will turn before June 12th and my predictions will hit. My algorithms predicted Trump's June 12th date. They have never been wrong. pic.twitter.com/IGAzWPtOV4 — John McAfee (@officialmcafee) May 24, 2018 Much of the cryptocurrency community consists of college students, and as such, a major volume increase is likely when all return home from school. If both a sustained growth of price and volume coexist into the start of June, the field may be set for a similarly exciting summer as was experienced in 2017. While December all-time highs seem to be very distant benchmarks, hopefuls throughout are suggesting that these price levels may be retrieved sooner, rather than later. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "everything green as price of bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T08:46:48.074+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d92f05bc9f3cb6ef3045f6a3971fc952847714d5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSUWBNqaav77dTI29alNd1c-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why China banned bitcoin？", "title_full": "Why China banned bitcoin？", "published": "2018-05-30T10:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.043, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d92f05bc9f3cb6ef3045f6a3971fc952847714d5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSUWBNqaav77dTI29alNd1c-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jeepuerit", "published": "2018-05-30T10:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why China banned bitcoin？", "text": "Quote: from: gcckpxm62308 on January 26, 2018, 08:42:42 AM China's three major virtual currencies trading platform Bitcoin China, Coin Network, OKCoin currency have announced that they will cease trading business, the Chinese regulatory authorities so resolute and beyond imagination.

It is accepted to have been made in 2009 by an unknown individual referred to as Satoshi Nakamoto as another method for paying for things that would not be liable to national banks that are equipped for cheapening cash. It is the most prominent of more than 1,000 “ cryptographic forms of money ” that have risen lately, with computerized monies like Dash, Ethereum and Litecoin likewise observing a huge hop in cost.\nConspicuous business analysts, for example, Joseph Stiglitz and Wall Street investors say the bitcoin advertise is an air pocket.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has issued notices about the danger of putting resources into bitcoin and other computerized monetary standards.

The estimation of one bitcoin was about $16,500, in late December, contrasted and about $1,000 in March. The cost is additionally unstable, however, and followed off to some degree subsequent to approaching $20,000 prior to December. Bitcoin can’t exist without PCs, which can’t exist without a wellspring of power. What’s more, the number of PCs and the vitality expected to control them is rising. The developing estimation of it is specifically attached to the measure of vitality its employment. The mineworkers open bitcoins by comprehending intricate, one of a kind riddles. As the estimation of the currency goes up, the riddles turn out to be progressively more troublesome, and it requires more PC energy to unravel them. A few evaluations say in excess of 60 percent of the handling power used to mine the digital currency is in China, where it depends vigorously on the consuming of coal. Coal and other petroleum derivatives are likewise the biggest generator of power for whatever is left of the world, and coal is a huge supporter of artificial environmental change .

Yet he said the money wasn't received on their part. He told me I will get reimbursed and to come back the next day to buy the product.\nThen I received an email from BitFlyer telling me they will reimburse me the money as soon as they confirm it was received on their part. By that time, the transaction was already confirmed hundreds times on the blockchain, and the Address I sent it to already spent it. They asked me to create an account on BitFlyer so I can get my money back. I did create an account on their website. Then one week later they write to me, telling me they can confirm they received my money, but it will take time to get my reimbursement. Now it's been three weeks and haven't received a word from them.\nI am very pissed by this. They just took me 300 dollars worth of bitcoin and claimed the transaction never happenned. Bic Camera do not want to deal with the issue as they pretend I am not their customer. I do not care what process they use behind the counter nor what exchange they deal with. They advertise they accept Bitcoin and yet whoever is in charge of the address they gave to me stole my money.\nThe problem isn't with Bitcoin per say. The problem is 'regulated' or 'official' companies that pretend to accept bitcoin but in the end fraud its customers. As my BTC is already lost and I still have no access to customer support, I have nowhere to let people know about the fraud, except here.\nSo there it is. I don't know what to do, except rent here and let you guys know the experience is not always positive.

The primary case of this system is the Bitcoin arrange. This procedure requires a significant measure of power; thus mineworkers in the system are dependably looking for a shabby and copious power supply. In the midst of this setting, some Wall Street examiners are proposing that oil firms in the Texas Permian Basin who discard their abundance petroleum gas by means of gas flaring, could better use it by utilizing the gas to produce power which would, thusly, control nearby Bitcoin mining rigs. A Bernstein group of experts, headed by Jean Ann Salisbury, disclosed in a note to customers that the bowl could include a surprising 25 [billion cubic feet for every day] of wet gas to 2025, which will, for the most part, be dealt with as a side-effect in view of oil cost and conceivably even flared! What could makers do rather with this free gas?\nIn the wake of making a few estimations, the examiners discovered that their technique would be sure have worked superbly well quite a long while prior, yielding moment rates of profitability. In any case, now that around 17 million bitcoins have just been mined out of the aggregate 21 million, the mining trouble would increment exponentially consequently, “turning into a Permian-bitcoin extremely rich person will stay, for the present, a fantasy,” the experts proclaimed, including that: In the event that we represent this expanding trouble, we profit just if the normal cost more than 15 years is $18,788. The experts are by all account not the only one’s reasoning of tackling abundance vitality for digital currency mining . Back in February, BTCManager detailed that Iron Bridge Resources, a Canada-based oil, and gas firm, was hoping to make a backup that could utilize a small amount of its gaseous petrol to create power for Bitcoin mining tasks to turnaround its diminishing fortune caused by the low cost of petroleum gas. Our IBR investors are required to profit by expanded petroleum gas netbacks as we change over our perfect, low evaluated gas to power and afterward guide that power to gainfully mine cryptographic money and host stages for outsider mining gear said Iron Bridge Resources CEO, Rob Colcleugh. Thus, an Australian firm known as Hunter vitality has marked an organization manages IOT Group, to re-open its coal digging office for crypto mining exercises. While this appears like a splendid business thought for the two gatherings, it could demonstrate very undesirable for the earth as consuming coal discharges colossal measures of carbon dioxide which contaminates the air and adds to a dangerous atmospheric deviation.

He told me that if I invest 5000 in our currency it will be doubled in a month's time. He also promised me that I will get referral fees and override from every person I introduced to Bitcoin and that prices of Bitcoin are expected to increase. To make the story short I did not join because I believe its a pyramiding scam. Truth to be told I did my research on Bitcoin after that and it turn's out that Bitcoin's price was really on rise unfortunately I did not invest at that time. Currently I'm learning more thru this forum and I thank my friend for inviting me here. Just last December I heard from one of my friends that the company they joined was in fact a pyramiding scam and the money they invested in just vanished out of thin air together with the people who invited them. We should be wary of people offering investments and opportunities to us. Do your research. Opportunity comes with risks as well as the rewards. If its too good to be true, it might be a scam. Bitcoin is not a SCAM but there are people who uses Bitcoin to SCAM other people. Good luck to us and more power to Bitcoin!\nI think you friend a quite wrong. Your bitcoin won't doubled just in a month. but investing in bitcoin for long period is indeed profitable.\nThere are many scam and pyramid schemes out there that offering you a great amount of profit, but bitcoin is not like that.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T10:37:11.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2b664eaaa4b60b98dc685f4cfce00cacc74fc08f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSQDTFKh.PXs8zLMBOPlTTT1UVzO2wdyKlfOBW0PYM27vL8rwH3iWsLs_HiYXiOB14dT8RKn06IbIS0Rc2QPVoHfs9YatnethQ3BeJtq_isCI-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/rising/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "reddit: the front page of the internet", "title": "Korea's Supreme Court recognizes Bitcoin as valuable property for first time : CryptoEra", "title_full": "Korea's Supreme Court recognizes Bitcoin as valuable property for first time : CryptoEra", "published": "2018-05-30T10:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.941, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2b664eaaa4b60b98dc685f4cfce00cacc74fc08f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSQDTFKh.PXs8zLMBOPlTTT1UVzO2wdyKlfOBW0PYM27vL8rwH3iWsLs_HiYXiOB14dT8RKn06IbIS0Rc2QPVoHfs9YatnethQ3BeJtq_isCI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "antipyro", "published": "2018-05-30T10:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Korea's Supreme Court recognizes Bitcoin as valuable property for first time : CryptoEra", "text": "submitted by /u/antipyro\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wdPWKTc4qY"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T10:50:09.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "53d2cfc44e05665f5fa90fe52563f96e14764da4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTgrCH9mettc0fZTB0thv9dYzGlzkJjkC8yGOmIXAT7TFJi90WPOTPH98Q9h3BWwaSEGQu759PMsXeCmEpIhh4KLYpEZntfMVPUX.skMSQw4g--", "site_full": "www.bclocalnews.com", "site": "bclocalnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.bclocalnews.com/opinion/letters/index.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BC Local News", "title": "Bitcoin farm in Houston one step closer to reality", "title_full": "Bitcoin farm in Houston one step closer to reality", "published": "2018-05-30T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.bclocalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/11983219_web_Bitcoin-farm.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "53d2cfc44e05665f5fa90fe52563f96e14764da4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTgrCH9mettc0fZTB0thv9dYzGlzkJjkC8yGOmIXAT7TFJi90WPOTPH98Q9h3BWwaSEGQu759PMsXeCmEpIhh4KLYpEZntfMVPUX.skMSQw4g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Wire Service", "published": "2018-05-30T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin farm in Houston one step closer to reality", "text": "A cryptocurrency facility proposed by Miningsky Technology Ltd. would be located at the former site of Houston Forest Products on Morice River Road. District of Houston image Bitcoin farm in Houston one step closer to reality It's still unclear how many jobs would be created May. 30, 2018 12:00 a.m.\nHouston council has recently issued a development variance permit to allow Miningsky Technology Ltd. to use up to 10 shipping containers as “accessory buildings for storage.”\nThe current bylaws only allow two shipping containers to be used for this purpose.\nMiningsky applied for the permit in late March to locate as many as 10 shipping containers on a parcel located at 1300 Morice River Road – the former site of Houston Forest Products, which shut its doors in 2014. The area is zoned as heavy industrial land.\nSince then, the District of Houston has notified owners and tenants of lands within 100 metres of the parcel boundaries that a permit may be issued. No comments were received from the public by the time council resolved to issue the permit, according to a district staff report.\nA land use application obtained by Houston Today states that employees would be present to monitor and maintain operation the facility, which would consume 10 megawatts of power.\nHowever, it’s still unclear how many jobs will be created.\n“I think that it is unfair to promise numerous jobs until we are further along; we are still very much in the planning stage at this point,” said Scott Young, managing director of Green Valley Mine Incorporated – a company that has recently announced a share exchange agreement involving Miningsky.\n“We have hired some local labour, only on a needs basis so far,” added Young. “I don’t know how many [jobs will be created] in the future… it depends on our client base.”\nAccording to the land use application, Miningsky considers shipping containers a good alternative to ordinary buildings.\n“It is quicker to use sea cans [containers], rather than to build buildings,” the application states. “We would like to increase our sea can amount from two to 10 within six months.”\nCryptocurrency — digital money that can be exchanged for goods and services online or for hard cash, but isn’t linked to any physical resource or central authority — has risen dramatically in popularity over the past few years.\n“At the moment there are many coins and currency in the market place,” said Young. “No doubt some consolidation will take place and mining technology will advance; however, we do feel this is the future of world currency.”\nBitcoin — the most well-known form of cryptocurrency — was created in 2009 and currently trades at more than US$8300 per unit, down from a peak of more than US$20,000 in December 2017.\nWith offices in Vancouver and Los Angeles, Miningsky describes itself as offering “a full-service solution” to cryptocurrency mining. The company, which was formed in November 2017, sells “mining rigs”— computer systems meant for mining bitcoins — and it provides services that include mining farm construction and miner hosting.\n– With files from", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "miningsky", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "miningsky technology ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston forest products", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "district", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morice river road", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T14:33:52.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "654eaf4fd76e1a399da298598a0c2650c30c5b28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY6ijqaA.DDR.EzHTZvSuOxkHNqEHe_hE6NO67t.QEScY.nDhmBsrDuKJNo4Fdx4HB6BLGuspiGUoSUTNSTYVRifq0DqU5qJY8-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "BCC (Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash) will become the global international currency with \"authorities\" interacting through it", "title_full": "BCC (Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash) will become the global international currency with \"authorities\" interacting through it : btc", "published": "2018-05-30T09:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.1, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "654eaf4fd76e1a399da298598a0c2650c30c5b28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY6ijqaA.DDR.EzHTZvSuOxkHNqEHe_hE6NO67t.QEScY.nDhmBsrDuKJNo4Fdx4HB6BLGuspiGUoSUTNSTYVRifq0DqU5qJY8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CAPTAIN_FIAT", "published": "2018-05-30T09:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "BCC (Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash) will become the global international currency with \"authorities\" interacting through it", "text": "How many know?\n submitted by /u/CAPTAIN_FIAT\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T05:10:13.072+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "099dd9afb63d4619b85015802b13d934e52cd17c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWEsBSwHveWIDf3gd83NufE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Which is more risky?

In November, the power devoured by the whole bitcoin organize was assessed to be higher than that of the Republic of Ireland. From that point forward, its requests have just developed. It’s currently poised to utilize a little more than 42TWh of power in a year, setting it in front of New Zealand and Hungary and simply behind Peru, as indicated by gauges from Digiconomist. That is similar to CO2 discharges of 20 megatonnes – or approximately 1m transoceanic flights. That really ought to be a grave idea to any individual who seeks after the digital currency to become advance in stature and enter far-reaching utilization. In any case, considerably additionally disturbing is that things could get a whole lot more regrettable, expanding environmental change simultaneously. Consuming immense measures of power isn’t accidental to bitcoin: rather, it’s implanted into the deepest center of the money, as the task known as “mining”. In streamlined terms, bitcoin mining is an opposition to squander the most power conceivable by doing inconsequential math quintillions of times each second. The greater power you consume, and the speedier your PC, the higher your possibility of winning the opposition. This is a victor takes-all amusement, where the prize is ensured to be paid to one, and just a single, excavator like clockwork. Consuming greater power expands your odds of winning , however correspondingly diminishes every other person’s – thus they have an inspiration to consume greater power thus. The financial result of the majority of this is uncovered in a Credit Suisse preparation note distributed on Tuesday: the system overall will reinvest all the bitcoin paid out as mining rewards once again into its power utilization . At current costs for power and bitcoin, the bank figures a greatest gainful power draw of bitcoin at around 100TWh – more than two times higher than its present rate. Any higher and the digger will lose cash. In any case, it deteriorates. In the event that bitcoin was to end up the worldwide money its supporters trust it will, its price would increment. Furthermore, if its cost expands, too does the measure of power mineworkers can bear to consume. Credit Suisse gauge that a bitcoin cost of $50,000 – five times its level as I compose – would expand the power utilization ten times. What’s more, at a bitcoin cost of $1.1m, it is gainful to utilize all the power as of now produced on the planet for mining. Bitcoin, in totality, is not good for our environment as it uses storehouses of energy. The bank sees the last prospect as not worth agonizing over, for two reasons: ◊ It doesn’t figure it will ever achieve that esteem since the opposition from different digital currencies is excessively solid, and ◊ It conceives that power utilization of mining will fall after some time as better innovations are utilized for mineworkers.

Using the Fibonacci retracement tool on the latest swing high and low shows that the 50% level lines up with the channel resistance while the 61.8% level is closer to a key area of interest.\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This means that the selloff is still more likely to resume than to reverse. The 100 SMA could also hold as dynamic resistance since it’s near the 38.2% Fib.\nRSI is still moving up to show that bulls have more energy left, which could lead to a move up to the highest Fib at the broken $8,000 support. The gap between the moving averages is widening to reflect stronger selling momentum while RSI is nearing overbought conditions.\nSimilarly stochastic is heading up but is also nearing the overbought zone to signal weakening bullish pressure. Turning lower could bring sellers back in and lead to a move back to the swing low or channel bottom closer to $7,000.\nWith anti-EU sentiment being feared to return and weigh on the global outlook, bitcoin appears to be drawing support from political jitters as it did so before. Italy’s political situation is still a mess as fresh polls might be needed due to the lack of support for the coalition government leaders. Spain is also set for elections so there’s plenty of uncertainty in the region.\nAccording to Brian Stutland of Equity Armor Investments, bitcoin seems to be the new fear gauge as there is a correlation between the VIX and its price.

Whale manipulation & mass accumulation stage. Dont go anywhere until at least 2021.\nMaybe you have noticed a pattern, LFC? Searing seems to continuously talk as if he is getting scared out of his stash, but for some reason, he has continued to HODL on at least his online persona seems to have made that impression.\n Well, Searing is close to (if not already) 65 years of age and on a fixed income now since he retired. I realize he has some money from a 401k but now his overall wealth is probably fluctuating tremendously due to Bitcoin and it seems to me that his Bitcoin stash is what made him comfortable in his retirement decision. I can understand his concern.\nYep, this pretty much sums up my cowardice....dump the BTC as a sure thing, keep the Alts ..if the Alts pump, I missed making\nmore money because the BTC pumped...if the alts dump, well than obviously dumping the BTC was wise...\nbut if bitcoin dumps then the alts will dump too...and I will be doubly underwater\nbut yeah...essentially cowardice...on my part...\nI admit that I feel a bit uncomfortable making fun at your expense, but I have to credit you with revealing the real dilemmas that exist, even when HODLing within a decent amount of profits (which seems to be your current situation).\nRegarding a possible poll of \"when Searing will crack?,\" that could be a fun one, but again such a topic would be at your expense, so such a poll could be a bit uncomfortable - except for the fact that you are acknowledging your own seeming precipice.\nRegarding your outline of possibilities in front of you, I just conclude that you are so much embedded into a kind of gambling mentality and you are trying to play with all or nothing strategies, too much. Why can't you be a bit more moderate about your approach without worrying so much? Figure out a proportionality between various coins that make you comfortable, and then once you get that proportionality, then skim 10% or 20% off of the top and put into fiat (if that is a comfortable amount for you), so that you will feel more comfortable in the event that prices of whichever crypto goes down.\nPersonally, I would say fuck you to a lot of the alts, but you are seeming a lot more sympathetic to them, so perhaps, your allocation is going to end up way more heavily allocated in the alt direction that I would chose (and perhaps several guys - and gal - in this thread).\nWell, the ALTs up till recently or I should say still ..should be the ONLY thing I need to sell bit by bit, to get to\nmy 'unneeded and random' goal of reaching 66 years and full retirement, before 'touching' any of my 'traditional\ninvestments' or social security. I can get Medicare at 65 a year earlier without issue. Thus as a 'random' goal\nI can make the case of let it ride. The BTC Hoard....and no real issue with lifestyle.\nThe problem is *until recently* I was under the deluded viewpoint that i have some 'very small' angle on what\nwas going on with crypto and alts and mining....they now are all in flux and I am befuddled. My big miner\ndays will likely be wrapped up by July 4th, 2018 say as an appropriate end date. The price of BTC and ALTS\nhave 'halved' I think or more since 1/14/18 when I retired on the above 'iffy plan'.\nOn the other hand, I'm 63 years old, if I'm not gonna say 'to hell with it now' and take a chance...when?\nSo I flutter between outcomes....sell the alts, sell the btc, etc trying to get the illusion back that at least\ngot me from 2013 till 2018 with SOME idea of wtf I am doing...those days seem to be gone. Truely, if all\nthat crypto does for me is allow me to retire 3 years early, at my same dubious lifestyle till the above\nmentioned 66 years. Also, giving you guys a laugh at my expense does not hurt....good to have an ego\ncheck on all this crypto stuff...\nAnyway, crypto will work till it don't I guess....and I can decide to continue to ride or jump off...but\nso far have resisted...there is NO WAY I can lose on any of the above .even if BTC goes to tulips\nI am likely in no danger of having to go back to work for a living. Also this is the most fun using my\nhead on complex stuff, since i was in College, thus what? Back to 'internet cats' for intellectual stimulation?\nAnyway, so far have resisted but if I did not have bitcointalk to 'bitch' about his or other stuff...I never\nwould have mined from 2013 onward and been in this dubious \"first world problem\" of shuffling crypto\nvs usd about is HARD...sheesh ...I'm such a tool. As to dubious other off topic stuff I've done ...Is\nI dumped 2.2 btc into LISK yesterday on that POS coin project. But that is my last hurrah with mining\ndone, adding to the LISK hoard so we will see, it will be interesting to see what I do as well in the\nfuture. But it is getting down to 'brace tack's\" now....Alts are as good as they can get, BTC hoard secure\nsince 2015, big time pow scrypt mining is winding down, what? ICO's (don't trust them) masternodes?\n(same not a clue) trading? can you guys see me trading crypto .you'd have to talk me off a microwave\ntower...maybe that is it, when the fun/glamor/and your confidence goes on wth is going on..perhaps\npulling the plug on some/most is not a bad play...but then again, so many years of being called crazy\nI'd hate for my friends/relatives/etc to be proved right if it all goes tulips....so again, will be interesting\nto see what i do ..i've not a clue\nBrad", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T10:09:51.046+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "45e6030e0d57a8c0d54ba17f38121099dd1d574a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRC9Vm1XEwB07EXjpYwv.lBWDG8rEX3cxxzHpxrDkwMCqR7c_wDn3xLuZ8yeGF_sS.QDVdH5pl40jDbLh.k1IdCfvXOvNp1ri2p4xCPwp.wA--", "site_full": "adrianoampb.deviantart.com", "site": "deviantart.com", "site_section": "https://www.deviantart.com/designs/editorialdes/popular-24-hours/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Browse Editorial Design | Designs &amp; Interfaces | DeviantArt", "title": "How-To-Profit-From-The-Bitcoin-Boom-3D by adrianoampb", "title_full": "How-To-Profit-From-The-Bitcoin-Boom-3D by adrianoampb on DeviantArt", "published": "2018-05-30T09:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.056, "main_image": "https://pre00.deviantart.net/3616/th/pre/f/2018/149/6/9/how_to_profit_from_the_bitcoin_boom_3d_by_adrianoampb-dccx6n5.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 264, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "45e6030e0d57a8c0d54ba17f38121099dd1d574a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRC9Vm1XEwB07EXjpYwv.lBWDG8rEX3cxxzHpxrDkwMCqR7c_wDn3xLuZ8yeGF_sS.QDVdH5pl40jDbLh.k1IdCfvXOvNp1ri2p4xCPwp.wA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "adrianoampb", "published": "2018-05-30T09:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "How-To-Profit-From-The-Bitcoin-Boom-3D by adrianoampb", "text": "How-To-Profit-From-The-Bitcoin-Boom-3D by adrianoampb on DeviantArt", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T07:02:39.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "03be34997fd567907f501436c99e0dd4fd23c594", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNF5guhTi9vtKtOuw3EO.ft.OOxW_qRxRE4yWNKfJ6K_3v.OhnIZ8mwYoH1GsC8HPYzDBhrGZ1OAZuAlxvodLctZY16HGiRz7ew--", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/news-btc", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "NewsBTC - Barchart.com", "title": "Key Points Bitcoin price formed a strong base arou", "title_full": "Key Points Bitcoin price formed a strong base arou", "published": "2018-05-30T09:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.022, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "03be34997fd567907f501436c99e0dd4fd23c594", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNF5guhTi9vtKtOuw3EO.ft.OOxW_qRxRE4yWNKfJ6K_3v.OhnIZ8mwYoH1GsC8HPYzDBhrGZ1OAZuAlxvodLctZY16HGiRz7ew--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aayush Jindal", "published": "2018-05-30T09:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Key Points Bitcoin price formed a strong base arou", "text": "Key Points Bitcoin price formed a strong base around $7,050 and moved higher against the US Dollar.

On the downside, the broken resistance at $7,300 and the 100 hourly SMA are likely to act as supports.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\nHourly MACD \\u2013 The MACD for BTC\\/USD is about to move in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \\u2013 The RSI is currently placed nicely near the 60 level.\nMajor Support Level \\u2013 $7,300\nMajor Resistance Level \\u2013 $7,600\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC\\/USD Signaling Bullish Reversal appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T12:16:45.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1e8e92fe793486b6d0103748ada4a22a6dca2568", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaLK7u3oAs.evNUzAQYF4RZj.eNjaHD8mdXs1tCUA9hvJeekWSyhC7ASc0NVgqMlADsCK109J.6QxHc_QWYrx0mdYjVdDNtb2o", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "A Bitcoin ATM Could Be Coming To A Gas Station Or Vape Store Near You (HBO)", "title_full": "A Bitcoin ATM Could Be Coming To A Gas Station Or Vape Store Near You (HBO) : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-30T09:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1e8e92fe793486b6d0103748ada4a22a6dca2568", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaLK7u3oAs.evNUzAQYF4RZj.eNjaHD8mdXs1tCUA9hvJeekWSyhC7ASc0NVgqMlADsCK109J.6QxHc_QWYrx0mdYjVdDNtb2o", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "HenryK81", "published": "2018-05-30T09:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "A Bitcoin ATM Could Be Coming To A Gas Station Or Vape Store Near You (HBO)", "text": "submitted by /u/HenryK81\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7VvbM04qnM"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T05:08:42.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7c656f058c53d6c07b494f2ef25b69c41b086ce0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTasgqID6w3avdUzXuj78i94dmClUBuvofCBAXbIVV9rvsNINmcheJDaRvcn5WORdREqgJ6mI7hTp5qneA5CbEE", "site_full": "www.derbrutkasten.com", "site": "derbrutkasten.com", "site_section": "https://www.derbrutkasten.com/feed", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "der brutkasten", "title": "Coinbase: Der erste Bitcoin-Gigant", "title_full": "Coinbase: Der erste Bitcoin-Gigant", "published": "2018-05-30T09:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.derbrutkasten.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/coinbase-e1527661406835.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7c656f058c53d6c07b494f2ef25b69c41b086ce0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTasgqID6w3avdUzXuj78i94dmClUBuvofCBAXbIVV9rvsNINmcheJDaRvcn5WORdREqgJ6mI7hTp5qneA5CbEE", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nikolaus Jilch", "published": "2018-05-30T09:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Coinbase: Der erste Bitcoin-Gigant", "text": "join us (c) Coinbase: Asiff Hirji, President & COO, Balaji Srinivasan, der neue CTO und Brian Armstrong, Gründer und CEO analyse von Nikolaus Jilch Coinbase: Der erste Bitcoin-Gigant Coinbase hat sich binnen weniger Jahre als wichtigste Krypto-App etabliert. Die US-Firma tut alles, um ihren Vorsprung zu halten. Aber die Konkurrenz schläft nicht. share our story\nFür fast jeden, der sich in den vergangenen zwei Jahren in die Welt von Bitcoin vorgewagt hat, war Coinbase die erste Station. Die Basis. Die App ist so etwas wie das erste benutzerfreundliche Interface für Bitcoin. Das war auch immer das Ziel der amerikanischen Firma: Den Einstieg in die Welt von Bitcoin so einfach wie möglich zu gestalten. Mittlerweile hat Coinbase 20 Millionen Kunden, 300 Vollzeitmitarbeiter und rund 700 auf Projektbasis Beschäftigte. Das Unternehmen boomt, ganz ohne eigenen Token und ICO. Und man bereitet sich auf noch mehr Kundschaft vor.\nAber man weiß auch, dass die Konkurrenz nicht schläft. In der aktuellen Konsolidierungsphase auf den Bitcoin-Märkten drängen immer mehr Anbieter in den Markt, die einen einfachen und sicheren Zugang zu Kryptowährungen bieten wollen. Revolut bietet Bitcoin an, die Apps Cash und (das von Goldman Sachs finanzierte) Circle genauso. Auch der heimische Anbieter Bitpanda hat sich zum Ziel gesetzt, den Zugang zu Kryptowährungen so simpel wie möglich zu gestalten – und dafür gerade erst ein neues Design präsentiert . Hysterie: Welche Coin wird als nächste gelistet?\nAber Coinbase ist eine Nummer größer. Als es vor einiger Zeit aus den Gerüchteküchen hieß, dass Ripple als fünfte Coin (nach Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum und BCash) auf der Plattform landen könnte, ist der Ripple-Preis gleich gen Himmel geschossen. Die Spekulation dahinter: Was auf Coinbase landet, wird für die vielen Millionen User leicht zugänglich. Außerhalb der hübschen, blauen App ist die Kryptowelt immer noch sehr kompliziert und gefährlich. Deswegen beschränken sich viele Kleinanleger auf die Assets, die von der größten Plattform angeboten werden.\nCharlie Lee, der Erfinder von Litecoin, hat eigens bei Coinbase angeheuert, um die Einbindung seiner Coin sicherzustellen. Mit Erfolg: Litecoin konnte von dem Listing massiv profitieren. Die Ripple-Community hat sich in der Hoffnung auf ähnliche Kurssteigerungen derart in das Coinbase-Gerücht hineingesteigert, dass die Firma ein eigenes Dementi veröffentlichen musste – was dann freilich zu großer Enttäuschung geführt hat. Man sah sich hier wohl zu einer Klarstellung veranlasst, nachdem man bei der Einführung von BCash mit einem Fall von mutmaßlichem Insiderhandel zu kämpfen hatte. Coinbase kauft Paradex um in den Token-Markt zu kommen\nAuch heute sind die Foren voll mit Spekulationen dazu, was als nächstes auf der wichtigsten Crypto-App überhaupt landet. Besonders heiß wird derzeit über ERC20-Token diskutiert. Denn Coinbase hatte bereits lange angekündigt, sich in den Sektor der auf Ethereum basierenden Token vorzuwagen. Einen großen Schritt in diese Richtung hat man mit der Akquisition der Firma Paradex vor wenigen Tagen getan. Die auf dem Ox-Protokoll basierende dezentrale Börse soll Coinbase-Usern den direkten Handel von Token miteinander ermöglichen. Es ist noch unklar, wie man die Technologie von Paradex konkret einbinden will.\nEs war auch nicht der einzige Zukauf, den Coinbase kürzlich getätigt hat. Für eine Summe von mehr als 100 Millionen US-Dollar hat man im April den Dienst Earn.com gekauft und dessen Chef Balaji Srinivasan gleich zum ersten CTO in der Geschichte von Coinbase gemacht. Earn.com will Usern ermöglichen, Geld für die Konsumation von Onlinewerbung zu verdienen. Auch hier ist noch unklar, wie die Technologie in das Angebot von Coinbase eingebunden werden soll. Der Kauf von Earn.com war aber der bisher größte Zukauf von Coinbase selbst. Eine Bewertung von acht Milliarden Dollar?\nLängst wird auch an der WallStreet darüber spekuliert, ob Coinbase nicht die erste große Bitcoin-Firma sein könnte, die an der “echten” Börse gelistet wird. Immerhin gehörte die Firma hinter der New Yorker Börse (NYSE) zu den frühen Investoren. Auch die internationale Großbank BBVA ist schon investiert. Insgesamt rund 225 Millionen Dollar an Investorengeldern konnte man bisher einsammeln. Die Bewertung der Firma liegt derzeit irgendwo zwischen 1,6 und acht Milliarden Dollar – je nachdem, wen man fragt.\nDie acht Millarden-Summe stammt von Coínbase selbst und ist sicherlich hoch gegriffen. In jedem Fall ist es nicht verkehrt, von Coinbase als erstem “Giganten” in der Bitcoin-Welt zu sprechen. Immerhin gibt es die Firma schon weit länger als etwa das erst 2017 gegründete Binance, das derzeit als größte internationale Börse gilt. Auch hat die Plattform aufgrund ihrer Geschichte als US-Unternehmen einen ganz anderen Stellenwert als die oft als windig verschrieenen asiatischen Börsen. Ist Coinbase wie Google – oder eher wie Altavista?\nCoinbase wurde 2012 vom ehemaligen Goldman-Trader Fred Ehrsam Brian Armstrong gegründet . Armstrong, der bis heute CEO ist, war davor als Techniker bei Airbnb tätig. Neben der App betreibt man auch eine eigene Börse (GDAX), die in Zukunft “Coinbase Pro” heißen soll. Überhaupt will man sich jetzt verstärkt auch den institutionellen Investoren zuwenden. Dafür hat man auch einen der ersten großen Krypto-Fonds ins Leben gerufen und die Abteilung Coinbase AM geschaffen. AM steht für Asset Management. In den Fonds können vorerst aber nur Amerikaner investieren, die tiefe Taschen haben. Mindestsumme: 250.000 Dollar.\nWohin Coinbase steuert? “Wir sehen uns nicht als Krypto Börse”, sagte COO Asiff Hirjii jüngst zu CNBC : “Wir konzentrieren uns auf die Etablierung einer Krypto-Ökonomie. Wir sehen uns als Enabler dieser Wirtschaft der Zukunft.” Freilich: Auch Altavista und Yahoo waren einmal “Enabler der Zukunft”. Coinbase hat als First Mover, der sich durchgesetzt hat, einen großen Vorteil. Es ist auch offensichtlich, dass die Firma sich bemüht, an der Innovationsfront nicht nachzulassen. Aber ob das alles reicht, um langfristig zu florieren, werden wir erst in einer fernen Zukuft wissen.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":
