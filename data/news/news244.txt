The software advancement makes blocks big enough to process lots of transactions over time — which gives developers plenty of breathing room to adjust the size if it starts getting closer to its limit. Unfortunately, many misdirected individuals assume the BCH chain will start processing 32MB blocks right away, which could lead to a blockchain chain that's much larger in gigabyte size and takes longer to download. However, this is not the case right now at all, because BCH miners process blocks that are often still under 1MB, as the 32MB code is only set to ensure the network is capable in the future.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Cash Upgrade Milestone Complete: 32MB and New Features\nThe Successful 32MB Block Size Increase Paves a Path for Mass Adoption After the Bitcoin Cash network upgraded yesterday and even before the fork, a few misguided individuals asked why there was a need to raise the block size fourfold when 8MB blocks were not filling just yet. The reason developers raised the limit to 32MB is likely because the software is perfectly capable of handling such a task in the future. Right now block size limits are set by the miner, and developers are there to help set the capacity so blocks cannot get full in the immediate future, and fees will remain low for quite some time. Unfortunately for the Bitcoin Core (BTC) network, Core developers let the block size fill beyond capacity, and fees became unreliable during the last quarter of 2017. The 32MB BCH block size adjustment ensures this will not happen to the BCH network down the road, even when transaction usage becomes as extreme as 2017's last quarter.\nThe Bitcoin Cash (BCH) community and developers are not afraid of forks and protocol upgrades. The May 15th upgrade is the second successful hard fork on the BCH network. Looking at BCH blocks on Coin Dance — a website which records BCH chain data currently shows that mining limits are being set by the mining pool. Over the past nine months, there have been a few 2,4, and 8MB blocks processed, but typically blocks have been a megabyte or less. So in essence, once miners decide its necessary to increase the block sizes they process, they will do so based on transactions and adoption increasing over time. In fact, current data also shows the Bitcoin Core (BTC) chain is still 34.4GB larger than the Bitcoin Cash chain.\nAfter the block size increase miners are not processing 32MB blocks, the upgrade was meant to ensure they can handle that capacity in the future. Transaction Data Shows Daily BCH Transactions Has Increased by 186% in Nine Months At the moment Bitcoin Cash transactions per day are less than BTC as there are roughly 20-25,000 daily BCH transactions. But there's also been a misdirected notion that the BCH chain isn't getting much use, but this is simply untrue as data shows over the past nine months that BCH daily transaction percentage rates have increased . The decentralized currency BCH has seen a steady incline (186%) of use since the August 1 fork and the expansion of BCH transactions are now only 5-10,000 transactions less per day than the Litecoin (LTC) network — a cryptocurrency that has been around for 7 years. This is due in part to many Bitcoin Cash-based on-chain platforms like the tipping bot Tippr , the social media apps Memo and Blockpress , and other applications that help increase BCH usage.\nIn just nine months Bitcoin Cash has more than doubled its transaction count, and the BCH daily transaction rate is just below LTC's daily transactions per day. 32X the Capacity is Merely Preparation for the Future of Bitcoin Cash Adoption Essentially the bottom line is the software is now capable of processing 32MB blocks as it was previously capable of 8MB blocks. So far BCH miners had proven the capability of mining much larger blocks than 1MB multiple times clearing thousands of transactions from the mempool. After the successful fork on May 15, some BCH supporters are already asking developers to remove the block size limit entirely.\nThe hilarious TX Highway has updated to 32 lanes. Moreover, we know from testing that the Bitcoin software is capable of processing gigabyte blocks, and research studies further suggest the network could handle terabyte blocks as well. Unlike other digital asset developers, BCH programmers have set the bar high for capacity based on the known advancements in scaling a cryptocurrency network. Instead of saying \"we don't need to scale now,\" the 32MB increase establishes a base block size that can efficiently handle 32X more transactions than the BTC network's highest daily transaction rate recorded this past December.\nWhat do you think about the 32MB block size upgrade? Do you think that the developers should remove the capacity limit entirely? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.\nImages via Pixabay, TX Highway, Bitinfocharts.com, and Coin Dance.\nDo you agree with us that Bitcoin is the best invention since sliced bread? Thought so. That's why we are building this online universe revolving around anything and everything Bitcoin. We have a store . And a forum .

I woudn't say that it is impossible for bitcoin to be priced 60k in 2018 as bitcoin has already proved many people's prediction wrong that it woudn't reach some \"X\" price but I would say that it will be very difficult for bitcoin to reach 60k this 2018.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T20:54:37.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "655b1a4c16017456f6fef846649374e44e2516f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.skqcIJfMtydsJwRNtBMuwXQKWvQ9mRQPgWmbwbEAg_d1qI9BSsInrkRtjVQm8dgit32AR9rKZrAz", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "I Hope Bitcoin Will Be Internet's 'Native Currency': Jack Dorsey of Twitter, Square", "title_full": "I Hope Bitcoin Will Be Internet's 'Native Currency': Jack Dorsey of Twitter, Square", "published": "2018-05-17T00:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "655b1a4c16017456f6fef846649374e44e2516f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.skqcIJfMtydsJwRNtBMuwXQKWvQ9mRQPgWmbwbEAg_d1qI9BSsInrkRtjVQm8dgit32AR9rKZrAz", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-17T00:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "I Hope Bitcoin Will Be Internet's 'Native Currency': Jack Dorsey of Twitter, Square", "text": "I Hope Bitcoin Will Be Internet's 'Native Currency': Jack Dorsey of Twitter, Square\n/u/IWriteCrypto\nsubmitted by /u/IWriteCrypto\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T00:48:27.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "50335976e489b75946f0fea4d4c30138f2ae68b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTk_cql8xpr5X0rNtUm911M-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin is", "title_full": "Bitcoin is", "published": "2018-05-17T00:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "50335976e489b75946f0fea4d4c30138f2ae68b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTk_cql8xpr5X0rNtUm911M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Magic Sarap", "published": "2018-05-17T00:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin is", "text": "Quote: from: nokati on February 06, 2018, 12:54:17 AM As it seems that more and more when do I get rich, when do I sell and o shit we are going to crash topics pops out....maybe its not so a bad ideee to read something else.\nIn the first time since ever, you got the chance to have financial freedom and the power to break the invisible chain of slavery that you carry.\nNo war:\nAs your shitty gov cant put you, your soon and your unborn grandson in debt and pay the guns.

(OTCQB: CIIX), a fintech company providing Chinese-speaking investors financial education, recently announced the launch of a cryptocurrency and blockchain talk show titled “Bitcoin Talk Show.” This new program will begin airing the first week of June 2018 on the Phoenix North America Chinese Channel. The 22-minute talk show has entered into a contract to air monthly for one year and broadcast to audiences in North America, as well as to be aired on the ChineseFN and Newcoins168.com YouTube channels.\nThe launch of Bitcoin Talk Show is only one key part of the company’s strategic plan to provide Chinese investors with essential cryptocurrency investment education and trading tools. CIIX provides real-time market commentary, analysis and education-related services in Chinese language character sets and is set to expand into retail facing services. The company’s platforms include: Bitcoin Multimillionaire, the first daily cryptocurrency newscast from the New York Stock Exchange in the Chinese language, which was launched in 2017; www.NewCoins168.com , a free cryptocurrency and blockchain website providing the latest news and investment education in the Chinese language, which was launched in November 2017; Bitcoin Talk Show, to be aired on Phoenix North America, a free channel offered by Time Warner Cable, and available on YouTube beginning the first week of June 2018; Bitcoin Trading Academy LLC, set to launch in June 2018, which will offer online and live courses focused on basic knowledge about bitcoin, alternative cryptocurrencies and vetting new coin offerings (Additional course offerings can be found at www.NewCoins168.com ); and CIIX intends to acquire XBTeller.com and its nine ATM locations throughout Colorado in order to expand its current cryptocurrency and blockchain business to include retail-facing services.\nCIIX recently spun off its ventures in the cannabis industry into a private company to focus solely on its initial vision of financial consulting. “As the company continues its expansion into the cryptocurrency space, we anticipate a 30% increase in revenues from last year, resulting in three consecutive years of revenue growth since 2016. This is an exciting time for ChineseInvestors.com, Inc. as the company’s fiscal year comes to an end on May 31, 2018,” Warren Wang, CEO of ChineseInvestors.com, Inc., stated in a news release.

I'm guessing it is hardware, however gettxoutsetinfo is supposed to take a while. I switched my node over to a spare PC (3ghz 4gb ram)as my node, it responds much quicker to the getinfo getmininginfo and other RPC calls, less than 1 second. – m1xolyd1an Jan 7 '16 at 5:07 1 1 GB of RAM seems low for bitcoind, and 99 MB of swap doesn't help much. top should show a state for the bitcoind process. If it's in state R most of the time, then CPU is probably the bottleneck. If state D, then it may be I/O (including swapping / paging). – Nate Eldredge Jan 7 '16 at 7:17 There's about 15 \"bitcoind\" threads and most are in state S. One is in state D. – pinhead Jan 7 '16 at 7:21 I can't contribute much to the resolution of that problem, except stating that I have the exact same (with RPi 2 running Raspbian Jessie, headless). In my case bitcoin-cli gettxoutsetinfo doesn't even return anything but an empty dict. I guess it times out or something, but it does this at highly varying intervals, sometimes after 5 minutes, in one extreme case after almost 40 minutes. – user30582 Jan 16 '16 at 12:31 I filed a ticket on github/bitcoin and got 1 reaction saying that on a RPi 2 average response time was around 7 minutes. With results! Not an empty dict like I'm getting. The difference is that my Bitcoind is compiled with the --disable-wallet option.

May 16, 2018\nBy Pareen Lathia Every few months, we hear that bitcoin has been banned by some country or the other. As early as 2013, bitcoin was “banned” by Thailand. In 2017, it was big news when China banned bitcoin and the latest news carries a ban by the Reserve Bank of India.\nThe problem is this news is grossly misleading because it is simply not possible to ban bitcoin, or any crypto currency for that matter.\nBitcoin’s price last year was hovering around $1,000 mark whereas right now, it is in the $9,000 range. This is in spite of the all the bans. This does not fit into any market logic. But that is the beauty of crypto currencies. They do not fit into traditional regulatory or banking framework. A different outlook is needed to understand how they work and why they were created in the first place.\nDecentralisation This is because bitcoin and most crypto currencies that run on Blockchain technology are decentralised. It means they do not run on one server or URL or IP address. These virtual currencies run on multiple nodes that can be owned and run by anyone and are usually spread across the globe. There is no central point for the governments to attack or block.\nThis is very similar to Torrent protocol. It is peer-to-peer. At the simplest level, if I hold bitcoin in my wallet and transfer it to your wallet, there is no way any government can block it because this entry of transfer is recorded in a distributed ledger.\nWhat has RBI done? So, what is this ban? If you read the RBI circular, they have never used the words “ban” pertaining to bitcoins. It has only prevented any organisation regulated by the central bank to deal with businesses that have anything to do with crypto currencies. Practically, this means banks will have to stop deposits and withdrawals to and from Indian rupee on crypto currency exchanges. This news spread widely and was seen as a “ban on bitcoin”.\nApart from this, the RBI has issued several warnings about scams and risks related to crypto currencies. It had also said there would be a crackdown on the illegal use of such cryptos.\nBut traders are still buying and selling crypto currencies under a three-month notice period that was issued to all exchanges. Even after that, the RBI or the government cannot technically ban bitcoin. Also, in the latest event, the Delhi High Court has already challenged this circular calling it “unconstitutional” and the apex bank has to present the basis of this restriction on banks to the court.\nPractical implications Other countries like China and the US have already tried banning exchanges, ICOs and mining of crypto currencies. Although those events in 2017 caused the price of bitcoin to fall temporarily, it went on to peak at $19,783 on December 17.\nSince most of the trading happens on international exchanges, banning Indian bourses will only make Indians buy crypto currencies from foreign sources or OTC (over the counter) options because it is simply not possible to track buying, trading or selling of crypto currencies.\nBans in other countries like Japan have also resulted in exchanges moving base to countries with friendlier macro environments like Malta and Estonia. This has only resulted in loss in terms of taxes for the governments of hostile countries.\nFor everyone who is holding any coins, they would transfer it to a wallet or an international exchange and then sell it for USD and convert USD to INR. This just hurts India because we will not even be able to tax this income if this is done in cash. Also, such a scenario exists only until the time enthusiasts can’t buy much with crypto currency.\nBut there are sites that are already accepting crypto currency as a mode of payment. As more tokens emerge and have real usage, it will be difficult to keep them at bay.\nWith bitcoin, we have seen the Streisand Effect in play – which means the more governments try to ban it, the more popular it gets, the more news, the more coverage.\nRegulation The only way to go about this saga is regulation, where checks are in place to ensure customers aren’t duped, taxation on profits and an era where exchanges follow KYC norms and legal compliances are in place. That would make it much safer for Indian citizens to buy, trade and profit from this revolution and be educated about its risks.\nIn February 2018, the US government has called for inter-departmental cooperation and allocated resources with the aim to create new legislation to govern virtual currencies.\nThere is also an opportunity for our country to become the Switzerland of the next century. If one government were to reduce taxes from trading of crypto currencies, the amount of crypto money to come in that country would be mind-boggling.\nThis may seem like a pipedream, but Malta is already going down this path and attracting major Blockchain players, including the largest international exchange at this time with profits of more than 200 million USD – more than profits of many traditional banks.\nEvery government wants to ban it because it undermines the power of Fiat currency – US dollar, Indian rupee and the like. But every government has tried and failed and in 2018, it is accepted that there will be regulation rather than bans.\nThe point of creating bitcoin A lot of believers of bitcoin see it as a way to liberate ourselves from the control of governments and the financial system. The point is to eliminate the need for printing money and more importantly, banks. So, banks moving out of the equation is a cause for celebration in the community rather than seen as a bad thing.\nAs countries grapple with regulation and laws, the crypto currency market cap keeps soaring every year. As they say, nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come.\n(Pareen is a blockchain and crypto currency writer.

Bitcoin Risks Fall Below $8K After 3.5-Week Low by 0\nBitcoin (BTC) bears have unraveled the minor rally in prices since Saturday and are now looking to pull the cryptocurrency below the $8,000 mark, the technical charts indicate. The bears’ comeback comes after bitcoin saw minor gains after the May 12 low of $8,204, but the bulls repeatedly failed to cut through the key falling trendline hurdle.\nAs a result, bitcoin fell to a 3.5-week low of $8,100 on Bitfinex earlier today. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,366 – down 4.7 percent in 24 hours. The above chart shows that bitcoin has dipped below the 50-day moving average (MA), currently located at $8,290.\nAs discussed yesterday, a close (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA would signal resumption of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 and could yield deeper sell-off to $7,800. The rejection at the descending trendline hurdle and a drop to $8,100 has reinforced the bearish view put forward by the short-term moving averages (5-day and 10-day), which are sloping downwards in favor of the bears.\nThe retreat from $8,884 to $8,100 has also established a falling top (lower highs pattern) – a (you guessed it) bearish setup. While the 10-day MA has crossed the 100-day MA from above (bearish crossover), and the relative strength index (RSI) is also biased bearish (below 50.00 and falling).\nAs a result, there is a high probability that bitcoin will now go on to close today (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA and confirm a bear revival. The bad news (for the bulls, at least) continues in the 4-hour chart.

The secretive industry is notoriously hard to track, but an economics-based model could help researchers and policymakers estimate just how much electricity the cryptocurrency requires. Author: 3 SHARES According to a new estimate, the Bitcoin network could be using at least as much energy as all of Ireland. (Photo: Marko Ahtisaari/Flickr)\nLast year, as the price of Bitcoin surged above $17,000, environmentalists began to take note that the cryptocurrency's energy consumption was likely to skyrocket as well. That's because Bitcoin mining—the process by which Bitcoins are created and transactions tracked in a public ledger known as the blockchain—requires electricity. But no one knows exactly how much energythe secretive industry consumes. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\nTo help fill this gap, Alex De Vries, a blockchain specialist at PwC's Experience Center in the Netherlands, outlines a methodology to calculate just how much electricity the Bitcoin network uses in a year in a commentary in the journal Joule . His initial estimate is jarring: At minimum, De Vries found, the network could be using 2.55 gigawatts a year, on par with the energy consumption of the entire country of Ireland.\nThat number comes from estimating the number of devices connected to the Bitcoin network—which is estimated to have at least 10,000 nodes, but those nodes can be either single devices or a group of machines in a mining facility—and the processing efficiency of those machines. However, this approach can only ever provide researchers with a minimum estimate, De Vries writes, \"first of all because the network doesn't contain a single type of machine, but also because it doesn't take cooling requirements into account.\" ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\nAs machines mine for Bitcoin, they can produce as much heat as a space heater. Case in point: Circa 2010, I briefly had a roommate in college who built a computer that mined Bitcoin and heated the living room of a small apartment through a Boston winter. Large-scale mining operations have to counter all that excess heat with cooling technology, which requires additional electricity. But Bitcoin mining companies are usually no more transparent about energy expenditures for cooling than they are about mining.\nSo De Vries turned to economics. More computational power means more Bitcoins, but also greater energy requirements, which cost mining operations money. Naturally, if the costs equal or outweigh the profits, mining Bitcoin no longer makes sense. De Vries used data on the cost and lifespan of mining machines from the manufacturer Bitmain, and electricity use estimates for the machines, to estimate when that equilibrium will be reached and how much electricity the Bitcoin network might be using at that point—a whopping 7.67 gigawatts, it turns out.\nThe economic model could provide policymakers with important insights into a growing industry—especially as countries around the world attempt to scale back energy consumption to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. But it still has its limitations. For one thing, Bitcoin mining machine manufacturers like Bitmain are pretty secretive with their data as well, which means De Vries estimates are still just best guesses. For another, an economic model assumes that actors will behave rationally and get out of the game when the costs exceed profits, but that's not always how it works in the real world.\nThere are many reasons why a person or a company would want to mine Bitcoin at a loss, De Vries notes: the anonymity that Bitcoin provides appeals to some; the fact that the decentralized currency lives up to the libertarian ideal of freedom from a central authority to others; and the high-risk/high-reward nature of the Bitcoin market attracts speculators, to name a few.\nOf course, all of this also depends on the price of Bitcoin, which is notoriously unstable. Today Bitcoin goes for about $8,500—less than half of its peak value in December of last year. Depending on who you ask, Bitcoin is either spiraling or poised to re-bound , but it's also not the only cryptocurrency on the market anymore.

John Oliver dedicated an episode of his HBO show Last Week Tonight to satirize a Wild West industry of “initial coin offerings” underscored by a lack of regulation, irrational decision-making and collusion that would make the Securities Exchange Commission’s Division of Enforcement blush. Through it all, more than one University of Virginia Darden School of Business finance professor remained skeptical of the real underlying value of any cryptocurrency.\nBut underneath all of these cryptocurrencies is a technology many industry experts and leading corporations from JPMorgan Chase to IBM believe has tremendous potential: blockchain. What is Blockchain?\nFor more than 7,000 years, humankind has used ledgers to record economic transactions. Archaeologists say clay tablets were used in ancient Mesopotamia to record simple purchases and sales of basic goods, growth of herd sizes and more.\nThe world has come a long way since clay tablets, though. Modern computing has transformed basic financial ledgers into lightning-fast, highly automated, precisely accurate relational databases. Today, as cybersecurity and transparency emerge as paramount priorities during digital transactions, blockchain technology has the potential to be the next generational improvement in how parties record the exchange of value.\nIn its most abstract sense, blockchain is a new platform technology enabling an improved ability to verify and record the exchange of value among an interconnected set of users. It is a secure and transparent way to track the ownership of assets before, during and after any transaction.\nEach transaction between parties in the network is a “block,” and the cumulative set of transactions across the entire network is the “chain.” Blockchain. The technology enables any network of users to track and trade virtually anything of value.\nBroadly speaking, there are currently two types of blockchains: public and private.\nPublic blockchains are open to anyone, and each use their own digital, “native currencies” (e.g., bitcoin). These native currencies are the required mediums of exchange in order to use the public blockchains to exchange value. Native currencies are needed for two reasons: to compensate network members who verify transactions (called miners) and, given the anonymous or pseudonymous nature of network members, to claim an underlying asset from its issuer.\nA private — or “enterprise” or “permissioned”— blockchain also records the exchange of value between parties in a network, but access to the network is permissioned and not everyone can join it. It is worth noting that since all parties are known to each other in a private blockchain, a native currency like bitcoin is not needed. In general, while specific applications of blockchain technology are still developing, there is a growing consensus that blockchains offer several benefits compared to legacy ledger technologies: Everyone in the network has an identical copy of the ledger. Network rules are democratic and voted on by members. Cryptography protects all data. Digital keys are needed to access transaction records. The ledger is permanent and tamper-resistant. The ledger reflects new transactions in near-real time. “Smart contracts” are possible with blockchain.\nThese benefits enable the development of many potential products and applications for industry. Examples of Blockchain Applications\nIn practice today, most current blockchain products and applications fall into three buckets. Operational Functions in Financial Institutions\nFinancial services institutions expect blockchain to yield operational benefits related to cross-border payments, given reduced transaction, administrative and capital costs; shorter settlement times; and fewer errors, according to Accenture Digital. Asset managers, for example, will also be able to use blockchain for client onboarding, management of model portfolios, trade and order management, regulatory and compliance reporting, real asset transactions, and data management. Operational Functions in Other Industries\nBlockchain applications apply to nonfinancial services industries, too. There are potential applications across enterprises in the consumer packaged goods, government and technology industries, including customer loyalty programs; tax, benefit collection and distribution; medical record keeping; inventory controls; and supply chain management. Smart contracts\nSmart contracts are a type of blockchain transaction that can be thought of as event-triggered, automated pieces of computer code. They can be as simple as “ship the product when we receive the payment” or “distribute dividends to shareholders upon their declaration.” All smart contract transactions are stored on a blockchain, which provides both an audit trail of events and assurance of fulfillment of contract terms.\nBlockchain has the potential to deliver operational cost savings and improvements, better customer experiences, and more seamless interactions between enterprises and customers.\nThere is growing interest in blockchain across diverse industries, and industry leaders have deployed teams of experts to work on how to use it. However, some experts are skeptical that blockchain technology will find a broader home in industry, arguing that transaction ledgers can be easily expressed as relational databases, with current best-in-class database tools more than sufficient for most needs. Views of Regulators\nWhen novel technologies with applications in financial services appear to gather critical mass, regulation follows. The current focus of legislators and central banks appears to be around payments, clearing and settlements. This focus appears to makes sense, too: U.S. payment, clearing and settlement systems process about 600 million transactions per day, valued at over $12.6 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve’s Division of Research & Statistics.\nThe Fed believes that “[blockchain] may represent the most significant development in many years in payments, clearing, and settlement.”\nThere is also the question of whether or how digital “currency” regulations will trickle down to affect blockchain use, and there appears to be regulatory interest connected to how people will ultimately use digital currencies. Considerations for the Future\nAt present, blockchain is a relatively nascent technology that appears to offer valuable product and service applications. Leaders whose businesses might evolve from technological advances need to decide: should they determine how to use the technology and pursue those opportunities, or should they wait until others try it, see how they do and learn from their mistakes?\nThe urgency of this decision may vary depending on industry.\nFinancial services companies may evolve sooner than others. Industries that feature complicated global supply chains, have high degrees of intermediated global payments, require high levels of data security and whose transactions face strong degrees of regulatory scrutiny may be motivated to adopt and deploy blockchain within individual enterprises.\nIf blockchain can deliver products and services that improve the customer experience and the profitability of an enterprise, the organizations that use it may capture a larger, more profitable share of a competitive marketplace moving forward.\nAaron Fernstrom (GEMBA ’15) is associate director of Darden’s Richard A.

Dorsey sat down with Elizabeth Stark of Lightning Labs at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2018 conference in New York City to talk more broadly about his company’s goals for the digital currency.\n“I’m just approaching with the principle that the Internet deserves a native currency. It will have a native currency. I don’t know if it will be bitcoin,” said Dorsey said during Wednesday’s fireside chat, adding:\n“I hope it will be bitcoin. I’m a huge fan.”\nDorsey admits the idea that bitcoin will someday be the basis for all payments made on the Internet remains a topic of debate at Square.\n“We’ve led with that mindset. But there’s still a lot of skepticism and a lot of debate and a lot of fights. But that’s where the magic happens, where creativity happens,” he explained.\nDespite the controversy, Dorsey argues that the vision of open access that bitcoin inspires is fundamental to the role Square has always played in the payments industry. “Any payment that comes across our table, the seller should be able to accept,” he remarked.\nWhen Dorsey first began contemplating how to implement bitcoin payments into the Square platform with Mike Brock, an engineer at the company, the two initially settled on a goal that was grandiose in its simplicity.\nEither one of them, he reasoned, should be able to walk over to the Blue Bottle across the street and buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin without the transaction looking any different than a regular dollar-denominated payment, perhaps without the cashier even knowing that bitcoin was being used.\nAccording to Dorsey, the team had a working solution within a week.\n“It felt amazing. It felt electric. And it felt like something we needed to explore a lot more,” he said. More work to come\nSquare has yet to build a full bitcoin payments solution for merchants and consumers, as it quickly changed direction to work on a buying-and-selling service to be integrated into its Cash App. But Dorsey said that the goal is same as it has always been.\n“We want to go back to that original idea of being able to purchase a coffee with it. And that’s why we’re working with [Lightning Labs],” said Dorsey. “Whatever it takes to get there, we’re going to make sure it happens.”\nDorsey – who counts himself as a fan of the hacker ethos surrounding bitcoin’s rise to fame – claimed that whatever path Square takes to pushing mass adoption of bitcoin payments, it will do so without threatening the openness of the network.\n“There’s so much openness in the community, and I want to make sure nothing in the corporate world threatens that,” he stated, going on to say:\n“We cannot risk hurting what made this possible to begin with … We can’t do any of this without the technology being strong and available for everyone.”\nPhoto by David Floyd for CoinDesk\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Although many were generating significant profits by investing in virtual currencies, a parallel reality has turn into progressively obvious: the energy intake implicit in the approach is firing .\nThis is what a economic economist and blockchain expert Alex de Vries tells in a research that is published these days in the journal Joule , the place he guarantees that the mining and the method related with getting Bitcoin will eat .5 % of entire world electrical energy by the finish of 2018 , as much as Austria. This is in line with the earlier estimates that experienced been created in current months, which indicated that By the end of 2017, .13% of entire world electrical power was currently destined to this stop. &#8220It&#8217s an intense variation when compared to the traditional monetary technique, and this growing need for electrical energy will certainly not assist us accomplish our climate ambitions,&#8221 he claims.

This attribute experienced recently captivated companies committed to the mining of virtual currencies and broken the neighbors, who had been forced to shell out the power surcharge that this entailed in the network .\nVries believes that at some position Bitcoin will take in five % of the globe&#8217s electrical energy , a circumstance in which the levels of vitality utilised would previously be drastically substantial. Makes certain that more investigation is essential in this regard that can aid forecast this electrical use and establish a regulation in this regard. &#8220We do not have a widespread technique to get there at a long term estimate of electrical energy consumption at this time, which is why I hope to open up a dialogue about it, I&#8217m doing this study, but a good deal of individuals should be performing it way too.&#8221\nYou can comment on this and other subject areas in our community\ncomment", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T23:57:52.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4969f0a50f3390e3175637e072a5e8eca027bb9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmY0wfZTllGhNniAODlFiWL0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=74.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Legal", "title": "Have people been forced to pay tax over Bitcoin yet?", "title_full": "Have people been forced to pay tax over Bitcoin yet?", "published": "2018-05-16T23:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.081, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4969f0a50f3390e3175637e072a5e8eca027bb9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmY0wfZTllGhNniAODlFiWL0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "makolz26", "published": "2018-05-16T23:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "Have people been forced to pay tax over Bitcoin yet?", "text": "Quote: from: BUK2016 on May 14, 2018, 09:07:16 PM Well, payment of tax from one earning in crypto currency should be a voluntarily and not by force, but who ever go contrarily against the law of his or her country will definitely face the full rout of the law no doubt am sure is happening in some part of the world.\nBut if in your country it is required then you are just forced to pay for it, since you don't have any choice but to pay for your tax with your income and that includes income cryptocurrency, if in our country they will require too then I will just have to follow rules rather than putting my name in danger.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T19:45:02.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "82426ef8eb999b6b11f650699567987a0704e869", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2j4cOLpiusN4s7vrWd83Yy.GdhrLjmzNGQimFt6.xKl2.MnycRasQ8B8G0C21yu49j1hf5W9.yd_8sx5BtRyjacRIs_53_BKxM", "site_full": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "http://TheBitcoinNews.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "The Bitcoin News – Leading Bitcoin News and Cryptocurrency News", "title": "32MB Blocks Means Bitcoin Cash is Prepared for Mass Adoption", "title_full": "32MB Blocks Means Bitcoin Cash is Prepared for Mass Adoption", "published": "2018-05-16T23:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/COdeCover-768x768.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "82426ef8eb999b6b11f650699567987a0704e869", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2j4cOLpiusN4s7vrWd83Yy.GdhrLjmzNGQimFt6.xKl2.MnycRasQ8B8G0C21yu49j1hf5W9.yd_8sx5BtRyjacRIs_53_BKxM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin.com", "published": "2018-05-16T23:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "32MB Blocks Means Bitcoin Cash is Prepared for Mass Adoption", "text": "32MB Blocks Means Bitcoin Cash is Prepared for Mass Adoption May 16, 2018 110\nOn May 15, 2018, the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network upgraded the chain’s base block size from 8MB to 32MB. The software advancement makes blocks big enough to process lots of transactions over time — which gives developers plenty of breathing room to adjust the size if it starts getting closer to its limit. Unfortunately, many misdirected individuals assume the BCH chain will start processing 32MB blocks right away, which could lead to a blockchain chain that’s much larger in gigabyte size and takes longer to download. However, this is not the case right now at all, because BCH miners process blocks that are often still under 1MB, as the 32MB code is only set to ensure the network is capable in the future.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Cash Upgrade Milestone Complete: 32MB and New Features The Successful 32MB Block Size Increase Paves a Path for Mass Adoption\nAfter the Bitcoin Cash network upgraded yesterday and even before the fork, a few misguided individuals asked why there was a need to raise the block size fourfold when 8MB blocks were not filling just yet. The reason developers raised the limit to 32MB is likely because the software is perfectly capable of handling such a task in the future. Right now block size limits are set by the miner, and developers are there to help set the capacity so blocks cannot get full in the immediate future, and fees will remain low for quite some time. Unfortunately for the Bitcoin Core (BTC) network, Core developers let the block size fill beyond capacity, and fees became unreliable during the last quarter of 2017. The 32MB BCH block size adjustment ensures this will not happen to the BCH network down the road, even when transaction usage becomes as extreme as 2017’s last quarter. The Bitcoin Cash (BCH) community and developers are not afraid of forks and protocol upgrades. The May 15th upgrade is the second successful hard fork on the BCH network.\nLooking at BCH blocks on Coin Dance — a website which records BCH chain data currently shows that mining limits are being set by the mining pool. Over the past nine months, there have been a few 2,4, and 8MB blocks processed, but typically blocks have been a megabyte or less. So in essence, once miners decide its necessary to increase the block sizes they process, they will do so based on transactions and adoption increasing over time. In fact, current data also shows the Bitcoin Core (BTC) chain is still 34.4GB larger than the Bitcoin Cash chain. After the block size increase miners are not processing 32MB blocks, the upgrade was meant to ensure they can handle that capacity in the future. Transaction Data Shows Daily BCH Transactions Has Increased by 186% in Nine Months\nAt the moment Bitcoin Cash transactions per day are less than BTC as there are roughly 20-25,000 daily BCH transactions. But there’s also been a misdirected notion that the BCH chain isn’t getting much use, but this is simply untrue as data shows over the past nine months that BCH daily transaction percentage rates have increased . The decentralized currency BCH has seen a steady incline (186%) of use since the August 1 fork and the expansion of BCH transactions are now only 5-10,000 transactions less per day than the Litecoin (LTC) network — a cryptocurrency that has been around for 7 years. This is due in part to many Bitcoin Cash-based on-chain platforms like the tipping bot Tippr , the social media apps Memo and Blockpress , and other applications that help increase BCH usage. In just nine months Bitcoin Cash has more than doubled its transaction count, and the BCH daily transaction rate is just below LTC’s daily transactions per day. 32X the Capacity is Merely Preparation for the Future of Bitcoin Cash Adoption\nEssentially the bottom line is the software is now capable of processing 32MB blocks as it was previously capable of 8MB blocks. So far BCH miners had proven the capability of mining much larger blocks than 1MB multiple times, clearing thousands of transactions from the mempool. After the successful fork on May 15, some BCH supporters are already asking developers to remove the block size limit entirely. The hilarious TX Highway has updated to 32 lanes.\nMoreover, we know from testing that the Bitcoin software is capable of processing gigabyte blocks, and research studies further suggest the network could handle terabyte blocks as well. Unlike other digital asset developers, BCH programmers have set the bar high for capacity based on the known advancements in scaling a cryptocurrency network. Instead of saying “we don’t need to scale now,” the 32MB increase establishes a base block size that can efficiently handle 32X more transactions than the BTC network’s highest daily transaction rate recorded this past December.\nWhat do you think about the 32MB block size upgrade? Do you think that the developers should remove the capacity limit entirely?

Bitcoins and benjamins: Which is the real currency? David McBee/Pexels Messenger\nOne of the hot questions regarding the bitcoin since the first ones were created in January 2009 is its real value. According to Warren Buffett, the most influential investor in the world, the answer to this question would be: not much .\nWe will try as well to answer to this question using two concepts in economics and finance: minimal (or residual) value and Ponzi schemes. The minimal value approach is a prudent approach. Under this approach we would like to know what value remains when everything goes wrong as in cases of market disruption or economic crisis. Value as a currency or value as an investment?\nBefore we try to value a bitcoin we would need to define it as a currency or as an investment. Its use as a means of payment with some merchants can lead us to see the bitcoin as a currency not tied to a country and without central bank.\nBitcoins are usually measured in terms of their exchange rate to the Japanese Yen and US dollar as these two currencies remain the main currencies for which bitcoins are exchanged .\nWe will now try to value bitcoins as a currency using the minimal-value approach.\nAll major currencies have a central bank that monitors the exchange rate of their currency respective to other currencies and mostly to the dollar. Contrary to most traded currencies, bitcoin does not have a central bank or an entity monitoring its exchange rate. Therefore, bitcoin exchange rate to the dollar or to the Japanese yen could theoretically go down to zero.\nAs some academics and practitioners would qualify it bitcoin cannot be considered as a currency but as an investment. In finance, we would measure an investment’s intrinsic value as the sum of future revenues it generates (with a discount to account for time ). Bitcoins do not generate any present or future revenues. Therefore, as an investment and using a minimal value approach bitcoins have a zero minimal value. Is the bitcoin the new gold?\nSome assets do not generate revenues, the best known unproductive asset being gold. Bitcoin has frequently been compared to gold given that it cannot be considered as a currency but like an investment that generates no revenues. Using our minimal-value approach, we can assume that gold has a minimal market value due to its industrial use . Indeed, the value as an industrial good of gold would become the minimal value even if it would have no value as a financial investment. Again, bitcoin at this stage does not have any industrial use and could not pretend to such minimal value.\nThat said, to avoid a totally biased view of the bitcoin, we could argue on one potential value for it as an investment – finance methods see a value in diversification. For asset managers with large investment portfolios, one value of bitcoin could therefore come from the fact that bitcoin is not fully correlated to financial markets. Warren Buffett, Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, in 2013. Fortune/Flickr , CC BY Or maybe a Ponzi scheme\nThen after all we have seen, why do bitcoins have a value on the market? As Warren Buffet puts it, “All you’re counting on is the next person is going to pay you more” . This answer corresponds to the definition of a Ponzi scheme.\nA Ponzi scheme can be defined as a dishonest investment scheme where older investors are paid by new entering investors. For the Ponzi scheme to work you need to have a continuous stream of new investors. In this type of system only one manager works at attracting new investors. In the case of bitcoin, the specificity relies on the fact that all owners become bitcoin managers in most cases without knowing it.\nPonzi schemes do not usually give solid grounds for an asset value. Again, assets valued through a Ponzi scheme end up having no value once the Ponzi scheme unravels or collapses. Ponzi schemes usually collapse in times of crisis, when it lacks new entrants or when people try to massively withdraw from it . If the bitcoin system proves to be a Ponzi scheme, the next economic downturn may soon unravel it and bring down bitcoin to its minimal value: not much.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.coinhills.com/market/currency/", "https://www.wired.com/2011/11/mf_bitcoin/", "https://geology.com/minerals/gold/uses-of-gold.shtml", "https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answersponzihtm.html#PonziCollapse", "https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-31/bitcoin-is-the-new-gold", "http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/26/technology/davos-bitcoin-currency-asset/index.html", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "https://www.lifewire.com/big-sites-that-accept-bitcoin-payments-3485965", "https://www-sciencedirect-com.revproxy.escpeurope.eu/science/article/pii/B9780128021170000023", "https://www.pexels.com/photo/bitcoins-and-u-s-dollar-bills-730547/", "https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/valuation/dcf-formula-guide/", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/07/warren-buffett-on-bitcoin-it-doesnt-produce-anything.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david mcbee/pexels messenger one", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T04:47:01.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "183d6dcfdd13c2d5a49418ccd4c3e48a3008388f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZbm4LYxckvXkudkyoot6xE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "WHAT IF the GOVERNMENT wins over BITCOIN?", "title_full": "WHAT IF the GOVERNMENT wins over BITCOIN?", "published": "2018-05-16T23:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.067, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "183d6dcfdd13c2d5a49418ccd4c3e48a3008388f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZbm4LYxckvXkudkyoot6xE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ninjaeth", "published": "2018-05-16T23:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "WHAT IF the GOVERNMENT wins over BITCOIN?", "text": "now the technology can not be defeated in any way, progress will not be stop, crypto anarchists will not allow the state to control bitocoin Cool", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T21:02:37.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ef95e97b0df8a599d90e3bc78ca23b5ff95d9b66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1qkezUz2HfD_.MdZwBb4t0S", "site_full": "nigeria.shafaqna.com", "site": "shafaqna.com", "site_section": "http://nigeria.shafaqna.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nigeria News (News Reader) |", "title": "32MB Blocks Means Bitcoin Cash is Prepared for Mass Adoption", "title_full": "32MB Blocks Means Bitcoin Cash is Prepared for Mass Adoption", "published": "2018-05-16T23:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5727, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ef95e97b0df8a599d90e3bc78ca23b5ff95d9b66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1qkezUz2HfD_.MdZwBb4t0S", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T23:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "32MB Blocks Means Bitcoin Cash is Prepared for Mass Adoption", "text": "9 hours ago 32MB Blocks Means Bitcoin Cash is Prepared for Mass Adoption On May 15, 2018, the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network upgraded the chain s base block size from 8MB to 32MB.

The software advancement makes blocks big enough to process lots of transactions over time — which gives developers plenty of breathing room to adjust the size if it starts getting closer to its limit. Unfortunately, many misdirected individuals assume the BCH chain will start processing 32MB blocks right away, which could lead to a blockchain chain that’s much larger in gigabyte size and takes longer to download. However, this is not the case right now at all, because BCH miners process blocks that are often still under 1MB, as the 32MB code is only set to ensure the network is capable in the future.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Cash Upgrade Milestone Complete: 32MB and New Features The Successful 32MB Block Size Increase Paves a Path for Mass Adoption\nAfter the Bitcoin Cash network upgraded yesterday and even before the fork, a few misguided individuals asked why there was a need to raise the block size fourfold when 8MB blocks were not filling just yet. The reason developers raised the limit to 32MB is likely because the software is perfectly capable of handling such a task in the future. Right now block size limits are set by the miner, and developers are there to help set the capacity so blocks cannot get full in the immediate future, and fees will remain low for quite some time. Unfortunately for the Bitcoin Core (BTC) network, Core developers let the block size fill beyond capacity, and fees became unreliable during the last quarter of 2017. The 32MB BCH block size adjustment ensures this will not happen to the BCH network down the road, even when transaction usage becomes as extreme as 2017’s last quarter. The Bitcoin Cash (BCH) community and developers are not afraid of forks and protocol upgrades. The May 15th upgrade is the second successful hard fork on the BCH network.\nLooking at BCH blocks on Coin Dance — a website which records BCH chain data currently shows that mining limits are being set by the mining pool. Over the past nine months, there have been a few 2,4, and 8MB blocks processed, but typically blocks have been a megabyte or less. So in essence, once miners decide its necessary to increase the block sizes they process, they will do so based on transactions and adoption increasing over time. In fact, current data also shows the Bitcoin Core (BTC) chain is still 34.4GB larger than the Bitcoin Cash chain. After the block size increase miners are not processing 32MB blocks, the upgrade was meant to ensure they can handle that capacity in the future. Transaction Data Shows Daily BCH Transactions Has Increased by 186% in Nine Months\nAt the moment Bitcoin Cash transactions per day are less than BTC as there are roughly 20-25,000 daily BCH transactions. But there’s also been a misdirected notion that the BCH chain isn’t getting much use, but this is simply untrue as data shows over the past nine months that BCH daily transaction percentage rates have increased . The decentralized currency BCH has seen a steady incline (186%) of use since the August 1 fork and the expansion of BCH transactions are now only 5-10,000 transactions less per day than the Litecoin (LTC) network — a cryptocurrency that has been around for 7 years. This is due in part to many Bitcoin Cash-based on-chain platforms like the tipping bot Tippr , the social media apps Memo and Blockpress , and other applications that help increase BCH usage. In just nine months Bitcoin Cash has more than doubled its transaction count, and the BCH daily transaction rate is just below LTC’s daily transactions per day. 32X the Capacity is Merely Preparation for the Future of Bitcoin Cash Adoption\nEssentially the bottom line is the software is now capable of processing 32MB blocks as it was previously capable of 8MB blocks. So far BCH miners had proven the capability of mining much larger blocks than 1MB multiple times clearing thousands of transactions from the mempool. After the successful fork on May 15, some BCH supporters are already asking developers to remove the block size limit entirely. The hilarious TX Highway has updated to 32 lanes.\nMoreover, we know from testing that the Bitcoin software is capable of processing gigabyte blocks, and research studies further suggest the network could handle terabyte blocks as well. Unlike other digital asset developers, BCH programmers have set the bar high for capacity based on the known advancements in scaling a cryptocurrency network. Instead of saying “we don’t need to scale now,” the 32MB increase establishes a base block size that can efficiently handle 32X more transactions than the BTC network’s highest daily transaction rate recorded this past December.\nWhat do you think about the 32MB block size upgrade? Do you think that the developers should remove the capacity limit entirely? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.\nImages via Pixabay, TX Highway, Bitinfocharts.com, and Coin Dance.\nDo you agree with us that Bitcoin is the best invention since sliced bread? Thought so. That’s why we are building this online universe revolving around anything and everything Bitcoin. We have a store . And a forum .

More Investing.com - Cryptocurrencies continued to fall on Wednesday, after Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced it is banning ads for virtual currencies and related products.\nBitcoin was trading at of $8,372.10, falling 4.65% as of 8:19 AM ET (12:19 GMT) on the Bitfinex exchange.\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) will join technology giants Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in banning advertisements of cryptocurrencies on its search engine, Bing. Digital coins are a risk to users because they are not regulated, the company said in a press release.\n“To help protect our users from this risk, we have made the decision to disallow advertising,” said Melissa Alsoszatai-Petheo, advertiser policy manager.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash and EOS (the fourth and fifth largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, respectively) both fell more than 9%.\nBut the price slump might be short-lived…\nBitMEX co-founder and CEO Arthur Hayes projected the price of Bitcoin will surge to $50,000 by the end of 2018 during an interview with CNBC .\nHayes dismissed the downturn in Bitcoin's price during the first quarter, but acknowledged that his firm is making money no matter which way it goes as a margin trading platform.\n\"If it goes up, if it goes down, if you have Bill Gates calling it a fraud… Short it, I don't care. If you think it's going to be $1 million in a few months, great, buy it. I still don't care.

In just one year’s time, the combined market cap of all digital coins rocketed higher by nearly $600 billion, which works out to more than a 3,300% increase on a percentage basis.\nIt’s perhaps the greatest single-year performance we may ever witness for any asset class. Leading that charge was the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, bitcoin.\nEven though bitcoin “only” rose in value by 1,364% last year, which would appear subpar relative to its peers, it’s risen from less than $0.01 in March 2010 to a current value of more than $8,500 per coin. That’s not too shabby of a return in just a shade over eight years!\nIn fact, a $1,000 investment in March 2010, assuming you found someone willing to part with that many bitcoin back then, would have been worth billions of dollars today. A good number of cryptocurrency investors view bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology — the digital, distributed, and decentralized ledger responsible for recording transactions in a transparent and unchanging manner — as revolutionary.\nAfter all, bitcoin was the very first digital currency to become investable back in 2010, and its blockchain offered a means of moving money from one party to another without using traditional banking networks.

Nouri declined to disclose how much he had paid for the cipher exchange, but said a rent like that is usually around USD 1,000. The flashy cars that symbolize the conspicuous consumption among the true believers of Bitcoin had caused a stir earlier when they roared in the streets near the hotel. Another trick came from an upstart mining company called Genesis Mining. The firm hired actors to portray injured bankers who will lose their financial services jobs when Blockchain takes over the industry. The tricks show that the exaggeration surrounding Bitcoin when it exploded into the mainstream last year is still alive and well even after the largest digital currency fell more than 50 percent from its December peak of almost USD 20,000. Genesis said the protest was a “fun way” to show how cryptography can alter banking activity “if they do not adapt to the new world we live in,” according to a publication on its website. Thirty meters away, MK Li stood in front of the revolving doors of the hotel with a sign that said: “Help a VC colleague pay for this expensive conference!” Wearing a pink shirt buttoned with a purple tie, the participant he accepted donations in digital cards, a way to protest the high price he paid for a conference on a technology that sought to eliminate the need for costly intermediaries. Ticket prices ranged between USD 1,499 and 2,999, suggesting that organizer CoinDesk Inc. earned at least USD 12.8 million in revenue from tickets alone. There are also more than 100 sponsors such as IBM, SAP and Microsoft Corp. Inside the hotel, several floors above, an annoying assistant told another, “How is it that this is not a violation of the fire code?” The two stopped at the entrance of a packed room, forcing their necks to take a look at a presentation on cryptographic innovations. The exaggeration is real in Consensus, the biggest of the two dozen events that make up the “Blockchain Week”. So far, the conference, which is expected to attract more than 8,000 people this year, has presented flannels, business suits, cowboy hats and dreadlocks amidst a sea of ​​crypts and blockchain enthusiasts. Sima Baktas, who works for a blockchain startup in Istanbul, wore a T-shirt that read “Satoshi is Female”, a reference to the mysterious and still unknown author of the original white Bitcoin book.

Goes Down, Getting Closer to 8000 USD/BTC", "text": "Bitcoin Wed, 16 May 2018 11:51:00 +0000 Experts say that the Bitcoin exchange rate is now getting closer to 7900-8100 USD/BTC area of support. If the exchange rate decides to test the support area, it may well have a hard time overcoming it right away. However, the bearish scenario – the one promising a move down below 8000 USD/BTC – is obviously not the only viable scenario for the BTC market. Apparently, if the news background improves and turns bullish, this may well change the situation. In particular, there is an annual cryptocurrency conference. It’s called Consensus. It’s currently taking place in New York. The results of the conference (if positive) may eventually back the entire global market of digital currencies. One again, some good news may reverse the situation and bring the BTC exchange rate back to 8800-9600 USD/BTC – the price range the exchange rate used to stay in early May when every other expert was expecting a move above 10000 USD/BTC in a matter of weeks or even days. Now that the situation has changed, they are not in a hurry to specify when the cryptocurrency conquers the resistance level.\n Will Hit $20K, CoinShares Says Publication date: 20 May 08:38 AM Read more » German\n Publication date: 17 May 12:00 PM ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coinmarketcap", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T23:46:53.043+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "88fb853fd704818572b5650710c27c769c7e883c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.sne.YuP9ssPIyNUzq2212kduwdjhl.9BJqnKekNzbAk3qMpiOzYaazC5CnD3Oe7qFQ--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Proof someone actually wants to see bitcoin succeed...", "title_full": "Proof someone actually wants to see bitcoin succeed...", "published": "2018-05-16T22:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "88fb853fd704818572b5650710c27c769c7e883c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.sne.YuP9ssPIyNUzq2212kduwdjhl.9BJqnKekNzbAk3qMpiOzYaazC5CnD3Oe7qFQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-16T22:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Proof someone actually wants to see bitcoin succeed...", "text": "Proof someone actually wants to see bitcoin succeed...\n/u/terr547\nThere are many big entities, well-known public figures, etc. talking big about bitcoin now. From Jamie Dimon bashing it (then suddenly believing in it), what it comes down to is very simple: dollars and cents.\nIf you want to see whether someone believes in bitcoin (or at least wants to profit off it short-term) or not, determine if they have actually bought/traded any. If they're talking big, but doing nothing, you can take what they say with a grain of salt. In order for one's words to have any real import, a person needs to have some skin in the game, have a feel for the market, the sentiment, the community, the people.\nSo when I hear Bill Gates bash bitcoin but refuse to short it, his words then become utter nonsense to me--or rather, what he says will be contrary to what will likely happen. When I hear Warren Buffet bash bitcoin but refuse to learn about the technology, it's the same way.\nActions over words. When someone's actions are requisite to their words, then you can tell they're not trying to pull a fast one on you (usually; sometimes they still can find a way to do so). When someone's actions are contrary to their words, or they do nothing to match their words, their words are either meaningless, or less than meaningless.\nBut ultimately, what it comes down to, is you taking action yourself. You prove you have agency by jumping in, and not simply listening to the projections of others.\nsubmitted by /u/terr547\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "warren buffet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie dimon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill gates", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T22:46:51.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "06fcfe7b2e3b896da8db2c8492f4eae5cd0ebe6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFSi_hlhn0U8JnCc8e6XZW6wdQqamlZgIRgZdnCyysjqINEfjpQpWLn.7yDlj2m3hE2MFQKMGk6H4LdW8a_GvCs2izWqB2BY047CHN7Amf22Vp5AoQYM9ZMJ4bCYi06GywIankCiOHZbIw--", "site_full": "forextv.com", "site": "forextv.com", "site_section": "http://forextv.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "retirement_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "ForexTV", "title": "Alarming Study Suggests Bitcoin Consumes an Astonishing Amount of Energy and It’s Only Getting Worse", "title_full": "Alarming Study Suggests Bitcoin Consumes an Astonishing Amount of Energy and It’s Only Getting Worse", "published": "2018-05-16T22:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "06fcfe7b2e3b896da8db2c8492f4eae5cd0ebe6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFSi_hlhn0U8JnCc8e6XZW6wdQqamlZgIRgZdnCyysjqINEfjpQpWLn.7yDlj2m3hE2MFQKMGk6H4LdW8a_GvCs2izWqB2BY047CHN7Amf22Vp5AoQYM9ZMJ4bCYi06GywIankCiOHZbIw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin News Editor", "published": "2018-05-16T22:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Alarming Study Suggests Bitcoin Consumes an Astonishing Amount of Energy and It’s Only Getting Worse", "text": "Webmaster Tools Risk Disclaimer - By using this web site you agree to its terms and conditions.

From Jamie Dimon bashing it (then suddenly believing in it), what it comes down to is very simple: dollars and cents.\nIf you want to see whether someone believes in bitcoin (or at least wants to profit off it short-term) or not, determine if they have actually bought/traded any. If they're talking big, but doing nothing, you can take what they say with a grain of salt. In order for one's words to have any real import, a person needs to have some skin in the game, have a feel for the market, the sentiment, the community, the people.\nSo when I hear Bill Gates bash bitcoin but refuse to short it, his words then become utter nonsense to me--or rather, what he says will be contrary to what will likely happen. When I hear Warren Buffet bash bitcoin but refuse to learn about the technology, it's the same way.\nActions over words. When someone's actions are requisite to their words, then you can tell they're not trying to pull a fast one on you (usually; sometimes they still can find a way to do so). When someone's actions are contrary to their words, or they do nothing to match their words, their words are either meaningless, or less than meaningless.\nBut ultimately, what it comes down to, is you taking action yourself. You prove you have agency by jumping in, and not simply listening to the projections of others.\nsubmitted by /u/terr547\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "warren buffet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie dimon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill gates", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T22:38:55.101+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd44de6b97c8f697f3e3636b46ce335e912aa1c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSj9kks7Ck.pLpomuZHQZi9jeTicxQ71RExFFU8Wo.K6FG8Nnp9.gDmByrabu9SF9k9W_w3ci1SOLi638A_ggjjdFvSqBGd4evgBizqkuzruzoo0PtJlThD", "site_full": "medium.com", "site": "medium.com", "site_section": "https://medium.com/feed/tag/web-development", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Web Development on Medium", "title": "Build a Bitcoin Price Tracking Chart in Minutes", "title_full": "Build a Bitcoin Price Tracking Chart in Minutes", "published": "2018-05-16T22:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*H9Cr5VSyud9IliwT.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 380, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dd44de6b97c8f697f3e3636b46ce335e912aa1c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSj9kks7Ck.pLpomuZHQZi9jeTicxQ71RExFFU8Wo.K6FG8Nnp9.gDmByrabu9SF9k9W_w3ci1SOLi638A_ggjjdFvSqBGd4evgBizqkuzruzoo0PtJlThD", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Joe Hanson", "published": "2018-05-16T22:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "Build a Bitcoin Price Tracking Chart in Minutes", "text": "mainApp(); Subscriber We now have our publisher to send the pricing updates.

Because the dashboard only needs to receive data and won’t be publishing, we will create the PubNub client with only a subscribe key. var pubnub = new PubNub({ subscribeKey: 'YOUR_KEY_HERE'}); Now we’re going to setup some variables to control how our charts look and act. var pointLimit = 15; //Total amount of points on your graph.var topPadding = 100; // Additional room between the top most point and the top of the chartvar bottomPadding = 100; // Additional room for the bottom of the graphvar eonData = {labels: true,type: 'line'}; // flag for rendering labels with the point and the type of line that will be renderedvar eonAxis = {y: {padding: {top:topPadding, bottom:bottomPadding}}, x: {type: 'timeseries',tick: {format: '%H:%M:%S'}}}; // Formatting the time stamps along the bottom of the graphs.
