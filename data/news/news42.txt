The ED has summoned him for questioning. There's no confirmation of his role in the scam, but some reports claim he was promoting one of Bhardwaj's several platforms through which he duped 8,000 people. Here's all you need to know. Scam: What was the scam about? Bhardwaj was allegedly working with others on creating and maintaining several platforms on bitcoins , including GB Miner and BTC payment gateway. GB Miner, which allowed people to mint and invest their own bitcoins, promised returns as high as 10% per bitcoin. Bhardwaj was helped in this scam by Darwin Labs co-founders Sahil Baghla and Nikunj Jain. Others: Role of prominent IIT alumni and serial entrepreneurs Instead of making promised payments to his 8,000 clients, Bhardwaj fled the country with some help from Baghla and Jain. Investigators recovered emails wherein Darwin and Bhardwaj were discussing appointment of lawyers and CAs for routing their money overseas to evade taxes. For such tasks, the duo received 20% of Bhardwaj's profits. All three were nabbed in April. Fact: Was Kundra a scammer or among the scammed? Kundra's role in this scam isn't known yet. It is also not known whether he was questioned for alleged links to the scammers, including Bhardwaj, or if he was one of the thousands of investors who were cheated of crores. Kundra: Kundra has had a shady history Despite uncertainty in this case, Kundra certainly has a dubious past. Earlier, he had confessed to betting in the IPL, and served a life ban from all cricket-related activities. He challenged the ban in the SC this March. Rajasthan Royals, the team he co-owns, also faced a temporary ban. It made a comeback in the latest season after two years.

Kundra is the husband of Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty .\nKundra was questioned in connection with a Rs 2000-crore Bitcoin scam that ED is probing. His name reportedly cropped up when Amit Bharadwaj, an accused in the case, was being questioned.\nThe Income Tax Department had recently sent notices to bitcoin users who were dealing in bitcoins worth Rs 1 crore or more daily. These names were also forwarded to ED and a probe into possible money laundering and fraud was initiated. It is learnt that many well-known names - especially those of Bollywood celebrities - may come up during investigations.\nWhile the nature of Kundra's questioning is not yet clear, he is not new to controversies and was previously embroiled in the infamous IPL betting scandal.

The landmark ruling occurred on May 30, 2018, and it overturns a decision made by one of the country’s lower courts in a case dating back to last year.\nIn September 2017, the Suwon District Court charged 33-year-old Ahn with the sale and distribution of child pornography. Operating a website since 2013, Ahn was arrested in May of 2017 for disseminating some 235,000 obscene files. Even though the court handed Ahn a guilty verdict and 18 months in prison for his actions, it did not confiscate the 216 bitcoins Ahn accumulated in exchange for the porn.\nAccording to the court, the government could not seize Ahn’s bitcoins because, unlike other assets tied to illicit dealings, they aren’t tangible.\n“It is not appropriate to confiscate bitcoins because they are in the form of electronic files without physical entities, unlike cash,” the court ruled. “Virtual currency cannot assume an objective standard value.”\nNow, the country’s Supreme Court thinks otherwise. The Suwon District Court’s decision was appealed, and, upon being challenged in South Korea’s highest court, it didn’t hold up.\nSeeing as Ahn accrued his digital fortune in exchange for an illegal service, the court reversed the decision and mandated that it is lawful for the government to confiscate it.\n“Korean law stipulates that a seizable hidden asset ranges from cash, deposits, stocks, and other forms of tangible and intangible objects holding standard value,” the ruling from this Tuesday reads. “Bitcoin is intangible and comes in the form of digitized files, but it is traded on an exchange and can be used to buy goods. Therefore, receiving bitcoins is an act of taking profits.”\nAhn’s sentence will remain the same, but he’ll have to forfeit 191 bitcoins, worth roughly $1.4 million at press time along with some $654,000 in cash. Tracking Ahn’s transactions on Bitcoin’s ledger, the court was able to determine how many bitcoins he received as payment.\n“[Ahn] received bitcoins by giving a certain bitcoin address to pornography watchers online. Records stored on the Bitcoin blockchain proved that bitcoins sent to him should be seen as profits online,” the court ruling states.\nThe ruling is a decisive, if roundabout, benchmark for cryptocurrency’s legal status in the country. It gives digital assets like bitcoin enhanced legitimacy at a time when South Korea is also in the process of legalizing and regulating Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). After effecting a domestic ban on ICOs in September of last year, the South Korean government has approached the cryptocurrency industry with ambivalent resolve. Tuesday’s ruling and the outlook of a formal framework for token sales, however, seem to be steering official policy in a clearer, more proactive direction.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .

While the intention is not clear, it has been found that 10 addresses are holding 496,735,539 EOS tokens, which are worth $5.86 billion and represent 49.67% of the existing one billion EOS tokens. 10 Addresses Hold Nearly Half of All EOS Tokens\nEOS has just under 900 million tokens in circulation as the remaining 100 million are held by Block.one, the company behind the initial coin offering. The other nine top ten holder addresses hold just over 400 million tokens. One address holds 75 million, which seems to be linked to another one holding close to 20.6 million (also in the top 10), and one with 13 million. These three addresses together hold approximately $1.5 billion worth of tokens.\nThe cryptocurrency exchanges trading the most EOS volumes , including Bithumb, OKEx, Huobi, Upbit, Bitfinex, and Binance, may be some of the top holders of the altcoin. The top 75 holders have at least $10 million worth of the token, which is 646,595 tokens. There is a total of 163,930 addresses holding any token.\nAs EOS has just launched, the top holders of the token have greater power over the decisions through EOS consensus, given it is decided by token holders’ votes. Large block producers, such as Bitfinex with approximately 10%, hold a significant amount of tokens and can be decisive in a shareholders’ vote.\nA power play could be happening already. EOS New York seems to be a front for Block.one and is calling out EOS Force, a potential competitor, for being part of a scheme designed by BCH investors. EOS Force, on the other hand, is making public announcements of which they have no authority over. The entity said it will start the global public test of the main net on June 3, but much testing and voting remain to be done first.\nThe disproportionate amount of voting power the top ten holders have can be demotivating for investors and users even if the top ten holders were to not abuse their 50% share. From the 169,930 addresses holding tokens, many of which certainly belonging to the same individual or entity, only a few have the ability to make decisions and organize their interests, naturally against the interests of others. Accountability is not, in any way, the name of the game.\nIn the meantime, Block.one is launching its $11.8 billion code with no official launch date. It is also unclear if the EOS is able to launch successfully with such unorthodox modus operandi. At the time of writing EOS was falling with the rest of the altcoins, shedding over 6% on the day down to just over $13.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "billion worth of tokens held", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "billion worth of tokens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "all eos tokens eos", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T14:23:25.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5adf79871e590b0baf30aa2b2ef526ac28d66249", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_pow_.fwohra5IymdkSz8fAnwHmR9V7Md6fXl3BkM5wOhxZCk2lRzCZX5O4OyiD2nAqlRnf94DWCOIqXZ_K7E.alT1KnLMPXlKh4-", "site_full": "iandroidlove.com", "site": "iandroidlove.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Magic Number?

Chart Data Hints at June 6 Bitcoin Boost Telecoms Giant Wants to Move Mobile Data Top-Ups to a Blockchain 3 hours ago\nA major reprieve just may be in the offing for the battered bitcoin bulls in the next 36 hours – if, that is, historical patterns repeat themselves.\nIntriguingly, the cryptocurrency tends to take a significant change of direction on the sixth day of every month.\nHaving topped out in the $20,000 neighborhood in mid-December 2017, the cryptocurrency fell to a 2018 low of $6,000 on Feb. 6. Since then, the cryptocurrency has been restricted to a narrowing price range, as indicated by the triangle pattern in the chart below.\nWhat’s more interesting is that major price highs and lows over that time have formed around the sixth day of every month. BTC daily chart\nThe above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows: Bitcoin bottomed out or turned higher from $6,000 on Feb. 6 and $6,500 on April 6. The lower highs – $11,700 and $9,990 – were created on March 5 and May 5, respectively. The yearly high of $17,252 was also set on Jan. 6.\nClearly, the tide rebounds in favor of the weaker side on, or close to, the sixth day of every month.\nAs of writing, bitcoin is trading at $7,433 on Bitfinex – down 34 percent from the bearish reversal point of $9,990, dated May 6, meaning the bulls are currently on the defensive.\nGoing by the historical pattern, the cryptocurrency seems likely to turn higher in the next 36 hours or so. In this case, bitcoin could revisit triangle (narrowing price range) resistance, currently located at $9,225.\nOn the other hand, long-term technical studies are biased to the bears, which was not the case on previous occasions.\nFor instance, the cryptocurrency has found acceptance below the 50-week moving average for the first time since 2015. Further, a 5-month and 10-month moving average (MA) bearish crossover recently occurred for the first time in four years.\nSo, as always, nothing is guaranteed when it comes to bitcoin price movements. But, just possibly, the cryptocurrency could pick up a strong bid tomorrow, in line with the historical pattern.\nEven so, it would be too early to call a bull reversal, given the bearish long-term technical developments, and traders would want to see more evidence – such as a high volume break above the weekly high of $7,779 – before assuming the bulls were back in charge.\nCalendar image via Shutterstock\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

The pair is now trading well below the $7,550 pivot level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nBitcoin price has moved into a short-term bearish zone below $7,550 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD could correct higher, but upsides are likely to be capped.\nBitcoin Price Analysis\nAfter trading above the $7,700 level, bitcoin price faced selling pressure against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair topped at $7,779 and started a downside move. The price declined and moved below the $7,600 and $7,500 support levels. The most important move was a close below the $7,550 pivot level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nMoreover, there was a break below a major ascending channel with support at $7,520 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair even moved below the $7,400 level a formed a new intraday low at $7,369. At the moment, the price is consolidating losses around $7,400. An initial resistance is around the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,779 high to $7,369 low. Any further gains could push the price towards the $7,550 pivot level, which is a major barrier . Additionally, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,779 high to $7,369 low is at $7,574.\nLooking at the chart , the price likely moved into a short-term bearish zone below $7,550.

The official announcement was made June 4, 2018, almost an entire week after rumors surrounding the acquisition spread like wildfire. Since GitHub hosts the underlying code of a wide variety of open source and proprietary software, many developers, including those working on bitcoin , were less than enthusiastic over Microsoft buying the company. Microsoft and Developer Distrust\nAs a company offering many products and services, many of Microsoft’s recent and past decisions have been somewhat controversial. In the case of the Windows 10 operating system, for example, the company’s reputation has repeatedly been challenged in the open source community for its stance on telemetry – or user data collection. The founder of ProductHunt added to this, stating, “Anecdotally, the developer community is very unapproving of this move. I’m curious how Microsoft manages this and how GitHub changes (or doesn’t change).” Let me just merge this pull re- pic.twitter.com/4U0hBAORDm\n— Kitze (@thekitze) June 4, 2018\nDrawing comparisons with LinkedIn, a company that was also bought by Microsoft in June 2016, Slashdot interviewed a security reporter as stating, “LinkedIn has turned into a slow-loading junk after the Microsoft acquisition. I can only imagine what awaits GitHub.”\nDeveloper communities across the internet were rife with similar comparisons to other companies acquired by Microsoft over the past decade, including relatively well-known Skype and Mojang. Cryptocurrencies and GitHub\nGiven that almost all cryptocurrencies currently on the market are open source, a rather large percentage of them rely on GitHub as a code collaboration tool. A Bitcoin Core developer was quick to react to news of the acquisition, responding that there was indeed a need for bitcoin to move away from using GitHub. “No real hurry, but I expect this is the beginning of a long painful road of gh toward obsolescence, possibly ending the same way as codeplex did.” We’re seeing a 5x increase in new customers today. Thanks for #movingtogitlab everyone! More information is on https://t.co/HGB8tVWhW6 pic.twitter.com/0UgG9Th6Lc\n— GitLab (@gitlab) June 4, 2018\nAt this time, it remains unclear as to where bitcoin development will be taken if its developers were to move away from GitHub. A popular alternative is currently touted to be GitLab, as is evident by the fact that ‘#movingtogitlab’ was trending on Twitter the day of the announcement. The company also reported unprecedented user growth in a tweet , stating “We’re seeing 10x the normal daily amount of repositories.” Developers “Jumping Ship”\nGiven the uncertainty over the future of GitHub under Microsoft’s reign, many open source maintainers have reportedly been considering moving to other Git platforms to host their code repositories. Furthermore, the matter is perhaps of far greater concern to developers and businesses that currently use GitHub to host closed source and proprietary software that requires confidentiality.\nAs TechCrunch reported, the exodus to alternatives such as BitBucket and Gitlab began even before either company officially announced the acquisition. A San Francisco-based developer was quoted on Twitter as saying, “Migrating all my repos from @github to @gitlab. Clients don’t trust Microsoft, I don’t trust Microsoft, and one way or another they are gonna find a way to ruin things.

A great majority of people use centralized exchanges, even though many of them require strict identification policies or have lost funds due to hackers infiltrating their platforms. Over the past couple of years, there has been a proliferation of decentralized exchanges (Dex) that allow digital currency trading without relying on a third party to hold a user’s funds. Unfortunately, people might not be aware that there have been over 200 Dex platforms launched over the past few years, and a Github repository called ‘Index’ allows people to get a comprehensive overview of each decentralized exchange.\nAlso Read: Testing Cryptocurrency Atomic Swaps With Barterdex A List of Decentralized Exchanges of Cryptographic Assets, and Their Protocols\nWhen people think about trading cryptocurrencies they often think about exchanges like Gemini, Coinbase, Bitstamp, and others. These exchanges are deemed centralized because they hold a customer’s funds and the data associated with the person’s account. A decentralized exchange, otherwise known as a ‘Dex,’ the protocol is basically a ‘trustless system’ because it doesn’t hold a user’s funds or require any data. There are a lot of popular Dex platforms that people have been hearing about more recently, and now there’s also a Github repository that gives an in-depth look at all 200+ trading platforms. The repository called ‘Index’ was created by the software developers Hanni Abu, Steven Hatzakis, Manfred Karrer and Elio Osés.\n“This is a list of decentralized exchanges of cryptographic assets (cryptocurrencies, tokens, derivatives, futures) and their protocols, without a central entity,” explains the repository.\nThe architecture of these and their protocols can be quite different from one another. In some cases, they are built projects entirely open source — In other cases, they are closed in some aspects, but still implemented open or decentralized tools or mechanisms like smart contracts that are publicly verifiable. Other projects have chosen to create their own distributed ledger technology (DTL) in order to build a protocol for exchange. The Index lists the decentralized exchange name, URL, repo, documents, Dex grade, status, protocol, reference, asset, DLT, ORG. The Benefits of Dex Platforms Are Great But These Projects Have a Limited User Base and Weak Liquidity\nDex platforms listed on the Index repository include Airswap, Altcoin Exchange , Atomicdex, Bisq , Bancor, Barterdex , Hodl Hodl , Counterparty Dex, Etherdelta, Localcoinswap, Raiden, QTUM Dex, and many more. The list also tells whether or not the Dex is operational, whether the platform has issues, and other types of characteristics. Some exchanges are considered “fully” decentralized while others are not operational.\nFor instance, the Index list features exchanges that offer accountless registration, a decentralized DNS, trustless order matching, and many more methods of decentralization. Out of the 200+ Dex platforms, there are a bunch that are either in their very early beta stages, or some that have been defunct or “dead” for quite some time. There’s still a good handful of “fully” decentralized projects, and Index also details their specific protocol layers and the type of cryptocurrency assets used. There are 200+ Dex platforms listed on Index but many of them have very little users and lack liquidity.\nThe advantages of using a Dex are profound and allow people to trade in a trustless fashion. The chances of losing your money due to an exchange hack is slim to none and you don’t have to reveal your identity which makes your transactions far more private. The disadvantage to Dex platforms right now is mostly lack of traders, and liquidity is also slim to none even on the most popular and fully operational exchanges. However, as more lose money to fallen exchanges and theft, people are slowly starting to migrate to Dex platforms that offer decentralized features.\nIt’s likely centralized exchanges will never go away but a lot of cryptocurrency proponents hope the majority of crypto-trades will take place on these trustless platforms. Lastly, if decentralized exchanges do dominate the way we trade value, then the technology will surely revolutionize our current monetary systems — And it’s a nice day for a revolution.\nWhat do you think of the Github repository Index that features a great variety of Dex platforms?

His evidence? The very short 6-month window showing the correlation between the VIX Index and Bitcoin, as well as the assumption that investors that are pulling their money out of the market and putting it into Bitcoin: ‘ @BrianStutland breaks down why #bitcoin could be the new fear gauge pic.twitter.com/tAYnkbmKds\n— Options Action (@OptionsAction) May 29, 2018\n“If you want to know what the market is going in the next 30 days, look at what bitcoin did 30 days ago. When we overlay the two together, there is huge correlation between VIX and Bitcoin 30 days ago.\nBitcoin is a way for investors to move money off the balance sheet of banks and into their own wallet. Essentially, they are storing them money under their pillow in the form of virtual currency. You’re worried banks are going to have some sort of credit risk. As credit risk increase, we get more volatility.”\nIs it that investors are actually taking money out of the market (pushing stocks down, and VIX up) and into Bitcoin (pushing Bitcoin up) or is it the Bitcoin has marketed itself as the antithesis of markets and every chink in the armor of the establishment (markets) is a feather in the cap for the anti-establishment (Bitcoin)?\nOr is it the blue squiggly line just happens to overlap the red squiggly line (with a 30-day lag) in a purely coincidental curiosity? We’ll take the latter. Just consider the following Marketwatch chart from this Josh Brown blog post showing the high correlation between the Dow “now” and before the great market crash of 1929.\nScary indeed… but now look back at the fine print on the x-axis. That’s the 2012 to 2014 period… not now. Updating that chart with current data would show we’re up several trillions of dollars in market cap or about 73% since then. Jeff Bezos, himself has made more money since the end of that chart than probably 90% of all of humanity has made in the entirety of the world before that time. So, color us a bit skeptical that Bitcoin and VIX lining up for a short stint mean anything significant.\nDisclaimer The performance data displayed herein is compiled from various sources, including BarclayHedge, RCM's own estimates of performance based on account managed by advisors on its books, and reports directly from the advisors.

Leary pointed out that each computer used to “mine” generates 1400 watts — the same as one hairdryer. With hundreds of thousands of these hot machines operating at once, upstate New York’s climate is ideal for reducing air-conditioning costs.\nCryptocurrency “mining” is essentially math done by high-powered computers. In order to trade bitcoin, transactions need to be verified through complex math equations, then and added to what’s known as a “distributed ledger.” In return for solving equations “miners” receive bitcoin.\nOperations are already underway at the former Alcoa East Facility complex, and are projected to be at full capacity within a year. The 435 Megawatt mining center is expected to be the world’s largest digital currency data processor, based on capacity, Coinmint said.\nMost of Coinmint’s competitors are overseas. Bitmain is the leader in the industry, and raked in record profits as bitcoin skyrocketed to almost $20,000 last year. The Chinese company likely made as much $3 billion to $4 billion in operating profit in 2017, as much as chipmaker Nvidia did last year, according to Bernstein analysts estimates.\nCoinmint is looking to hire around-the-clock staff, and plans to tap the local community to hire staff from security personnel to electricians, to highly- trained IT staff.\n“We in Massena, would like to welcome Coinmint to our town,” Steve O’Shaughnessy, Massena Town Supervisor said in a statement Tuesday. “The thought of 150 jobs and revitalization of the Alcoa East Facility is exciting and what we have been working for.

Slovenia has announced that its largest shopping center — coincidentally known as BTC City — will transform into a complete bitcoin city , in which every store and venture will accept cryptocurrency and operate via blockchain technology. The complex, located in the country’s capital of Ljubljana, stretches over 1,558,398 square feet and contains over 500 retail stores. Prime Minister Miro Cerar recently visited the shopping center, where he was treated to a cup of coffee (purchased with cryptocurrency by State Secretary Tadej Slapnik). Details regarding the center’s newfound approach to bitcoin are being headed by fintech startup Eligma. “The purpose of his visit was to open the Beyond 4.0 international conference, dedicated to digital society and blockchain, and to get acquainted with BTC City’s strategy to become a Bitcoin City,” said BTC City representatives. BTC City initially began in 1954 as a warehouse and logistics center. More warehouses were added to the complex over time, and, by 1990, it had transformed into a commercial shopping arena. BTC City presently plays host to several travel and tourism ventures including a luxury hotel and casino, a multiplex cinema, a waterpark and the Crystal Palace office park — home to Slovenia’s tallest building. Executives of BTC City say they’re hoping Bitcoin City will give rise to new businesses that push the cryptocurrency space toward mainstream territory and lead to further blockchain developments. “Bitcoin City will create an open society which will enable users to pursue their missions as well as develop their business environments in line with their wishes, needs and operating policies,” they said. Eligma’s cryptocurrency transaction system Elipay is being installed in several stores. Situated throughout the premises are also several one-way cryptocurrency ATMs, along with the Blockchain Think Tank and what executives call the biggest crypto mining rig in Slovenia. Representatives further commented, “The development of BTC City into a bitcoin city is an important step toward the realization of BTC’s openness-oriented strategy, providing its customers and business partners with both freedom and choices regarding their purchases with new forms of payment.” This article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .

Developers have taken measures to increase the difficulty of future attacks. The event-ticketing platform Ticketfly is also trying to recover from a hijack. 26 million accounts have been reportedly compromised by a hacker who asked for bitcoin ransom. Also read: This Week in Bitcoin: Digital Money Makes the World Go Round Zencash Attacked with Two Double-Spends The Zencash network has been targeted in a 51% attack on Saturday, June 2. The attacker managed to successfully perform two double-spend transactions while reorganizing the blockchain multiple times and reverting 38 blocks in the longest reorganization. According to a released statement, the Zencash team received warning of potential attack from a pool operator and took measures to raise the difficulty of future attacks on the network, contacting exchanges to increase confirmation times and recommending a minimum of 100 required confirmations. Advertisements\nThe attacker(s) caused the reorganizations of the blockchain between blocks 318165 and 318275. They performed the double-spend attacks in blocks 318204 and 318234 – for 13,000 and 6,600 ZEN, respectively, worth more than $550,000 at current prices. According to the forensic analysis conducted with the affected exchange, the suspect pool address is znkMXdwwxvPp9jNoSjukAbBHjCShQ8ZaLib and the suspect exchange deposit address is zneDDN3aNebJUnAJ9DoQFys7ZuCKBNRQ115. At the time of the attack the network’s hashrate was 58MSol/s. Developers believe that the attacker has a private mining operation large enough to conduct the attack and/or supplement with rental hash power. Zencash is a proof of work coin based on the equihash algorithm. All equihash-based networks are exposed to possible influx of new equihash power, the team noted. Ticketfly Hijacked by Hacker, Trying to Recover Ticketfly has been reportedly attacked by a hacker who breached its website last week and demanded a ransom in bitcoin to release it. The event-ticketing platform is still trying to recover from the “cyber incident.” “We’re working to bring ticketfly.com back up as soon as possible,” its team said, notifying users that the site is offline. In correspondence with Motherboard, the supposed hacker claimed to have warned Ticketfly of a vulnerability that allowed him to take control of its database and website. The hijacker asked for 1 bitcoin (BTC) to explain the issue in details but did not receive a reply. According to the publication, after no ransom was paid, the attacker posted the user data online. “We have learned that some customer information has been compromised as part of the incident, including names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers of Ticketfly fans,” the company admitted without revealing how many accounts have been affected. According the data breach tracking website haveibeenpwned.com, more than 26 million accounts have been compromised, Marketwatch reports.\nIt’s unclear whether any event tickets have been stolen but a number of promoters, clubs and upcoming shows have been affected by the breach. Ticketfly is owned by San-Francisco based Eventbrite, which bought the platform from Pandora Media in a $200 million deal about a year ago. Avalon Blockchain Unwinds Acquisition of Crypto Assets Avalon Blockchain Inc., formerly known as World Mahjong Ltd., has announced it has reached an agreement with Avalon Life S.A. to unwind the acquisition of crypto mining assets and cryptocurrencies it has previously bought. According to a press release, the two sides have not been able to reach a consensus in regards to the holding, conversion, trading, and arbitrage of the acquired digital currencies. World Mahjong Limited, a provider of online games and entertainment services, decided to enter the crypto sector through the acquisition of crypto mining abilities and cryptocurrency assets from the mining and community knowledge network Avalon Life SA and Avalon Projects Canada Inc. More than 27,000 ASIC mining machines were purchased, along with a number of Dash, Vivo, and Pura coins.\nEarlier this year it was reported that the company had also changed its name to Avalon Blockchain. In its latest statement, however, it said it was unable to execute its proposed business plan involving these crypto assets. Following the agreement with the vendor, Avalon Blockchain will return them to Avalon Life SA and will arrange the cancellation of 120,000,000 common shares that have been issued. Avalon Projects Canada Inc., a subsidiary of Avalon Blockchain, has completed the offering of 37,154,502 subscription receipts, at a price of $0.50 each. The company now intends to allow subscribers to rescind their subscriptions. All of them will be offered the option and will be entitled to a full refund of all subscription proceeds tendered to the company. What are your thoughts on today’s topics in Bitcoin in Brief?

Both digital assets saw a major increase in global trading volume compared to the month prior. BTC held steady, averaging $200 billion a month, but ripple didn’t fare so well, recording trading volume that was down 86% since January, mirroring its decline in price.\nAlso read: Decentralized Exchange Compendium ‘Index’ Lists Over 200 Dex Platforms Bitcoin Cash Is May’s King of Coins\nThere are various ways to measure a cryptocurrency that’s in demand, with trading volume the most useful indicator after price. A lot of bitcoin cash changed hands in May – 140% more than in the month prior in fact. Diar’s weekly update highlights the big winners and losers in the cryptocurrency market in May, and shows the substantial demand for BCH. In total, $30 billion of bitcoin cash changed hands in May. The next biggest gainer was ethereum, whose trade volume was up 50% on April, resulting in monthly trading volume of over $80 billion.\nMost major cryptocurrencies saw an increase in trading volume in May including litecoin, which had a modest increase. There was one notable loser however – ripple. XRP trading volume has been on the decline since January, back when $100 billion of tokens were traded in a month, pushing the price of XRP north of $3. Reality has since settled in, and May saw just $16 billion of ripple traded. Fake Volume Rears Its Head\nWhen it comes to analyzing trading volume, one topic that often crops up concerns fake volume. Exchanges and their traders are frequently accused of creating orders that they have no intention of fulfilling, which creates a false impression of liquidity. If traders are doing so, it’s likely bot-based as a means of market manipulation in the pursuit of profit. If exchanges are responsible, it’s likely to make their platform look more popular than it is, and to benefit from the additional custom that comes from being a top ranked global exchange by volume.\nBinance is the latest exchange to have faced accusations of fake volume, with certain coins displaying unusually high volume for short periods of time, comprising fluctuations that appear outwith normal trading patterns. Given the hundreds of thousands of traders who can be using a platform such as Binance at one time, including countless bots connected via API, determining which orders are real, which are fake, and who’s responsible for any manipulation, is virtually impossible.\nDo you think fake volume is a problem on major exchanges?

Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space GMO Miner B2 Specs\nJapanese internet giant GMO announced the details of its bitcoin mining rigs called “GMO miner B2” in a press conference on Tuesday, June 5, ahead of the actual launch that is scheduled for the morning of the following day, June 6.\nNikkei reported:\nThe GMO miner B2 features a semiconductor chip ‘GMO 72b’ dedicated to mining that adopts the in-house developed 7-nanometer process technology. The hash rate indicating the computing capacity of mining is 24 TH/s, and can calculate hash 24 trillion times per second. Bitmain Antminer S9\nFor comparison, the popular Bitmain Antminer S9’s hashrate is 14TH/s. According to Bloomberg, the GMO chips are designed in Japan and produced in Taiwan.\nMasatoshi Kumagai, Chairman and Director of GMO Internet and the GMO Group representative, described the advantages of his company’s mining equipment over other products.\n“The performance per unit is higher than that of major competitors’ products,” he was quoted by the news outlet. “If we switch from over 20,000 mining machines operating in Northern Europe to GMO miner B2, the installation space will be about half in terms of equivalent performance.” Power Consumption\n“Compared to general mining machines…the power consumption is up to 20%, the cost of network equipment etc. can be reduced to 1/55,” Itmedia noted.\nKumai publication reported from the press conference that each unit consumes 1,950 watts and power supply units can supply up to 2,200 watts at 240 V. Adjustable Price – $1,999 for June\nGMO miner B2 will be sold through the company’s subsidiary in Zug, Switzerland, according to Nikkei. They will be on sale starting Wednesday and orders will start shipping from the end of October, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported .\nThe price for each unit is “announced monthly,” the publication added, revealing that the “sales price in June is $1,999.” Itmedia described:\nThe price for the June release is $1,999 (including power supply unit, excluding tax). The sales price is adjusted monthly according to demand etc. The number of shipments was kept private.\nCurrently, Bitmain’s Antminer S9 is priced at $837. GMO’s Plans\nMr. Masatoshi Kumagai told reporters that so far the crypto mining industry is dominated “by mining machines provided by Bitmain, a major mining hardware company in China,” and that he “noticed the fact that not a single Japanese company that is good at manufacturing is able to participate.”\nHe also revealed that the company “invested nearly 10 billion yen for the development of the product,” the publication conveyed and quoted the chairman explaining:\nWe are not setting business targets such as sales targets yet, but if we cannot sell it, we will use it in our mining business, so I think that it is a very excellent business in that there is no inventory risk.\nFurthermore, he added, “we also provide an API (application programming interface) for system monitoring compatible with GMO miner B2 and a detection function [for] when the product is connected to the net at the time of an unlikely event of theft.”\nWhat do you think of GMO miner B2? Will you buy one? Let us know in the comments section below.\nImages courtesy of Shutterstock, Nikkei, Itmedia, Kumai, and GMO Internet.\nNeed to calculate your bitcoin holdings?

bitcoin transactions case, officials said.\nThe businessman was summoned at the ED office here and was asked questions about his involvement in the trade, termed as illegal by the government, they said.\nThere are some instances of the case that are linked to Kundra and hence, he has been asked to record his statement, the officials said without elaborating.\nThe ED, sometime back, had registered a criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against bitcoin-based investment website GainBitcoin + , its founder Amit Bhardwaj and eight others.\nIt is alleged that nearly 8,000 investors lost around Rs 2,000 crore funds by transacting in this scheme.\nThe ED had filed its case based on an FIR of the Maharashtra Police in this case and the Pune Police arrested Bhardwaj and his brother Vivek from Delhi earlier.\nBhardwaj reportedly was behind ventures like GainBitcoin, GBMiners, MCAP and GB21, and the investors were allegedly duped after transactions on these portals.\nThe central agency has expanded its probe into this case and is also investigating related bitcoin or cryptocurrency transactions that are under the scanner of other departments.\nIt is alleged that Bhardwaj and his associates allegedly duped investors to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore in Mumbai, Pune, Nanded, Kolhapur and other places in the state.\nLast year, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had informed Parliament that there are no regulations governing virtual currencies in India + and the RBI has not given any licence to any entity/company to operate such currencies.\nThe government had also cautioned investors to be wary of virtual currencies such as bitcoin, saying they are like Ponzi schemes with no legal tender and protection.", "highlightText": "",

Nadex (North American Derivatives Exchange™) has added a Mini-Bitcoin Spread with a one-month duration to complement its existing week-long contract. As the first exchange regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to offer a Bitcoin contract (in 2014), Nadex is expanding the choice of contract duration and size in response to member requests, as part of its ongoing efforts to lead in the cryptocurrency space.The new Mini-Bitcoin Spread contract is a month-long contract with a tick value of $0.01 per point of the underlying Bitcoin index.\nThe existing Bitcoin Spread has a one-week duration and a larger tick value of $0.10 per point of the underlying index.\nBoth contracts are cash-settled in US Dollars with funds held by Nadex's CFTC-regulated clearinghouse. Based on the TeraBit Index SM published by TeraExchange, the Bitcoin and Mini-Bitcoin Spreads are more affordable and flexible in many cases than owning Bitcoin outright.\nUnlike unregulated cryptocurrency vendors, Nadex offers market participants the security of trading on a CFTC-regulated exchange, with the opportunity to trade contracts based on other markets as well, including stock index futures, commodities, forex, and economic numbers.\n\"With the Mini-Bitcoin contract, we're continuing our practice of responding to customer demand. Many of our traders love the cryptocurrency markets and gave us great feedback on what they needed from us to be able to trade the Bitcoin market their way,\" said Nadex CEO, Timothy McDermott. \"So we're building a range of cryptocurrency products that give traders more choice and flexibility to day trade or take a position in Bitcoin on the long and short side.\"\nAbout Nadex (North American Derivatives Exchange ™)\nNadex is the first and largest CFTC-regulated online exchange in the U.S offering binary options and spreads to individual traders seeking a trusted and secure way to participate in the markets.

According to sources, the agency has questioned Kundra about other people he involved to promote Bitcoin.\nNames of several Bollywood celebrities have also come up during the questioning by the agency. Among the high-profile celebrities whose names have come up are – Sunny Leone, Prachi Desai, Aarti Chabria, Sonal Chauhan, Karishma Tanna, Zareen Khan, Neha Dhupia, Huma Qureshi and Nargis Fakhri. The agency may also question Kundra’s wife Shilpa Shetty.\nThe celebrities allegedly promoted the company owned by Amit Bharadwaj, an accused in the case, in Dubai and Singapore. Bharadwaj, a Pune-based businessman, was arrested six months ago from the Indira Gandhi International airport in New Delhi.\nHe had allegedly flown away after duping over 8000 people under the Ponzi scheme. Pune Police had located him in Bangkok. He had duped people to invest in bitcoins for 18 months and promised them benefit at the return of 10 per cent. When people did not get back the promised money, they filed a complaint with the police.\nThe ED began questioning Kundra at 11.30 am on Tuesday and it went on for over eight hours. Kundra's name came up when Bharadwaj was being questioned.\nThe Income Tax Department had recently sent notices to bitcoin users who were dealing in bitcoins worth Rs 1 crore or more daily. These names were also forwarded to ED and a probe into possible money laundering and fraud was initiated. It is learnt that many well-known names - especially those of Bollywood celebrities - may come up during investigations.\nWhile the nature of Kundra's questioning is not yet clear, he is not new to controversies and was previously embroiled in the infamous IPL betting scandal. He is serving a life ban from all cricket-related activities. In March, Kundra did file a petition in Supreme Court challenging the ban.

Find Free WordPress Themes and plugins.\nBitcoin News: Bitcoin (BTC) obsession has been declining at a staggering pace since the start of this year; the largest coin couldn’t sustain trader’s attention and the confidence that it had attained in the final quarter of last year.\nCryptocurrency market analysts are blaming declining trader’s interest for the bearish trend over the last couple of months. They believe Bitcoin needs substantial fundamental support to rebuild trader’s confidence, either from its network or through Wall Street investments. Declining Bitcoin Searches Isn’t a Good Sign\nSearches for Bitcoin plunged almost 75% since the start of this year – which isn’t a good sign for the price performance of crypto coins. Searches for Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) are also down more than 70% in the past five months.\nNicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, has shown his concerns on declining trader attention towards bitcoin and other digital currencies.\nThe researcher said, “ We use Google Trends to track search queries for ‘bitcoin’ as a proxy for potential new buyers,” Colas said in an email to clients Monday. “Bitcoin needs a new narrative in order to reestablish global attention .” What Would Be the New Narrative\nNicholas Colas is certainly right about the cryptocurrency markets.

Speaking at the Institute for New Economic Thinking, the famed short seller described bitcoin as a “ libertarian fantasy ” and said it is “the last thing I’d want to own is bitcoin if the grid goes down.”\nA single bitcoin BTCUSD, -0.36% last changed hands at $7,633.62, up 1.5%, since Monday 5 p.m. Eastern Time on the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange.\nRipple CEO bullish on use of XRP coin The CEO of payment protocol Ripple said he expects “dozens” of banks to be using its payment system, which requires the use of Ripple’s XRP coin by the end of 2019. Speaking to CNBC , Brad Garlinghouse said he has “every confidence that major banks will use XRapid as a liquidity tool.”\nThe news comes less than a week after chief market strategist Cory Johnson told MarketWatch that a year ago the company was adding one financial institution every six weeks, and today it is one every six days.\nRipple’s XRP coin XRPUSD, -0.78% joined the broad based rally in digital currencies Tuesday, trading up 3.7% at 68 cents.\nAltcoins add to gains Tuesday After a sluggish start to the day, altcoins, or coins other than bitcoin, have moved higher throughout Tuesday. Ether ETHUSD, -0.58% is up 1.7% to $606.00, Bitcoin Cash BCHUSD, -1.04% is higher by 2.9% at $1,149.60 and Litecoin LTCUSD, -0.68% has added 1.8% at $121.60.\nFutures followed the spot market higher Tuesday.

Mark Wilson/Getty Images\nSteve Wozniak, “the other Steve” who co-founded Apple with Steve Jobs in 1976, recently dumped most of his Bitcoin holdings (probably when Bitcoin price was near its peak). But that wasn’t because he had lost faith in the digital currency.\nOn the contrary, Wozniak is a firm believer in Bitcoin over any other type of digital token.\n“I believe so much strongly in mathematics and purity and science… Bitcoin is mathematically defined. It’s pure. There’s no human and company run in it. To me, that’s natural and more important than human conventions,“ he told CNBC on Monday at the Money 20/20 event in Amsterdam, Netherlands. “Only B itcoin is pure digital gold… All the others tend to give up some of the aspects of Bitcoin—for example, being totally decentralized and having no central control. That’s the first one they have to give up to try to have a business model.” Wozniak bought Bitcoin in late 2016 when it was just $700 as an experiment. But when Bitcoin surged to nearly $20,000 in late 2017, he felt it was too confusing to stay in the game. Having witnessed the internet bubble pop in the early 2000, Wozniak knows from experience that it isn’t wise to measure the value of Bitcoin with dollars yet. “There is a huge amount of interest in [Bitcoin] right now, but things aren’t going to change that rapidly. That’s what the internet bubble was about,” he explained. “I never invested in Bitcoin. I was actually a little worried when the price went up. I said to my self, ‘Wait a minute. I only wanted to buy Bitcoin as an experiment. That’s always my purpose. I’m not an investor.'” Now, Wozniak keeps just one Bitcoin and two Ethereum tokens. Ethereum is a blockchain-based platform similar to Bitcoin’s underlying system but with more flexibility for developers to build custom applications. Wozniak said he bought Ethereum when he recognized its strong attribute as a platform, rather than a currency. “Platforms tend to grow, because they have got millions of people working on developing applications,” he explained.\nIn February, Wozniak revealed that he had lost seven Bitcoin in a fraud not long before he cashed out most of his holdings. However, Bitcoin wasn’t to blame.\n“Somebody bought them from me online through a credit card, and they cancelled the credit card payment. It was that easy!

Source: GoogleTrends\nGoogle Trends analyzes different ‘periods of popularity’ for individual web searches. The value of ‘100’ on their site is given to a specific term that is being searched at its peak of popularity. Bitcoin (BTC) reached its all-time record high of $20,000 a coin in mid-December 2017 and has been dropping ever since.\n>> Bitcoin Price Manipulation?\nBull or Bear?\nBefore Tom Lee, Nick Colas was the first Wall Street analyst to cover Bitcoin back in 2013, and he is bearish on BTC at the moment. Colas spoke to CNBC yesterday and states that he has yet to see new adopters wanting to buy Bitcoin recently, and with any new technology new adopters make it more valuable.\nColas gives to reasons as to why investors should halt on purchasing the cryptocurrency. First, google searches are down over 90% since Bitcoin’s peak in December and second, Bitcoin wallet growth has slowed down since last year.\nWith that being said, Colas believes that the sharp drop in December and January was the crypto ‘bubble’ popping, but he’s a strong believer in its structure and technology.\nNegatives Across The Board\nMost top 10 cryptocurrencies reached their top search peaks on Google, back in the last weeks of 2017 and the first week of 2018.\nEOS is the only exception to this, as it reached its peak searches this past week as it launched its main net. Most searches for the cryptocurrency came from Nevada and Arizona, within the United States.\nTron (TRX) launched its main net a week ago and barely received a spike in Google search traffic.\nDo you think investors now are just ‘HODLing’ and not checking the news every day or do you think individuals have just lost interest in cryptocurrency?\nLeave your opinions and comments below.

With declines being seen across the board, the entire value of the market has dropped US$8 billion or 2.5% since this morning to US$332.7 billion according to Coin Market Cap. Why are cryptocurrencies tumbling lower? It is a little unclear what the main catalyst for today’s selloff is, but it could have been driven by reports about a significant drop in searches for Bitcoin (BTC).

Searches for these terms have fallen by 70%, 82%, and 87%, respectively, since early in 2018.\nAnother reason for concern is the slowdown in the number of new Bitcoin wallets being created. The report indicates that there has only been a 3.7% lift in new wallets this year, where late last year Bitcoin wallet numbers were growing 7.6% monthly.\nI think this is a touch worrying for the crypto market as a lack of new money into the market to support prices could easily lead to prices capitulating over the long term.\nWhat is the state of play this afternoon?\nAt present the Bitcoin price is down 3.3% since this time yesterday to US$7,429.07, leaving it with a market capitalisation of US$126.9 billion.\nThe Ethereum price is down a further 5% to US$585.10, reducing its market capitalisation to US$58.4 billion.\nThe Ripple price has tumbled 4.5% lower over the last 24 hours to 65.2 U.S. cents. This leaves XRP with a market capitalisation of just under US$25.6 billion.\nThe Bitcoin Cash price has plunged 7.5% since this time yesterday to US$1,077.79, reducing its market capitalisation to US$18.5 billion.\nThe EOS (EOS) price has sunk almost 8% lower to US$13.14, giving it a market capitalisation of US$11.8 billion.\nOutside the top five the declines were just as severe. Litecoin (LTC) is down 5.5%, Cardano (ADA) is 7.2% lower, Stellar (XLM) is off 6.9%, IOTA (MIOTA) has fallen 4.4%, and TRON (TRX) is 5.5% lower.\nMotley Fool contributor James Mickleboro has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Last month, he said that he believes the project could become the next Apple in terms of its status in the tech sector.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T03:23:43.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "483eb20d94f930d2151860e7017b3701319d48dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQQUfcOKWcsr0V0Ky63VKcg8_xtNeMiMrvu2XML7eNnSoybhJ60Smoc849j.xdJpzbAO_9Z2KoVVDxuEJHjME8SiXS2a_meVjv9b0ZLH3FjANZZnd2kuigZNgRp5lcl.9l_t_IKFsWs4i3WJV3eJg2eD6Bt.B7WeYjZcZjOr9.19zjJu2n3RhMZhmb.3i7eU.1q46Zvb6uxKqDj9AGSahSIK_BZWCiXvW8-", "site_full": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/rssfeedsdefault.cms", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Economic Times", "title": "Shilpa Shetty's husband and businessman Raj Kundra summoned by ED in Bitcoin scam case", "title_full": "Shilpa Shetty's husband and businessman Raj Kundra summoned by ED in Bitcoin scam case - The Economic Times", "published": "2018-06-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-64461666,width-672,resizemode-4,imgsize-108180/raj-kundra.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "483eb20d94f930d2151860e7017b3701319d48dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQQUfcOKWcsr0V0Ky63VKcg8_xtNeMiMrvu2XML7eNnSoybhJ60Smoc849j.xdJpzbAO_9Z2KoVVDxuEJHjME8SiXS2a_meVjv9b0ZLH3FjANZZnd2kuigZNgRp5lcl.9l_t_IKFsWs4i3WJV3eJg2eD6Bt.B7WeYjZcZjOr9.19zjJu2n3RhMZhmb.3i7eU.1q46Zvb6uxKqDj9AGSahSIK_BZWCiXvW8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "published": "2018-06-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Shilpa Shetty's husband and businessman Raj Kundra summoned by ED in Bitcoin scam case", "text": "Actor Shilpa Shetty's husband and businessman Raj Kundra is being questioned by the Enforcement Directorate in relation with the high profile bitcoin scam involving Amit Bhardwaj, ANI reported.\nIt is not clear why Raj Kundra has been called for questioning by the ED as of now.\nThe Enforcement Directorate had, in April, arrested the key mastermind and founder of GainBitcoin Amit Bhardwaj for allegedly duping investors worth Rs 2,000 crore.

Both digital assets saw a major increase in global trading volume compared to the month prior. BTC held steady, averaging $200 billion a month, but ripple didn’t fare so well, recording trading volume that was down 86% since January, mirroring its decline in price.\nAlso read: Decentralized Exchange Compendium ‘Index’ Lists Over 200 Dex Platforms Bitcoin Cash Is May’s King of Coins\nThere are various ways to measure a cryptocurrency that’s in demand, with trading volume the most useful indicator after price. A lot of bitcoin cash changed hands in May – 140% more than in the month prior in fact. Diar’s weekly update highlights the big winners and losers in the cryptocurrency market in May, and shows the substantial demand for BCH. In total, $30 billion of bitcoin cash changed hands in May. The next biggest gainer was ethereum, whose trade volume was up 50% on April, resulting in monthly trading volume of over $80 billion.\nMost major cryptocurrencies saw an increase in trading volume in May including litecoin, which had a modest increase. There was one notable loser however – ripple. XRP trading volume has been on the decline since January, back when $100 billion of tokens were traded in a month, pushing the price of XRP north of $3. Reality has since settled in, and May saw just $16 billion of ripple traded. Fake Volume Rears Its Head\nWhen it comes to analyzing trading volume, one topic that often crops up concerns fake volume. Exchanges and their traders are frequently accused of creating orders that they have no intention of fulfilling, which creates a false impression of liquidity. If traders are doing so, it’s likely bot-based as a means of market manipulation in the pursuit of profit. If exchanges are responsible, it’s likely to make their platform look more popular than it is, and to benefit from the additional custom that comes from being a top ranked global exchange by volume.\nBinance is the latest exchange to have faced accusations of fake volume, with certain coins displaying unusually high volume for short periods of time, comprising fluctuations that appear outwith normal trading patterns. Given the hundreds of thousands of traders who can be using a platform such as Binance at one time, including countless bots connected via API, determining which orders are real, which are fake, and who’s responsible for any manipulation, is virtually impossible.\nDo you think fake volume is a problem on major exchanges?

Searches for these terms have fallen by 70%, 82%, and 87%, respectively, since early in 2018.\nAnother reason for concern is the slowdown in the number of new Bitcoin wallets being created. The report indicates that there has only been a 3.7% lift in new wallets this year, where late last year Bitcoin wallet numbers were growing 7.6% monthly.\nI think this is a touch worrying for the crypto market as a lack of new money into the market to support prices could easily lead to prices capitulating over the long term.\nWhat is the state of play this afternoon?\nAt present the Bitcoin price is down 3.3% since this time yesterday to US$7,429.07, leaving it with a market capitalisation of US$126.9 billion.\nThe Ethereum price is down a further 5% to US$585.10, reducing its market capitalisation to US$58.4 billion.\nThe Ripple price has tumbled 4.5% lower over the last 24 hours to 65.2 U.S. cents. This leaves XRP with a market capitalisation of just under US$25.6 billion.\nThe Bitcoin Cash price has plunged 7.5% since this time yesterday to US$1,077.79, reducing its market capitalisation to US$18.5 billion.\nThe EOS (EOS) price has sunk almost 8% lower to US$13.14, giving it a market capitalisation of US$11.8 billion.\nOutside the top five the declines were just as severe. Litecoin (LTC) is down 5.5%, Cardano (ADA) is 7.2% lower, Stellar (XLM) is off 6.9%, IOTA (MIOTA) has fallen 4.4%, and TRON (TRX) is 5.5% lower.\nOne of the world's richest people is sounding the alarm on what could be a trillion-dollar technology.\nAnd when a tech billionaire - several times over - speaks, it pays to listen.\nThis could be your chance to get in on the ground floor!\nClick here to discover a $19.9 trillion dollar idea -- hidden in plain sight!\nMotley Fool contributor James Mickleboro has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Chart Data Hints at June 6 Bitcoin Boost NEWS Omkar Godbole and Sebastian Sinclair Jun 5, 2018 at 14:00 UTC | Updated Jun 6, 2018 at 10:41 UTC\nA major reprieve just may be in the offing for the battered bitcoin bulls in the next 36 hours – if, that is, historical patterns repeat themselves.\nIntriguingly, the cryptocurrency tends to take a significant change of direction on the sixth day of every month, or at least it has so far in 2018.\nHaving topped out in the $20,000 neighborhood in mid-December 2017, the cryptocurrency fell to a 2018 low of $6,000 on Feb. 6. Since then, the cryptocurrency has been restricted to a narrowing price range, as indicated by the triangle pattern in the chart below.\nWhat's more interesting is that major price highs and lows over that time have formed around the sixth day of every month. BTC daily chart\nThe above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows: Bitcoin bottomed out or turned higher from $6,000 on Feb. 6 and $6,500 on April 6. The lower highs – $11,700 and $9,990 – were created on March 5 and May 5, respectively. The yearly high of $17,252 was also set on Jan. 6.\nClearly, the tide rebounds in favor of the weaker side on, or close to, the sixth day of every month.\nAs of writing, bitcoin is trading at $7,433 on Bitfinex – down 34 percent from the bearish reversal point of $9,990, dated May 6, meaning the bulls are currently on the defensive.\nGoing by the historical pattern, the cryptocurrency seems likely to turn higher in the next 36 hours or so. In this case, bitcoin could revisit triangle (narrowing price range) resistance, currently located at $9,225.\nOn the other hand, long-term technical studies are biased to the bears, which was not the case on previous occasions.\nFor instance, the cryptocurrency has found acceptance below the 50-week moving average for the first time since 2015. Further, a 5-month and 10-month moving average (MA) bearish crossover recently occurred for the first time in four years.\nSo, as always, nothing is guaranteed when it comes to bitcoin price movements. But, just possibly, the cryptocurrency could pick up a strong bid tomorrow, in line with the historical pattern.\nEven so, it would be too early to call a bull reversal, given the bearish long-term technical developments, and traders would want to see more evidence – such as a high volume break above the weekly high of $7,779 – before assuming the bulls were back in charge.\nCalendar image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .
