In a recent interview , the former Facebook executive said Buffett is not an expert on technology. He also reiterated the notion that Bitcoin is digital gold. Buffett Knows Little About Technology\nSpeaking during the interview, Palihapitiya said Buffett, the 82-year Berkshire Hathaway CEO, isn’t entirely tech-savvy. According to Palihapitiya, knowledge of technology isn’t exactly in Buffett’s “circle of competence,” saying:\nNot everybody is right all the time.\nIndeed, Warren Buffett hasn’t always been right. Despite being regarded as one of the greatest investors of all time, Buffett has passed up on a few choice investments like Amazon and Google . With cryptocurrency, he remains a staunch critic, recently declaring that buying the crypto wasn’t investing but speculating. Chamath Palihapitiya\nThe “Oracle of Omaha” has had a lot of negative things to say about cryptocurrency, calling it a bubble and a mirage. He has even called the number one crypto “rat poison,” a view shared by Charles Munger, Buffett’s second-in-command at Berkshire Hathaway. Munger recently referred to the granddaddy of cryptocurrency as a “ noxious poison ” and called for the U.S. to adopt China’s crypto crackdown philosophy. According to Buffett, Bitcoin has no intrinsic value and does not produce anything.\nPalihapitiya isn’t the only one who thinks Buffett knows nothing about technology and cryptocurrency. Binance CEO Zhao Changpeng said earlier in the year that the Berkshire Hathaway chief doesn’t understand bitcoin . Recently, Weiss Ratings provided evidence to dispute Buffett’s claims that the number one virtual currency has no value. Bitcoin is a Replacement for Gold\nPalihapitiya believes Bitcoin is a replacement for gold. The self-proclaimed Buffett disciple identifies with the importance of the cryptocurrency, saying that it bears no correlation with the mainstream market. As a result, it appears like Bitcoin has created a separate world, one that Palihapitiya jokes requires a passport to move from one to the other.\nThe former Facebook executive has owned Bitcoin since 2012. He says that he prefers to view the cryptocurrency as a hedge to the uncertainty of the mainstream market. Bitcoin emerged in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, an event that Palihapitiya says broke the confidence of many people in the safety of mainstream finance. As a final thought, Palihapitiya states:\nEverything broke down, and things that we thought were hedges went away.\nDo you think Palihapitiya is correct in saying Warren Buffett is wrong about Bitcoin?

Gox trustee, who was tasked to sell about 200,000 bitcoin after the bankruptcy of the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox, is suspected to have dumped another 8,000 bitcoin on the cryptocurrency market. Domino Effect\nAs CCN reported yesterday, CNBC’s Fast Money contributor and BKCM founder Brian Kelly stated that the entrance of major financial institutions and banks into the cryptocurrency market could allow the cryptocurrency market to surge in value and cryptocurrencies to be considered as an emerging asset class.\nCurrently, Kelly stated that cryptocurrencies are bearer instruments and it is difficult for institutional money to flow into the market.\n“I’m actually a bit shocked that the market did not pick up on this. Dominic Chu of CNBC said that investors will get physical delivery of bitcoin. That doesn’t sound that interesting except for the fact that it means ICE Exchange has a custody solution. That has been the big hurdle. How do you hold onto these assets. These are generally bearer instruments, just like gold bearer bonds. That’s the big deal. They have come up with a custody solution for institutional holders,” said Kelly.\nFollowing the logic of Kelly, the cryptocurrency market is very volatile and its daily trading volume is relatively low compared to other traditional assets and markets like the NASDAQ and gold. As such, the movement of funds of less than a billion dollars could drastically impact the market and the rates of cryptocurrencies, especially if large amounts of bitcoin are sold on public cryptocurrency exchanges.\nOver the past few months, despite of the criticism from the cryptocurrency market, the Mt. Gox trustee has continued to sell massive chunks of bitcoin on cryptocurrency exchanges, even after acknowledging that the sell off of tens of thousands of bitcoins can easily move the market that is already highly volatile.\nToday, on May 11, various reports have suggested that the recent price dip of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies was triggered by the sell off of Mt. Gox coins. Four wallets of the Mt. Gox trustee moved around 2,000 bitcoins each, sending over 8,000 bitcoins in total over the past 24 hours. Considering that the Mt. Gox trustee was asked to sell over 200,000 bitcoins and convert it to Japanese yen by local financial authorities, it is evident that any external movement of the Mt. Gox trustee’s funds likely means that they are being sold on cryptocurrency exchanges. Over-The-Counter (OTC) Market\nSimilar to how most institutional traders and retail investors purchase and sell large batches of cryptocurrencies, the Mt. Gox trustee could use the over-the-counter (OTC) market and directly deal with large-scale investors that are willing to purchase thousands of bitcoins.\nInstead, the Mt. Gox trustee has opted to sell its funds on cryptocurrency exchanges, creating a domino effect across all major exchanges and leading the cryptocurrency market to drop by large margins.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dominic chu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ice exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bkcm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mt. gox wallet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mt. gox", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T14:54:42.071+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "54bb7fffae267de059ccbc461ac67253212396a4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMsnimtca2NXOEO2k9mKs2uiRi8.5XqyTr2ps96qoy0rqSnIzuE7MLDI", "site_full": "video.foxbusiness.com", "site": "foxbusiness.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "Will bitcoin become a mainstream currency? | On Air Videos | Fox Business", "title_full": "Will bitcoin become a mainstream currency? | On Air Videos | Fox Business", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "EU", "spam_score": 0.306, "main_image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/BrightCove/854081161001/201805/3569/640/360/854081161001_5783609725001_5783606670001-vs.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5795, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 26, "comments": 0, "shares": 26}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "54bb7fffae267de059ccbc461ac67253212396a4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMsnimtca2NXOEO2k9mKs2uiRi8.5XqyTr2ps96qoy0rqSnIzuE7MLDI", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "msn.com", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Will bitcoin become a mainstream currency? | On Air Videos | Fox Business", "text": "Galaxy Digital Capital Management CEO Mike Novogratz on the impact of the tax reform legislation and the outlook for cryptocurrency.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mike novogratz", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fox business galaxy digital capital management", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T17:47:40.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1566264db3355204794497f602a41fe9d2c53ffa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqsxUkjV1Gvi6jERETdqPylwT8xhxZrtst3a6KUY.xFxeOZ7NgPmFyi1Ef7gRv2h8z8XPJpTjQmo3022RLjfJHAoRgkgRFgVpU-", "site_full": "blog.naver.com", "site": "naver.com", "site_section": "https://openapi.naver.com/v1/search/blog?query=t&start=53&sort=date&display=100", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "[twitter 검색 May-11, 17시] bitcoin", "title_full": "[twitter 검색 May-11, 17시] bitcoin : 네이버 블로그", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "KR", "spam_score": 0.019, "main_image": "http://blogimgs.naver.net/nblog/mylog/post/og_default_image_160610.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 89, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1566264db3355204794497f602a41fe9d2c53ffa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqsxUkjV1Gvi6jERETdqPylwT8xhxZrtst3a6KUY.xFxeOZ7NgPmFyi1Ef7gRv2h8z8XPJpTjQmo3022RLjfJHAoRgkgRFgVpU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "NORAZO", "published": "2018-05-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "[twitter 검색 May-11, 17시] bitcoin", "text": "가상화폐 [twitter 검색 May-11, 17시] bitcoin 57분 전 URL 복사 본문 기타 기능 번역보기 머신 러닝을 통한 분석 Google Blogger(개발중)\n2018-05-11 08:55:23 RT @ProducToken: ..and @ProducToken is featured on @Cointelegraph !

This time analysis depends largely on what’s known as the mining economy. Hash power and hardware advancement all combine to show a possible $36,000 BTC price by the end of next year, they claim.\nAlso read: JP Morgan Chase Eats Humble Pie, Applies for Blockchain Patent Fundstrat Continues Moon Price Predictions\nFundstrat’s head of data research, Sam Doctor, explained, “The release of the next generation of rig hardware should trigger a new round of capex as well as hash power growth, which could accelerate if BTC price appreciates.”\nCapex is short for capital expenditure, and refers here to upgrades in technology such as mining rigs. Hash power growth can be thought of as cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin using proof of work, relying on a unit of measure basically recording power consumed by the network to keep it humming along, in this case, roughly every ten minutes a block is found or generated. Internal Fundstrat research document\n“We believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range,” Mr. Doctor continued. “The primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors.”\nIf a multiple of four from its current price seems ambitious, the actual range from Fundstrat pushes the high to nearly twice even that number. Mr. Doctor uses mining economics to establish a floor support level due to its supposed relative growth going forward. Through next year, researchers believe mining hash power will indeed boom by 350 percent. A Rosy Immediate Future\nMost of the price moon prediction depends upon miners Fundstrat assumes will hold their position through the crypto winter, and then sell once it recovers (and better). Moving variables in the mining economy include rig innovation, electricity cost, and the ability to lower hardware temperatures.\nMr. Doctor further elaborated how “miners verify and process transactions, supporting the network in exchange for mining rewards and transaction fees. We argue that the Price/Miner’s Breakeven Cost multiple has proven a reliable long-term support level, and further, that the likely trajectory of future mining infrastructure growth should underpin Bitcoin price appreciation into year-end 2019.” And harder numbers Fundstrat asserts to be $6K per BTC for Bitmain’s Antminer S7, and just over $2K for its S9 model.\nSuch rosey price predictions are nothing new for Fundstrat Global. Its very public face, and really only prominent Wall Street analyst to take cryptocurrencies seriously as an asset class, Tom Lee, famously last Summer forecast BTC becoming a store of value on par with gold, reaching a high of as much as $55K by 2022. As more information has come in, Mr. Lee has also said he expects the digital asset could moon to $25K by the end of this year alone.\nStill other analysts believe the causal connection between mining activity and speculative price is not well established, leading to perhaps more outlandish price calls as a result. And with other cryptocurrencies battling it out for market share, offering varieties of features not currently found in bitcoin, the BTC price explosion might not be such a given. At press time, BTC price hovered around $8,500, down almost ten percent.\nWhat are your crypto price predictions?

The 200 day MA (green line has stalled the rallies) on the topside. That MA comes in at $10,157. ON the downside, the 100 day MA has confined the downside over the near term. That MA comes in at $8,843. The distance between the 100 and 200 day MA is wide but real. At some point there will be a break and the digital currency will run free again. To get a closer look at the bias, drilling down to the hourly chart gives a better view. Looking at the hourly chart below, the price has been trading above and below the 100 and 200 hour MAs since the move higher stalled, and the price started to waffle back and forth. Currently, and over the last few days, the price has stayed on the lower side of the 200 hour MA (green line). That is now the line in the sand for buyers and sellers. Stay below and the sellers are more in control. Move above, and the sellers turn to buyers. What about that lower trend line on the hourly chart? There is a lower trend line that cuts across at $9004. The price is about $65 from that line. If the price can keep the momentum down going, breaking that line will be a catalyst for more potential and a run toward the key 100 day MA below. The price may bounce again off the trend line/off the 100 day MA, but traders have the roadmap.

But Benjamin Lau, the chief investment officer of Apriem Advisors, says Nvidia has another opportunity that’s much bigger than crypto mining. Booming demand for Nvidia’s chips for artificial intelligence and data centers should drive the company’s business for the near future, he said.\nGraphics chipmaker Nvidia pulled the curtain back on its bitcoin mining-related business for the first time on Thursday. But the real game-changing opportunity for Nvidia is not inside the crowded cryptocurrency mines — it’s in the wide open field of artificial intelligence.\nSo says Benjamin Lau, the chief investment officer of Apriem Advisors, a firm with $650 million under management that’s betting big on Nvidia.\nNvidia’s business designing chips for AI uses, which could upend industries from healthcare to transportation, and chips for computer data centers are the future, said Lau.\n“They have a great platform and not a lot of really meaningful competition in that space,” said Lau, whose firm is long Nvidia’s stock.\nNvidia is already seeing significant success in those areas. In the first quarter , its data center business brought in $701 million in revenue, which was up 71% from the year-ago period. Sales of its latest Tesla chips — which the company designed for AI processing — helped boost the data center business, the company said.\nData center sales were reportedly below analysts’ estimates, which may have explained the sell-off in Nvidia’s stock in after-hours trading following its report. In recent trading, Nvidia’s shares were down $8.53, or 3%, to $251.60.\nStill, Lau was impressed with the business’ performance in the period and sees it continuing to drive Nvidia’s overall results.”The AI stuff and the data center stuff is going to be the short-term boost” for Nvidia, Lau said.\nThe investor is also optimistic about the company’s automotive efforts, although those have been mired in controversy of late. Nvidia has been developing chips and other technology for use in self-driving cars.\nAfter an Uber autonomous car killed a pedestrian in Arizona , Nvidia announced that it would suspend its own autonomous vehicle tests . Uber’s self-driving cars use Nvidia graphics processors, but not its autonomous vehicle system .\nThe bitcoin business is in the past, the autonomous car business is the future Nvidia’s automotive business totaled $145 million in sales in the first quarter, up just 4% from the year-ago period.\nBut it’s still early days in the development of self-driving cars, Lau said.\n“The auto stuff is going to be the future for them,” he said. But he acknowledged that “there will be speed bumps with autonomous driving.”\nOne area Lau isn’t counting much on is cryptocurrency mining. For the first time ever, Nvidia disclosed in its earnings report its cryptocurrency-related sales, saying they hit $289 million in its first quarter.\nNvidia and rival AMD have been boosted in recent years by the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies.

In the first quarter , its data center business brought in $701 million in revenue, which was up 71% from the year-ago period. Sales of its latest Tesla chips — which the company designed for AI processing — helped boost the data center business, the company said.\nData center sales were reportedly below analysts’ estimates, which may have explained the sell-off in Nvidia’s stock in after-hours trading following its report. In recent trading, Nvidia’s shares were down $8.53, or 3%, to $251.60.\nStill, Lau was impressed with the business’ performance in the period and sees it continuing to drive Nvidia’s overall results.”The AI stuff and the data center stuff is going to be the short-term boost” for Nvidia, Lau said.\nThe investor is also optimistic about the company’s automotive efforts, although those have been mired in controversy of late.

The tax agency demands in those letters that the recipients will divulge all of their involvement in the cryptocurrency market including all past transaction history and current holdings. People are being asked to list all exchange accounts and wallets they ever had and report their trade earnings. Additionally, the agency demands that people will reveal if they are engaged in mining.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Supporter Might Be Next NY Attorney General Check Your Mailbox\nThe agency appears to be be very confident in its suspicions as some local tax offices have not even bothered with sending out the letters with demands for information, instead they just opened a business case for anyone they think is trading bitcoin. Those people are simply informed they must pay income taxes as business owners now, fill reports retroactively back from 2013 as well as keep balanced books and report taxes on salaries to employees as any other business, as if they were restaurant or factory owners.\nEarlier this year the tax agency issued a circular on the matter, declaring that bitcoin is an asset, and thus anyone trading it must pay the capital gains tax of 25% and anyone considered to be running a business must also pay the VAT of 17%. The Tax Authority commented to Israel’s Globes newspaper: “Following the publication of the circular, which reflects the Authority’s position on the taxation method of trading and investing in virtual currencies, the Authority is working to locate those active in the field who do not manage a case in the tax authorities. We recommend that those who conduct unregistered activity in these areas take advantage of the existing channels to settle their issues before they will have to endure the unpleasantness that accompanies enforcement. ” Monitoring Social Media Groups\nThe Tax Authority is not exposing how it got its hands on a list of bitcoin traders in the country to check if they report or not, but there a few obvious ways. The banking system in Israel is very hostile to any bitcoin dealings, and the banks thus probably proactively report all inbound and outbound transactions involving known accounts of exchanges abroad as possible money laundering and tax evasion. And the few local trading avenues available to Israelis can easily be compelled to hand over a list of their clients with a warrant.\nInvestigators have used more creative means, however, people familiar with the tax scene told the Globes newspaper. They claim that undercover agents are monitoring local groups for peer to peer buying and selling of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Facebook, Telegram and Whatsapp. The information gathered there is said to be sophisticatedly cross-referenced with other available data.\nWhat should Israeli bitcoin do with this information?

Written by: Published on: May/10/2018\nLately, there’s been a lot of talk about Bitcoin becoming the new capital flight. This matters for online bookie agents because they should run their sportsbooks via some type of cryptocurrency.\nThe most important remains Bitcoin.\nWill Bitcoin take over as the new capital flight? Before getting into that, we come up with a definition for capital flight. What is Capital Flight?\nCapital flight is anything that investors head to during a time of crisis. For example, when the housing market imploded in 2008, sending the world into a recession, investors went into precious metals.\nThe most important precious metal investors flocked to was gold. The second most important was silver.\nSilver and gold made up the largest chunk of most everyone’s portfolios. To say that Bitcoin will take over as the capital flight is to say that Bitcoin will somehow replace gold and silver. Will Bitcoin Take Over Gold and Silver as the World’s Capital Flight?\nThe short answer is no, Bitcoin won’t.\nWhile many believe Bitcoin is on its way to becoming the most important capital flight in the world, the bottom line is that Bitcoin remains an outlier currency.\nAn outlier currency is one that’s only utilized in its home nation.\nMexico has the peso. If you go to Mexico with U.S. dollars, you can purchase goods and services. If you go to the U.S. with Mexican pesos, you can’t use those pesos until you turn them into dollars.\nThe U.S. dollar is a currency accepted throughout the world. It has weight. The Mexican peso is only accepted in Mexico. It has no weight.\nBitcoin remains an outlier currency just like the Mexican peso. This is important for per head agents to understand. Bitcoin’s home nation is the Internet.\nWhile purchasing goods and services on the Internet, you can use Bitcoins. You cannot use Bitcoins to walk into a 7-11 and purchase a soda.\nTherefore, Bitcoins are only worth what they can be utilized for, just like all outlier currencies. Gold and silver aren’t currencies.\nThey can be used like a currency, to exchange goods and services, but they have an intrinsic value separate form their uses.\nGold’s intrinsic value is backed up by the fact that biggest economies in the world, like Chinas, back up their home currencies with gold.\nBitcoin, to be honest, has no intrinsic value. That’s why, although some investors may think otherwise, Bitcoin will never take the place of gold or silver as the best flight capital.\nHowever, i t is the best option for online bookie agents . If an online bookie doesn’t accept bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies yet, they’re missing out on all the benefits cryptocurrency has to offer online bookies and sportsbooks.\nRead more about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, plus find out how you can get cash back when you sign up for PayPerHead.com .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://payperhead.com/bitcoin?utm_source=g911&utm_medium=blog+post&utm_content=bitcoin+capital+flight&utm_campaign=triple+crown+cash"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T04:58:50.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "86846c9434a5057abb36fc08597c300e18f36336", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSV726y8j_xea2A9dbbM_R_5gGUCEXO1pzua2_35TnlckVdCxUNtUybkWWF8d0EgC8g--", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Huawei Poised to Give Chinese Users Easier Access to Bitcoin", "title_full": "Huawei Poised to Give Chinese Users Easier Access to Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-11T02:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "86846c9434a5057abb36fc08597c300e18f36336", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSV726y8j_xea2A9dbbM_R_5gGUCEXO1pzua2_35TnlckVdCxUNtUybkWWF8d0EgC8g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-11T02:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Huawei Poised to Give Chinese Users Easier Access to Bitcoin", "text": "Huawei Poised to Give Chinese Users Easier Access to Bitcoin\n/u/redundo\nsubmitted by /u/redundo\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "huawei", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T02:26:48.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2299fd133061db5c026c06d728ea353e9f02a155", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmY.6fzRfImwFnyx6V8kCrXI-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why people afraid to invest in bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why people afraid to invest in bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-11T02:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.008, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2299fd133061db5c026c06d728ea353e9f02a155", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmY.6fzRfImwFnyx6V8kCrXI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "LadyCoin", "published": "2018-05-11T02:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why people afraid to invest in bitcoin?", "text": "Quote: from: mimakter on May 07, 2018, 04:52:57 PM Afraid in invest on bitcoin what reason they are afraid?

in Bitcoin? Former NFL star Ricky Williams recommends looking to the stars.\nCatching Fire Former NFL running back Ricky Williams is well-known for taking an unorthodox career approach, having famously retired from football to pursue — among other things — holistic method. Thus, it may not come as a surprise that the Heisman Trophy winner based his decision to invest in Bitcoin on astrology.\n\"When I look at things, I tend to look at astrology to get insight,\" Williams told CNBC Make It . One of those things included Bitcoin. Williams explained :\nThe insight that got me interested in Bitcoin was the planet Uranus is about to enter into Taurus.\n[Uranus] is about revolution; it's about a change in the way we do things; it's about innovation. [Taurus] is about resources and finances.\n\"Revolution.\" \"Finances.\" It's easy to see where this going.\nAccording to Williams, the combination of Uranus' revolutionary trait in astrology with Taurus' focus on wealth and finance led him to the logical conclusion that \"we're going to totally change the way we view and understand [finances].\"\nAs an added bonus, Williams explained that Pluto is in the process of passing through Capricorn — which he interprets to mean the downfall of traditional financial institutions. Willians explained:\nI think as people are starting to become disillusioned with our institutions, that things like blockchain and cryptocurrency, it's the perfect time for them to catch fire and really change the way we do things. So, you know, I had to get a little piece of that action.\nResponsible Investing That said, Williams is still all about investing responsibly and sticks to the golden rule of \"never invest more than you can afford to lose.\" The former NFL star only invested a maximum of $50,000 into Bitcoin , explaining:\nI didn't want to go crazy.\nHe's also not concerned with the dominant cryptocurrency by market capitalization's infamous volatility — which he claims is simply par for the astrological course:\nEspecially with the planet Uranus and change, [it's] always going to be volatile in the beginning. But, still, it's more of a conscious choice to contribute to the change. If I do well, then great. If not, I'll still feel like I did my part to contribute to things moving forward.\nWhat do you think of Ricky William's astrological interpretations in regards to Bitcoin?

Kano's team, which includes a former fixed-income desk head at Barclays and an ex-senior private banker at Credit Suisse, has doubled to more than 150 people in the past six months and is on pace to top 300 before year-end.\nYuzo Kano has big crtyptocurrency dreams.\nPhoto: Bloomberg While he's far from the only crypto boss to poach talent from Wall Street firms, Kano has been among the most aggressive in taking advantage of recent Japanese regulations that make the finance-to-crypto leap less daunting. The nation's virtual currency exchanges are now licensed by Japan's securities watchdog, giving the venues an official stamp of approval that's largely absent from countries like the US and Britain. For Kano, that makes Japan the ideal base for an increasingly global operation.\n\"My target is to be number one in the world,\" the former derivatives and convertible bonds trader said in an interview from his office in Midtown Tower, the tIny Tokyo skyscraper that's also home to Blackstone Group and Bain & Co. \"To get there, I need to grow headcount. And those with the best skills come from global banks.\"\nKano's four-year-old exchange is already the world's fourth largest crypto venue by turnover, after BitMex, Binance and OKEx, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from exchanges, Coinhills and Coinmarketcap.com. Transactions on bitFlyer averaged about $US2 billion a day during late April and early May, thanks in large part to Bitcoin margin contracts popular with Japanese day-traders. The venue's users have tripled in the past year to 2 million.\nAdvertisement Replay\nReplay Video Loading Play Video\nOn top of existing locations in Tokyo, San Francisco and Luxembourg, Kano is eyeing new offices in Africa, South America, Australia and other parts of Asia. He's also expanding beyond crypto trading to businesses that include digital payments and a brokerage-advisory service for investors and startups interested in initial coin offerings. The strategy is similar to that of Mike Novogratz, another Goldman alum who recently started a New York-based crypto merchant bank.\nKano, bitFlyer's co-founder and chief executive officer, said former traders and bankers are ideal for crypto firms because they understand how to operate in regulated markets -- a skill set that's becoming more important as governments around the world scrutinize an industry notorious for security lapses and money laundering risks. Last month, bitFlyer tightened its anti-money laundering rules after the Nikkei newspaper reported that users could perform some limited functions without fully completing customer verification.\n\"Crypto companies need finance guys to fill roles across the board: business development, sales, account management, operations, and compliance just to name a few,\" said Razin Ashraf, head of Tokyo-based recruiting firm Divine Solutions Japan.\nOf course, technology matters too. Kano's hiring spree also includes coders, who can make $US100,000 at bitFlyer with a high school -- or even middle school -- education if they've got a track record of success at hackathons or coding tournaments.\nKano, 42, said bitFlyer's ideal finance recruits fall into one of two groups: experienced bankers in their 40s tired of corporate bureaucracy, or younger associates in their 20s who've become disillusioned with the industry and are hungry for a taste of startup life.\nLoading \"Japan is facing long-term headwinds including negative interest rates, which is driving headcount lower at finance firms,\" said Yoshiharu Akahane, who oversees fintech research at Tokyo-based NTT Data Corp. \"That coincides with our huge crypto boom, which is much stronger than in the rest of the world, and explains why more people may jump to the crypto industry.\"\nKano can't promise to beat the banks on salaries, but he said there are plenty of people at bitFlyer who earn more than $US200,000 a year.\nStock options are also a major draw. All of bitFlyer's full-time employees receive them and can cash out without having to wait for the company's planned initial public offering, Kano said, declining to elaborate on a timeframe for an IPO. \"At what other startup can the secretary become a millionaire?\"\nThat upside potential could help bitFlyer compete for talent even as Wall Street firms tiptoe into the crypto space themselves. Goldman is preparing to open a Bitcoin-trading business, while Intercontinental Exchange Inc., the owner of New York Stock Exchange, is said to be working on a platform that would let investors bet on the cryptocurrency. In Japan, financial companies including SBI Holdings and Monex Group are making big investments in crypto businesses.\nLoading While Kano declined to discuss details of bitFlyer's finances, disclosures from one of its rivals suggest crypto exchanges in Japan are comfortably profitable. Coincheck, the venue that lost client assets to hackers in January, reported an estimated $US490 million in operating profit in the 10 months before the theft (the exchange was later bought by Monex).\nThere's no guarantee that the boom times will last.\nAverage daily turnover at global crypto exchanges fell to $US9.1 billion in April from $US17 billion in December as prices for most major tokens sank more than 50 per cent from their highs, according to CryptoCompare. In another sign of waning interest, Google searches for \"Bitcoin\" and \"crypto\" have dropped by more than 70 per cent since late last year.\nThat said, Bitcoin is still up more than 1,800 per cent on a two-year horizon -- trading around $US9,270 on Thursday -- and the flood of ICOs shows little sign of stopping despite growing regulatory scrutiny. For Wall Street types who watched the go-go years of 2005-2007 give way to the global crisis and a more utility-like role for banks in the aftermath, the excitement surrounding cryptocurrencies is proving tough to resist.\n\"I just didn't see a future in traditional finance,\" said Daisuke Murayama, the 35-year-old former Barclays trader who took a pay cut to join bitFlyer in February. \"It's never coming back.\"\nBloomberg\nCryptocurrencies Bitcoin ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T09:21:42.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "40d4fa53b473b6b191845bffb8c8ed849a187d2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFQwb3.FcJ3hGJxloy9BiUR4_m6uRfF2FAG3Ptu65lugH5McjKwR0JElBn_vugaogx6wDz5p4EG0ZQ4ICC3ZSgNEBdC3ara0je6kRhspsVqLsncQ4EiM1Y9HAfK6WaYUOeuX71A8O0WvUeESEaOEYOGkXChl2qfHfPI-", "site_full": "forextv.com", "site": "forextv.com", "site_section": "http://forextv.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "retirement_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "ForexTV", "title": "An aspiring Bloomberg for bitcoin is connecting investors directly with the teams working on the hottest cryptos", "title_full": "An aspiring Bloomberg for bitcoin is connecting investors directly with the teams working on the hottest cryptos", "published": "2018-05-11T02:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "40d4fa53b473b6b191845bffb8c8ed849a187d2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFQwb3.FcJ3hGJxloy9BiUR4_m6uRfF2FAG3Ptu65lugH5McjKwR0JElBn_vugaogx6wDz5p4EG0ZQ4ICC3ZSgNEBdC3ara0je6kRhspsVqLsncQ4EiM1Y9HAfK6WaYUOeuX71A8O0WvUeESEaOEYOGkXChl2qfHfPI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin News Editor", "published": "2018-05-11T02:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "An aspiring Bloomberg for bitcoin is connecting investors directly with the teams working on the hottest cryptos", "text": "Home / Bitcoin News Wire / An aspiring Bloomberg for bitcoin is connecting investors directly with the teams working on the hottest cryptos An aspiring Bloomberg for bitcoin is connecting investors directly with the teams working on the hottest cryptos Posted by: Bitcoin News Editor in Bitcoin News Wire 1 min ago\nBlockfolio, an app crypto investors can use to view their investments, has raised $3 million in funding.

The nation's virtual currency exchanges are now licensed by Japan's securities watchdog, giving the venues an official stamp of approval that's largely absent from countries like the US and Britain. For Kano, that makes Japan the ideal base for an increasingly global operation.\n\"My target is to be number one in the world,\" the former derivatives and convertible bonds trader said in an interview from his office in Midtown Tower, the tIny Tokyo skyscraper that's also home to Blackstone Group and Bain & Co. \"To get there, I need to grow headcount. And those with the best skills come from global banks.\"\nKano's four-year-old exchange is already the world's fourth largest crypto venue by turnover, after BitMex, Binance and OKEx, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from exchanges, Coinhills and Coinmarketcap.com. Transactions on bitFlyer averaged about $US2 billion a day during late April and early May, thanks in large part to Bitcoin margin contracts popular with Japanese day-traders. The venue's users have tripled in the past year to 2 million.\nAdvertisement Replay\nReplay Video Loading Play Video\nOn top of existing locations in Tokyo, San Francisco and Luxembourg, Kano is eyeing new offices in Africa, South America, Australia and other parts of Asia. He's also expanding beyond crypto trading to businesses that include digital payments and a brokerage-advisory service for investors and startups interested in initial coin offerings. The strategy is similar to that of Mike Novogratz, another Goldman alum who recently started a New York-based crypto merchant bank.\nKano, bitFlyer's co-founder and chief executive officer, said former traders and bankers are ideal for crypto firms because they understand how to operate in regulated markets -- a skill set that's becoming more important as governments around the world scrutinize an industry notorious for security lapses and money laundering risks. Last month, bitFlyer tightened its anti-money laundering rules after the Nikkei newspaper reported that users could perform some limited functions without fully completing customer verification.\n\"Crypto companies need finance guys to fill roles across the board: business development, sales, account management, operations, and compliance just to name a few,\" said Razin Ashraf, head of Tokyo-based recruiting firm Divine Solutions Japan.\nOf course, technology matters too. Kano's hiring spree also includes coders, who can make $US100,000 at bitFlyer with a high school -- or even middle school -- education if they've got a track record of success at hackathons or coding tournaments.\nKano, 42, said bitFlyer's ideal finance recruits fall into one of two groups: experienced bankers in their 40s tired of corporate bureaucracy, or younger associates in their 20s who've become disillusioned with the industry and are hungry for a taste of startup life.\nLoading \"Japan is facing long-term headwinds including negative interest rates, which is driving headcount lower at finance firms,\" said Yoshiharu Akahane, who oversees fintech research at Tokyo-based NTT Data Corp. \"That coincides with our huge crypto boom, which is much stronger than in the rest of the world, and explains why more people may jump to the crypto industry.\"\nKano can't promise to beat the banks on salaries, but he said there are plenty of people at bitFlyer who earn more than $US200,000 a year.\nStock options are also a major draw. All of bitFlyer's full-time employees receive them and can cash out without having to wait for the company's planned initial public offering, Kano said, declining to elaborate on a timeframe for an IPO. \"At what other startup can the secretary become a millionaire?\"\nThat upside potential could help bitFlyer compete for talent even as Wall Street firms tiptoe into the crypto space themselves. Goldman is preparing to open a Bitcoin-trading business, while Intercontinental Exchange Inc., the owner of New York Stock Exchange, is said to be working on a platform that would let investors bet on the cryptocurrency. In Japan, financial companies including SBI Holdings and Monex Group are making big investments in crypto businesses.\nLoading While Kano declined to discuss details of bitFlyer's finances, disclosures from one of its rivals suggest crypto exchanges in Japan are comfortably profitable. Coincheck, the venue that lost client assets to hackers in January, reported an estimated $US490 million in operating profit in the 10 months before the theft (the exchange was later bought by Monex).\nThere's no guarantee that the boom times will last.\nAverage daily turnover at global crypto exchanges fell to $US9.1 billion in April from $US17 billion in December as prices for most major tokens sank more than 50 per cent from their highs, according to CryptoCompare. In another sign of waning interest, Google searches for \"Bitcoin\" and \"crypto\" have dropped by more than 70 per cent since late last year.\nThat said, Bitcoin is still up more than 1,800 per cent on a two-year horizon -- trading around $US9,270 on Thursday -- and the flood of ICOs shows little sign of stopping despite growing regulatory scrutiny. For Wall Street types who watched the go-go years of 2005-2007 give way to the global crisis and a more utility-like role for banks in the aftermath, the excitement surrounding cryptocurrencies is proving tough to resist.\n\"I just didn't see a future in traditional finance,\" said Daisuke Murayama, the 35-year-old former Barclays trader who took a pay cut to join bitFlyer in February. \"It's never coming back.\"\nBloomberg\nCryptocurrencies Bitcoin Comments disabled Morning & Afternoon Newsletter Delivered Mon–Fri.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yuji nakamura", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hideki", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "takahiko hyuga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yuzo kano", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "credit suisse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barclays", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T02:12:23.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "139d04845c27f1115e19fd8d7e67ff737512a308", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFdUjJ_gRyW5pSj3mzS49iFy1YTkC.QmI3fYUWrpgFlI3t9rmKK3dlW3vfuBSt.bju3Ah8KPtR0lKeOhWCsa8hNZMtpW1lcyfcQ--", "site_full": "www.youbrandinc.com", "site": "youbrandinc.com", "site_section": "http://www.youbrandinc.com/feed", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "You Brand, Inc.", "title": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH), DASH, & VeChain (VEN) Price Jump – Big Partnerships", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH), DASH, & VeChain (VEN) Price Jump – Big Partnerships", "published": "2018-05-11T02:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.youbrandinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin-Cash-Edited.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "139d04845c27f1115e19fd8d7e67ff737512a308", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFdUjJ_gRyW5pSj3mzS49iFy1YTkC.QmI3fYUWrpgFlI3t9rmKK3dlW3vfuBSt.bju3Ah8KPtR0lKeOhWCsa8hNZMtpW1lcyfcQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Scanlon", "published": "2018-05-11T02:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH), DASH, & VeChain (VEN) Price Jump – Big Partnerships", "text": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH), DASH, & VeChain (VEN) Price Jump – Big Partnerships by 0\nBitcoin Cash (BCH), DASH, & VeChain (VEN) – This week has been extremely quiet. There haven’t been any big updates to any of the major blockchain projects.\nMonths ago, the market’s volatility ran high as various countries began implementing various regulations to try and control cryptocurrency. Lately, however, the governments have remained fairly quiet since the latest G20 summit and the market has remained somewhat ‘consistent’ in response.\nAt press time, the entire market cap is sitting just over $435 billion. Let’s take a look at the coins that are leading the market this morning!\nToday’s BCH run-up is in response to the upgrade that its network will go through in five days. Currently, Bitcoin Cash remains as the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\nAt press time, BCH is trading at $1,651.05 a coin, up 5.24%, in 24 hours. For the week, BCH is up 10.8% and for the month, the coin is up 159%. The DASH team has been fairly quiet as of late, as the coin currently sits as the 13th largest cryptocurrency by market cap.

His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.\nIn the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: how much digital cash does it really hold?\nLow on trust and high on volatility: Can Bitcoin find a reason to exist beyond shady transactions? Gold casts of Nelson Mandela’s hands sell to Ontario cryptocurrency company for $10 million in Bitcoin ‘Secure and super private’: This tiny Canadian bank is building a vault for cryptocurrencies Two Xapo clients said it houses roughly US$10 billion of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoin’s price, after all, is hardly steady.\n‘Patient Zero’ Even in the colourful world of crypto the cache is remarkable — amounting to about 7 per cent of the global Bitcoin supply. It would mean Xapo, just 4 years old, has more “deposits” than 98 per cent of the roughly 5,670 banks in the U.S. But as a custodian it’s regulated differently. The Swiss subsidiary is overseen by the self-regulating Financial Services Standards Association, which audits members to ensure they comply with anti-money-laundering rules. Xapo serves U.S. customers through a Delaware corporation that’s registered with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and is licensed in several states.\nThe outsize holdings underscore the faith that Casares — a serial entrepreneur nicknamed “Patient Zero” for stirring Silicon Valley’s interest in Bitcoin — has garnered among his acolytes and at major crypto investment firms, such as Grayscale and CoinShares.\n“Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,” said Ryan Radloff of CoinShares, which has more than US$500 million of Bitcoin stored at Xapo. “You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.”\nArgentine entrepreneur and Xapo founder Wences Casares. Daniel Acker/Bloomberg\nXapo’s billionaire backers include LinkedIn Corp. co-founder Reid Hoffman and former Wall Street trader Mike Novogratz, who’s in the process of setting up his own cryptocurrency merchant bank. Their bet is that Bitcoin is here to stay, and so is its biggest scourge, theft.\nThe first rule of owning Bitcoin is to securely keep your private key — the code that lets you spend your coins. If thieves get it, they can loot your holdings in an instant, with no hope of recovery. Putting keys on a device connected to the Internet is both convenient and perilous: Hackers have proven adept at obtaining them from afar.\nThe most popular alternative is called cold storage, keeping the key in an offline device such as a thumb drive. But risks remain: Hackers have also proven adept at setting traps on computers to access cold-storage devices the moment they’re online. More traditional criminals have committed home invasions and kidnappings. Some Bitcoin tycoons have resorted to hiding their identities, fortifying their homes and studying self-defense.\nTrading Desk Xapo’s solution is to bury a cold-storage device in a mountainside and layer on electronic safeguards.\n“They’re the first folks who recognized custodial and security functions would be key,” said Hoffman, whose venture capital firm Greylock Partners led a US$20-million investment in Xapo in 2014, a couple of years after Casares persuaded him to buy his first Bitcoin. “He made the pitch in the morning and in the afternoon I called him with an offer.”\nAt Xapo, retrieving Bitcoin from the vault takes about two days. The company verifies a client’s identity and authenticates the request before manually signing the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations. Approval from three separate vaults is required for any transactions to be authorized. The company also offers customers a trading desk to buy and sell Bitcoin and created the first Bitcoin debit card to spend it.\nCasares, 44, declined to comment for this story. After a flurry of publicity at Xapo’s launch, he has drawn big audiences at crypto conferences but largely shunned media interviews.\nYet his persuasiveness is legendary. His evangelizing of Bitcoin is so pervasive in Silicon Valley that when Hoffman asked his family office to buy some, his banker asked when he’d spoken to Casares. Xapo’s advisers now include former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, ex-Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Officer John Reed and Visa International founder Dee Hock.\nSuch salesmanship has been critical to Xapo’s success. First Block Capital, Canada’s first fully registered crypto firm, picked Xapo as its custodian after months of due diligence, including touring the Swiss vault.\n“Every part of their DNA is geared to security,” said Sean Clark, First Block’s founder, who noted the vault’s fingerprint scanners were equipped with a pulse reader to prevent amputated hands from being used. “Whenever we make big transfers they FaceTime us, we have duress words, if it’s big enough they’ll fly out to see us.”\nXapo is doubling down on its pursuit of institutional clients, with President Ted Rogers enlisting Peter Najarian, a veteran of emerging-market trading at UBS Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, to oversee outreach to investors including pension funds, private banks, assets managers, family offices and hedge funds.\n‘Tidal Wave’ The perceived lack of an institutional-grade custodial solution for Bitcoin has been one of the sticking points for many money managers looking to try the asset class. Xapo says its already offering precisely that solution. If it persuades them of its merits, the implications for Bitcoin would be profound.\n“A fraction of that kind of institutional money flowing into the space would be a tidal wave,” Najarian said.\nCasares has made acceptance of Bitcoin his life’s mission. Born to sheep ranchers in Argentina’s remote Patagonia region, he experienced the impact of inflation throughout his youth.\nThat drove him to build a series of fintech startups that made him millions before he encountered Bitcoin. He sold 75 per cent of Patagon, a Latin American financial-services website, for US$529 million in 2000 and digital wallet startup Lemon for US$43 million 13 years later to focus on crypto. By then, he was already a big holder of Bitcoin.\n“I am personally allocating a percentage of my net worth to this that is borderline irresponsible because I believe in it so much,” Casares told Lemon board member Eric O’Brien, according to “Digital Gold,” a book by Nathaniel Popper. Two years ago, he joined the board of PayPal Holdings Inc.\n‘High Hurdle’ Bitcoin’s meteoric rise in recent years has spurred the proliferation of rival currencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple that also have multibillion-dollar valuations. Yet Xapo only safeguards Bitcoin because of Casares’s belief that it alone will succeed. Such dogmatism has seen Xapo turn away customers looking to store rival currencies.\nOther purists say ventures such as Xapo have no place in the Bitcoin ecosystem, slowing down what’s supposed to be a seamless transfer.\nXapo’s top brass wrestle with that paradox, too.\n“It’s a subject we discuss a lot, and we believe Bitcoin won’t reach the mainstream if people have to hold their own private keys,” Rogers said. “It’s a pretty high hurdle technically to be your own bank with lots of security.”\nBloomberg.com\nBitcoin More diversity needed in B.C.'s tech sector, says female executive Business Trends This content was provided by Market One Media Group for commercial purposes.\nx Sponsored by Market One Media Group Permex Petroleum’s projects are in one of the hottest regions in North America Democracy in medicine Providing virtual healthcare to the masses Venzee’s cloud-based technology is reducing labour and costs by automating supply chain ordering Connect With Us News Releases Business Wire Rimini Street Delivers Premium SAP Support to Solar Frontier Bluedrop Releases Q2 2018 Financial Results CORRECTING and REPLACING Reis & Irvy’s Frozen Yogurt Robots Are Coming to Canada Telson Mining Corporation Clarifies Definition of Cash Flow in News Release Declaring Commercial Production at ...

Financial Post", "text": "Behind the guards, the blast doors and down corridors of reinforced concrete, sit the encrypted computer servers — connected to nothing — that hold keys to a vast digital fortune.\nArgentine entrepreneur Wences Casares has spent the past several years persuading Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires that Bitcoin is the global currency of the future, that they need to buy some, and that he’s the man to safeguard it. His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.\nIn the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: how much digital cash does it really hold?\nLow on trust and high on volatility: Can Bitcoin find a reason to exist beyond shady transactions? Gold casts of Nelson Mandela’s hands sell to Ontario cryptocurrency company for $10 million in Bitcoin ‘Secure and super private’: This tiny Canadian bank is building a vault for cryptocurrencies Two Xapo clients said it houses roughly US$10 billion of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoin’s price, after all, is hardly steady.\n‘Patient Zero’ Even in the colourful world of crypto the cache is remarkable — amounting to about 7 per cent of the global Bitcoin supply. It would mean Xapo, just 4 years old, has more “deposits” than 98 per cent of the roughly 5,670 banks in the U.S. But as a custodian it’s regulated differently. The Swiss subsidiary is overseen by the self-regulating Financial Services Standards Association, which audits members to ensure they comply with anti-money-laundering rules. Xapo serves U.S. customers through a Delaware corporation that’s registered with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and is licensed in several states.\nThe outsize holdings underscore the faith that Casares — a serial entrepreneur nicknamed “Patient Zero” for stirring Silicon Valley’s interest in Bitcoin — has garnered among his acolytes and at major crypto investment firms, such as Grayscale and CoinShares.\n“Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,” said Ryan Radloff of CoinShares, which has more than US$500 million of Bitcoin stored at Xapo. “You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.”\nArgentine entrepreneur and Xapo founder Wences Casares. Daniel Acker/Bloomberg Xapo’s billionaire backers include LinkedIn Corp. co-founder Reid Hoffman and former Wall Street trader Mike Novogratz, who’s in the process of setting up his own cryptocurrency merchant bank. Their bet is that Bitcoin is here to stay, and so is its biggest scourge, theft.\nThe first rule of owning Bitcoin is to securely keep your private key — the code that lets you spend your coins. If thieves get it, they can loot your holdings in an instant, with no hope of recovery. Putting keys on a device connected to the Internet is both convenient and perilous: Hackers have proven adept at obtaining them from afar.\nThe most popular alternative is called cold storage, keeping the key in an offline device such as a thumb drive. But risks remain: Hackers have also proven adept at setting traps on computers to access cold-storage devices the moment they’re online. More traditional criminals have committed home invasions and kidnappings. Some Bitcoin tycoons have resorted to hiding their identities, fortifying their homes and studying self-defense.\nTrading Desk Xapo’s solution is to bury a cold-storage device in a mountainside and layer on electronic safeguards.\n“They’re the first folks who recognized custodial and security functions would be key,” said Hoffman, whose venture capital firm Greylock Partners led a US$20-million investment in Xapo in 2014, a couple of years after Casares persuaded him to buy his first Bitcoin. “He made the pitch in the morning and in the afternoon I called him with an offer.”\nAt Xapo, retrieving Bitcoin from the vault takes about two days. The company verifies a client’s identity and authenticates the request before manually signing the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations. Approval from three separate vaults is required for any transactions to be authorized. The company also offers customers a trading desk to buy and sell Bitcoin and created the first Bitcoin debit card to spend it.\nCasares, 44, declined to comment for this story. After a flurry of publicity at Xapo’s launch, he has drawn big audiences at crypto conferences but largely shunned media interviews.\nYet his persuasiveness is legendary. His evangelizing of Bitcoin is so pervasive in Silicon Valley that when Hoffman asked his family office to buy some, his banker asked when he’d spoken to Casares. Xapo’s advisers now include former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, ex-Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Officer John Reed and Visa International founder Dee Hock.\nSuch salesmanship has been critical to Xapo’s success. First Block Capital, Canada’s first fully registered crypto firm, picked Xapo as its custodian after months of due diligence, including touring the Swiss vault.\n“Every part of their DNA is geared to security,” said Sean Clark, First Block’s founder, who noted the vault’s fingerprint scanners were equipped with a pulse reader to prevent amputated hands from being used. “Whenever we make big transfers they FaceTime us, we have duress words, if it’s big enough they’ll fly out to see us.”\nXapo is doubling down on its pursuit of institutional clients, with President Ted Rogers enlisting Peter Najarian, a veteran of emerging-market trading at UBS Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, to oversee outreach to investors including pension funds, private banks, assets managers, family offices and hedge funds.\n‘Tidal Wave’ The perceived lack of an institutional-grade custodial solution for Bitcoin has been one of the sticking points for many money managers looking to try the asset class. Xapo says its already offering precisely that solution. If it persuades them of its merits, the implications for Bitcoin would be profound.\n“A fraction of that kind of institutional money flowing into the space would be a tidal wave,” Najarian said.\nCasares has made acceptance of Bitcoin his life’s mission. Born to sheep ranchers in Argentina’s remote Patagonia region, he experienced the impact of inflation throughout his youth.\nThat drove him to build a series of fintech startups that made him millions before he encountered Bitcoin. He sold 75 per cent of Patagon, a Latin American financial-services website, for US$529 million in 2000 and digital wallet startup Lemon for US$43 million 13 years later to focus on crypto. By then, he was already a big holder of Bitcoin.\n“I am personally allocating a percentage of my net worth to this that is borderline irresponsible because I believe in it so much,” Casares told Lemon board member Eric O’Brien, according to “Digital Gold,” a book by Nathaniel Popper. Two years ago, he joined the board of PayPal Holdings Inc.\n‘High Hurdle’ Bitcoin’s meteoric rise in recent years has spurred the proliferation of rival currencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple that also have multibillion-dollar valuations. Yet Xapo only safeguards Bitcoin because of Casares’s belief that it alone will succeed. Such dogmatism has seen Xapo turn away customers looking to store rival currencies.\nOther purists say ventures such as Xapo have no place in the Bitcoin ecosystem, slowing down what’s supposed to be a seamless transfer.\nXapo’s top brass wrestle with that paradox, too.\n“It’s a subject we discuss a lot, and we believe Bitcoin won’t reach the mainstream if people have to hold their own private keys,” Rogers said. “It’s a pretty high hurdle technically to be your own bank with lots of security.”\nBloomberg.com\n0 Comments Share your thoughts ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nelson mandela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wences casares", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ontario", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T20:51:57.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5fbb2b1aca23b8e7af3da3cd37a34588eb335047", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMvZ2NML4ZWKlK2UhJRT1gXqEpNf5cLzbdu.KkA9EeSbH9PP.0HUQ9RcoVEosxIL7uTcDajTvu4btg.CwF4_xfp4O2llEZHVzsgjSLgE07hU1BdOt1eIVdnNZdPkJSCNrd1vwaVOlLXzn.v4D0JQ6OZWLbbrrqWt39Ndk0ZVDWqQmx8Qr_SEMeSIn3Zu8t6BtuQ-", "site_full": "vancouversun.com", "site": "vancouversun.com", "site_section": "http://vancouversun.com/category/technology", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Technology News, Headlines, Trends &amp; Reviews | Vancouver Sun ", "title": "Vast system of underground vaults for the rich said to hoard $10-billion of Bitcoin", "title_full": "Vast system of underground vaults for the rich said to hoard $10-billion of Bitcoin | Vancouver Sun", "published": "2018-05-11T01:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.882, "main_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/0510bitcoin.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 16800, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5fbb2b1aca23b8e7af3da3cd37a34588eb335047", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMvZ2NML4ZWKlK2UhJRT1gXqEpNf5cLzbdu.KkA9EeSbH9PP.0HUQ9RcoVEosxIL7uTcDajTvu4btg.CwF4_xfp4O2llEZHVzsgjSLgE07hU1BdOt1eIVdnNZdPkJSCNrd1vwaVOlLXzn.v4D0JQ6OZWLbbrrqWt39Ndk0ZVDWqQmx8Qr_SEMeSIn3Zu8t6BtuQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-11T01:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Vast system of underground vaults for the rich said to hoard $10-billion of Bitcoin", "text": "Behind the guards, the blast doors and down corridors of reinforced concrete, sit the encrypted computer servers — connected to nothing — that hold keys to a vast digital fortune.\nArgentine entrepreneur Wences Casares has spent the past several years persuading Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires that Bitcoin is the global currency of the future, that they need to buy some, and that he’s the man to safeguard it.

Such dogmatism has seen Xapo turn away customers looking to store rival currencies.\nOther purists say ventures such as Xapo have no place in the Bitcoin ecosystem, slowing down what’s supposed to be a seamless transfer.\nXapo’s top brass wrestle with that paradox, too.\n“It’s a subject we discuss a lot, and we believe Bitcoin won’t reach the mainstream if people have to hold their own private keys,” Rogers said. “It’s a pretty high hurdle technically to be your own bank with lots of security.”\nBloomberg.com\nBitcoin Review: The Boy on the Beach contains lessons for humanity as...

Most people who invested in Bitcoin recently are sitting on negative equity or have cashed out losing.\nEthereum and Ripple backers have similar stories to share with their Bitcoin owning counterparts. But for portfolio manager Jeet Sign cryptocurrency volatility isn’t surprising and he envisages Bitcoin’s value hitting $50k this year.\nSingh gave his views about cryptocurrencies to RT while attending the Davos Economic Forum in Switzerland. He’s been operating in the cryptocurrency space for the last six years. He’s seen similar volatility time and again. And he’s also experienced fluctuations by more than 80% and above on a regular basis.\nSingh drew comparisons between cryptocurrency and the early performance of Microsoft and Apple stock.\n“If you look at Microsoft or Apple when they went public their stocks were very volatile because the market wasn’t mature,” he said.\nThe lack of vendors accepting cryptocurrencies as payment results in cryptocurrencies being used more like as a store of value.

However I am not sure if there were even exchanges in 2009. Bitcoin was incredibly new at that time and would have likely been worthless. If you had Bitcoin and there were an exchange to buy and sell Bitcoin at, then your Bitcoin would either be on that exchange or in a local wallet on your computer.\nIf your Bitcoin was on that exchange, you should try to figure out what exchange you had used. Unfortunately it is likely that if you did use an exchange that it has since ceased to exist, so even if you did figure out what exchange, you probably can't get your Bitcoin.\nIf your Bitcoin was on your computer, then you would have been using the satoshi client as that was the only wallet software at that time. This would have resulted in you having a file named wallet.dat that contains all of the information necessary for you to retrieve your Bitcoin.

A number of Bitcoin investors are locking up their loot in underground vaults across the globe to prevent them from being stolen.\nXapo, a Hong Kong-based company that provides Bitcoin wallet and cold storage services, now holds close to $10 billion worth of BTC in its vaults, Bloomberg reports .\nThat’s roughly 6 percent of BTC’s current market cap being stored by a single entity – making Xapo one of the largest cryptocurrency storage services on the planet.\nXapo is one of the first companies to capitalize on the security concerns associated with storing Bitcoins, which have been rampant pretty much since the virtual currency’s inception. In fact, the first major Bitcoin theft , of 25,000 BTC (worth $231 million at today’s market price), can be traced back to 2011, when Bitcoin was still worth $19.\nXapo’s clientele has the option of locking away their cryptocurrency in one of its vaults located in undisclosed physical locations across three different continents, guarded by biometric locks and armed guards. The private key to a customer’s wallet is stored in these vaults, and access is granted to the user only if their identity has been established beyond doubt.\nThe shortcomings with the usual wallet services force cryptocurrency holders to turn to such extreme methods to store their valued investments.\nExchange wallet services offer the simplest user experience, especially for frequent trading, but they are the worst when it comes to security . A number of exchanges have lost significant money of their users to hackers including Mt. Gox , Bitfinex , Poloniex , Bitstamp , and Bitfloor .\nOnline wallets are considered to be a safer choice, but even they are vulnerable to phishing attacks and compromise of private keys.\nWhile hardware wallets are considered even safer, researchers have shown that these can be hacked too . In March, a 15-year-old programmer managed to hack Ledger Neno S and even disclosed the security flaw to the company.\nIt is worth noting that while Xapo’s services significantly improve the security concerns associated with Bitcoin storage, they kind of defeat the entire purpose of cryptocurrencies.\nLocking up your Bitcoins in remote physical locations don’t exactly sound like the ideal way to secure a supposedly revolutionary digital currency.\nIt takes upward of 48 hours for your Bitcoin to show up in your Xapo wallet from the company’s vaults if you want to withdraw them, that is on business days — your wait can stretch up to 4 days if you happen to catch the weekend in between.\nIf you intend to further trade your BTC for another cryptocurrency, there is an added wait and cost for transferring your BTC to an exchange wallet.\nXapo’s services are meant for HODLing Bitcoin for a long term like you would gold, and might suit major investors. But for people who hold smaller investments, or who like to frequently trade their cryptocurrencies, Xapo’s services are less than ideal. Both the cost incurred in the transactions and the time taken will be too high for it to be viable.\nXapo’s solution to the Bitcoin’s security problem is not efficient for mass adoption, and better solutions need to be figured out.\nWhile it’s interesting that a service like Xapo’s exists, it underscores the need for better solutions that all investors can take advantage of. Hopefully, we’ll see a better security option soon: the Ethereum Foundation is looking to fund projects that are trying solve the security problems faced by existing wallet services.\nNeer Varshney is a Journalist with 5+ years of experience and has been in the Cryptocurrency sphere since late 2015.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/01/06/5-million-stolen-bitcoin-exchange-bitstamp-hack-attack/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheNextWeb+%28The+Next+Web+All+Stories%29", "https://www.coindesk.com/poloniex-loses-12-3-bitcoins-latest-bitcoin-exchange-hack/", "https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/21/a-15-year-old-hacked-the-secure-ledger-crypto-wallet/", "https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/03/20/ledger-nano-s-hack-cryptocurrency/", "https://thenextweb.com/cryptocurrency/2018/02/26/why-you-should-not-store-your-cryptos-on-an-exchange-but-use-a-wallet-instead/", "https://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/09/05/top-us-bitcoin-exchange-hacked-250000-btc-stolen/", "https://thenextweb.com/insider/2016/08/03/bitcoin-bitfinex-75-million-stolen/", "https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/04/24/myetherwallet-mew-suffers-dns-attack-user-funds-stolen/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/bunkers-for-the-wealthy-are-said-to-hoard-10-billion-of-bitcoin", "https://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/06/15/close-to-us500k-stolen-in-first-major-bitcoin-theft/", "https://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/03/03/troubled-exchange-mt-gox-confirms-loss-of-750000-bitcoins-blames-a-bug-in-the-bitcoin-system/", "https://thenextweb.com/topic/bitcoin/", "https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/04/17/ethereum-cryptocurrency-wallets-user-friendly-secure/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T09:40:34.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1b1a247786dff98ca1eb8aae3650bd2bffcbf82d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFQwb3.FcJ3hGJxloy9BiUR4qs23DRgOyxytFxA5ZhExW9pUj1AjKkRT9mzHNLmwz6AvwbTzWT57KanfOYL2kIJmOdlHWSzXB3732I1NrULKN3AQaQSiqvJzUn4jNo5j8IMT6G8M2iTy7MdXKut7WtGfvzCQvDj1CUQ-", "site_full": "forextv.com", "site": "forextv.com", "site_section": "http://forextv.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "retirement_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "ForexTV", "title": "An aspiring Bloomberg of bitcoin is connecting investors directly with the teams working on the hottest cryptos", "title_full": "An aspiring Bloomberg of bitcoin is connecting investors directly with the teams working on the hottest cryptos", "published": "2018-05-11T01:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b1a247786dff98ca1eb8aae3650bd2bffcbf82d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFQwb3.FcJ3hGJxloy9BiUR4qs23DRgOyxytFxA5ZhExW9pUj1AjKkRT9mzHNLmwz6AvwbTzWT57KanfOYL2kIJmOdlHWSzXB3732I1NrULKN3AQaQSiqvJzUn4jNo5j8IMT6G8M2iTy7MdXKut7WtGfvzCQvDj1CUQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin News Editor", "published": "2018-05-11T01:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "An aspiring Bloomberg of bitcoin is connecting investors directly with the teams working on the hottest cryptos", "text": "Home / Bitcoin News Wire / An aspiring Bloomberg of bitcoin is connecting investors directly with the teams working on the hottest cryptos An aspiring Bloomberg of bitcoin is connecting investors directly with the teams working on the hottest cryptos Posted by: Bitcoin News Editor in Bitcoin News Wire 1 min ago\nBlockfolio, an app crypto investors can use to view their investments, has raised $3 million in funding.

The BTC.com wallet will be the first cryptocurrency app offered by Shenzhen-based Huawei. The AppGallery will be pre-installed on all new Huawei and Honor phones and will be rolled out to older devices in the coming months, he said.\nThe move will likely have the most impact in the Chinese market, where Huawei is the biggest mobile phone seller. The nation has been a hotbed for cryptocurrencies. The Chinese government blocks Android’s Google Play Store and some sections of Apple’s iTunes, limiting access to apps like BTC.com’s. While China has shut down cryptocurrency trading platforms and initial coin offerings, people can still own virtual currencies.\n“It’s a good opportunity to tap into the Chinese market,” de la Torre said in a telephone interview. “The use of cashless payments with apps is very big and the traditional banking system is lacking, so there’s a good use case for crypto payments to grow there.”\nBTC.com, which also controls the world’s largest Bitcoin mining pool, is owned by mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain Technologies.

Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The value of currencies may fluctuate and investors may lose all or more than their original investments. Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The leveraged nature of FX trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds and such may work against you as well as for you.

The recently launched Bitcoin Futures on the CBOE previously had no negative effects on the Bitcoin market, but the CME?\nThe largest “Bitcoin Future”-the market will open in two days for all investors of the gates and so open the way, to speculate strongly on the Bitcoin. The immediate impact on the crypto market is not likely to be immediate, so that a critical examination of the long-term consequences appears to be as worthwhile.\nAs we have already discussed at this point, the price of a “Bitcoin Future”market does not have a direct influence on the Bitcoin. Any speculation, regardless of the outstanding capital tied up in Bitcoin, made. Nevertheless, a not insignificant connection, which could affect the price significantly.\nInvestors who have already committed large amounts of capital in Bitcoin, could speculate on a market movement, allowing you to run exactly those capital flow movements, which correspond to your bet.\nInvestor A price speculated on a falling Bitcoin, because he knows exactly: “If I move my capital from the bitcoin market, it will drop the course immediately.” The is distributed a large part of the bitcoin capital on only a few bitcoin holder is now no longer a secret and well-known in the industry.\nPrecisely, this fact can lead to a controlled market manipulation and bitcoin’s price affect. Of course, this is not an acceptance, which must occur, however, you should be aware of this risk.\nCurrently, the bitcoin price moves in the direction of a new all-time highs and continues the unhealthy end of the Rally of recent days and weeks continue to grace freely. Whether we will experience with the Launch of the CME, a course correction is uncertain. Probably, however, will flow new fresh capital in the market.\nThe EU is considering stricter rules in regards to bitcoin trading\nThe EU wants to introduce stricter controls on all exchanges trading Bitcoin,. It is no longer possible to send anonymous transactions, as well as to conduct transactions with Prepaid cards. The aim of these measures is to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism.\nPeter Zilgavis makes it clear that crypto-currencies will definitely should continue to exist, however, it must be examined what rules or conditions are necessary:\n“The Blockchain Observatory will be launched in January 2018 and will see a close collaboration with innovators and look at the different use cases of cryptocurrency and decide whether it will be worth intervening or leaving the market alone. The FinTech Action Plan to be published in March of 2018, want to touch upon this issue.“\nDisclaimer: — trading in crypto-currencies carries a large financial risk, and can be up to a total loss of the invested capital.

(Nasdaq: AAPL) shares and refusing to take a stand on gun control, the 87-year-old investing icon took a few shots at bitcoin, saying: “It’s probably rat poison squared.”\nAs a crypto investor , and one who believes in a better, more efficient world served by getting rid of the middleman … I’m going to (surprisingly) agree with Buffett here. Any reference to bitcoin as “rat poison” is an entirely appropriate metaphor.\nWhile rat poison might not be the best means of quenching one’s thirst, however, I don’t think that Buffett’s beverage investment, The Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO), constitutes a healthier alternative.\nRat poison, on the other hand, can be extremely useful for ridding oneself of a rodent infestation. In this case, the vermin-infested governments and corporations (especially banks) that plop themselves smack in the middle of economic transactions, and then extract a Big Gulp-sized toll on societies.\nBitcoin Restores Power to the People\nBitcoin’s technological breakthrough allows anyone with an internet connection to buy and store something of value that’s neither tied to a state nor a bank. This allows the free market to decide what the demand (and price) should be for money, not a group of elitist, egghead economists who spectacularly fail once a decade.\nThis will be a liberating force as citizens are able to hold more of their own value and won’t be subject to the whims of a profligate government or monopolizing middleman.\nBitcoin can be a check on people in power. Citizens now have the option to swap their domestic currency for bitcoin, avoiding hyperinflation and currency debasements that threaten their purchasing power.\nVenezuela’s annual inflation rate is over 1,000%, and bitcoins are bought and sold at significant premiums as the locals ditch their worthless currency for something that can better store value.\nMost citizens simply can’t pick up and move to another country, thereby voting with their feet. And in corrupt democracies like Ivory Coast and Zimbabwe, voting is inconsequential anyway.\nHowever, the threat of millions of citizens voting with their wallets should worry dictators and autocrats from Caracas to Shanghai. A windfall of citizens moving out of their fiat currency into cryptocurrencies would be enough to spark a currency crisis and facilitate social unrest.\nThere’s a reason governments are fearful of bitcoin and have tried to suppress trading and ownership of the digital currency. When they lose control of the money, they lose control of their oppressed citizenry.\nThe Digital Gold Rush\nNow, perhaps ol’ Warren simply got this one wrong. Hey, when you’ve got $84 billion in the bank, it’s hard to empathize with the little guy trying to put food on the table in faraway lands.\nMaybe he didn’t understand how investments in the new “internet of value” actually work. As he recently told Yahoo Finance:\nIf you buy something like a farm, an apartment house or an interest in a business … you can do that on a private basis … and it’s a perfectly satisfactory investment. You look at the investment itself to deliver the return to you. Now, if you buy something like bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don’t really have anything that has produced anything. You’re just hoping the next guy pays more.\nBuffett continued :\nYou aren’t investing when you do that. You’re speculating. There’s nothing wrong with it. If you wanna gamble, somebody else will come along and pay more money tomorrow . That’s one kind of game. That is not investing.\nFirst things first. I agree with the Oracle here that the crypto asset class is entirely speculative.\nMost of the 1,500-plus cryptocurrencies have no real-world product, and therefore no utility value. Many of them likely won’t even launch anything, and they’ll end up burning their investors.\nAs I’ve written before, there’s a digital gold rush happening here, and it’s attracting entrepreneurs with great ideas and charlatans with not-so-great ideas. As the world becomes digitally connected, we will need economies of scale to manage these new networks and provision digital and real-world resources.\nThis is par for the course. Most, if not all, early-stage investments are extremely speculative and difficult to value.\nIt’s the difference between buying a fully furnished home in a well-developed neighborhood and buying a piece of land in the middle of the woods. The raw land might have more upside if the surrounding area is developed, but there’s no guarantee you’ll get your money back.\nCrypto just happens to be the hottest piece of raw property on the market, and people are paying excessive premiums to get a piece .\nEarly-stage investments are notorious for either returning upward of 1,000% or zero. That’s why early-stage investors own large, diversified portfolios of very small bets. If they lose on 90% on them but hit a few home runs, they can still outperform the indexes.\nReality (and gravity) will drag most of these crypto assets down to $0. But some will deliver products that change the world.\nKeep More of Your Hard-Earned Wealth\nBitcoin obviates the need for a bank or government to create and store money, and this is only the first iteration in the crypto space.\nProjects like Ethereum and EOS are building the necessary infrastructure to power smart contracts, a method to exchange anything of value in a transparent way without the need for a middleman. Think about renting someone’s house without Airbnb or calling a taxi without needing Uber.\nOld valuation techniques can’t be applied to these new crypto assets. Discount cash-flow analysis is a futile endeavor. There are no companies here, just open-source software protocols. (Protocol is a fancy way of saying “way of doing things.”)\nThe value of a crypto asset relates to the demand for the digitally linked network. The tokens represent a fee for accessing the network, or a fuel to power a smart contract.\nImagine if you were charged a small fee, represented by an “email token,” to send an email. As more people move from the spying eyes of Google’s Gmail, the value of this token would increase in price.\nAdditionally, since crypto tokens facilitate economic transactions without the need for a middleman, they will allow those who provide value to keep more of their hard-earned wealth.\nIf there’s anything the world could use right now, it’s for workers to keep more of the fruits of their labor.\nI’m sure that’s something Warren Buffett would definitely agree with me on.\nThe post Why Warren Buffett Is Terrified Of Bitcoin appeared first on ValueWalk .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie munger", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "berkshire hathaway", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "apple inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "omaha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "designerkottayam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nebraska", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T02:25:15.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "26e8c8c9b6d2145930d4d2011ca3f19a7d5403b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTOv3b9ziPzjhSAOs7XQAaatS5RQmhUcRl.psxyq4AUHsnSK6eDkVdEFS_9cj0UpPJZ36pSLoxHh9vPrYIOjwzyC1u8NjBE9bwBD2zpo2PKxhdB7Fyqrx2.NRHamlwkHuTtb6iQeNRtkW0PD8z0oIr3vqItFTy263Q-", "site_full": "www.heise.de", "site": "heise.de", "site_section": "http://www.heise.de/ct/rss/artikel-atom.xml", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "c't-Themen", "title": "Wie Segregated Witness das Platzproblem auf der Bitcoin-Blockchain löst", "title_full": "Wie Segregated Witness das Platzproblem auf der Bitcoin-Blockchain löst", "published": "2018-05-11T01:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://heise.cloudimg.io/bound/1920x1920/q90.png-lossy-90.webp-lossy-90.foil1/_www-heise-de_/ct/imgs/04/2/4/2/0/4/5/9/07afe7b38559dddd.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1694, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "26e8c8c9b6d2145930d4d2011ca3f19a7d5403b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTOv3b9ziPzjhSAOs7XQAaatS5RQmhUcRl.psxyq4AUHsnSK6eDkVdEFS_9cj0UpPJZ36pSLoxHh9vPrYIOjwzyC1u8NjBE9bwBD2zpo2PKxhdB7Fyqrx2.NRHamlwkHuTtb6iQeNRtkW0PD8z0oIr3vqItFTy263Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mirko Dölle", "published": "2018-05-11T01:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Wie Segregated Witness das Platzproblem auf der Bitcoin-Blockchain löst", "text": "Wie Segregated Witness das Platzproblem auf der Bitcoin-Blockchain löst Trends & News | News BIP-141 , Bitcoin , Bitcoin Cash , Bitcoin doppelt leistungsfähig , Blockchain , Kryptowährung , Segregated Witness , Soft-Fork Der Bitcoin scheint am eigenen Erfolg zu ersticken: Die Kryptowährung ist offenbar nicht leistungsfähig genug, immer wieder türmen sich unbearbeitete Transaktionen in den Mem-Pools. Hard-Forks wie Bitcoin Cash mit vielfach größeren Blöcken sollten den veralteten Bitcoin ersetzen, doch der hält sich hartnäckig und hat durch sanftes Doping – von den meisten unbemerkt – seine Leistungsfähigkeit verdoppelt. N üchtern betrachtet taugt die Kryptowährung Bitcoin weder zum massenhaften noch zum globalen Einsatz als Zahlungsmittel. Sie ist einfach viel zu beschränkt: So dauert es aufgrund der in Stein gemeißelten Zeitvorgabe mindestens zehn Minuten, bis eine Transaktion in einem Block auftauchen kann. Das Limit von maximal 1 MByte Transaktionsdaten pro Block sorgt zudem dafür, dass darin nur rund 2000 Standard-Transaktionen mit einem Absender und einem Empfänger verarbeitet werden können – weltweit. Da ist es kaum verwunderlich, dass sich Spekulanten bei Kursstürzen gegenseitig überbieten, um für ihre Verkaufs-Transaktion einen Platz im nächsten Block zu ergattern. Kurz vor Weihnachten 2017 war ihnen das über 100 US-Dollar Überweisungsgebühr pro Transaktion wert. Solche Transaktions-Staus und Gebührenexzesse führen zwangsläufig dazu, dass Bitcoin nicht mehr als Zahlungsmittel, sondern nur noch als Investitions- und Spekulationsobjekt benutzt wird. Wer will schon Stunden warten, bis sein Kaffee bezahlt ist oder ein Vielfaches des Kaufpreises als Überweisungsgebühr ausgeben? Auch die Bitcoin-Miner haben ein Interesse an größeren Blöcken, schließlich wird die Transaktionsgebühr pro Byte bezahlt – größere Blöcke bedeuten potenziell höhere Einnahmen aus Transaktionsgebühren. Bei der Suche nach einer Lösung spielen die Miner die größte Rolle, nicht etwa die Bitcoin-Besitzer: Die Miner sind es, die die Transaktionen zu neuen Blöcken verarbeiten. Egal wie eine Änderung aussieht, sie muss die Zustimmung der Miner finden und die Miner müssen ihre Software entsprechend ändern – andernfalls bleibt alles beim Alten. Ein Änderungsvorschlag, der Anfang 2017 große Unterstützung fand, war Segregated Witness 2MB, abgekürzt SegWit2x. Er sah vor, Buchungsdaten und Signaturen der Transaktionen nicht mehr unmittelbar hintereinander im Block zu speichern, sondern voneinander zu trennen (Englisch: segregate). Vorne im Block würden nur noch die Buchungsdaten mit Absender, Empfänger und Betrag stehen, die Signatur hingegen sollte ans Ende des Blocks verlegt werden. Außerdem sollte die Blockgröße auf 2 MByte anwachsen – womit SegWit2x inkompatibel zum damaligen Bitcoin-Protokoll wäre. Dadurch entstünde eine neue Kryptowährung, ein sogenannter Hard-Fork. Der Bitcoin-Börse CoinDesk, dem Mining-Farm-Betreiber ViaBTC und anderen war die Erhöhung der Blockgröße auf 2 MByte zu kurzsichtig. Es würde das Transaktionsvolumen lediglich verdoppeln. Sie unterstützten deshalb einen anderen Vorschlag, der Blockgrößen bis zu 8 MByte vorsah und außerdem einen neuen Algorithmus für eine beschleunigte Anpassung des Schwierigkeitsgrads enthielt, sodass die Kryptowährung künftig schneller auf Schwankungen bei der Anzahl und Leistungsfähigkeit der Miner reagieren könnte. Auch dies wäre ein Hard-Fork, wodurch eine neue Kryptowährung entstünde – ViaBTC nannte sie Bitcoin Cash. Späte Liebe Der dritte Vorschlag stieß bei den Minern zunächst auf wenig Gegenliebe: Er sah ähnlich wie SegWit2x eine Auftrennung von Buchungsdaten und Signaturen vor, die nominale Blockgröße sollte hingegen unverändert bei 1 MByte belassen werden. Dadurch wären die Blöcke weiterhin kompatibel mit dem traditionellen Bitcoin-Protokoll, sodass keine neue Kryptowährung entstehen würde – SegWit wäre ein sogenannter Soft-Fork. Wegen angeblicher Patentverletzungen schwenkten die meisten vormaligen SegWit2x-Unterstützer aber zu SegWit, sodass letztlich am 1. August 2017 der Hard-Fork Bitcoin Cash und am 24. August der Soft-Fork SegWit umgesetzt wurden. SegWit2x hingegen wurde Anfang November 2017 endgültig begraben. Während Bitcoin Cash viel Aufmerksamkeit erfuhr, bekamen die meisten Anwender vom Soft-Fork SegWit kaum etwas mit – der Bitcoin funktionierte ja weiterhin wie gewohnt. Dabei gleicht die Lösung einer Quadratur des Kreises: Dank SegWit ist nun fast doppelt so viel Platz für Transaktionen auf der Blockchain, die SegWit-Blöcke sind aber abwärtskompatibel. Alte Bitcoin-Clients verstehen die neuen Blöcke, ein Upgrade auf SegWit ist eine Option, keine Notwendigkeit. SegWit-fähige Bitcoin-Clients trennen Überweisungen in zwei Transaktionen auf, eine Buchungstransaktion (TX) ohne und eine Witness-Transaktion (WTX) mit Signaturen. Die erste Transaktion enthält somit lediglich die Buchungsdaten mit Absender, Empfänger und Betrag, die Witness-Transaktion hingegen den vollständigen Datensatz inklusive Signaturen. Die Miner schürfen ihre Blöcke wie bisher aus dem Pool traditioneller Bitcoin-Transaktionen sowie aus Buchungstransaktionen von SegWit-Überweisungen. Zudem hängen sie bei SegWit-Überweisungen die Witness-Transaktionen ans Ende des Blocks an. Dabei darf der erste Teil des Blocks ohne Witness-Daten nicht größer als 1 MByte sein. Zweigleisig Alte Bitcoin-Clients können den vorderen Teil eines SegWit-Blocks mit den Buchungsdaten theoretisch verarbeiten. Doch sie müssten die Transaktionen verwerfen, da es keine Signatur gibt, die die Überweisung autorisiert. Der Clou liegt darin, dass Geld aus der Buchungstransaktion von SegWit-Überweisungen stets als gemeinfrei („Anyone can spend“) gekennzeichnet wird. Solches freies Geld konnte vor SegWit jedermann für sich beanspruchen und musste sich nicht mit einer Signatur autorisieren – deshalb handelt es sich in den Augen der alten Bitcoin-Clients um eine gültige Transaktion. Lediglich die erste SegWit-Transaktion, die Geld von einer noch ohne SegWit genutzten Adresse als gemeinfrei kennzeichnet, muss eine Signatur im Buchungsteil enthalten. Auf diese Weise können Bitcoin-Clients, die noch nie etwas von SegWit gehört haben, weiterhin den Zahlungsverkehr verfolgen und auch weiterhin Transaktionen durchführen. Allerdings können sie die Autorisierung von SegWit-Zahlungen nicht verifizieren – denn alle Gelder aus diesen Transaktionen sind vermeintlich gemeinfrei. Moderne Bitcoin-Clients und die Miner, die SegWit beherrschen, wissen hingegen um die neue Funktion des Transaktions-Typs „Anyone can spend“ und verwenden die Witness-Transaktion für die Verifizierung. Sie verhindern, dass ältere Bitcoin-Clients fremde Gelder erfolgreich für sich beanspruchen und – aus ihrer Sicht völlig legal – woanders hin überweisen können: Es gibt für eine solche Transaktion keine Witness-Transaktion, weshalb sie Miner und SegWit-fähige Bitcoin-Clients zurückweisen. Deshalb konnte SegWit erst eingeführt werden, nachdem so gut wie alle Miner auf SegWit umgestellt waren. Platz da! Ohne Signatur benötigen die Buchungstransaktionen von SegWit-Überweisungen deutlich weniger Platz im ersten, noch immer auf maximal 1 MByte begrenzten Block (genauer: TX+WTX/4 maximal 1 MByte), wodurch sich die mögliche Zahl der Transaktionen nahezu verdoppelt. Das Potenzial kann aber nur ausgenutzt werden, wenn Anwender SegWit-fähige Bitcoin-Clients installieren und ihr Geld in SegWit-Wallets übertragen. Eckdaten der Bitcoin-Forks Den ersten nennenswerten Anstieg an SegWit-Überweisungen gab es im Dezember 2017, als jedes Byte in der Blockchain sprichwörtlich mit Gold aufgewogen werden musste. Kurz vor Weihnachten waren erstmals über 15 Prozent aller Transaktionen SegWit-Überweisungen. Inzwischen machen SegWit-Überweisungen bereits über 30 Prozent aller Transaktionen aus, Tendenz weiter steigend. Um die SegWit-Nutzung zu forcieren, dürften die Bitcoin-Miner mittlerweile traditionelle Transaktionen zurückweisen – machen davon aber keinen Gebrauch. Sie bevorzugen stattdessen SegWit-Transaktionen, was dazu führt, dass SegWit-Transaktionen schneller und für weniger Transaktionsgebühr ausgeführt werden als traditionelle Transaktionen. SegWit löst allerdings nicht alle Probleme des Bitcoin: Die Verdopplung des Transaktionsvolumens ist ein großer Schritt, doch Engpässe wie etwa vor Weihnachten 2017 sind damit weiterhin möglich. Auch liegt der Blockabstand noch immer bei 10 Minuten. Dieser Flaschenhals wurde durch SegWit zwar nicht angegangen, doch durch die Einführung von SegWit konnte das Lightning Network (LN) seinen Betrieb aufnehmen. Dort werden Zahlungen innerhalb von Sekunden und praktisch kostenlos außerhalb der Blockchain durchgeführt, die Guthaben der Nutzer aber regelmäßig mit der Blockchain synchronisiert. Damit steigt das Transfervolumen fast ins Unendliche, außerdem sind die einzelnen Zahlungen nicht mehr über die Blockchain nachverfolgbar, was die Privatsphäre schützt. Über diesen Bi-Turbo lesen Sie in einer späteren Ausgabe mehr.

Former NFL star Ricky Williams recommends looking to the stars. Catching Fire\nFormer NFL running back Ricky Williams is well-known for taking an unorthodox career approach, having famously retired from football to pursue — among other things — holistic method. Thus, it may not come as a surprise that the Heisman Trophy winner based his decision to invest in Bitcoin on astrology.\n“When I look at things, I tend to look at astrology to get insight,” Williams told CNBC Make It . One of those things included Bitcoin. Williams explained :\nThe insight that got me interested in Bitcoin was the planet Uranus is about to enter into Taurus.\n[Uranus] is about revolution; it’s about a change in the way we do things; it’s about innovation. [Taurus] is about resources and finances.\n“Revolution.”“Finances.” It’s easy to see where this going.\nAccording to Williams, the combination of Uranus’ revolutionary trait in astrology with Taurus’ focus on wealth and finance led him to the logical conclusion that “we’re going to totally change the way we view and understand [finances].”\nAs an added bonus, Williams explained that Pluto is in the process of passing through Capricorn — which he interprets to mean the downfall of traditional financial institutions. Willians explained:\nI think as people are starting to become disillusioned with our institutions, that things like blockchain and cryptocurrency, it’s the perfect time for them to catch fire and really change the way we do things. So, you know, I had to get a little piece of that action. Responsible Investing\nThat said, Williams is still all about investing responsibly and sticks to the golden rule of “never invest more than you can afford to lose.” The former NFL star only invested a maximum of $50,000 into Bitcoin , explaining:\nI didn’t want to go crazy.\nHe’s also not concerned with the dominant cryptocurrency by market capitalization’s infamous volatility — which he claims is simply par for the astrological course:\nEspecially with the planet Uranus and change, [it’s] always going to be volatile in the beginning. But, still, it’s more of a conscious choice to contribute to the change. If I do well, then great. If not, I’ll still feel like I did my part to contribute to things moving forward.\nWhat do you think of Ricky William’s astrological interpretations in regards to Bitcoin?

At Tuesday’s price, their combined holding was worth about $834.17 million, assuming the twins haven’t sold any.

According to these Billionaires, Bitcoin has no real use, it has no value and can’t be put to any use.\nBrian Kelly gives an interesting analogy in defense of Bitcoin against Warren Buffett’s comment by pointing out that previously Warren Buffett had earlier said that commodities are useless, so petroleum which runs the car according to him is useless. In the same way, Bitcoin or cryptocurrency which runs the blockchain technology is useless.\nAccording to him, Warren Buffett is missing key points about Bitcoin and that he does not really understand the potential of it. He adds on that Warren Buffett was wrong about Google and Amazon before this and he is wrong about Bitcoin too. He just makes stable investments which do not see a high rise or fall, which are secure and the future of it could be easily predicted whereas Brian Kelly believes in investing in more.\nHe further simplifies Bitcoin and says it is just a software, with hundred thousand lines of code, this code helps replace the middleman in the financial services.\nHe then attacks Bill Gates, who has not been supportive of Bitcoin or cryptocurrency but does believe that the blockchain technology is of great value and can be used. Brian says that unlike Microsoft which provides software and which is centralized, Bitcoin is a decentralized software. Bitcoin gives the users incentive to run this open source. making the internet itself a unique economic model.\nHe draws a parallel between the concept of Intranet and Internet and Cryptocurrency and blockchain.\nThe blockchain and cryptocurrency together are like the internet, free but the blockchain alone is more like the intranet. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies give it the power to be an all-powerful economic model.\nBrian ends with remarks that in his opinion, bashing from the billionaires do not cause the market to drop instead promote people to invest. So he does not think the bashing from the billionaires was responsible for Bitcoin’s drop after reaching close to its $10000 mark.\nHe adds:\n“Digital currencies one of the biggest opportunities of our generation”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian kelly
