The RBZ further stated that domestic digital currency operations had sixty days to become compliant. Local reports now reveal the Zimbabwe-based cryptocurrency exchange Golix plans to take the central bank to court for banning digital assets, as the firm emphasizes that the RBZ has no authority to ban cryptocurrencies across the country.\nAlso read: How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid the Same Mistakes as Bitcoin Core, Part 4 of 4 Reserve Bank Of Zimbabwe Faces Legal Backlash\nLast week cryptocurrency enthusiasts and businesses in Zimbabwe got some bad news as the central bank decided to ban all digital currency activities . The RBZ warned about the ‘risks’ involved with cryptocurrencies and told financial institutions not to deal with digital asset businesses. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe released a circular which effectively banned cryptocurrencies this month.\nThe ban would affect Localbitcoins trades within the region alongside the country’s three exchanges Golix , Bitfinance, and Styx24. News.Bitcoin.com spoke with Golix representative Tawanda Kembo last month when the exchange installed a Bitcoin ATM. Our newsdesk also received an email from the Golix exchange shortly after the ban.\n“On Friday, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe issued a statement to all banks instructing them to stop providing bank accounts to cryptocurrency companies within the next sixty days,” the Golix exchange explains.\nThis means that unless the central bank changes its position prior to the expiry of the sixty-day window, you will not be able to send or receive fiat currencies for cryptocurrency trades. According to the regional publication Zimeye.net, Golix is taking the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe to the High Courts. Golix Files a Lawsuit Against the RBZ with the High Court\nShortly after the email, the regional publication Zimeye.net reported that Golix was now planning to “slap a lawsuit” against the RBZ for issuing a countrywide cryptocurrency ban. Golix says they are taking the central bank to the High Court and state that the RBZ governor has no experience with managing a local currency giving him no right to ban it. The exchange argues that the central bank has no authority to ban digital currencies and only parliament has the means to make such laws.\n”I submit that the ban in effect outlaws and classifies as illegal Applicant’s operations,” a Golix official said to the Zimeye publication.\nThe respondents are in fact purporting to classify the trade in cryptocurrency as illegal. That will amount to law making, a function that belongs to the legislature and not the respondents. Respondents are thus clandestinely usurping Parliament’s law making powers. Golix Has Yet to Receive Instructions From Their Bank — Continues Business as Usual\nNews.Bitcoin.com reached out to Golix for further information on this lawsuit but has yet to hear back from the exchange. According to other reports, even though the RBZ has issued a ban in its circular to banking institutions concerning virtual currencies, Golix is still organizing an initial coin offering (ICO) . “Thus far we are yet to receive instructions from our bank as to what will happen, if at all anything. Once we do, we will update,” an official from the Golix exchange detailed.\nWhat do you think about the Golix exchange slapping a lawsuit against the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe?

A number of new cryptocurrencies have been developed to avoid or improve upon some of the shortcomings or challenges that have emerged with Bitcoin, as the network has become stressed with higher transaction volumes, the company stated. In different ways, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Dash all promise improved transaction potential over their predecessor, being either faster or with lower fees attached, the company stated.\n“Our cryptocurrency customers tend to be very vocal about what they want, something we appreciate very much,” said CheapAir CEO Jeff Klee. “Over the last six months, we’ve seen a huge uptick in the number of customers requesting alternative currencies, so we’ve worked hard to integrate the three that were most requested.” advertisement\nKlee acknowledged that accepting digital currency on behalf of airline and hotel suppliers who insist on being paid in fiat currency does have its challenges. However, he stated that CheapAir has already solved those challenges with Bitcoin.\n“We already had the plumbing in place to make digital currency payments work seamlessly for our customers and suppliers,” he said. “That made adding Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Dash a relatively minor endeavor for our development team, but a huge benefit for our crypto customers.”\nCheapAir added that as with any flight booking on CheapAir.com, purchases made with digital currency are protected by their unique Price Drop Payback protection, offering up to USD 100 back if airfares go down after your purchase.

There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $8,370 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair must hold the $8,240 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average to avoid more losses. Bitcoin price is trading above a major support at $8,240 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD should stay above the 100 hourly SMA to trim recent losses. Bitcoin Price Analysis After trading towards the $8,600 level, bitcoin price faced a selling interest against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair formed a short-term top at $8,596 and started a downside move. The price declined and moved below the $8,400 support level. More importantly, there was a break below the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $8,139 low to $8,596 high. It opened the doors for more losses, resulting in a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $8,350 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair almost tested the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $8,139 low to $8,596 high. However, the price is currently holding the 100 hourly simple moving average and $8,280. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at $8,400, followed by the all-important $8,600. As long as the price is above the 100 hourly SMA, it could make an attempt to surpass the $8,400 level. On the other hand, a close below the 100 hourly SMA may perhaps push the price back towards $8,150. Looking at the chart , the price is showing a few positive signs above $8,240. However, BTC buyers must clear the $8,400 hurdle for a push towards $8,600. Looking at the technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is slowly moving in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is moving higher towards the 50 level.

The U.S. agencies may define digital currency owners as a ‘security risk’ in order to protect foreign and domestic classified information.\nAlso read: BCH Miners Discuss Funding Development With a Fraction of Block Rewards If You Own Bitcoin and Have U.S. Security Clearance Then You Might Have a Problem\nAmerican bureaucrats are deliberating on whether or not they should flag cryptocurrency investors who have special security clearances to classified government information. An individual who owns a cryptocurrency like bitcoin or ethereum, may be considered “risky” in the eyes of the Pentagon. This past February the Defense Security Service (DSS) and the Pentagon revealed they were working on guidelines for reporting cryptocurrency ownership. According to another report published on May 22, the debate is currently being argued and government contractors are already upset about the backlog of other security clearance issues.\nA director for Financial Services Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University, Param Vir Singh, believes cryptocurrencies do have security risks.\n“There are a lot of good things about cryptocurrencies, but at the same time there are these security risks,” explained Param Vir Singh this week.\nThink about a knife: It could be used for good things and it can be used for bad things as well. DSS Recommends Cryptocurrency Owners With Security Clearance Should Report Their Virtual Currency Holdings\nFurther, the columnist Adam Reese recently reviewed an email by a DSS employee named Chad M. Campbell — which indicates that the security specialist recommends individuals who apply for U.S. security clearance need to report their cryptocurrency holdings on the agency’s Standard Form 86 (SF86). Additionally, the reporter received a reply from Defense Security Service Public Affairs which stated:\n“DSS has fielded a number of questions from industry as to whether ownership of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, should be reported by cleared persons or security clearance applicants,” explains the Defense Department.\nThere is no current Department of Defense guidance related to the reporting of ownership of cryptocurrencies. DSS is working with DoD policy offices for further clarification and once such guidance is issued, DSS will ensure the widest dissemination to industry. Additionally, the email [Campbell’s email] was an internal discussion document which was not intended to serve as policy guidance. University of California Researcher: ‘Bitcoin Owners Deserve Suspicion’\nIndividuals and organizations see the security clearance/cryptocurrency discussion as a controversial subject as opinions differ depending on who is discussing the matter. Steve Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists believes holding cryptocurrencies or other behaviors don’t necessarily make a person risky. “I don’t know if the government has a clear understanding of what makes a person actually a security risk — Instead they look at proxy factors like excessive debt, drug use and contact with the criminal justice system, which don’t necessarily translate to risk,” Aftergood explains.\nHowever, a researcher at the University of California, Nicholas Weaver, disagrees and thinks digital currency holders should be suspects. “Since Bitcoin’s only real use is to buy drugs, etc., it deserves suspicion,” Weaver said this week. It’s also worth noting that some of these DSS and Pentagon officials who firmly believe cryptocurrencies are a ‘security risk’ have no problem with defense contractors who shill centralized blockchains. The DSS is not calling blockchain projects sponsored by Booze Hamilton Allen or the company’s employees suspicious — Nope just bitcoin and public blockchains seem to be a threat at the moment.\nWhat do you think about the DSS and Pentagon’s discussion about bitcoin classification and raising suspicion against cryptocurrency owners?

The recent couple of days, however, saw the decline decelerate. Does this have any bullish indications for the currency at the moment. We actually do have some strong ideas on this question and on the possibility that we might have already seen a local extreme. We would like to share them in this alert along with thoughts on our already profitable hypothetical positions. It’s really hard to put a reasonable number down as far as Bitcoin’s value is concerned. This doesn’t stop people from taking a crack at it. On the Forbes website, we read : Cryptocurrency analysts Fundstrat think they have found a way of predicting the future price of Bitcoin. They used the expected path of breakeven Bitcoin mining costs to forecast that Bitcoin will reach $36,000 by the end of 2019 (…) But this method has come in for considerable criticism from the Bitcoin community. On Twitter, Samson Mow, chief strategy officer of Blockstream, claimed that Fundstrat's forecast relied on a controversial economic theory (…) The “labor theory of value” essentially says that the price of a good or service is determined by the work required to produce it. It is popular with Marxist economists, but most other schools of economics have abandoned it in favour of “subjective valuation” which says that the value of a good or service is whatever someone will pay for it, regardless of the effort that went into producing it. Mow’s argument is that subjective valuation is the right way to understand Bitcoin’s price dynamics, not the labor theory of value. Intuitively, the price of any given asset depends on the cost of production only to an extent. Usually, no one will produce anything which they can’t sell for a price above the cost of production. At the same time, if a good is sought for and people want to pay a lot for it, the price can go up considerably irrespective of the cost of production. So, we would be very careful about claims that Bitcoin will trade at historical multiples of price to mining cost. Shifts in demand and supply might shift the multiple up or down. The multiple analysis might have some long-term implications but they are a lot weaker than one might suspect after simply reading about a $36,000 price target. The one thing we think it is important to pay attention to as far as mining cost is concerned is the breakeven mining cost across countries as it might provide us with a level at which miners start to pull out of the Bitcoin market. If the price of Bitcoin falls below the breakevel level, miners might abandon their mining operations, depending on the local cost of electricity. If the number of miners leaving the market is large, the network might experience further mining concentration, which might not be great for the stability of the network. Again, this is not of immediate concern to traders but definitely something to keep in mind and check from time to time. And this is precisely why we are monitoring such developments in the market for you. Decline in Bitcoin Followed by Some Appreciation On BitStamp, we saw a relatively significant move down from $10,000, to around $8,000. This was fallowed by some appreciation in the last couple of days. Are we seeing a meaningful reversal? In short, there’s not much to support such a point of view, in our opinion. First of all, even if we take a look at only the recent rally from around $6,500 to around $10,000 (April-May) and draw the Fibonacci retracement levels on the short-term chart, we see that Bitcoin is now below the 38.2% retracement level based on the April-May rally . This means that even from the short-term perspective, we don’t see a lot of evidence of a reversal to the upside. What we’ve seen so far supports a further move to the downside as the breakdown below the 38.2% level is now verified. If we look at different Fibonacci retracements drawn based on longer time horizons, the implications do not change and we haven’t really seen any important breakout suggesting a move to the upside. To the contrary, all the short-term signs point to the downside. Have We Seen a Local Top? On the long-term Bitfinex chart, we can compare the recent move down with other moves we had seen previously. In general, the recent action is nothing spectacular. But it might be at least mildly important for the next move in the market. What we saw during the recent rally was a breakout above the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement, which could have been viewed as a resistance level . This was not a very bullish development as the level is not a particularly important one as far as strong moves up are concerned but what followed does have bearish implications. Namely, Bitcoin reversed course, move down below the 78.6% retracement and invalidated the breakout above this level. Even though the level itself is not of primary importance, the whole move adds to the bearish implications. This might mean that the recent move up is over and we might have already seen a local top at around $10,000. Mind that all the other implications based on Fibonacci retracements are bearish and actually have been bearish for some time now. Adding to that, we are below the new declining trend line based on the entire decline from around $20,000 and below the rising support level based on previous local lows. It does seem that the local top might be behind us and Bitcoin might have more room to decline, and the profits on our hypothetical positions might grow even further. Summing up, we might have already seen the local top and the decline might resume.\nIf you have enjoyed the above analysis and would like to receive free follow-ups, we encourage you to sign up for our daily newsletter – it’s free and if you don’t like it, you can unsubscribe with just 2 clicks.

But in a twist that reflects the changing mood in this part of the world, most chose to pay for their pies with bitcoin cash (BCH).Subscribe to the Bitsonline YouTube channel for more great interviews featuring industry insiders & experts What’s Bitcoin Pizza Day? If you’ve been around bitcoin for a while, you might know May 22nd is the day the community celebrates “Pizza Day”. Why? Well, back in 2010, when bitcoin had virtually zero official value in dollars, Laszlo Hanyecz posted online that he’d send 10,000 BTC to anyone who’d order him two pizzas. Someone took the offer (and the bitcoins) and sent Hanyecz two pizzas from Papa John’s.Like every other media outlet, we’re obligated to point out that purchase is worth about $82.3 million USD at current prices. However, as one of the first ever (if not the first) uses of bitcoin to pay for real-world products, it’s today regarded as the event that kick-started bitcoin as money, and proved it had value at all.Bitsonline’s Akane Yokoo scored the first pizza of the night What would’ve become of bitcoin, had that pizza order not happened? Who knows, but thank goodness it was a pizza order, because it gave the community a convenient and tasty way to celebrate every year.Hanyecz himself repeated that initial stunt in February 2018, by ordering pizza in a similar manner, this time using a Lightning Network transaction . That order also produced pizza, though this time required the extra step of funding a Lightning channel with BTC before paying.It actually tastes better when you don’t pay in fiat But… That’s Bitcoin Cash Curiously, the only Pizza Day event in Tokyo was organized by the Bitcoin Cash Meetup group. Paying in BCH wasn’t obligatory, but owner of the host venue Mike Verweyst was offering a 50 percent discount for BCH purchases. Most took him up on the offer.Verweyst said despite growing demand, there still isn’t a proper payment processor for BCH. His venue took over 50 bitcoin cash transactions tonight, all paid the old-school way — directly into a mobile wallet on the venue’s iPad. He pleaded with local processors to solve that problem ASAP:While the very existence of bitcoin cash remains controversial within the community, it’s a fact that Hanyecz’s purchase still exists on the BCH blockchain — so it has equal claim to that history. Bitcoin cash also enjoys a higher level of support in Japan and China, where there are booming blockchain industries with pockets of support for all cryptocurrencies.Notable among the crowd were those new in town, who’d moved to Japan specifically to take up blockchain-related jobs. Strict but friendly regulation has seen a proliferation of new startups in the country, leading some to wonder if Tokyo could become the regional, if not the global blockchain business capital.Is this a worthy celebration of Bitcoin Pizza Day 2018?

Bitcoin and the rest of the top five took a hit yesterday after legendary economist Robert Shiller warned on his blog that cryptocurrencies mirror some failed currency experiments of the past.\nThe Ethereum (ETH) price has tumbled 3% since this time yesterday to US$699.03 per token. This leaves Ethereum with a market capitalisation of US$69.5 billion.\nThe Ripple (XRP) price has fall 2.9% over the last 24 hours to 68 U.S. cents, giving the popular alt coin a market capitalisation of US$26.7 billion.\nThe Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price has been the worst performing major coin over the period with a 4.1% decline to US$1,243.97. This reduces its market capitalisation to US$21.3 billion.\nThe EOS (EOS) price was not far behind with a 4% decline during the last 24 hours to US$13.49. This leaves EOS with a market capitalisation of US$11.7 billion.\nOnce again, outside the top five it was a similar story with Litecoin (LTC), Cardano (ADA), Stellar (XLM), and IOTA (MIOTA) all down around 3% or more.\nOnly TRON (TRX) in the top ten was higher during the period. It climbed a sizeable 5.7% to 8.2 U.S. cents. Traders have been snapping up all the TRX they can get hold of ahead of its mainnet launch on May 31. That launch will see TRX leave the Ethereum network to go it alone on its own network.\nMissed the Bitcoin boom?

Its trading volume was not sufficient to maintain the latest bull run. BTC/USD Back Down To $8,200. The sell-off Subsides.\nAs of 12:30 PM EST, Bitcoin price is sitting at around $8,200. However, BTC/USD is currently on another upward trend that is testing a major resistance level at $8,250. A break above that could send Bitcoin price further toward the $8,300 mark it was trading at earlier today. The major support level for BTC/USD is held at $8,100.\nThe good news for investors is that last week’s bearish trend seems to have run out of steam. The low trading volume certainly indicates that the sell-off has subsided. Should further bullish trends arise later this week, a rally back to $8,500 is very likely. Source: Tradingview\nThe technicals indicate that in the short term, a Bitcoin market rally has to wait. Both the MACD and RSI are showing bearish signals, so investors will need to monitor whether the $8,100 support could hold later today.

They aim to utilise Bitcoin as a low-fee cryptocurrency which can be transferred across borders and easily exchanged for fiat currencies. Bank Moves from SWIFT to Bitcoin\nBMV said in a statement : “The service allows you to reduce costs associated with international transfers as there are no international banks as intermediaries. The logistics solution allows for a reduction in the time it takes to send or receive transfers up to a maximum of 24 hours. Bitex has a wide network of partners that enables international transfers to more than 50 countries.”\nBitcoin enables transfers to be made without using third parties and does not rely on any trusted parties. Instead, it uses a network of nodes that validate transactions and uses incentives to ensure that the network operates accurately. It also uses cryptography, such as hash functions, to ensure that only the person who holds their Bitcoin can spend it as well as providing a public ledger to ensure accountability.\nBitex is a blockchain-based financial services provider for both individuals and institutions. They help to create logistics solutions which allow for payments to be made between multiple countries. Bitex are self-regulated, but follow compliance and KYC rules. They have also hired Deloitte services to fulfil audits on the company’s operations and holding of funds.\nU.K. bank Santander has continued their move into the blockchain ecosystem by announcing their new app One Pay FX which uses Ripple technology in April. The app was launched in Spain, the U.K., Brazil, and Poland and is designed to make cross-border payments in a matter of minutes. It runs on xCurrent, a payment solution provided by Ripple Net but does not exclusively use XRP which is associated with Ripple. XRP is used by xRapid, another solution, and has been successfully trialled by Mercury FX.\nRipple have targeted banks and, specifically, cross-border payment providers and argue that XRP can save costs and deliver faster transactions than using SWIFT or Bitcoin. This move by BMV shows a preference for the number one ranked cryptocurrency by market cap instead of XRP which is aimed at being used by banks. In Q1, along with other xRapid pilots customers, we have proved that #xRapid can lower liquidity costs & increase payment speed and transparency using #XRP . We are looking forward to continued successful testing and going into production. t.co/hlYDcFyG7o\n— Mercury-fx Ltd (@mercury_fx_ltd) April 26, 2018 Should Bitcoin Be Used by Banks?\nMany token holders will welcome real-world integration as an increase in use of a coin usually leads to an increase in price. However, Bitcoin was initially set up in a libertarian environment which was hostile to banks. In fact, the Bitcoin’s genesis block contains an extract from the Times which references the 2008 financial crisis. Bitcoin is also pseudonymous which makes it harder for governments to keep track of payments and users.\nIn this partnership, we have an example of a low-fee cryptocurrency being used by a bank which is then charging 3% plus VAT for the service. This means that the bank is profiting from the low fees that Bitcoin offers. On the other hand, BMV did suggest it has passed some of the savings on to the customer. Instead of going through a bank, users could set up their own wallets and send transactions without using a bank, but novices may find this risky as mistakes can happen.

Instead of comparing bitcoin to past technological solutions, as has been done many times before, he puts it in the context of time-based and electricity-backed experimental forms of alternative money.\nPutting the technology of Bitcoin on the same level as primarily political movements, he also compared it to attempts to reshape how governments and economies operate. And while novel ideas by communist and technocratic thinkers have failed, the Euro – which was devised to help unite former warring nations – is still around. Revolutionary Zeal Is Not Enough Nobel Prize Laureate Robert J. Shiller\nAfter reviewing these past examples, Shiller explains that: “Each of these monetary innovations has been coupled with a unique technological story. But, more fundamentally, all are connected with a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society. The cryptocurrencies are a statement of faith in a new community of entrepreneurial cosmopolitans who hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.”\n“And, as in the past, the public’s fascination with cryptocurrencies is tied to a sort of mystery, like the mystery of the value of money itself, consisting in the new money’s connection to advanced science. Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work. That mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal. None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a compelling story may not be enough,” he concluded.\nWhether it’s true or not that only computer scientists understand cryptocurrencies today, it is certainly accepted that having a story is not enough by itself, which is why bitcoin entrepreneurs continue to work on exciting use cases that are only made possible with this revolutionary technology.\nWhat should the bitcoin community make of the professor’s observations?

They’re part of a study to monitor microchips embedded under the skin on the back of a person’s hand.\nIn a gesture that’s as simple as a handshake, participants can swipe or wave a hand to pay for shopping, book train tickets and access buildings. The tiny implant can effectively replace credit cards, physical keys and tickets.\n“The biggest benefit I think is convenience,” said Patrick Mesterton in an interview with the AP . Mesterton is the co-founder and CEO of Epicenter , Sweden’s startup hub for technological innovation. “It basically replaces a lot of things you have, other communication devices, whether it be credit cards or keys.”\nSigning up for cyborg tech\nMicrochipping has been around for years. British scientist Kevin Warwick received an RFID implant in 1998. He used it to activate lights and open doors. Companies such as Biohax and Dangerous Things make near-field communication (NFC) chips which can be used to store Bitcoin wallet addresses and other sensitive data; unlock their cars and start their engines; or log onto their computers easily and conveniently.\nIt may be difficult to justify having an implant surgically wedged into the flesh of your hand, between your thumb and forefinger, when the sole purpose is for easy access to the gym – when you can just keep carrying your access keycard – but cryptocurrency wallet addresses are not as easy to remember.\nMeet Martijn Wismeijer, the marketing manager at Bitcoin ATM manufacturer General Bytes who calls himself the first man to become a “human Bitcoin wallet.” In 2014, he decided to store his private Bitcoin keys in chips that he had implanted under his skin. He explains how he made his body a walking Bitcoin ATM in this mind-bending TEDx Talk.\nAnd there’s Patric Lanhed, a software developer at DigitasLBi who embedded a small NFC chip under his skin so he could transfer Bitcoin between two crypto wallets – all with his hand, no keys required.\nToday, bio-implantable Bitcoin wallets are still considered cyborg-creepy, despite social norms that have made lip implants, cheek implants, butt implants, breast implants and many different cosmetic injectables everyday procedures.\nWith 3,000+ Swedes turning the tide toward embedded chips, it may not be too long before crypto enthusiasts, mired in wallets, passwords and strings of digits, decide that the best way to keep track of their digital assets is with the flick of a wrist.

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

Mining them is 60 per cent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers. Why, then, is Canaan, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $US2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world's biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date? Canaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin. \"Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,\" said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public. The offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world's second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment. The Beijing-based company's profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($US56.7 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin's soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand. But the effects of bitcoin's volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong's central business district, where the IPO has been filed. Businesses selling mining rigs there said demand - especially for high-end machines - was limping along. Alvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit. \"Since we weren't selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,\" said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district. The change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming. Bitcoin prices have fallen 40 per cent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $US1,000 in January last year to more than $US19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $US8,400. To some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment. \"Investors are always looking for crypto 'picks and shovels', and that's what this is,\" said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm. Canaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock. However, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens. Fast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 per cent of their 2017 peak at roughly $US17 million per day. Last month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), the world's largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain. Cryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator's apparent approval. Bitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market - a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan's deal. Although the two sources were confident the IPO could raise $US2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between $US500 million and $US1 billion. A lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price.

The Most Delicious Holiday of the Year Best New – It’s Bitcoin Pizza Day! The Most Delicious Holiday of the Year Best New Cryptocurrency By root / May 22, 2018\nIf you had 10,000 BTC what would you spend it on? A mansion? The oh-so-typical ‘Lambo’? Two Papa John’s pizzas? Well eight years ago an early Bitcoiner opted for the latter and on the anniversary of the now-legendary deal, he’s absolutely no regrets! An Expensive Slice of History?\nEight years ago, on this very day, history was made. As far as we know, for the first time ever, Bitcoin was traded for something outside of the realms of software developers. Sure, the world’s most popular digital currency had previously been gifted to folks, or a coin or two swapped for lines of code on various cryptography forums, but the anniversary we celebrate today marks Bitcoin entering the real world – traded for something visible, something tangible, something delicious!\nWe are, of course, talking about Bitcoin Pizza Day. If you’re not familiar with the story, I’ll recap. Back in 2010, early cryptocurrency miner Laszlo Hanyecz signed onto a forum and made what has since become a legendary post:\n“I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas… Like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later.”\nThe post continued, stating that the hungry cryptographer wasn’t fussy about the origins of said slices – he would happily accept takeaway or homemade – the important clauses of the deal were a) the transaction had to happen in Bitcoin b) the food had to arrive at Hanyecz’s home, and c) he didn’t want to have to order or prepare the food himself.\nIt was a few days later when Jeremy Sturdivant replied to the post. He agreed to accept the deal and proceeded to place an order from his London apartment across the Atlantic Ocean to arrive at Florida-based Hanyecz’s place. That was it. Bitcoin had just successfully proven itself as the permissionless, cross-border payment method it was intended to be.\nOf course, back in 2010 the 10,000 Bitcoin were worth a fraction of what they are today. In fact, according to the irreverent Twitter account ‘Bitcoin Pizza,’ the long-devoured disks of deliciousness were bought for over $83 million. The #Bitcoin pizza is worth $83,131,600 today. (-2% from yesterday) Today is Bitcoin pizza day!\n— Bitcoin Pizza 🍕 (@bitcoin_pizza) May 22, 2018\nHanyecz isn’t phased by the vast appreciation of his payment, however. For him, mining was a hobby and he did get free pizza after all. The now 36-year-old told the U.K.’s Telegraph :\n“I don’t think it was a mistake. It’s like if you could go back in time and buy Google stocks when they were $1 or something… At the time it wasn’t worth much and I feel like if I hadn’t done it, someone else would have. I wouldn’t have spent $100m on pizza, right? But if I hadn’t done that, maybe it wouldn’t have become popular.”\nIn fact, Hanyecz enjoyed his entry into the Bitcoin history books so much that he repeated his order this year. This time, he used the Lightning Network to order his munchies – again two pizzas. He personally feels that the software upgrade is what’s missing from Bitcoin becoming a truly global payment network rather than a speculative investment that people are hoping will make them rich.\nEven though people love to make a big deal about the supposed value of the legendary Bitcoin pizzas being in the tens of millions today, it’s not like Sturdivant ended up retiring in his twenties thanks to the deal. He was able to trade the coins in for a significant (although certainly not life-changing) profit to take a trip to the U.S. with his girlfriend. Eight years on from the purchase, Sturdivant still sees the necessity of a commodity like Bitcoin though:\n“I believe the overall power of cryptocurrency is for good… empowering individuals and companies alike to handle local and international trade in a fair and traceable manner, and that’s exactly what I see it bringing to the future, as a component in an era of economic freedom.” Featured image from Shutterstock.

There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $8,370 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair must hold the $8,240 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average to avoid more losses.\nBitcoin price is trading above a major support at $8,240 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD should stay above the 100 hourly SMA to trim recent losses.\nBitcoin Price Analysis\nAfter trading towards the $8,600 level, bitcoin price faced a selling interest against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair formed a short-term top at $8,596 and started a downside move. The price declined and moved below the $8,400 support level. More importantly, there was a break below the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $8,139 low to $8,596 high.\nIt opened the doors for more losses, resulting in a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $8,350 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair almost tested the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $8,139 low to $8,596 high. However, the price is currently holding the 100 hourly simple moving average and $8,280. On the upside, an immediate resistance is at $8,400, followed by the all-important $8,600. As long as the price is above the 100 hourly SMA, it could make an attempt to surpass the $8,400 level.

According to reports filtering in on online crypto forums, the attackers seem to be using pretty much the same tactics at the last time. Hacker Used Modified Version of the Previous Attack Vector\nAccording to Bitcointalk user “ Ocminer ,” the attacker used a modified version of last month’s attack vector to spoof the blockchain. Instead of one algorithm, the hacker used two algorithms to fork the main Verge chain, claiming all the block rewards and earning millions of XVG tokens in the process. Ocminer pointed out the exploit when it was used by hackers last month.\nAs seen in the image above, both the scrypt and lyra2re algorithms were set to the same infinitesimal difficulty level. Each one was used interchangeably to manipulate transaction blocks time-stamps, enabling the hacker to essentially “manufacture” 25 blocks per minute which amount to 18,250 XVG ($950) per minute. According to Reddit user u/Flenst , the attack appears to be over. The third edit on Flenst’s post reads :\nIt seems the attack is over, 35.000.000 XVG were generated in a few hours. But this also means there is still no fix, and this is possible at any time again. Meanwhile, the only official info out there is ‘mining pools are DDoS’d’.\nAt the current XVG price , the hacker has carted away about $1.8 million. Verge Appears to Have no Answers to its 51% Hacking Problem\nWith today’s hack coming firmly on the heels on the previous hack, the question remains, “is Verge secure?” When Ocminer alerted the crypto community to last month’s hack, the Verge development initially tried to dismiss the claims. They later put up a statement on Twitter acknowledging the hack but called it a “small hash attack.” As at the time of writing this article, the only response from Verge is a tweet saying that some mining pools are under DDoS attack. it appears some mining pools are under ddos attack, and we are experiencing a delay in our blocks, we are working to resolve this.\n— vergecurrency (@vergecurrency) May 22, 2018\nThe prevailing narrative at the moment is that Verge didn’t solve the problems with its network. The fact that hackers can use essentially the same exploit protocols to initiate a 51% attack is cause for worry for many XVG enthusiasts.\nWhat are your thoughts on the vulnerability of the Verge network to 51% attack?

Previous lawsuits filed in relation to the ICO also contained allegations of securities law violations, as well as investor fraud.\nIn its motion, Bitcoin Suisse further distanced itself from Tezos, stating that the plaintiff failed to connect the two organizations in the lawsuit. As such, it claims that the court does not have jurisdiction over Bitcoin Suisse AG and therefore it should not be involved in the action.\nBitcoin Suisse also claims that MacDonald did not even specify a particular grievance against it, writing, “To assert a claim under Section 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act, a plaintiff must allege that defendant offered or sold a security in violation of 15 U.S.C. § 77e to the plaintiff.”\nHowever, it continues, “Here, Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege: that Bitcoin Suisse offered or sold a security in connection with the Tezos ICO; and that Plaintiff purchased a security from Bitcoin Suisse in connection with the Tezos ICO.”\nIn supporting this argument, Bitcoin Suisse states that it did not offer or sell securities. A hearing about the filing will likely not be held until July 19, according to the document.\nTezos completed its initial coin offering in July of last year, bringing in a record-breaking $232 million-worth (at the time) of bitcoin and ether.\nLaw image via Shutterstock\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

Canaan to Launch Biggest Bitcoin IPO Ever\nBejing based Canaan inc., the worlds second largest Bitcoin mining hardware supplier increased its overall profits seven times in 2017 during the soaring Bitcoin price craze selling its products under the AvalonMiner brand. Since those halcyon days, the profitability of mining Bitcoin has steadily declined. Today Bitcoin is worth less than half of what it was in December 2017 and mining them is 60% less profitable.\nThis begs the question, why is this Bitcoin mining rig maker launching an IPO with a $2 billion goal when the profits of and demands for its products are in little demand? According to inside sources who spoke to Reuters about the move Canaan will present itself as a chip designer which focuses on artificial intelligence and blockchain technology development instead of a Bitcoin mining company.\n“ Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company, ” Said one of the unnamed sources Reuters spoke to.\nCanaan produces what are known as ASIC chips designed for the singular purpose of mining Bitcoin. Its customers have historically been large-scale mining operations incorporating thousands of machines working twenty-four hours a day.\nIronically increasing competition since the development of ASIC mining rigs has hit the profit margins of mining outfits hard. Experts estimate that mining revenue in 2018 is just 37% of what it was in 2017. This downshift in mining profits led the worlds largest manufacturer of chips, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), to cut it’s full-year sales target, citing uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market as its reason. In a Mining Boom Sell Shovels\nThese same factors could be the reasons investors will buy into an IPO by Canaan, as the old adage goes the best way to make money in a gold rush is to sell shovels. A sentiment iterated by Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong-based blockchain and cryptocurrency investment firm who told Reuters,\n“Investors are always looking for crypto ‘picks and shovels’, and that’s what this is,”\nThough crypto mining has been under serious regulatory pressure by the Chinese government and earlier rumors of Canaan’s proposed IPO had the chip maker looking to Hong Kong or Singapore it seems they have gotten approval to go ahead in the country. Last month when China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang visited their factory and said publicly, “no matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you’re still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,”\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "best new - mining company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canaan inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canaan inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bejing", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T10:35:45.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "785f76e5e7065f4f76f4e81e1a7461fb127339d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSmCL_6f2hFu2tP1ohupIVFqIbV_.4C7c.OLMvdQoCTFmK_O5oif6VftpdFEAtzhDR1zX1j3lH56REkO4vUDd7br9Pkr4nDyrRIUW9aEQGAftmMoCq7qs9fsy_eAHUjM3U-", "site_full": "www.cryptocoincache.com", "site": "cryptocoincache.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Mining Equipment Company Canaan Plans to Raise $2B in IPO – CryptoCoin Cache", "title_full": "Bitcoin Mining Equipment Company Canaan Plans to Raise $2B in IPO – CryptoCoin Cache", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.016, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "785f76e5e7065f4f76f4e81e1a7461fb127339d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSmCL_6f2hFu2tP1ohupIVFqIbV_.4C7c.OLMvdQoCTFmK_O5oif6VftpdFEAtzhDR1zX1j3lH56REkO4vUDd7br9Pkr4nDyrRIUW9aEQGAftmMoCq7qs9fsy_eAHUjM3U-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Mining Equipment Company Canaan Plans to Raise $2B in IPO – CryptoCoin Cache", "text": "Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

What is this new technology? Why does it matter and how can we capitalize? These questions are not always answered with due diligence in the sea of headlines that deal with digital currencies.\nAs a result, many people are left with an incomplete understanding of this transformative new technology and its massive implications for the future.\nThe goal of these books is not to plumb the depths of mathematical wizardry, as much of the available information dealing with cryptocurrencies assumes a fairly advanced level of experience with cryptography, computer programming, financial markets, and mathematics in general, but rather to serve as an introduction to the broader architecture and conceptual background of cryptocurrency technology.\nWe will take a practical approach, examining how Blockchain, Bitcoin & Ethereum are used in the real world. In this trilogy guide you will learn:\nA Brief History of Blockchain TechnologyBlockchain Basics: Managing Digital TransactionsProfiting from Blockchain Technologies Limitations & Challenges of BlockchainHow can I use Bitcoin?The difference between Bitcoin & other cryptocurrenciesChoosing the Best Bitcoin WalletMaking Money & Investing With BitcoinCommon Myths, Mistakes, & Misconceptions About BitcoinThe Role of Smart ContractsThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)Consensus Algorithms: Proof-of-Work vs. Proof-of-StakeGetting Started with EthereumCriticisms, Risks, & Challenges Concerning Ethereum For Centuries, people have relied on third parties and corrupt Centralized Institutions like banks and Governments to serve as intermediaries when it comes to storing and transacting financial assets.\nThis is ALL About To Change… Make sure you take action and join the Financial Revolution.

Funds Real, No Investors Affected\nLast week, CCN reported that UPbit was raided and investigated by local police, Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KIU) and Financial Services Commission (FSC) due to suspicions of fraud. Local financial authorities accused UPbit of inflating its balance sheet and claiming to have more funds in various cryptocurrencies than their actual amount.\nOn May 15, various sources confirmed that an audit done by a major accounting firm in South Korea known as Yoojin found that the funds recorded on the balance sheet of UPbit exactly matched the actual holdings of the company and proved that the company is solvent.\n“Since early 2018, UPbit created snapshots of its multi-signature wallets and funds stored within them for auditing purposes. Yoojin accounting firm, a major accounting firm based in Seoul, confirmed that all of the funds on the UPbit platform match the cryptocurrency holdings of UPbit stored in its multi-signature wallets,” MoneyToday reported.\nSource: Shutterstock\nThe issue is said to have been caused by the lack of wallets for dozens of cryptocurrencies. UPbit has more than 130 cryptocurrencies listed on its platform but only 90 cryptocurrencies have native wallets that allow users to withdraw and deposit directly from and to UPbit. In order to withdraw the other 40 cryptocurrencies, users are required to convert to major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum.\nInsiders have claimed that the police investigation has found no irregularities and due to the official audit report released by Yoojin, the cryptocurrency market of South Korea has already started to recover.\nEarlier this week, on May 20, in an interview with Korea Herald, an insider stated that the authorities will not be able to bring any charges against UPbit because no investors were affected in any way.\n“As no investors seem to have been affected by Upbit’s alleged business practices, it would not be easy for the authorities to bring any charges to bear,” said the source , who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the issue.\nThe expert added that although the investigation has ultimately found no irregularities, it has significantly impacted the local cryptocurrency market in a negative way, leading investors to lost trust in the market.\n“But a series of prosecution probes into the exchanges did effectively hurt the overall credibility of the industry,” the insider added. Difficult to Regain Investor Trust\nOh Jeong-geun, a professor at Konkuk University, one of the most prestigious colleges in South Korea, stated that the investigation would cause investors to leave the cryptocurrency market permanently and to recover from it, both the exchanges and authorities will have to lead an initiative to convince investors that it is safe to invest in the market. Professor Oh said:\n“Along with diversification efforts, priority should be put on ensuring the smooth operation of their trading systems in order to guarantee their growth potential. Lack of reliability would cause investors to leave the market forever.”\nImages from Shutterstock\nFollow us on Telegram .\nAdvertisement ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "blockchain & cryptocurrency news difficult", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fsc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "financial services commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea financial intelligence unit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T12:11:34.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "828c64f9aa1b4fe732ed7ed30f4e33748642c6f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2j6NbG2B0Gm4aP2K0V0hZroP0J1Ix.Sr9faQiSdMvPMST_qwWsVWryRdeWAFW.WFhVJyI6zdvHvrBxaitlEBvXEw715QqvnNY1", "site_full": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Reasons Why Zilliqa Holders Can Expect a Highly Profitable 2018 - The Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Reasons Why Zilliqa Holders Can Expect a Highly Profitable 2018 - The Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Crypto.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "828c64f9aa1b4fe732ed7ed30f4e33748642c6f4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2j6NbG2B0Gm4aP2K0V0hZroP0J1Ix.Sr9faQiSdMvPMST_qwWsVWryRdeWAFW.WFhVJyI6zdvHvrBxaitlEBvXEw715QqvnNY1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Global Coin Report", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Reasons Why Zilliqa Holders Can Expect a Highly Profitable 2018 - The Bitcoin News", "text": "Reasons Why Zilliqa Holders Can Expect a Highly Profitable 2018 May 22, 2018 173\nZilliqa (Zil) is one of the most recent cryptocurrencies that made their way to the traders across the world. It was introduced on January 25 th of this year, at the time when almost the entire market was in shambles due to the plummeting in Bitcoin’s price. It is now a well-known fact that Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency that currently exists in terms of both market capitalization and price. Despite these two facts, the debacle in January 2018 made this coin susceptible to volatility and various security threats thereby creating considerable doubt in the crypto-traders’ minds. Under the circumstances, making progress as a recently introduced coin is incredibly difficult for any currency. But Zilliqa made this ostensibly impossible job possible with its sui generis features.\nZilliqa was introduced as the first through-put public blockchain in the world and started making inroads right after its tokenization preceded by a successful ICO token sale. This unique feature accompanied by several others has helped this coin grabbing attention of a significant number of traders. As a result, there hasn’t been any major downfall in this currency’s price and market cap so far and Zilliqa managed to gain a commendable position on Coinmarketcap toppling many potential big guns. Here, Zilliqa Sharding, one of the most recently implemented processes of Zilliqa would be discussed along with other major advantages to accentuate the fact why holding onto this coin would be a judicious decision this year.\nZilliqa Sharding Process\nIn DBMS, Sharding refers to a technique of partitioning various data in a database or search engine horizontally. In this way, the fragments of a single piece of data would be stored in different locations ensuring security in case of incidents like hacking. In case of blockchain technology, sharding refers to a simple yet efficient process where mining would be fragmentized into several smaller parts known as “shards”. It is a mandatory approach to increase the scalability of a blockchain protocol.\nEthereum was the first cryptocurrency to make an endeavor to implement the sharding process in blockchain in order to get rid of malicious nodes and mitigate the difficulty in constructing a consensus algorithm. However, the randomness of these mining shards causes a communication problem. The development team of Zilliqa has been able to nullify this problem by designing a system where all the shards would work simultaneously. The sharding approach was chosen by the Zilliqa team also enables them to have a copy of the current state of every single node. The advantages that Zilliqa Sharding offers include: In sharding, nodes are divided into shards. When the number of nodes increases, the number of shards also increases proportionally to accommodate new nodes within the system. As a result, the network traffic always remains free from any kind of congestion. Due to less congestion, the blockchain of this cryptocurrency offers a highly scalable and fast transaction system which not only saves the time of their traders but also saves from the unnecessary wastage of electricity and expenditure. Sharding makes this cryptocurrency more secure. As the mining is done in different fragments spread across different locations, it becomes nearly impossible for the cybercriminals to hack important data or currency tokens from this platform.\nNotable Partnerships:\nZilliqa has engaged in several partnerships this year in order to increase their token circulation and popularity to the crypto-traders. During last month of this year, Zilliqa partnered with two other major cryptocurrencies – Bluezelle and Genaro Network. Both of these currencies offer their support to Zilliqa as a distributed backend storage provider. As a result, DApp developers now can choose a storage provider of their own preference, with the API (Application Program Interface) support from Genaro Network and Bluezelle.\nMajor Events:\nThe development team of this cryptocurrency has been extremely busy throughout this month as they have already attended several cryptocurrency meet-ups such as the World Digital Asset Summit in Singapore, Bloxpo meet-up in Stockholm, Sweden, and many more. They are also about to attend a major cryptocurrency meet-up in Singapore on 23 rd May. With these events, more traders would come across this ingenious currency and its features eventually increasing its popularity.\nCurrent State of Zilliqa:\nAs of 21 st May 2018, Zilliqa holds the 25 th position on Coinmarketcap with a price nearly equivalent to $0.15 and a market capitalization of nearly 1 billion USD. The currency continues its bullish run as both the price and market cap charts are showing a steady upward trend.\nFinal Thoughts:\nZilliqa possesses one of the most efficient development teams in the crypto-world and is constantly making new ameliorations for their holders. According to their latest progress report, they have improved their testnet deployment system along with making major changes to their main protocol. This coin has been able to get a position among the top thirty currencies within a few months. Hence judging by this trend it can be inferred that Zilliqa holders can be hopeful about a very profitable 2018.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Service Highlights ‘No Intermediaries’\nThe initiative, which Banco Masventas (BMV) launched May 22nd, is the result of a partnership with local blockchain financial services startup Bitex.\nOnce payments begin being sent, BMV will likely become the world’s first banking institution to actively leverage Bitcoin as an international payments standard.\nThe move is a conspicuous move away from extant options such as the SWIFT clearing network, which has seen multiple failures and security problems in recent years.\n“The service allows you to reduce costs associated with international transfers as there are no international banks as intermediaries,” a dedicated information page on the bank’s website states.\nThe service will initially roll out to 50 countries, with payment timeframes reduced to 24 hours. Outpacing the Rest\nIf it proves to be successful, Argentina would significantly outstep progress with cryptocurrencies by its neighbors, while the country’s domestic banking sector has been preparing for closer integration for some time.\nIn April, an event dubbed ‘ Bitcoin Day ’ in the capital, Buenos Aires, saw participants approve the supportive environment around Bitcoin, contrasting it with the prohibitive stance taken by authorities in countries such as Chile .\nChanges in legislation have also resulted in operators pledging to install thousands of Bitcoin ATMs throughout Argentina this year.\nEarlier this month meanwhile, Brazil’s largest asset management company moved to launch an over-the-counter cryptocurrency trading platform, highlighting a wish to target institutional investor money.\nBlockchain-based payments are also gaining traction with banks, with Santander becoming the first to launch the facility for customers in several jurisdictions, including Brazil, in April via a partnership with Ripple.\n“Transfers to Europe can be made on the same day and we are aiming to deliver instant transfers across several markets by the summer,” the bank said in a statement .\nWhat do you think about Banco Masventas’ Bitcoin payments?

Bitcoin Cash outperformed other leading digital currencies, the latter of which have taken it on the chin in recent weeks.\nThe Bitcoin Cash price advanced 6% over the last month compared to declines of 5%, 9% and 11% for bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple, respectively. Kelly on CNBC made the case for Bitcoin Cash.\nKelly, the founder of investment firm BKCM, believes that Bitcoin Cash has more room to run, and he’s outlined the catalysts for the bullish outlook. “Proposed development fund” “Could give cryptocurrency more use cases” “Highlights centralization of miners”\nTo take each of the catalysts in more detail, miners of Bitcoin Cash in recent days announced a new development fund that will be comprised of a percentage of the bounty they receive from creating new coins. The funds in the new portfolio will be directed toward the development of new technology “on top of Bitcoin Cash,” Kelly explained, adding that it’s akin to an App Store for the blockchain.\n“That potentially could give value to Bitcoin Cash,” said Kelly, adding that it’s not the only blockchain project doing something like this.\nThe development fund leads to the second catalyst, which involves developers using the new blockchain technology to create more use cases for bitcoin cash. “To the extent that usefulness translates into value, that could be a positive for Bitcoin Cash,” he said.\nNext, the development fund reflects “centralization of the miners,” which Kelly admits bucks the trend for cryptocurrencies. Ultimately, this could prove to be a negative but for now, the mission behind the development fund appears to be a good one.\nAs for the market, Kelly points to an uptrend in BCH that’s strengthened by the fact that it has been able to hold support. The technicals for BCH coupled with the catalysts he outlined led to his bullish call: “For me, that’s a place that I want to buy,” he said. Source: CNBC\nNot So Fast?\nCNBC’s Fast Money took some tweets from viewers, one of which asked Kelly if he was actually early bitcoin backer Roger Ver. Ver, who is also known as “Bitcoin Jesus”, is a proponent of Bitcoin Cash over bitcoin core.\nCNBC said they get a number of tweets basically accusing the business network of performing pump-and-dump schemes. One such accusation come from a Twitter user by Samson Mow, who Mow said Kelly has since blocked – Collecting some gems for @SEC_Enforcement @SEC_News to take a closer look at @CNBCFastMoney @CNBC pumping and dumping altcoins on their viewers. Enough is enough. If you have more tweets, post below and I’ll add them to the Moment. ⚖️ https://t.co/i42MeDK91P\n— Samson Mow (@Excellion) May 22, 2018\nMeanwhile, CNBC host Melissa Lee responded on the air broadly to any accusations, saying: “That is absolutely not the case.

The recent couple of days, however, saw the decline decelerate. Does this have any bullish indications for the currency at the moment. We actually do have some strong ideas on this question and on the possibility that we might have already seen a local extreme. We would like to share them in this alert along with thoughts on our already profitable hypothetical positions. It’s really hard to put a reasonable number down as far as Bitcoin’s value is concerned. This doesn’t stop people from taking a crack at it. On the Forbes website, we read:\nCryptocurrency analysts Fundstrat think they have found a way of predicting the future price of Bitcoin. They used the expected path of breakeven Bitcoin mining costs to forecast that Bitcoin will reach $36,000 by the end of 2019 (…)\nBut this method has come in for considerable criticism from the Bitcoin community. On Twitter, Samson Mow, chief strategy officer of Blockstream, claimed that Fundstrat's forecast relied on a controversial economic theory (…)\nThe “labor theory of value” essentially says that the price of a good or service is determined by the work required to produce it. It is popular with Marxist economists, but most other schools of economics have abandoned it in favour of “subjective valuation” which says that the value of a good or service is whatever someone will pay for it, regardless of the effort that went into producing it. Mow’s argument is that subjective valuation is the right way to understand Bitcoin’s price dynamics, not the labor theory of value.\nIntuitively, the price of any given asset depends on the cost of production only to an extent. Usually, no one will produce anything which they can’t sell for a price above the cost of production. At the same time, if a good is sought for and people want to pay a lot for it, the price can go up considerably irrespective of the cost of production.\nSo, we would be very careful about claims that Bitcoin will trade at historical multiples of price to mining cost. Shifts in demand and supply might shift the multiple up or down. The multiple analysis might have some long-term implications but they are a lot weaker than one might suspect after simply reading about a $36,000 price target.\nThe one thing we think it is important to pay attention to as far as mining cost is concerned is the breakeven mining cost across countries as it might provide us with a level at which miners start to pull out of the Bitcoin market. If the price of Bitcoin falls below the breakevel level, miners might abandon their mining operations, depending on the local cost of electricity. If the number of miners leaving the market is large, the network might experience further mining concentration, which might not be great for the stability of the network. Again, this is not of immediate concern to traders but definitely something to keep in mind and check from time to time. And this is precisely why we are monitoring such developments in the market for you. Decline in Bitcoin Followed by Some Appreciation\nOn BitStamp, we saw a relatively significant move down from $10,000, to around $8,000. This was fallowed by some appreciation in the last couple of days. Are we seeing a meaningful reversal?\nIn short, there’s not much to support such a point of view , in our opinion. First of all, even if we take a look at only the recent rally from around $6,500 to around $10,000 (April-May) and draw the Fibonacci retracement levels on the short-term chart, we see that Bitcoin is now below the 38.2% retracement level based on the April-May rally. This means that even from the short-term perspective, we don’t see a lot of evidence of a reversal to the upside. What we’ve seen so far supports a further move to the downside as the breakdown below the 38.2% level is now verified.\nIf we look at different Fibonacci retracements drawn based on longer time horizons, the implications do not change and we haven’t really seen any important breakout suggesting a move to the upside. To the contrary, all the short-term signs point to the downside. Have We Seen a Local Top?\nOn the long-term Bitfinex chart, we can compare the recent move down with other moves we had seen previously. In general, the recent action is nothing spectacular. But it might be at least mildly important for the next move in the market. What we saw during the recent rally was a breakout above the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement, which could have been viewed as a resistance level. This was not a very bullish development as the level is not a particularly important one as far as strong moves up are concerned but what followed does have bearish implications.\nNamely, Bitcoin reversed course, move down below the 78.6% retracement and invalidated the breakout above this level. Even though the level itself is not of primary importance, the whole move adds to the bearish implications. This might mean that the recent move up is over and we might have already seen a local top at around $10,000 .\nMind that all the other implications based on Fibonacci retracements are bearish and actually have been bearish for some time now. Adding to that, we are below the new declining trend line based on the entire decline from around $20,000 and below the rising support level based on previous local lows. It does seem that the local top might be behind us and Bitcoin might have more room to decline , and the profits on our hypothetical positions might grow even further.

The purchase is believed to have been the first time that bitcoin was used in a real-world transaction. Today, those coins are worth nearly $82 million. Source: BitcoinTalk\n“It wasn’t like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,” Hanyecz famously said in a 2013 interview with The New York Times. “No one knew it was going to get so big.”\nHanyecz later christened the nascent Lightning Network (LN) with a similar purchase , though it cost him just 0.00649 BTC (~$53) this time around.\nIf you’re lucky, you can commemorate Bitcoin Pizza Day at a restaurant that accepts bitcoin directly ( CoinMap curates a non-exhaustive list). Don’t worry, the going rate is no longer 10,000 BTC.\n— Miss Sheree (@missdiorsheree) May 22, 2018\nIf not, you can use your BTC to purchase a gift card to your favorite pizza restaurant. Gyft and eGifter are two popular gift card providers that accept bitcoin — and the latter is currently running a sale on Dominos gift cards.\nIt was still a bit early for pizza in the Western Hemisphere at the time of writing, but cryptocurrency users on the other half of the globe have already shared pictures of their celebratory slices across social media.\nCryptocurrency trading platform and brokerage firm eToro sent a “literal bitcoin pizza” to the offices of financial publication Business Insider UK.

The bitcoin community has exploded in size — and experienced contentious debates about the future of the protocol, not to mention the wider ecosystem. But while arguments over blocksize, ASIC mining, and initial coin offerings may frequently divide us, Bitcoin Pizza Day provides us with an opportunity to focus on what unites us — a passion for cryptocurrency and a love of good pizza.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laszlo hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcointalk", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lightning network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T18:34:35.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f4ca09130672c0ccf2cc467d2ba06eccd0563730", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8wYV38WFZNaX.kcnM5GIiPaoDdEPCjn2jdtppk6MVbnn40KgXDVshfJU0zpA5_Rf8MSW7p02ExMqi_sNEj9Eg96ivIAavQw9Yhni8TLDz_3VNA7asTBbc3CZzMv3w4Ip1L.Z8TOmRt.g--", "site_full": "www.isbitcoinsafe.info", "site": "isbitcoinsafe.info", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Moon Missions and Custom Wallets: Bitcoin Community Celebrates Pizza Day -", "title_full": "Moon Missions and Custom Wallets: Bitcoin Community Celebrates Pizza Day -", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.isbitcoinsafe.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bitcoin-pizza-day-768x768.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f4ca09130672c0ccf2cc467d2ba06eccd0563730", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8wYV38WFZNaX.kcnM5GIiPaoDdEPCjn2jdtppk6MVbnn40KgXDVshfJU0zpA5_Rf8MSW7p02ExMqi_sNEj9Eg96ivIAavQw9Yhni8TLDz_3VNA7asTBbc3CZzMv3w4Ip1L.Z8TOmRt.g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Author Admin", "published": "2018-05-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Moon Missions and Custom Wallets: Bitcoin Community Celebrates Pizza Day -", "text": "Moon Missions and Custom Wallets: Bitcoin Community Celebrates Pizza Day Posted on May 22, 2018 Author admin Comments Off on Moon Missions and Custom Wallets: Bitcoin Community Celebrates Pizza Day\nOn May 22, the bitcoin community celebrated the second most important date in its calendar. No other date, save for January 3, 2009 when Satoshi mined the genesis block, is more symbolic. It was on May 22, 2010 that Laszlo Hanyecz purchased two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. Eight years on, the occasion has become part of bitcoin’s mythology.\nAlso read: Ross Ulbricht Continues to Fight for Freedom With Supreme Court Petition Remembering the $83 Million Pizza\nOn May 18 2009, Laszlo posted a thread on the Bitcointalk forum entitled “Pizza for bitcoins?” In it, he explained: “I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I’m aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don’t have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a ‘breakfast platter’ at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you’re happy!”\nLaszlo then went on to list his favorite toppings, before specifying “just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that”. Within days he had a buyer and the deal went through on May 22. The event is symbolic, not so much for the value of those 10,000 BTC today, but because it marked one of the first public instances of bitcoin being used as a means of payment. The pizza thread, like the value of BTC, has since grown and grown, and today runs to 73 pages, having been viewed around 750,000 times. Pizza Wallets and Pizza Moon Missions\nEvery year on May 22 the bitcoin community now competes to despatch the best pizza tweets and branded products, all tied to that then-minor but now massive day in 2010 when bitcoin proved its worth. It hasn’t stopped proving it ever since. To mark the occasion today, Bitstamp has calculated how far $83m of pizzas would stretch, using the following formula:\n10,000 BTC * 8,400 USD (1 BTC) = 84 million USD 84 million USD / 15 USD (1 pizza price) = 5.6 million pizzas 5.6 million pizzas * 14 inches (diameter of a large pizza) = 1237 miles 1237 miles / 248 miles (average altitude of the ISS) = 4.9 PIZZA TO THE MOON: In 2010, a Florida man bought two large pizzas for 10.000 #Bitcoin . Today, this could buy you enough pizzas to get to the International Space Station five times. #whenmoon Happy #BitcoinPizzaDay ! #BTC #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/OuPeXC93CM\n— Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) May 22, 2018\nHardware wallet manufacturer Ledger has gone one better, creating a limited edition Pizza Day Nano S. Just 1,337 of the units will be issued, each coming in a special Laszlo’s Pizza box complete with a sachet of red chilli pepper oil, for those who like to spice up their cold storage.\nAs for the man who made this infamous anniversary come about, history records that Laszlo sold most of his bitcoins at around $1 apiece but, having contributed to its early source code, and done his bit to ensure real world adoption, he regrets nothing. In the crypto community, Laszlo Hanyecz’s actions will always be the ultimate “Florida man” story, destined to be commemorated faithfully every May 22 forevermore.\nWould you buy a limited edition Pizza Day wallet?

Mavani was running a ponzi-like scheme in cryptocurrency in Surat.\nThe latest twist in the probe comes on the heels of the CID-Crime arresting a bunch of policemen, including a Superintendent of Police, and looking for former BJP MLA Nalin Kotadiya for allegedly abducting and extorting Bitcoins from Bhatt. According to the CID-Crime, days before he was allegedly abducted by some policemen from Amreli Local Crime Branch unit in mid February and forced to shell out Bitcoins worth Rs 10 crore in a conspiracy hatched by his close aide, Kirit Paladiya, Bhatt had allegedly abducted two associates of a firm “Bit Connect” and extorted Bitcoins and cash worth over Rs 155 crore from them.\nThe CID-Crime said it all started after one Satish Kumbani’s firm Bit Connect, a ponzi scheme offering lucrative interest in short span, was closed in January this year. CID officials said that many people, including those living outside India, had invested in the firm. Shailesh Bhatt is also said to have invested about Rs 2 crore in the scheme. After the firm was shut in January and its promoters went underground, Bhatt and others started to look for them to recover their money.\nAshish Bhatia, DGP (CID-Crime) said that Bhatt’s men first kidnapped Piyush Savalia, who used to work for Bit Connect, by posing as Income Tax inspectors. “Savalia was held captive in a farmhouse in Surat for three days in January-end… Savalia gave the name of Dhaval Mavani, who was also associated with the firm, to his captors… On February 1, Mavani was abducted and at gunpoint, he was forced to transfer 2,256 Bitcoins worth over Rs 131 crore into their digital wallet. Bhatt and his accomplices also transferred another 166 Bitcoins worth Rs 9.64 crore into their account,” said Bhatia.\n“Besides Bitcoins, Bhatt and his accomplices extorted Rs 14.50 crore cash, which the builder received through a courier firm. In all, Bhatt and his associates extorted Bitcoins and cash worth Rs 155.21 crore and distributed it among themselves. Bhatt had kept around 700 Bitcoins with him,” Bhatia said, adding that the entire episode became clear after Savalia was questioned. He is reported to have told the investigators that he was paid Rs 34.50 lakh to remain silent. Mavani, on the other hand, is said to have left the country even before a team of policemen from Amreli had flown to Mumbai to nab him.\nFollowing the lodging of fresh FIR against Bhatt and eight of his accomplices in Surat, the CID has arrested his nephew, Nikunj Bhatt, and one Dilip Kanani. Seven other accused, including Bhatt, are absconding. Bhatia said that Shailesh Bhatt had engaged his nephew, who is tech-savvy, to transfer the Bitcoins. Police have also recovered 152 Bitcoins worth about Rs 8.58 crore, from Kanani’s digital wallet.

Mining them is 60 percent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers. Why, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion (£1.49 billion), according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world's biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date?\nCanaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focussed on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.\n“Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public.\nThe offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world's second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment.\nThe Beijing-based company's profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan (£42.1 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin's soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand.\nBut the effects of bitcoin's volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong's central business district, where the IPO has been filed.\nBusinesses selling mining rigs there said demand - especially for high-end machines - was limping along.\nAlvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit.\n\"Since we weren't selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,\" said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district.\nThe change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming.\nBitcoin prices have fallen 40 percent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400.\nPROMISED LAND\nTo some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment.\n\"Investors are always looking for crypto 'picks and shovels', and that's what this is,\" said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm.\nCanaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock.\nHowever, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens.\nFast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 percent of their 2017 peak at roughly $17 million per day.\nLast month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), the world's largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain.\nCryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China.

PHOTO: REUTERS\n[HONG KONG] Bitcoins are worth less than half of what they were in December. Mining them is 60 per cent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers.\nWhy, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to US$2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world's biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date?\nCanaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.\n“Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public. sentifi.com Market voices on:\nThe offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world's second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment. SEE ALSO: Bitcoin a shadowy new realm as US weighs security clearances\nThe Beijing-based company's profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan (S$75.7 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin's soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand.\nBut the effects of bitcoin's volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong's central business district, where the IPO has been filed.\nBusinesses selling mining rigs there said demand - especially for high-end machines - was limping along.\nAlvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit. \"Since we weren't selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,\" said Mr Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district.\nThe change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming.\nBitcoin prices have fallen 40 per cent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from US$1,000 in January last year to more than US$19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about US$8,400.\nTo some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment.\n\"Investors are always looking for crypto 'picks and shovels', and that's what this is,\" said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm.\nCanaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock.\nHowever, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens.\nFast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 per cent of their 2017 peak at roughly US$17 million per day.\nLast month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), the world's largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain.\nCryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator's apparent approval.\nVisiting its factory, he said: “no matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you’re still a chip company, and I hope you list in China\", according to mainland media reports.\nBitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market - a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan's deal.\nAlthough the two sources were confident the IPO could raise US$2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between US$500 million and US$1 billion.\nA lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price.

However, not all free market advocates believe that bitcoin should have a valid place in the economy. What are “Free Markets?”\nIn economics, the term “free markets” refers to an economic system where prices for goods and services are determined purely by market forces – driven by consumers and the open market – without any government interference on pricing or market structure.\nA free market economy is based on a spontaneous order of arrangements where individuals decide to engage in voluntary economic activity without the control of central governing authorities. This creates unobstructed competition, which – in theory – should allow for fair pricing and the most possible wealth for the highest amount of people within this economy. Who Said What About Bitcoin?\nWhile bitcoin – and cryptocurrency in general – fit into the free market spirit, opinions about its validity as money differ among leading figures in the libertarian and anarcho-capitalist realm. Ron Paul\nRon Paul is an author and former politician who has established himself as the most influential libertarian thought leader in the U.S. after having run for the U.S. Presidency three times during his active political careers. He is an advocate for the Austrian school of economics and a Senior Fellow of the Mises Institute and has been very outspoken about why the Federal Reserve should be abolished, most notably in his book End the Fed . ( Source : Wikipedia )\nRon Paul has also publicly stated his view on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies on several occasions.\nIn 2013, he told CNN : “There will be alternatives to the dollar, and [bitcoin] might be one of them.” If bitcoin mass adoption will take place, “it’ll go down in history as the destroyer of the dollar,” he added.\nIn November 2017, Paul even starred in an advert for CoinIRA, where he stated: “As a firm believer in currency competition, I’m excited to see the options that bitcoin opens up.”\nHaving said that, Ron Paul remains skeptical about bitcoin functioning as currency effectively as he believes that money has historically always been something tangible. In January 2018, he explained that individuals should have the right to choose what currency they want to use but said that it ought to be something tangible.\nHe also considers the current valuations of cryptocurrencies to be in bubble territory. In December 2017, he told CNBC cryptocurrencies are a reflection of the disaster of the money dollar systems and that the high price of bitcoin has been partly caused by loose monetary policy, in the same way as other asset bubbles have in the recent past. Doug Casey\nDoug Casey is an anarcho-capitalist writer, an investor, and CEO of investment research firm Casey Research . While Casey was originally skeptical about decentralized digital currencies, he has since changed his mind and has become a firm believer in the value of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\nIn a blog post titled “ How I Learned to Love Bitcoin ,” Casey stated:\n“My original objection was that Bitcoin isn’t backed by anything. It’s really a private fiat currency. It’s very much like the Zambian Kwacha, the Argentine peso, the US dollar, or any of the other 150-plus currencies in today’s world. It’s a floating abstraction. Unlike state currencies, though, its acceptance isn’t enforced by laws.” Casey, therefore, believes that “Bitcoin is well on the way to being accepted as money. I think it will succeed.”\nWhile he considers bitcoin as another form of fiat currency, he is not sure if it will stand the test of time.\n“Bitcoin passes the medium of exchange test for the moment and store of value test for the moment. So you can definitely say it’s money—for the moment. I have little confidence, however, Bitcoin will be here, say, five years from now. Buying cryptos is not like socking away gold coins,” Casey added. Robert Murphy\nRobert Murphy is an anarcho-capitalist writer and scholar at the Mises Institute. In 2015, he co-authored the book Understanding Bitcoin: The Liberty Lover’s Guide to the Mechanics & Economics of Crypto-Currencies and has been a supporter of bitcoin.\nIn an article for the Library of Economics and Liberty , Murphy wrote: “Bitcoin is an ingenious peer-to-peer ‘virtual’ or ‘digital currency’ that challenges the way economists have traditionally thought about money. Its inbuilt scarcity provides an assurance of purchasing power arguably safer than any other system yet conceived.” He added:\n“Critics argue that because of its lack of commodity backing, Bitcoin is doomed to eventual failure. Yet the popular versions of these arguments either would apply just as well to gold or have already been proven wrong by the use of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange among a small (but growing) group of users.” ( Source : Wikipedia )\nHaving said that, like many of his “Austrian” peers, he also prefers gold over bitcoin.\n“I still think that gold remains the preeminent money for humans at this stage of the globe’s economic development. If governments around the world got out of the way, humanity would (I predict) once again embrace gold, not Bitcoin, as the true free-market money. But this is just a personal judgment call. We need to let the decentralized market test tell us what is the best money, or monies,” Murphy concluded. Konrad Graf\nKonrad Graf is a writer and an economist who has written extensively on the topic of bitcoin monetary policy . He considers bitcoin to be one of the greatest inventions of our time and has shared his thoughts on the digital currency in essays such as “ On the Origins of Bitcoin: Stages of Monetary Evolution ,” and the “ Bitcoin Decrypted Series ,” as well as in his book Are Bitcoins Ownable? Property Rights, IP Wrongs, and Legal Theory Implications . ( Source : Konradsgraf.com )\nIn “On the Origins of Bitcoin,” Graf wrote: “Bitcoin was offered up as an invention/discovery of a new way to do something very old—transfer the control of purchasing power from one party to another. This method was offered for free to the entire human population. [Each] person remains entirely free to either ignore it or use it in some way, and only to the exact extent of each person’s willing participation.”\n“Bitcoin is superior to any known alternative medium of exchange on just about every meaningfully relevant characteristic,” he added. Jeffrey Tucker\nJeffrey Tucker is an Austrian school economist, author, and an anarcho-capitalist. He is the editorial director of the American Institute for Economic Research ( AIER ) and the CEO of the Atlanta Bitcoin Embassy .\nTucker has been a vocal supporter of bitcoin for several years and has spoken about the benefits of the virtual currency at numerous conferences. He is also the founder of the CryptoCurrency Conference and authored the book Bit by Bit in 2015. ( Source : Wikipedia )\nIn a 2017 Op-Ed for Bitcoin Magazine , Tucker wrote : “There are dramatic challenges to the status quo that are being offered up by the advent of cryptocurrency. [The] new world will be financially sound, stable, radically disintermediated, decentralized and democratized because anyone, of any financial means and access to financial institutions, can participate within it.”\n“We’ve only begun to think about what a radical change it would be if our money actually gained value over time (as crypto has for nine years, and the dollar did in the late 19th century), so that you actually grow more wealthy merely by not spending. Such a change would be huge, not only for finance but also for the culture at large,” he added. Advertisement advertisement Kevin Dowd\nKevin Dowd is a professor of finance and economics at Durham University, England. He is a long-standing free market economist with interests in private money, financial and macroeconomics and political economy. He has also co-authored the book Alchemists of Loss: How Modern Finance and Government Intervention Crashed the Financial System . ( Source : Wikipedia )\nIn 2014, Dowd published a paper for the Institute of Economic Affairs in which he argued that governments should not stifle currency competition and provide a level playing field for private money such as bitcoin so that citizens have the ability to choose which currency they want to use.\nHe told The Guardian : “Let’s suppose that bitcoin became a very prominent currency. [To ensure a level playing field], the government itself would accept bitcoin in tax payments. So, in effect, the government should not be favoring its own currency, or any particular currency, through any of its unique powers. Nor have regulations against them. Bryan Caplan ( Source : bcaplan.com )\nIn a Reddit AMA in 2014, Caplan was asked what his thoughts on bitcoin’s validity as money. His response was:\n“It’s done 10x better than I expected, but I still don’t expect it to be more than a niche financial instrument. It’s long been noted that people around the world continue using their national currencies even in the face of 20 or 30 [percent] inflation because national currencies are more convenient and focal. Also, I expect regulators to crack down if Bitcoin becomes much of a threat. But hopefully I’m wrong!” Peter Schiff\nPeter Schiff is an economist, a financial commentator, and CEO of stock brokerage Euro Pacific Capital . He is also one of the most outspoken bitcoin critics among libertarian thought leaders.\nSchiff believes that bitcoin is not the money of the future because money needs to be a commodity. He has defended this view in heated discussions with bitcoin advocates such as CNBC Fast Money’s Brian Kelly and Coin Center’s Peter Van Valkenburgh . ( Source : Wikipedia )\nSchiff also believes that bitcoin is the biggest bubble he has ever seen. “[Bitcoin] a speculative asset at best, but anybody who buys it runs the risk that the price could collapse any day. Sure, it could keep going up, but eventually it’s going to implode, so you really can’t say it’s a safe haven. It’s a highly speculative asset. The underlying concept is not entirely meritless, though. I think bitcoin was born as a solution to a real problem but I think unfortunately this is not the solution,” he told Benzinga . Walter Block\nWalter Block is another Austrian school economist and an advocate of anarcho-capitalism. He is a Senior Fellow of Mises Institute and is well-known for his book Defending the Undefendable , which he published it 1976. ( Source : Wikipedia )\nBlock is not a fan of bitcoin. In 2011, he said : ”I’m not sure I fully understand [bitcoin]. But, I favor money based on real commodities (gold, silver, whatever the market settles upon), and, I gather, bitcoins do not qualify. So, I oppose bitcoins. I favor 100 [percent] backed (by a commodity) currency for reasons that Rothbard and Mises have written about, over and over again.” Gary North\nGary North is an economic historian, an author, and another Austrian economist who has little love for bitcoin.\nIn an article titled “Is Bitcoin a Ponzi Scheme” that North wrote for LewRockwell.com , he states: “I hereby make a prediction: Bitcoins will go down in history as the most spectacular private Ponzi scheme in history. It will dwarf anything dreamed of by Bernard Madoff.” ( Source : Wikipedia )\n“Bitcoins cannot possibly fulfill their supposed purpose: to serve as an unregulated currency unit. Bitcoins are not an alternative currency. They are something you buy in the midst of a mania, and you will sell at some point in order to get back your money. You are thinking of buying Bitcoins, not because Bitcoins will serve as a means of exchange, as originally argued, but because you want to get back lots more money than you paid for them,” North concluded. Hans-Hermann Hoppe\nHans-Hermann Hoppe is an Austrian school economist and an anarcho-capitalist philosopher. He is also a Senior Fellow at the Mises Institute and the founder of the Property and Freedom Society .\nIn 2013, Hoppe was asked by Stephan Kinsella what he thought of bitcoin. He told Kinsella that he does not consider bitcoin to be money. ( Source : Wikipedia )\nHowever, Hoppe is strongly in favor of the decentralization that blockchain technology brings. In an interview with Polish media outlet Najwy?szy Czas! , he said: “Don’t put your trust in democracy, but neither should you trust in a dictatorship. Rather, put your hope into radical political decentralization.” Why Aren’t All Free Markets Proponents in Love with Bitcoin?\nIn may come as somewhat of a surprise that a fair share of free-market advocates are not supportive of bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general, despite the fact that it ticks so many free-market boxes.\nBitcoin acts both as a digital currency and as a store of value that cannot be censored, easily confiscated or directly influenced by a government or central banks. Its price is based purely on supply and demand market forces and anyone in the world with an Internet connection has the ability to partake in the Bitcoin network and transact in the digital currency.\nWhile governments can and, in some cases, have attempted to ban bitcoin, it is de facto impossible to do so due to the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network, which spans thousands of nodes across the globe. Hence, even if a government did manage to shut down all nodes and miners in its jurisdiction, the Bitcoin network would continue to function via the continual operation of nodes based outside the country.\nThe most common criticism of bitcoin found among libertarian thought leaders is that it is not backed by “real” commodities, such as gold and silver, and, thus, has no “real” value. Many free-market advocates are also believers in the gold standard, which is a monetary system where a currency is backed by gold reserves, and consider non-commodity backed mediums of exchange to be inferior.\nThis argument, however, can easily be refuted as bitcoin is backed by something “real.” Bitcoin is backed by hashing power which is provided by one of the largest networks of computers in the world.\nWhile bitcoin may be a bit more challenging to comprehend and conceptualize for some, it carries all the essential traits that free market economics, libertarians, and anarcho-capitalists look for as an alternative to fiat currency.\nAs the bitcoin ecosystem grows and its value as a spending currency (should the Lightning Network and other scaling solutions succeed) and as a digital gold-like store of value becomes increasingly more evident, it would not be a surprise for the list of bitcoin-skeptical free-market advocates to shorten significantly.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T17:54:56.017+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32209, "moreResultsAvailable": 13409, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=18800", "requestsLeft": 474}
