It could run more than 6 million average U.S. homes, or all of New York City for more than a year. Continue Reading\nBitcoin's vast power appetite is thanks to mining, where computers crunch complex math problems for a reward of more bitcoins. As more miners try to solve the problems, the difficulty of the computations — and therefore the amount of power required — increases.\nAnd this great financial experiment isn't all powered with renewable energy. It's responsible for more than 30 megatons of annual carbon emissions right now — equivalent to more than 7 million cars on the road, or about 1 million transatlantic flights.\nThe good news for the environment is that bitcoin is a scarce resource, and its algorithm rewards fewer coins as time goes on. By 2140, there'll be no rewards left and no reason to run power-hungry mining computers. Related Story Bitcoin Took A Wild, Volatile Ride In 2017\nIt's hard to say whether bitcoin will soak up energy until then or if it will start to taper off. It's expensive to run mining operations, but as long as the price of bitcoin is high enough, people will keep mining.\nIf it stays profitable, researchers say bitcoin could eventually be responsible for 5 percent of global energy usage — which could run every data center in the U.S. right now.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.nyiso.com/public/webdocs/media_room/publications_presentations/Power_Trends/Power_Trends/2017_Power_Trends.pdf", "http://www.ren21.net/status-of-renewables/global-status-report/", "https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/bitcoins-insane-energy-consumption-explained/", "https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-05/cp-bet051018.php", "https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "evan thomas may", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "continue reading bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "power ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T18:26:59.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "945a55a4d1947f4697e680e8824b2f873b42abbf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS0afqHggYJrnNST2x7KawogrVTIlEf3CSZ_0aRgVA2ke6.i_8RAarulkA6k7zahIdfZKJh5SbdAAvcBjK0owEgDAoJQIfeSXyTMbdxNu1VMu_X5exVUTOen.hoamDG1EsVDJKPIESCWDKcBKZBozM0pejnCaQkicZV_0uX_NzxXA--", "site_full": "networknewswirefull.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://networknewswirefull.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Virtual Crypto Technologies Inc.

(VRCP) Speeds Up Bitcoin eCommerce Transactions", "text": "Cryptocurrencies gain in acceptance, but… High transaction fees and lengthy processing times delay implementation Bit4Sure cuts bitcoin transaction times Now that some marquee names – Microsoft, Expedia, Overstock – have begun accepting bitcoin, it looks as if cryptocurrencies have entered the mainstream of commerce. Notice from Japanese retailer Rakuten appears to confirm that. The ecommerce giant, which has been called Japan’s Amazon, has announced plans to launch its own “Rakuten Coin” in the near future ( http://nnw.fm/PFm8e ). Not so fast, however. Ironically, Satoshi Nakamoto’s peer-to-peer payment system, which held out the promise of no intermediaries charging transaction costs, is plagued by high transaction costs. Other frictions also exist, one of which is tardy speed of execution. Nevertheless, getting bitcoin payments up to speed may be just around the corner.\nVirtual Crypto Technologies Inc. (OTCQB: VRCP) has launched Bit4Sure, a proprietary cryptocurrency transaction confirmation solution. Virtual Crypto Technologies is a technology company dedicated to making cryptocurrencies accessible to the public, specifically by creating payment solutions for businesses and consumers, which combine application programming interfaces and mobile applications for implementation across ATMs, PCs, tablets and other mobile devices.\nAs useful as blockchain technology is turning out to be, its employment in payment transactions is running into unanticipated problems that result in high transaction fees and delayed processing. One major issue with blockchain processing is the limit on the number of transactions that can be “confirmed” in each block and the time it may take to “fully” verify a transaction. Authenticating a bitcoin transaction can be quite lengthy because of the confirmation steps involved.\nThe process begins when a bitcoin payment is made, an event that broadcasts to the bitcoin network that the transaction is now in the “unconfirmed transactions” pool. Bitcoin miners will access this unconfirmed transactions pool and attempt to verify the transactions they find there by solving complex algorithms. If they do, they group the transactions into a “block”, which is set at the end of the existing blockchain, extending it. Every time a new block is verified, the older, existing blocks are re-verified. Thus, older blocks carry more trust than newer ones. However, this going over old ground can drag out transaction time. Moreover, only a limited number of transactions can be confirmed in one block, which means that, typically, a new bitcoin block only appears after about 10 minutes.\nSometimes (especially when the price spikes), bitcoin transactions surge, resulting in increased competition for limited block space; this drives up fees. Bitcoin fees are computed according to system rules that take into account the coins someone plans to spend, their size, their age, and the transaction size. The bitcoin system does not add coins; every coin is kept separately in a wallet. When a payment is made, the wallet will attempt to select coins to match the amount. It’s very similar to paying $0.65 with traditional coins, where a consumer could select two quarters, a dime and a nickel. This increases transaction size and fees. If, instead, a user were making a 0.65-bitcoin payment and happened to have a 0.65 bitcoin, transaction size and fees, and possibly time as well, would be less.\nFortunately, the Virtual Crypto Bit4Sure solution is sure to cut transaction time ( http://nnw.fm/5vs2P ). It bridges the time gap from when a transaction is published on the bitcoin network to the moment it joins the blockchain, essentially confirming a transaction before it reaches the blockchain for inclusion in a mined block. The Bit4Sure API also provides subscribers with direct access to Virtual Crypto’s proprietary algorithm model, giving them real-time confirmation of cryptocurrency transactions, as well as the ability to monitor the trading market of any cryptocurrency, protecting subscribers from delay, double spending and fraud. Virtual Crypto anticipates that the Bit4Sure API will be particularly attractive to crypto exchanges, payment processors, crypto wallets and other direct participants in the industry. The platform incorporates a mobile app for consumers.\nFor more information, visit the company’s website at www.Virtual-Crypto.com\nMore from NetworkNewsWire\nBlockchain Offers Diverse Possibilities for Expanding Markets First Cobalt Corp.

But one researcher says he still isn't getting the whole picture. May 16 2018, 3:04pm Image: Shutterstock\nBy the end of this year, Bitcoin may account for a whopping half of a percent of the world’s total energy demand. It doesn’t sound like much, but that is roughly equivalent to the energy needs of Austria, a country of nearly nine million people. This sobering prediction was made by financial economist Alex de Vries and published on Wednesday in Joule , marking the first time that the energy consumption of Bitcoin has been quantified in a peer-reviewed journal.\n“Most people are shocked that Bitcoin could use this much energy,” de Vries told me on the phone. “I think that’s the appropriate reaction. Half of a percent of the world’s energy is a huge number, especially for a system that isn’t really used for anything except speculation.”\nOver the past few years, de Vries’ blog Digiconomist has garnered a lot of attention for quantifying the amount of energy used in a single Bitcoin transaction (currently the same as an average Dutch household uses in a month). He used this value to quantify the energy consumption of the network as a whole (currently the same as the country of Ireland). Earlier this year, de Vries calculated that the process of securing the Bitcoin blockchain—known as mining—is over three times more energy intensive than actually mining real gold per dollar mined. This hasn’t made him popular amongst the hodlers online, who see the critique as an unfair attack on Bitcoin. In a representative Reddit thread , rebuttals to de Vries’ analysis mostly focus on how plenty of other things waste electricity as well, such as Christmas lights.\n“There are some diehards in the Bitcoin community that don’t want to talk about this because they hold Bitcoin and think it’s damaging,” de Vries told me. “But overall I’m getting a lot of really positive reactions from people who are happy that I’m trying to understand this problem which is growing quite rapidly.”\nStill, de Vries is the first to acknowledge that his estimates are just that—estimates. It may be impossible to ever know the exact energy consumption of the Bitcoin network, but upper and lower bounds of its energy consumption can be reliably calculated using economic models. Improving the accuracy of these models, however, requires a lot of information that is simply not currently available in the largely unregulated cryptocurrency space, de Vries said. How to predict the future of Bitcoin energy consumption\nAs detailed in de Vries’ new paper, the Bitcoin network currently consumes at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity and may consume 7.67 gigawatts by the end of this year.\nTo calculate the lower bound of this estimate, de Vries took the total mining power of the network and divided it by the energy efficiency of the most efficient Bitcoin miner on the market, the Antminer S9 . That means that if everyone on the Bitcoin network was using the most efficient computer chip available, the network would be using a total of 2.55 gigawatts of energy. In reality—where people use old and inefficient hardware—that number is likely higher, although determining just how much higher, or how much it can grow in the future, is really tough.\nBesides the difficulty of pinning down which hardware miners are using, its nearly impossible to tell how many individual miners are actually running on the network. There are approximately 10,000 nodes that make up the Bitcoin network, but each node might host dozens or even hundreds of miners. This can lead to large discrepancies in power consumption. As de Vries points out, the same hashrate can be achieved by a single Antminer S9 or about 500,000 Playstation 3s—the Antminer would use 1,372 watts of electricity compared to 40,000,000 watts in the case of the PS3s. Read More: You Could Mine One Bitcoin By Harvesting the Body Heat of 44,000 People For a Month\nDe Vries said he was able to predict the future energy consumption of Bitcoin by using economic models in which Bitcoin can be considered to be a “virtual commodity with a competitive market of producers.” De Vries cites a 2015 paper about Bitcoin economics written by the University of Wisconsin economist Adam Hayes, who predicts that miners will continue to mine “until their marginal costs equal their marginal product.”\nThis is an economist’s way of saying that more mining power will be added to the network (and hence more energy consumed) until the cost of the energy from adding another unit of mining power is equal to the value of the reward gained by adding that extra mining power, either through the generation of new bitcoins or the collection of transaction fees. At that point, the miner is effectively “breaking even” and it doesn’t make economic sense for them to continue adding more mining power to the network. Once that equilibrium point is reached, the power consumption of the network will effectively level off or decrease as mining will no longer be profitable.\nDe Vries calculated that about 60 percent of the Bitcoin value produced by a miner on March 16, 2018 went to paying for electricity. Based on that figure, he calculated that the equilibrium point will occur when the Bitcoin network reaches around 7.67 gigawatts of power consumption.\nHe then looked at reports estimating the number of chips that Bitmain—a Chinese firm that dominates Bitcoin mining and hardware production—is able to produce and found that the company could produce enough chips by the end of this year to bring the Bitcoin network’s total energy draw to 7.67 gigawatts. Since after this point miners would be breaking even, assuming the price of Bitcoin stays the same, it is the upper limit to Bitcoin’s energy use. How to improve predictions about Bitcoin energy consumption\nThe equilibrium limit established by de Vries requires a lot of assumptions. For starters, it’s a static picture of a market that is really dynamic. If the price of Bitcoin changes, this also affects the point of equilibrium—if the price of Bitcoin goes down, so too does the point of energy equilibrium and vice versa. And as everyone knows, the price of Bitcoin can change dramatically day-to-day.\nMoreover, de Vries’ estimates assume that miners are rational actors, though he told me it’s possible that some miners will mine at a loss for ideological reasons or to take advantage of stolen computer power. For example, National Science Foundation supercomputers were used to mine between $8,000 and $10,000 worth of Bitcoin in 2014, even though the computing power ended up costing the facility $150,000 . A more trivial example of mining at a loss is the rise of cryptojacking malware , which uses a victim’s computer to mine cryptocurrencies. This is only mining at a loss from the perspective of the victim, whereas the hacker is profiting no matter the value of the coin being mined.\nIn short, there are simply too many unknowns to get anything better than a ballpark estimate of future Bitcoin energy consumption.\n“Right now we're just looking at extremely limited data,” de Vries told me. “There is some information available, but its often conflicting. One of the first things we should do is try to get more information about these facilities and then we can better understand them. But for now it's a black box and its really hard to get a good number out of it.”\nDe Vries believes it may be possible to get better information about Bitcoin’s energy consumption in the future, however. One possible tactic we discussed on the phone would be to require Bitcoin mining operations that are above a certain size to report their energy consumption to a state agency. A similar program is already being trialled in Russia, which will make cryptocurrency miners register with the government starting this year .\nThe problem with this solution, of course, is that Bitcoin is transnational so this would require cooperation among China, Russia, Canada, and the US to report this information.\nAs far as mitigating Bitcoin’s effects on the environment, regulators can charge higher electricity rates for large scale mines or cap the amount of electricity a mine can use. In February, a small city in upstate New York became the first in the US to temporarily ban Bitcoin mining to prevent a huge upswing in electricity costs for its residents. Both variable rates and electricity caps are being considered as possible solutions to the town’s Bitcoin mining problem. Read More: The City That Banned Bitcoin Mining\nFor now, however, there are few mechanisms in place to stop Bitcoin from consuming more electricity. Bitcoin evangelists like John McAfee see the price of Bitcoin rising to over $500,000 by 2020 , which would significantly raise energy levels consumed by the system as it would be more profitable than ever to mine bitcoins.\nHowever, detractors consider Bitcoin’s economy to be in a bubble phase, and if it pops the price crash would also result in a huge down turn in mining and thus electricity demand. There’s also technical solutions like the Lightning Network on the way, which processes transactions off of the main Bitcoin blockchain and would thus significantly lower the energy cost per Bitcoin transaction. Another alternative is to use wind power and other forms of clean energy for Bitcoin mines .\nBut before a good solution to Bitcoin’s energy problem can be devised, it will be necessary to understand the full scope of that problem. Given that this will require greater government oversight of a commodity created specifically to avoid government meddling, it’s likely going to be an unpopular proposition.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/887024683379544065", "http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~caesar/papers/dime-raid17.pdf", "https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(18)30177-6?code=cell-site", "https://shop.bitmain.com/antminer_s9_asic_bitcoin_miner.htm", "https://digiconomist.net/", "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2580904", "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8694dq/bitcoin_and_energy_consumption_rebuttals/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitc", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "de vries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "digiconomist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T20:00:46.040+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2189ce7da2e1b404d5ca2bf33ffd7c7b6faa75e7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQpGLf2qSXvXp600Wyt66JESaymcmf8wfm42IfUCASN7sDrz6TSrAYlORFWFZUGXTR2Vc67vKbfKSxlQweUYG8itlS2OwnU58g-", "site_full": "www.zmescience.com", "site": "zmescience.com", "site_section": "http://www.zmescience.com/feed", "site_categories": ["sci_fi_and_fantasy", "hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "ZME Science", "title": "Bitcoin to consume 0.5% of the world’s electricity — as much as Ireland", "title_full": "Bitcoin to consume 0.5% of the world’s electricity — as much as Ireland", "published": "2018-05-16T18:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bitcoin-1813503_960_720.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 76498, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2189ce7da2e1b404d5ca2bf33ffd7c7b6faa75e7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQpGLf2qSXvXp600Wyt66JESaymcmf8wfm42IfUCASN7sDrz6TSrAYlORFWFZUGXTR2Vc67vKbfKSxlQweUYG8itlS2OwnU58g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mihai Andrei", "published": "2018-05-16T18:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin to consume 0.5% of the world’s electricity — as much as Ireland", "text": "Bitcoin to consume 0.5% of the world’s electricity — as much as Ireland Last updated on at 9:27 pm by Mihai Andrei\nEveryone’s favorite cryptocurrency is turning out to be a massive energy sink. According to a new study, in 2018, Bitcoin will soon account for 0.5% of the planet’s electricity — more than the consumption of many sizeable countries.\nCryptocurrency promised to revolutionize how we pay and receive money, and while they haven’t really done that, they did make a few people very rich. Aside from that, the social promises made by cryptocurrencies have yet to be fulfilled, and we’re starting to see some of the downsides of cryptocurrencies — in this case, energy consumption.\nMost of the Bitcoin-related energy is consumed in the “mining” process. Mining is essentially a record-keeping service done through the use of computer processing power. Miners keep the blockchain consistent, complete, and unalterable by repeatedly grouping newly broadcast transactions into a block, which consumes a massive amount of energy (the blockchain itself is a list of records linked and secured using cryptography).\nThe problem is that you can’t really have Bitcoin without immense computation, and this level of computation will always require vast amounts of energy. Miners are incentivized to use more and more processing power and even those who don’t get anything expend electricity.\nIf Bitcoin miners were a country, they’d rank somewhere between the 60th and 70th for consumed electricity — that’s more than half the countries in the world.\nIn a Commentary appearing on May 16 in the journal Joule , financial economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries analyzes this energy consumption using a new methodology.\n“The electricity that is expended in the process of mining Bitcoin has become a topic of heavy debate over the past few years. It is a process that makes Bitcoin extremely energy-hungry by design, as the currency requires a huge amount of hash calculations for its ultimate goal of processing financial transactions without intermediaries(peer-to-peer). The primary fuel for each of these calculations is electricity.”\nHis estimate put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts annually, though the real figure is likely much higher. That’s about as much as Ireland , and two times more than countries like Paraguay and Lithuania. A single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the developed world uses in a month, and to make matters even worse — things are only going to get worse as Bitcoin-related energy consumption increases.\n“To me, half a percent is already quite shocking. It’s an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,” he says. If the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, de Vries believes the network could someday consume 5% of the world’s electricity. “That would be quite bad.”\nThis raises two important questions. First, is Bitcoin really adding any value to society? Sure, you can speculate around it, maybe make some money, maybe lose some money. But at the end of the day, for mankind, is Bitcoin really adding anything of value — especially considering how you spend electricity (and therefore money) to generate it? Secondly, there are important externalities associated with Bitcoin. It’s not just the money, but also the emissions generated in the electricity-producing process — who will account for that? Some states are already taking the first steps towards Bitcoin regulation, and that’s really important, not just for what’s happening now, but for what will undoubtedly happen in the future.\n“But you need to base your policy on something. And I think that my method is important in that regard, because it’s very forward-looking. It’s focused not on the now, but on where we’re headed. And I think that’s something you really need to know if you’re going to draft policy about it,” he says.\nMining Bitcoins gets harder and harder, so at one point, the cost of electricity will outweigh the Bitcoin revenue. But we’re still a long way from reaching that equilibrium, and it doesn’t make much sense to wait for that to happen — after all, a new currency could come up and take Bitcoin’s place, and then we’re back to square one. As de Vries concludes:\n“For now, however, Bitcoin has a big problem, and it is growing fast.”\nJournal Reference: Joule , de Vries: “Bitcoin’s Growing Energy Problem” http://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(18)30177-6\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption", "http://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(18)30177-6", "http://zmescience.us8.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=7431083f9ab1b95fec8f03864&id=3b5aad2288"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mihai andrei everyone", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T19:52:55.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "81e11b749d59575d97962eb2b8f1caad4af144ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSCEqOmtojK1VkZu5D2zY9iuEiJK0ngQqj3hyBoudwMylRBOWy25v1v", "site_full": "www.tellows.it", "site": "tellows.it", "site_section": "https://www.tellows.it/stats", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Statistiche dei numeri", "title": "390497360272 1 (1 trading Bitcoin 00390390497360272", "title_full": "390497360272 su tellows | 1 Commenti (1 Negativo) per trading Bitcoin numero di telefono - chiama da 00390390497360272", "published": "2018-05-16T18:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "IT", "spam_score": 0.218, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 54538, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "81e11b749d59575d97962eb2b8f1caad4af144ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSCEqOmtojK1VkZu5D2zY9iuEiJK0ngQqj3hyBoudwMylRBOWy25v1v", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "fruit", "published": "2018-05-16T18:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "390497360272 1 (1 trading Bitcoin 00390390497360272", "text": "truffa aggravata", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T22:30:48.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "129d34fce18d35db65c73a89fff0099871e1ac98", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.cRxZE.p3laWrqUsXlsR8dDg0QaNCHeIFnN4HK10JFnF6TG0L9O7Jl95Vcj3Alkk9dKxjLTjyZWpHpRhxlST7tLzm3hrXidbM-", "site_full": "www.gistpunch.com", "site": "gistpunch.com", "site_section": "http://www.gistpunch.com/", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "For Best Entertainment, Sport, and Music", "title": "Do You Need To Sell or Buy Bitcoin in Lagos, or Nigeria as Whole Visit HEre", "title_full": "Do You Need To Sell or Buy Bitcoin in Lagos, or Nigeria as Whole Visit HEre", "published": "2018-05-16T18:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "129d34fce18d35db65c73a89fff0099871e1ac98", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.cRxZE.p3laWrqUsXlsR8dDg0QaNCHeIFnN4HK10JFnF6TG0L9O7Jl95Vcj3Alkk9dKxjLTjyZWpHpRhxlST7tLzm3hrXidbM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "gistpunch (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-16T18:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Do You Need To Sell or Buy Bitcoin in Lagos, or Nigeria as Whole Visit HEre", "text": "DO YOU NEED BITCOIN or Ethereum and also Perfect Money or Other Kind of ECurrency\nDo you want to Sell your Bitcoin or Etherium\nall available at Pufftech Exchange With Instant Funding And Payment of Both E-currency\n Available to buy and also you can sell Visit our Website www.pufftechexchange.com and register afterward you can submit you buy/sell order form if u have any problem or Difficulties kindly send us an email at info@pufftechexchange.com or whats app 08026116103\nWe Do Large Quantities 5,000 - 50,000$ upward\nYou Can Now Sell Your Gift Card To Us and you will be Paid instantly as your card been verified We Buy any Gift Card from USA, ETC iTunes Gift Card.

Created in response to the 2008 financial crisis, anarcho-capitalists hailed it as the decentralized future of commerce.\nBut as prices soared and the biggest names on Wall Street bought in, Bitcoin became mostly known as a speculative, unregulated investment. Think Beanie Babies, but you can also use them to buy drugs and engage in human trafficking.\nPerhaps the most remarkable Bitcoin storyline recently has been just how much computational horsepower it takes to create the virtual currency : some 26 quintillion calculations per second. That adds up to tremendous energy bills.\nBut it’s been tough to put exact numbers on Bitcoin’s massive energy consumption. Most estimates have been “back-of-the-envelope” type calculations. A study published Wednesday in the journal Joule attempts to change that. Economist and digital currency expert Alex de Vries applied traditional economics to better understand Bitcoin’s current and future energy consumption.\nHis results are staggering: Bitcoin uses roughly as much electricity annually as Ireland. And just one Bitcoin transaction requires as much electricity as an average household in his native Netherlands uses in a month.\nProjecting forward, the power drain becomes even more alarming. By year’s end, Bitcoin could consume as much electricity as Austria — or roughly one half of one percent of humanity’s total power needs. If the cryptocurrency’s price grows as some expect, it could eventually chew up 5 percent of global electricity.\n“This increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,” says de Vries, who’s also the founder of Digiconomist, in a media release.\nAlways-On Technology\nBitcoin’s intense energy consumption is baked into its design.\nTo stop people from fraudulently spending their virtual money more than once, each Bitcoin transaction gets a precise timestamp. This public ledger is known as the blockchain . It underpins all consumer confidence in the system.\nTo create it, computers around the world continuously crank away at calculations, generating numbers as they compete to process transactions. If your computer gets selected to process a Bitcoin transaction, you’re rewarded 12.5 new coins plus a transaction fee.\nThis means that the computers processing Bitcoin are chugging away at calculations non-stop — even when they’re not involved in an actual transaction. The more calculations you do, the more chances you have to get a transaction fee.\nIn Bitcoin’s early days, the need was small and many transactions happened on home computers. But now some 200,000 Bitcoin transactions transpire every day.\n“If you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power,” de Vries says. “So there’s a big incentive for people to increase how much they’re spending on electricity and on machines.”\nThe growth and increased complexity, paired with the reward, has led to a worldwide rush to build vast Bitcoin mining operations. You can see this across Eastern Europe, China, Russia and Siberia, where Bitcoin server farms are so big that their excess energy is literally warming houses. Or, for example, the Russian nuclear scientists caught trying to use a government supercomputer for mining cryptocurrency.\nde Vries’ study tries to figure out when the expense will level off with the reward, slowing the industry’s growth and energy consumption. And he admits his estimates are shaky. Bitcoin mining is a secretive business, and so some of the information he relies on came from eyewitness accounts. But the results are important for understanding the industry’s sustainability and passing effective regulations.\n“I’m doing this research,” he says, “but a lot of people should be doing it.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43003740", "http://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(18)30177-6", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/technology/bitcoin-new-york-stock-exchange.html", "http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-mining.asp", "https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/wtf-is-blockchain-inside-the-most-disruptive-tech-since-the-internet/81567"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eric betz", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T19:59:12.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b1689e8ba2e196d12fdce8f420640bd567e09731", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRO1G7gzj4RY7q6Bfhz12sXveEzHmOGX9J_QEMruNei_rR1244sjF6IAx5mP..lH8uZjwzQc7afuYEjzbJ_BPW6laP8l2vee6o-", "site_full": "www.scimex.org", "site": "scimex.org", "site_section": "https://www.scimex.org/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Scimex Newsfeed", "title": "Mining how much electricity Bitcoin uses", "title_full": "Mining how much electricity Bitcoin uses", "published": "2018-05-16T18:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.scimex.org/__data/assets/image/0003/323688/ChonBuri-,thailand-Dec-18,2017-close-up-of-Digital-money-901806276_1256x838.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b1689e8ba2e196d12fdce8f420640bd567e09731", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRO1G7gzj4RY7q6Bfhz12sXveEzHmOGX9J_QEMruNei_rR1244sjF6IAx5mP..lH8uZjwzQc7afuYEjzbJ_BPW6laP8l2vee6o-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T18:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Mining how much electricity Bitcoin uses", "text": "Mining how much electricity Bitcoin uses 17 01:00 Alongside tales of people who have made (and lost) a lot of money through Bitcoin, the other major news is how much electricity it takes to mine the cryptocurrency. Now a financial economist has attempted to tally Bitcoin's electricity requirements and suggests by the end of the year it will be using half a per cent of the world's electric energy. Currently, he estimates Bitcoin uses about the same amount of electricity as Ireland and by the end of the year could be equal to that of Austria.\nJournal/conference: Joule Media Release From: Cell Press\nBitcoin estimated to use half a percent of the world's electric energy by end of 2018\nBitcoin's burgeoning electricity demands have attracted almost as much attention as the cryptocurrency's wildly fluctuating value. But estimating exactly how much electricity the Bitcoin network uses, necessary for understanding its impact and implementing policy, remains a challenge. In the first rigorously peer-reviewed article quantifying Bitcoin's energy requirements, a Commentary appearing May 16 in the journal Joule , financial economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries uses a new methodology to pinpoint where Bitcoin's electric energy consumption is headed and how soon it might get there.\n\"We've seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I'm hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research,\" says de Vries, who works at the Experience Center of PwC in the Netherlands and is the founder of Digiconomist( @DigiEconomist ), a blog that aims to better inform cryptocurrency users.\nHis estimates, based in economics, put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts annually, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland. A single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. By the end of this year, he predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts--as much as Austria and half of a percent of the world's total consumption. \"To me, half a percent is already quite shocking. It's an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,\" he says. If the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, de Vries believes the network could someday consume 5% of the world's electricity. \"That would be quite bad.\"\nBitcoin is dependent on computers that time-stamp transactions into an ongoing chain to prevent duplicate spending of coins. Computers in the network perform calculations continuously, competing for the chance, once every ten minutes, to be appointed to create the next block of transactions in the chain. The user of the computer that wins is awarded 12.5 new coins--a process known as \"mining\" Bitcoin. But all the time, even the users that don't win are expending computing power. \"You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you're using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there's a big incentive for people to increase how much they're spending on electricity and on machines,\" de Vries says.\nIt's figuring out when that incentive stops paying off that is at the heart of de Vries's estimation method. Economic principles suggest that the entire Bitcoin network will eventually reach an equilibrium where the costs of the hardware and electricity used to mine equal the value of the Bitcoin being mined. And that information can approximate the total amount of electricity that the network will use at said equilibrium.\nOther researchers have used the fundamentals of this method before, but de Vries goes farther. He uses production information aboutBitmain, the biggest manufacturer of Bitcoin mining machines, to estimate both how much of a miner's costs are associated with hardware rather than electricity and when this equilibrium might be reached. And while he does have confidence in his estimates, the problem with this method is that these manufacturers are extremely secretive. \"Sometimes the best information we've got is really shaky eyewitness accounts. That's the stuff we have to work with,\" he says.\nStill, he believes that getting a good estimate is important in determining the sustainability of cryptocurrencies moving forward and in helping shape policy around them. Some states in the U.S. have already started to put restrictions around Bitcoin mining. \"But you need to base your policy on something. And I think that my method is important in that regard, because it's very forward-looking. It's focused not on the now, but on where we're headed. And I think that's something you really need to know if you're going to draft policy about it,\" he says.\nHe also points out that there is plenty of room for discussion of his method. \"I think everyone agrees on the minimum energy consumption. But the future estimate? That's actually quite debatable. We don't really have a common approach to getting to a future estimate of electricity consumption right now, which is why I am hoping to get this conversation started. I'm doing this research, but a lot of people should be doing it.\" Attachments:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://click.deliveryengine.agilitypr.com/wf/click?upn=wIF-2BQTwXiA1xLVaYz4WPfVAVHWaPRm4dqw3FCMjwMnywh6AC5aOOXJV6PSrvZvQR_xT9avFbO0gzk52bod4iig5gIGqAQQTKVg-2Fr7tfYnPfE4VZaPFCTxxfCgAsa0FhFXOpTC2P2-2F6GcAon9WQwPVQwTbviH-2FI5y8wlCAT5Axvun2cPwX3dZU0p6QqLp52h0ErcKUroS4R9YEBtKyiAZ-2BowCfDTiN1oCBShoQ5hNQBH6Fk2hIYNsT1jB20ybCdGE5D0hVcFTXfrHIXtQDpFa0I87YI4ov78gMz4aaopam8yVp6W02plEbdjtGB6jxephmduMvjj2YuiKmnlbRBpZs0hFom7qcx30oM8FA1WscKyk8CjFItn3aITqABvamPeEIUsCvkLOUvqvJx-2BOF4mnMEGmrBd3giDdPoRjRlm-2BmvnayH-2Fdg0gXi5K-2FxaSMlb6fw7aV5p41I1HvhwyWfwiIs"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "joule media", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T00:40:57.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7b797b6455df7fa6ace50e836a6e83d82d28dab4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R9M6RBHurip_hPkVssqG91GbQRlRU8WCF9h6BZCTIGoLzS5p2nwrsWm051DsmvhvMHNACLqocDHKlcT6Gc5ZW4KXGssVF1YN4DoGx1M_UNgGjUXTsQmEUHWZZTO0_3jvjAsp03ow4F4_5rUE2FSA_", "site_full": "www.livemint.com", "site": "livemint.com", "site_section": "http://www.livemint.com/money", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Livemint - Money, news on finance, stock markets, personal finance, loans and more", "title": "Bitcoin mining equipment maker Canaan files for $1 billion IPO", "title_full": "Bitcoin mining equipment maker Canaan files for $1 billion IPO - Livemint", "published": "2018-05-16T18:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.livemint.com/rf/Image-621x414/LiveMint/Period2/2018/05/17/Photos/Processed/bitcoin-kwYE--621x414@LiveMint.JPG", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4429, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7b797b6455df7fa6ace50e836a6e83d82d28dab4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R9M6RBHurip_hPkVssqG91GbQRlRU8WCF9h6BZCTIGoLzS5p2nwrsWm051DsmvhvMHNACLqocDHKlcT6Gc5ZW4KXGssVF1YN4DoGx1M_UNgGjUXTsQmEUHWZZTO0_3jvjAsp03ow4F4_5rUE2FSA_", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bloomberg", "published": "2018-05-16T18:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin mining equipment maker Canaan files for $1 billion IPO", "text": "A listing of Canaan would be the first Hong Kong IPO from the cryptocurrency industry.

The sanctions also include bank senior official Ali Tarzali. Both have been listed as “specially designated global terrorists”.\nAt the same time, Iranian government moves to head off a currency crisis could lead to further capital flight via cryptocurrencies.\nOn Monday , the Central Bank issued a new directive setting stricter limits on the amount of foreign cash travelers can take with them out of the country. Travelers can leave Iran by air now with only $5,980 (5,000 euros, or the equivalent in any foreign currency). The new amount halves the previous amount allowed. Leaving by land, rail or sea has a limit of $2,392 per person.

This has led to a flourishing business for cross-border crypto deals with Iranian citizens desperate to get their money out.\nWhile the initial justification for the ban was to thwart money-laundering and terrorism financing, the Iranian Financial Tribune quoted an Iranian official as saying that the move was intended to stop capital flight.\n“The ban on trade of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin by CBI, as the financial and currency regulator of the country, is to prevent the flight of foreign currency under the current circumstances of the country.”\nNow that the original ban has backfired and possibly led to increased capital flight, the government seems to be wavering, suggesting that the policy might not be set in stone and a new regulatory framework should be in place by the third quarter of this year.\nIn the meantime, capital flight will be hard to stop, especially considering that all of the government’s recent actions undo their liberal economic policymaking of the past years.\nBy Michael Kern for Safehaven.com\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-iran/iran-central-bank-bans-cryptocurrency-dealings-idUSKBN1HT0YN", "https://financialtribune.com/articles/economy-business-and-markets/85928/iranians-crypto-purchases-surpass-25-billion", "http://en.ibena.ir/news/85435/Iranians-Purchase-2-5-Billion-Dollars-Cryptocurrencies", "https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-economy/iran-rial-plunges-to-new-low-after-trump-decides-to-leave-nuclear-deal-idUSL8N1SG4KL", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-sanctions-iranian-currency-exchange-operations-in-the-u-a-e-1525973587", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-iran-central-bank-terror-sanctions-20180515-story.html", "https://en.radiofarda.com/a/central-bank-sets-strict-limits-on-cash-leaving-iran-amid-ongoing-currency-crisis/29225983.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael kern", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T08:03:46.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "21582af877833faacd418614a342ce7c37f5024c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8T_3330TWrL3xX35Q9ya0BycSkb1p4e1RM1FJ5RWGzT1y5vqPsT.f0tf.rdzIK.vQEdAm_RN3Ohw--", "site_full": "www.greencarcongress.com", "site": "greencarcongress.com", "site_section": "http://www.greencarcongress.com/", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "Green Car Congress", "title": "Study estimates Bitcoin will use half a percent of the world’s electric energy by end of 2018", "title_full": "Study estimates Bitcoin will use half a percent of the world’s electric energy by end of 2018", "published": "2018-05-16T18:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "21582af877833faacd418614a342ce7c37f5024c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8T_3330TWrL3xX35Q9ya0BycSkb1p4e1RM1FJ5RWGzT1y5vqPsT.f0tf.rdzIK.vQEdAm_RN3Ohw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mmillikin", "published": "2018-05-16T18:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Study estimates Bitcoin will use half a percent of the world’s electric energy by end of 2018", "text": "Bitcoin’s burgeoning electricity demands have attracted almost as much attention as the cryptocurrency’s wildly fluctuating value. However, estimating exactly how much electricity the Bitcoin network uses, necessary for understanding its impact and implementing policy, remains a challenge. In a Commentary in the journal Joule , financial economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries uses a new methodology to pinpoint where Bitcoin’s electric energy consumption is headed and how soon it might get there.\nde Vries works at the Experience Center of PwC in the Netherlands and is the founder of Digiconomist (@DigiEconomist), a blog that aims to better inform cryptocurrency users.\nHis estimates put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 GW annually, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland. A single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. By the end of this year, he predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts—as much as Austria and half of a percent of the world’s total consumption.\nTo me, half a percent is already quite shocking. It’s an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals. —Alex de Vries\nIf the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, de Vries believes the network could someday consume 5% of the world’s electricity. “ That would be quite bad. ”\nEstimated number of Terahashes per second (Trillions of hashes per second) performed by the Bitcoin Network Source: Blockchain.info. de Vries (2018)\nBitcoin is dependent on computers that time-stamp transactions into an ongoing chain to prevent duplicate spending of coins. Computers in the network perform calculations continuously, competing for the chance, once every ten minutes, to be appointed to create the next block of transactions in the chain. The user of the computer that wins is awarded 12.5 new coins—a process known as “mining” Bitcoin. But all the time, even the users that don’t win are expending computing power.\nYou are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you’re using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there’s a big incentive for people to increase how much they’re spending on electricity and on machines. Alex de Vries\nIt’s figuring out when that incentive stops paying off that is at the heart of de Vries’s estimation method. Economic principles suggest that the entire Bitcoin network will eventually reach an equilibrium in which the costs of the hardware and electricity used to mine equal the value of the Bitcoin being mined. And that information can approximate the total amount of electricity that the network will use at said equilibrium.\nOther researchers have used the fundamentals of this method before, but de Vries went further. He used production information about Bitmain, the biggest manufacturer of Bitcoin mining machines, to estimate both how much of a miner’s costs are associated with hardware rather than electricity and when this equilibrium might be reached. And while he does have confidence in his estimates, the problem with this method is that these manufacturers are extremely secretive.\nStill, he believes that getting a good estimate is important in determining the sustainability of cryptocurrencies moving forward and in helping shape policy around them. Some states in the US have already started to put restrictions around Bitcoin mining.\nBut you need to base your policy on something. And I think that my method is important in that regard, because it’s very forward-looking. It’s focused not on the now, but on where we’re headed. And I think that’s something you really need to know if you’re going to draft policy about it.\nI think everyone agrees on the minimum energy consumption. But the future estimate? That’s actually quite debatable. We don’t really have a common approach to getting to a future estimate of electricity consumption right now, which is why I am hoping to get this conversation started. I’m doing this research, but a lot of people should be doing it. —Alex de Vries\nResources\nde Vries, (2018), “Bitcoin’s Growing Energy Problem,” Joule doi: 10.1016/j.joule.2018.04.016\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T18:11:39.038+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "131b7b2a70fec4e5f98ae6386d686bb3d929027e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSX9hzo2IzPtUFj7FwkLQ1K0Jp6fXOwlEStIhI9nVlzcN5A55uSqJoEXcVwOiZf0QdH53p0RwRwQa", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "The normalization of Bitcoin continues.

Iran sees cryptocurrencies as a promising avenue to withdraw from the influence of the dollar, Mohammad Reza Purebrakhimi, the head of the commission for economic affairs of the Assembly of the Islamic Council (Parliament) of Iran, said according to Interfax. “An important issue has been raised about using cryptocurrency for the past year or two, which is one of the good ways to bypass the use of the dollar, as well as the SWIFT system, and we have ordered the Central Bank in Iran to start developing proposals for using cryptocurrency,” Purebrakhimi said at a meeting with Russia’s head of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy Dmitry Mezentsev. Purebrakhimi had discussed the matter a day before the meeting at Russia’s lower house of Parliament, the State Duma’s committee on economic policy. “They share our opinion, we said that if we manage to promote this work, then we will be the first countries that use the cryptocurrency in the exchange of goods,” Purebrakhimi said according to a rough translation. The two countries are to further discuss the matter at the meeting of the interbank working group on financial and interbank cooperation to be held in Tehran on July 5. Russia has stated earlier this month they are to blockchenize their own SWIFT as early as next year, while Iran’s IT Minister has strongly suggested their plans to issue a cryptocurrency is actually more likely to be a tokenized bond backed by assets Venezuela style. This recent discussion of direct trade between the two countries through crypto is a new development. At the beginning of the year, Russia and Turkey completed their first shipping deal paid by crypto. Other countries have likewise undertaken such small pilots, but in the case of Iran the usage of crypto might be at a higher level than a shipping here or there, especially in the context of potential re-instatement of sanctions by US as Trump performs a complex geopolitical dance. What crypto they would use exactly remains unknown at this stage. It could potentially even be bitcoin or eth, they could even mine it directly. But they could perhaps launch their own crypto, which might make the task of wider acceptance a bit more difficult, or, perhaps, this is final stage discussions regarding the token we mentioned and how that could potentially be used in trade with Russia. Blockchain technology and public blockchain cryptos are decentralized and have been designed in a way that ensures neutrality. Therefore no one can interfere with the transfer of one bitcoin or eth as far as their movement from one bitcoin address to another is concerned. Beyond that, then of course you’re dealing with non-blockchain systems, but within the blockchain system itself, the network is open to everyone. A recent innovation is the use of ethereum’s blockchain to create new currencies that run on top of it, usually through an ICO, but tokens can be generated by simply pushing some code. Those currencies running on top allow the creator of the token to have more control over them, say over their distribution, issuance, or indeed if one wants to you can have stupendously complex algorithmic if then rules that shape the currency as you please. It is probable therefore Iran will use one of these options rather than re-invent the wheel by launching their own blockchain, but what exactly they will do remains to be seen as the tokenization of geopolitics continues. 0 Beitrag zu dieser Diskussion schreiben\nUm einen Beitrag schreiben zu können, müssen Sie sich anmelden!

(I have occasionally also argued that the story of cryptocurrency might actually be the opposite, that it’s about traveling back in time to progressively forget the lessons of modern finance, but never mind that.)\nIn many ways this is a snarky and condescending thing to think; the implication is that the crypto people had simplistic and naive expectations about how trustless decentralized purely market-based finance could work, and are slowly discovering the obvious-to-the-rest-of-us benefits of trust and central counterparties and regulation and non-market mechanisms. On this theory, financial history is a journey from darkness into enlightenment, and those of us who have seen the light can watch in amusement as cryptocurrencies make the same journey.\nOn the other hand that’s not actually how many people think of financial history! “The most important financial innovation that I have seen the past 20 years is the automatic teller machine,” Paul Volcker famously said , and there are plenty of people who would argue that at least the past few decades of financial history have been a story of reckless deregulation, risk, scandal, inequality, over-financialization and rent-seeking. On this view, if cryptocurrency does quickly repeat the history of conventional finance—if in two years we end up with too-big-to-fail Bitcoin banks that use chat rooms to manipulate crypto indexes and set up fake accounts for their users—then that will be bad . Cryptocurrency’s original promise wasn’t simplistic and naive; it was idealistic and pure, and importing all the controversial features of scandal-plagued modern finance will be a tragedy.\nAnyway Bitcoin has discovered co-location for high-frequency traders :\nCoinbase Inc., which operates the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, said on Tuesday that it would upgrade its systems with services that cater to ultrafast traders. The upgrade, planned for later this year, will make Coinbase one of the first bitcoin exchanges to welcome the controversial business of high-speed trading. ...\nSan Francisco-based Coinbase plans to introduce “low-latency performance,” the company said in a blog post, using a term in the exchange industry that means extremely fast processing times.\nCoinbase also said it would allow trading firms to place their servers directly in its data center, a practice called co-location.\nThat’s fine! Catering to professional market makers— having professional market makers, for that matter—is probably a way to make the market better and more useful for most investors. “These additions will allow for a more efficient price discovery process to occur, creating tighter markets, deeper liquidity, and increased certainty of execution,” says Coinbase . It is a stage of enlightenment, an adoption of useful ideas from conventional finance. (Along with the co-location, Coinbase is also “developing several tools to lure institutional investors onto its platform,” including “custodial services where investors can store large amounts of digital currencies”; obviously having a safe place to put your Bitcoins would be a positive development—and a change from Bitcoin’s original promise of decentralization.)\nOn the other hand that’s not actually how many people think about exchanges that cater to high-frequency traders! I mean, co-location, my word:\nCoinbase’s move is likely to raise eyebrows, since many investors view high-speed traders with suspicion. Critics like Michael Lewis, author of the 2014 best-seller “Flash Boys,” have alleged that HFT firms take advantage of slower-moving players.\nSome number of people got into Bitcoin because they felt like the conventional financial system was rigged against them, and I suspect that some number of them felt like that because stock exchanges let high-frequency traders pay to run their algorithms right next to the exchanges’ servers so they could have faster access to the exchange than anyone else. And now here we are.\nObviously neither of these narratives is really right; financial history is not a story of uninterrupted progress to pure efficiency nor one of absolute corruption by evil entrenched interests. It’s mostly a series of good-faith tradeoffs under uncertainty, many of which could conceivably have gone the other way. U.S. securities laws, for instance, have an onerous and one-size-fits-all set of disclosure requirements for anyone who wants to raise money by selling securities to the general public; this makes it much easier to police fraud , but also makes it harder for disruptive entrepreneurs to raise money to fund real projects and for small investors to participate in high-growth investments. And there are those in the crypto community who argue that the tradeoff should go the other way in cryptocurrency regulation: Let a million blockchain projects bloom, accept that most of them will be frauds, but do it anyway to foster innovation.\nThat is interesting, or at least potentially interesting. ( Not all of the regulators are moved by it! But some seem to be.) Watching cryptocurrency create an alternate financial history, one in which some of those choices go another way, in which the balance is struck (say) in favor of more fraud and more innovation, or more democracy and less professionalization, or whatever, is the real appeal of the cryptocurrency revolution. If, after learning all of its lessons, it just converges entirely on old-fashioned finance—but with a different set of powerful incumbent billionaires—then what was the point?\nElsewhere in crypto exchanges, here&apos;s a story about how Israeli crypto exchange eToro will open to U.S. investors. And: “Crypto Exchange Kraken Says It Will Probably Register With SEC .” And: “ ‘Privacy Coin’ ZCash Lands on Winklevoss’s Gemini Exchange.”\nAnd elsewhere in crypto, the Consensus 2018 conference is going on in New York this week and it is exhausting just to read about. Here’s a story about how the BitMex exchange rented some Lamborghinis to sit around revving outside the conference because, you know, crypto Bitcoin blockchain Lambo Lambo Lambo Lambo Lambo Lambo. Here&apos;s a story about how “the smell of marijuana wafted through a half-filled event space in Manhattan’s Meatpacking District, as a group of cryptocurrency believers downed champagne and blood orange margaritas” and listened to Snoop Dogg at an afterparty thrown by Ripple Labs Inc.:\nAround 9 p.m., Snoop Dogg arrived to an adoring crowd sporting Patagonia fleeces, button-up shirts and Team Ripple tees.\n“So what we get drunk, so what we smoke weed,” they sang along as Snoop strutted onstage flanked by dancers in rhinestone bras and a person in a canine costume, wearing a jacket with ‘Dirty Dogg’ written on the back.\nDo you think that the majority of people at the majority of Snoop Dogg shows circa 2018 are wearing button-up shirts and Patagonia fleeces? Surely yes, right? These days I feel like the dress code for any Snoop Dogg show is probably business casual.\nCBS v. Redstone.\nWe talked yesterday about CBS Corp.’s amazing effort to get rid of its controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone’s National Amusements Inc., by issuing enough voting stock to other shareholders to dilute away NAI’s control. The point of this effort would be to prevent Redstone and NAI from using their voting power to fire CBS’s directors and try to force through a merger with Viacom Inc., another company controlled by Redstone. A flaw in CBS’s plan is that it had to give Redstone notice of the board meeting (scheduled for tomorrow) at which it will issue those new shares, and so she can fire them before they hold that meeting. But it asked a Delaware court to enjoin her from doing that, so it could go and get rid of her in peace.\nLater yesterday NAI filed its reply to that lawsuit, which denies the basic conflict that CBS claimed—\nPlaintiffs suggest that NAI intends to force such a merger by removing and replacing the CBS independent directors. There is no truth to that. NAI does not have, and has never had, any intention of replacing the CBS Board or taking other action to force a merger. Plaintiffs’ supposed belief to the contrary is based on unsourced media reports and conjecture.\n—but also notes that, even if it were true, diluting away Redstone’s ownership “would still be egregiously overbroad and unjustified”:\nIf Plaintiffs were genuinely concerned that NAI would seek to force a merger upon the company, and NAI had not committed to refrain from doing so during the pendency of this action, the relief to which Plaintiffs would even plausibly be entitled would be an injunction to prevent NAI from forcing a merger upon the company while this litigation is pending. It would not be to dilute NAI’s voting power, for all purposes, now and forever. This is an unprecedented usurpation of a controlling stockholder’s voting power.\nLook: That is obviously correct. If the controlling shareholder wants to do something bad and wrong over the board’s objection, then the board should say no. The board shouldn’t fire the controlling shareholder . That’s not even a thing. You can sort of understand the board’s point of view though. If the chief executive officer wanted to do something bad and wrong over the board’s objection, then the board really might fire him. Firing the CEO for doing bad things is how the board exerts its power, how it demonstrates that it is in control of the corporation. If the board really is supreme, if it is in control of the corporation and the shareholders are just sources of capital, then why shouldn’t it fire the shareholders too, if they make it mad enough?\nBy the way yesterday I expressed some surprise that the board would even try, but apparently there is precedent for boards trying to get rid of their controlling shareholders while the shareholders weren’t looking. (“You go on one long vacation out of cell-phone coverage and, bam, you’re out,” I wrote yesterday.) It didn’t work though. From NAI’s filing:\nThe proposed dilutive stock dividend would be invalid under Adlerstein v. Wertheimer . There, the Court recognized that where a controlling stockholder has the power to forestall board action by preemptively removing directors, the board cannot take steps to neutralize the controlling stockholder’s voting power in order to effectuate the board action. In Adlerstein , the controller had the power to remove certain directors and, recognizing this, the board kept the controller in the dark about a board proposal that destroyed his voting control over the corporation until it was too late for the controller to act. Recognizing that the controller was entitled to an adequate opportunity to protect his interests, the Court held that the directors’ decision to keep the controller uninformed about the proposal invalidated the board’s approval of the proposal.\nStill, good effort.\nOh, disclosure: CBS’s lawyers here are from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, where I worked long ago. I remain very fond of Wachtell, and I don’t think that I am biased when I say that it is undoubtedly the U.S.’s leading advocate of the theory of “ board primacy ” in corporate governance. I don’t really think they will, but if they do convince a Delaware court that boards of directors should be able to get rid of shareholders they disagree with , then that would be quite a total victory for board primacy.\nShould index funds be illegal?\nNo, write Thomas Lambert and Michael Sykuta of the University of Missouri, in “ The Case for Doing Nothing About Institutional Investors’ Common Ownership of Small Stakes in Competing Firms ”:\nWe show that the theory of anticompetitive harm from institutional investors’ common ownership is implausible and that the empirical studies supporting the theory are methodologically unsound. The theory fails to account for the fact that intra-industry diversified institutional investors are also inter-industry diversified and rests upon unrealistic assumptions about managerial decision-making. The empirical studies purporting to demonstrate anticompetitive harm from common ownership are deficient because they inaccurately assess institutional investors’ economic interests and employ an endogenous measure that precludes causal inferences.\nEven if institutional investors’ common ownership of competing firms did soften market competition somewhat, the proposed policy solutions would themselves create welfare losses that would overwhelm any social benefits they secured.\nThe point that “intra-industry diversified institutional investors are also inter-industry diversified” is worth emphasizing. When people worry that common ownership of multiple firms in the same industry by big institutional investors reduces competition in that industry—the antitrust worry that I often shorthand as “should index funds be illegal?”—the theory is more or less that if all the airlines raise prices, rather than compete with each other on price, then they will all make higher profits and benefit their common shareholders at the expense of customers. But, in general, the mutual funds also own the customers. Lambert and Sykuta write:\nIntra-industry diversified mutual funds tend also to be inter-industry diversified, and maximizing one industry’s profits requires supracompetitive pricing that tends to reduce the profits of firms in complementary industries. A leading Vanguard fund, for example, holds around 2% of each major airline (1.85% of United, 2.07% of American, 2.15% of Southwest, and 1.99% of Delta) but also holds:\n• 1.88% of Expedia Inc. (a major retailer of airline tickets),\n• 2.20% of Boeing Co. (a manufacturer of commercial jets),\n• 2.02% of United Technologies Corp. (a jet engine producer),\n• 3.14% of AAR Corp. (the largest domestic provider of commercial aircraft maintenance and repair),\n• 1.43% of Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (a major automobile rental company), and\n• 2.17% of Accenture (a consulting firm for which air travel is a significant cost component).\nEach of those companies—and many others—perform worse when airlines engage in the sort of supracompetitive pricing (and corresponding reduction in output) that maximizes profits in the airline industry.\nIf you do want to believe the index-funds-should-be-illegal thesis, then it may not be as simple as “giant diversified mutual funds that own lots of companies in an industry want to maximize the profits of that industry in anti-competitive ways.” Their objective function has to be a bit broader: They must want to maximize the profits of corporations , broadly, at the expense of individual consumers (and workers). That is a more nebulous theory; it is not as simple as “companies in an industry should try to keep prices high and not undercut each other by competing for market share,” but more like “companies in every industry should try to keep corporate profits high generally and not undercut each other by being nice to household consumers or workers.” It is harder to see how corporate managers would maximize that. But it is a pleasingly Marxist diagnosis of institutional investors as advocates, not of reduced competition in any particular industry, but of the interests of the capitalist class generally against those of workers and consumers.\nPeople are worried about unicorns.\nPrivate markets, I sometimes say, are the new public markets; companies used to have to go public to raise a lot of money or create secondary liquidity or achieve widespread name recognition or whatever, but now they can do all of that in the private markets. Still companies do go public sometimes, often because their venture capitalists find it easier to cash out by selling to the public than by relying on the relatively limited liquidity in private secondary markets. But the VCs are working on fixing that problem too :\nNew Enterprise Associates, one of Silicon Valley’s largest venture-capital firms, plans to sell off a big chunk of its startup investments in response to a dearth of initial public offerings, according to people familiar with the discussions.\nThe firm plans to sell roughly $1 billion worth of its stakes in about 20 startups to a new firm it is seeking to create, one of the people said, in an effort to return capital to its limited-partner investors. These companies will mostly be those that initially raised money from NEA about eight to 10 years ago.\nI mean it is all just pots of money. You are a private company, you go to a pot of money called “venture capital,” it gives you some money, you grow, the venture capitalists want to cash out, you go public, and the VCs sell to another pot of money called “mutual funds” or whatever. If the VCs set up a new pot of money called, like, “private secondary liquidity funds” or whatever (you might want a catchier name), then you kind of get rid of the need to go public. The trick is that those funds have to look more like mutual funds than the VC funds do; if they are buying big high-valuation stakes in mature but somehow-not-yet-public companies, then they need to be big, and they can’t expect too many of those stakes to produce enormous returns. On the other hand they shouldn’t expect most of them to go bust, either; they should expect steady reliable returns from most of their mature private investments. They just have to accept that the private markets are the new public markets.\nElsewhere :\nSoftBank Group Corp.’s near-$100 billion Vision Fund has yet to close, but its acquisitive founder is already gauging interest for a second fund.\n“Vision Fund II will definitely come. It’s just a matter of time,” SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said during an interview at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council meeting in Tokyo on Tuesday.\nAnd why shouldn’t all the money in the world be in private tech investment funds?\nThings happen.\nItaly Bonds Roiled as Populists Debate $300 Billion Write-Down .

Authorized by China Conservation and Research Center for Giant Panda, Panda.Earth is the world’s first decentralized stimulation of the lives of pandas, digitizing every panda in existence into the blockchain.\nMay 16th, 2018, Hong Kong – CryptoKitties burst onto the scene in a flash, with a blockchain-based gamer that allowed users to breed virtual pets and put the technology firmly in the media limelight. However, as more people subscribed to these games and issues began to crop up, one fact became glaringly obvious, these games are pseudo-blockchain games. The data itself is not on the chain and it can easily be tampered with.\nPseudo-blockchain games use the blockchain to settle transactions, but not the storage of game data and gameplay. Game data and gameplay information tend to get distributed from centralized sources that do not offer true ownership and have multiple points of failure. This problem is what the Panda.Earth team is set to resolve through its community autonomous ecosystem .\nA Community Autonomous Ecosystem\nPlayers, designated as ‘Guardians’, will take on this exciting new universe while meeting up with each other, breeding, and exchanging pandas. This new fantasy-based world is hosted on both PCs and mobile terminals, enabling players to log in through their favorite devices on-the-go.\nA Bold New World on the Blockchain\nPanda.Earth distinguishes itself from another blockchain offering through five key features that highlight the philosophy empowering this world. They are:\nReal World Mapping: Possessing sole authorization from China Giant Panda Protection Research Center, Panda.Earth is able to collect and access hundreds of real panda data and maps to make them readily available to the blockchain network. This makes the platform the premier decentralized database for real-world panda facts and the number of these digital giant pandas in the world is only 100.\nUnique Genetic Algorithm: Using a proprietary genetic algorithm based on real-world genetic output, every offspring panda in the game will be based on genetic algorithms to obtain the genetic characteristics of the pandas. Core data regarding all genetic output are based on smart contracts to ensure fairness and uniqueness of every panda in the world, making the game a truly collectible game for gamers.\nRarity: According to WWF statistics, the total number of wild pandas is around 1864 at best. Panda.Earth’s ultimate mission is the protection of giant pandas, combining the changing trends of the natural environment, coding them into smart contracts alongside the total number of digital giant pandas, the game affords a new level of collectible collection, rewarding diligent gamers for collecting rare digital panda. Because the real pandas are precious animals in the world, so are these crypto-pandas.\nCommunity Autonomy: Panda.Earth team has developed basic rules and a governing logic for the world. These rules are constantly being updated based on feedback from the community to enrich gameplay experience. Panda.Earth’s autonomous smart contract introduces a myriad of variable gameplay factors from the real world into this universe to properly simulate the living conditions of giant pandas.\nEmerging ERC-721 Exchange: With ERC-721 , crypto pandas will be more like “ collectibles ” during collection, breeding, and trading. Cryptopandas can be exchanged with other digital collections using the ERC-721 protocol (non-fungible tokens) and others. However, pricing constraints are determined by player preferences and market demand for the value of each giant panda. Through smart contracts and side-chain technologies, non-fungible tokens can be circulated cross-chain and cross-platform. The Panda.Earth team believes this is the direction of future digital assets.\nPanda.Earth is also committed to public welfare. The platform will integrate the knowledge of giant pandas in blockchain games and propagate educative information on living conditions, propagation conditions, and distribution. This has been designed to assist the general public access readily available information on giant pandas and drive awareness about them and other endangered species\nPanda.Earth’s Featured Gameplay\nPanda.Earth offers an innovative and unique gameplay feature including:\nCollection and Reproduction: Through a unique genetic algorithm, each crypto panda uses its unique genes and personality to directly influence the quality of its offspring. Breeding between pandas of different personalities is highly encouraged and incentivized – there will even be extremely treasured panda babies.\nCirculation of Value: ERC-721 features not only enables Panda.Earth to populate the world conveniently, but also facilitates a cross-platform exchange of assets including CryptoKitties and other digital assets can be directly exchanged with them. This creates a tangible and sustainable gaming ecosystem for players. Because of games like CryptoKitties and Panda.Earth are both in ERC-721, users can seamlessly exchange Kitties for Pandas through Panda.Earth’s novel implementation of ERC-721 features.\nSimulate Business Operations: In addition to trading and breeding, Panda.Earth will introduce groundbreaking gaming concepts based on “territory”. Players will receive “ bamboo ” by through the acquisition of territory. Bamboos are convertible cash source for the gaming ecosystem that creates a perfect output cycle for retaining the transferable values of the ecosystem, thus ensuring the active and healthy operation of community players.\nAn Incentivized Platform\nPanda.Earth has decided to make its ecosystem readily accessible to the general public and will be giving a batch of cryptopandas free of charge to users who sign up for early-stage community building.\nTo learn more visit the Website: https://panda.earth/\nJoin the community on Discord – https://discord.gg/dGtKYu Learn more on Github – https://github.com/pandaearth Chat with us on Telegram: https://t.me/pandaearth Connect on Twitter – https://twitter.com/Panda__Earth Join the community on Facebook – https://www.facebook.com/PandaEarth.Official/\nMedia Contact Contact Name: Info Contact Email: info@panda.earth\nPanda Earth is the source of this content.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a good way to add alternatives to allocation, on the order of 3 percent to 5 percent of a portfolio. Many investors wonder when the right time will be to put some money in bitcoin. It's a question that financial advisors increasingly hear these days.\nYet advisors, for the most part, don't recommend investing in digital currency, or in the investment vehicles that have cropped up around it, at all. In fact, earlier this year, Merrill Lynch banned bitcoin buying across the firm. JP Morgan chairman Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a \"fraud\" (he later softened some of his comments), and Vanguard CEO Tim Buckley told CNBC in an interview: \"You will never see a fund from Vanguard on bitcoin.\"\nThere's no doubt that bitcoin has been wildly volatile, so for now, many advisors apparently remain wary and urge investors to avoid cryptocurrency investments altogether.\nLex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research, thinks that is a big mistake.\n\"Cryptocurrency is very controversial, but it's really here to stay,\" he said. \"And the underlying [blockchain] technology is really fundamental to the types of companies that people are building right now.\"\nIt's important for individuals who want to invest in cryptocurrency to first understand what it is and also how blockchain technology works, Sokolin explained.\nTo be sure, one of the most compelling things about cryptocurrency is actually blockchain, he added. To that point, Amazon just announced that its cloud computing arm is partnering with a start-up called Kaleido to make it easier for customers to put their services on blockchain.\n\"It's volatile right now, so you should not just go and fill your entire portfolio with cryptocurrencies,\" he said. \"But it is a good way to add alternatives to your general allocation, something like 3 [percent] to 5 percent of your portfolio.\"\nSokolin warned financial advisors that their clients are going to buy bitcoin whether they like it or not.\n\"So [advisors] can choose to say that this whole thing will fall apart and not get educated about it and not help [investors], but that's really irresponsible,\" he said.\nAdvisors need to take the time and brush up on the subjects of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology so they can properly address questions from their clients, Sokolin explained.\n\"Advisors really need to start to understand the basics of how blockchain works,\" he said. \"Start to understand why there are different cryptocurrencies.\n\"What's the difference between a payments coin, like bitcoin or ethereum?\" Sokolin added. \"All of these things are different, so advisors have to spend the time so they can actually help their clients make sense of this.\"\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/16/investors-buy-bitcoin-against-advisors-advice.html You are ignoring posts from sr20desr20de 1 Report Post Quick reply Reply with Quote:\nYou’re viewing a single post only.

At some point, however, maybe not soon but certainly on the horizon, the Bitcoin phenomenon will come to a head. It will either surge past all opposition to become the line way that people do business, it will fade out of existence, or it will come to some sort of alliance with the traditional financial institutions already in place. It is that third possibility that might be the most realistic, even as there are a lot of unknowns surrounding how all of that might work.\nInvestors looking down the road a bit certainly want to know Bitcoin will stand up as an asset should that eventuality finally occur. Bitcoin is already a difficult enough investment to grasp, which is why many people rely on artificially-enhanced trading programs such as Bitcoin Loophole to do their work for them in that asset class. Let’s play the hypothetical game and imagine that Bitcoin and the banks somehow work in accordance with each other. How will that look and what will the ramifications be for the investment value of Bitcoin. An Uneasy Alliance\nIt is a fascinating possibility to try and wrap your head around because the two entities seem to be diametrically opposed. Bitcoin is all about a lack of regulation and the freedom of average people to conduct their financial transactions as they see fit. The banks and credit card companies’ whole point of existence is to attempt to facilitate (some would say butt into) this process. But there are banks that are slowly incorporating blockchain-like features into their business, so they seem to understand that the public’s taste for Bitcoin-like financial freedom will not soon disappear. Would Bitcoin Still Be Bitcoin?\nThe major fear for investors, if the banks were able to come to terms with Bitcoin and perhaps even incorporate the coins into their own operations somehow, is that Bitcoin would lose its essence. A mass exodus from the coins by true believers of the revolution that Bitcoin was supposed to instill would be possible. And a precipitous drop in value might occur. The Stamp of Approval\nThe flip side of this scenario relates to the people who have been hesitant to even consider Bitcoin as a part of their financial lives. These are the kind of people who might be scared off by the outlaw status of Bitcoin. If the banks allowed Bitcoin into their operations, it might give it, in the eyes of these late-comers, an air of legitimacy and could herald in a whole new age of investors in the coins.\nConclusion\nIt seems as if there will be positives and negatives to the value of Bitcoin if it is subsumed into the larger financial picture. If nothing else, some of the volatility would conceivably disappear, and it would be a somewhat safer bet to be an investment property well into the future.

Separately, the rate is determined by mining complexity and network scalability, Dneprovskaya said. © Sputnik / Evgeny Biyatov Why Soros, Goldman Sachs, Wall Street Tycoons Embrace Bitcoin \"Bitcoin may grow in price in the long run, sometime in 2018, and it will be a result of international cryptoasset regulatory mechanisms being introduced, which will enhance public trust in cryptocurrencies at large,\" the analyst said.\nInvestor trust will in its turn propel demand for the “digital gold.” Separately, a rise in the price of bitcoin may be driven by an increase in the complexity of the mining process due to a limited offer of the asset, Dneprovskaya stated. As of today, roughly 17 million bitcoins of the overall 21 million have been mined.

The markets of major digital currencies continued to decline in yesterday's US and Asian trading sessions, but today bitcoin and the etherium are making attempts to win back yesterday's losses. It is interesting enough that in the current week bitcoin evenly declines, alternating downward impulses with attempts to locally win back losses. Today shortly before the start of US trading Bitcoin is trading around $8,200 mark.\nAn interesting situation occurs in the market of one of the main crypto-currencies Bitcoin Cash. As the crypto currency market began to decline, Bitcoin Cash began making losses at a much higher rate compared to Bitcoins and Ethereum. Today, on May 16, Bitcoin Cash fell more than 6 percent. Traders often describe the investment in Bitcoin Cash as a kind of speculative Иitcoin trading, because both in terms of gains and decline, Bitcoin Cash moves at a faster pace.\nAn interesting statement came yesterday from the head of one of the largest crypto currency exchanges. Yesterday at CNBC, BitMEX CEO Artur Hayes said that he sees the price of bitcoins in the region of $ 50,000 by the end of 2018, despite the correction that is currently observed in the market.\nFrom a technical point of view, after the bulls did not retain the $ 8,400 mark, we believe that the market is moving to $ 7,700, where the first strong support level is located.\nFortFS ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T17:23:57.040+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5996d6120c29d316ab67ab5601d1c7b07e9dbc51", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQibdhzJFXSBPUC7zqwOJ0ajkZTb7SMjvSvOAGOY7zG56IbXa5Wbm3_3vxyyG9X5DhI0mK6Zn3l8CPZoU.J__3.BhaI.Ss9encXZXVTene5tJGk8tY5vVWW", "site_full": "www.nasdaq.com", "site": "nasdaq.com", "site_section": "https://www.nasdaq.com/", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Daily Stock Market Overview, Data Updates, Reports &amp; News - Nasdaq", "title": "5 of the Most Ridiculous Bitcoin Price-Target Forecasts", "title_full": "5 of the Most Ridiculous Bitcoin Price-Target Forecasts - Nasdaq.com", "published": "2018-05-16T17:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/images/dreamit.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2975, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5996d6120c29d316ab67ab5601d1c7b07e9dbc51", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQibdhzJFXSBPUC7zqwOJ0ajkZTb7SMjvSvOAGOY7zG56IbXa5Wbm3_3vxyyG9X5DhI0mK6Zn3l8CPZoU.J__3.BhaI.Ss9encXZXVTene5tJGk8tY5vVWW", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Motley Fool", "published": "2018-05-16T17:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "5 of the Most Ridiculous Bitcoin Price-Target Forecasts", "text": "Last year was a true coming-out party for virtual currencies. In just one year's time, the combined market cap of all digital coins rocketed higher by nearly $600 billion, which works out to more than a 3,300% increase on a percentage basis. It's perhaps the greatest single-year performance we may ever witness for any asset class.\nBitcoin is leading the cryptocurrency revolution Leading that charge was the world's most popular cryptocurrency, bitcoin. Even though bitcoin \"only\" rose in value by 1,364% last year, which would appear subpar relative to its peers, it's risen from less than $0.01 in March 2010 to a current value of more than $8,500 per coin. That's not too shabby of a return in just a shade over eight years! In fact, a $1,000 investment in March 2010, assuming you found someone willing to part with that many bitcoin back then, would have been worth billions of dollars today.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nA good number of cryptocurrency investors view bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology -- the digital, distributed, and decentralized ledger responsible for recording transactions in a transparent and unchanging manner -- as revolutionary. After all, bitcoin was the very first digital currency to become investable back in 2010, and its blockchain offered a means of moving money from one party to another without using traditional banking networks.\nBitcoin also derives value from the perception that it's scarce . Protocols limit the total number of bitcoin that can be mined to 21 million coins.\nNowadays, bitcoin is aiming to become a primary medium of exchange. There isn't another digital currency out there accepted by more physical and online merchants than bitcoin.\nIt's also the most commonly paired digital currency when it comes to cryptocurrency investing. In other words, an investor often can't buy an obscure digital currency without first purchasing bitcoin and exchanging their bitcoin for tokens in a smaller cryptocurrency.\nIt's this first-to-market advantage of bitcoin, as well as these other factors noted above, that have some Wall Street analysts and strategists placing some very lofty price targets on the world's most popular token. How lofty, you ask? Let's take a look.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThe craziest bitcoin price-target forecasts While it's really a game of \"take your pick\" when it comes to wild bitcoin price targets, the following five estimates stand out as particularly mind-boggling.\n1. John McAfee: $1,000,000 by 2020 The wildest prediction of all comes from John McAfee, the outspoken former CEO of the antivirus company that bears his name. Using a prediction model, McAfee had originally called for bitcoin to hit $5,000 in 2017, and $500,000 in 2020. However, with bitcoin blowing past $5,000 last year and briefly eclipsing $20,000 per coin, McAfee revised his target estimate to $1 million. McAfee believes bitcoin's relative scarcity and growing adoption provides a path to considerable appreciation over the next two-plus years.\n2. John Pfeffer: $700,000 (no time frame offered) Last month, at the annual Sohn Investment Conference in New York, John Pfeffer, a partner at Pfeffer Capital, laid out his case for why bitcoin could run to $700,000 per coin. Pfeffer's price target relies on two primary catalysts. First, he assumes that bitcoin will replace gold, since it's considerably easier to store and is more secure. Secondly, he opines that bitcoin could replace some form of reserves at global central banks over time.\n3. Jeremy Liew & Peter Smith: $500,000 by 2030 Jeremy Liew, the first venture capitalist to back Snap , and Peter Smith, the current CEO of Blockchain, together believe that bitcoin has a shot at hitting $500,000 per coin by 2030. Chief to their thesis is the idea that growing mobile penetration will increase the number of non-cash transactions processed by these devices, driving bitcoin adoption. Liew and Smith suggest that bitcoin may one day account for half of all non-cash transactions, with the aggregate bitcoin user network growing to about 400 million users.\nImage source: Getty Images.\n4. Tim Draper: $250,000 by 2022 Also revealed last month was the $250,000 price target by 2022 from venture capitalist Tim Draper. Though hitting $250,000 might appear crazy on the surface, Draper has been right before on bitcoin. When the virtual coin was valued at just $320 in 2014, he predicted $10,000 would be hit in 2017 -- which it indeed was.\n5. Fundstrat: $64,000 by 2019 Arguably the loftiest of the shortest-term estimates comes from independent research firm Fundstrat, which has called for an end-of-year $36,000 target for bitcoin in 2019, with a peak of $64,000 during the year. Driving this increase in price, according to the company's head of research, Sam Doctor, is the expected uptick in bitcoin mining . Fundstrat believes bitcoin miners are the primary sellers of bitcoin, which provides a pretty clear downside buffer (i.e., a level where mining would be unprofitable) that bitcoin is unlikely to cross.\nMy opinion: These estimates are insane If you ask me, I'd suggest these price estimates are ridiculous. While I've certainly been wrong about bitcoin before, I don't see how any of these price targets are achievable given the hurdles bitcoin has yet to overcome .\nFor starters, bitcoin's blockchain technology is considerably slower than its peers when it comes to validating and settling transactions. With an average block-processing time of 10 minutes -- i.e., the average amount of time it takes to verify a group of transactions as accurate -- and the need for six validations per transaction, it takes about an hour for a bitcoin transaction to be completely settled. Meanwhile, some of its peers can complete the same process in a matter of seconds. The Lightning Network may offer bitcoin hope of closing this gap, but there are no guarantees.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nAnother issue with bitcoin is that it may never be broadly adopted as a medium of exchange. Around 40% of today's existing coins are believed to be controlled by just 1,000 long-term traders and holders. That removes nearly 7 million bitcoin from circulation, leaving fewer coins to be used for the purchase of goods and services. Likewise, with so many bitcoin controlled by so few people, the influence these investors could exert on the price of bitcoin is likely to keep larger merchants away.\nAdditionally, there are no traditional metrics that allow investors to properly value bitcoin. Sure, investors can look at processing speeds and daily transactions, but that doesn't tell us a whole lot about what bitcoin should be worth.\nAnd lastly, it also makes little sense buying into bitcoin when its underlying blockchain is the valuable asset. Unfortunately, virtual currency investors don't gain ownership in a blockchain by purchasing digital tokens.\nFeel free to call me a naysayer, but I don't foresee bitcoin coming anywhere close to these ridiculous price targets.\nBitcoin is overhyped: 10 better buys for you now\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Bitcoin Risks Fall Below $8K After 3.5-Week Low", "text": "\nBitcoin (BTC) bears have unraveled the minor rally in prices because Saturday and are currently looking to pull the cryptocurrency beneath the $8,000 mark, the technical graphs indicate. The bears’ comeback comes after bitcoin saw minor gains after the May 12 low of $8,204, but the bulls repeatedly failed to cut throughout the key falling trendline barrier. Consequently, bitcoin dropped to a 3.5-week low of $8,100 on Bitfinex before today. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,366 – down 4.7 per cent in twenty four hours. Daily chart\nThe above chart shows that bitcoin has dipped beneath the 50-day moving average (MA), now located at $8,290. As discussed yesterday, a close (as per UTC) beneath the 50-day MA would signal resumption of the sell-off from the latest high of $9,990 and may yield deeper sell-off to $7,800. The rejection at the descending trendline barrier along with a fall to $8,100 has reinforced the bearish view put forward from the short-term moving averages (5-day and 10-day), which are sloping downwards in favour of the bears. The escape from $8,884 to $8,100 has also established a falling top (lower highs pattern) – a (you guessed it) bearish setup. Whilst the 10-day MA has crossed the 100-day MA from above (bearish crossover), and also the relative strength index (RSI) is also biased bearish (below 50.00 and falling). Consequently, there’s a high probability that bitcoin will now go on to close today (as per UTC) beneath the 50-day MA and confirm a bear revival. 4-hour chart\nThe bad news (for the bulls, at least) takes on in the 4-hour chart. The downside break of the expanding station (bearish breakdown) indicates the sell-off from the May 5 high $9,990 has resumed and may yield a fall to $7,524 (target as per the measured height method). Note, the major moving averages (50, 100 and 200) are sloping downwards (bearish). View\nBTC will likely close below $8,290 (50-day MA) today and confirm a bear revival. The cryptocurrency looks set to test support at $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from Apr 1 low to May 5 high) and may go as low as $7,524 (expanding channel breakdown target) at the next 24-48 hours. An unexpected break above $8,884 would abort the bearish perspective.\nBear graffiti picture via Shutterstock\nThe leader in blockchain information, CoinDesk is a media outlet that tries for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It's a question that financial advisors increasingly hear these days.\nYet advisors, for the most part, don't recommend investing in digital currency, or in the investment vehicles that have cropped up around it, at all. In fact, earlier this year, Merrill Lynch banned bitcoin buying across the firm. JP Morgan chairman Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a \"fraud\" (he later softened some of his comments), and Vanguard CEO Tim Buckley told CNBC in an interview: \"You will never see a fund from Vanguard on bitcoin.\"\nThere's no doubt that bitcoin has been wildly volatile, so for now, many advisors apparently remain wary and urge investors to avoid cryptocurrency investments altogether.\nMore from Straight Talk:\nEven if bitcoin crashes, blockchain is the future\nMicro-investing builds wealth bit by bit\nHow to pick a new financial advisor\nLex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research, thinks that is a big mistake.\n\"Cryptocurrency is very controversial, but it's really here to stay,\" he said. \"And the underlying [blockchain] technology is really fundamental to the types of companies that people are building right now.\"\nIt's important for individuals who want to invest in cryptocurrency to first understand what it is and also how blockchain technology works, Sokolin explained.\nTo be sure, one of the most compelling things about cryptocurrency is actually blockchain, he added. To that point, Amazon just announced that its cloud computing arm is partnering with a start-up called Kaleido to make it easier for customers to put their services on blockchain.\n\"It's volatile right now, so you should not just go and fill your entire portfolio with cryptocurrencies,\" he said. \"But it is a good way to add alternatives to your general allocation, something like 3 [percent] to 5 percent of your portfolio.\"\nSokolin warned financial advisors that their clients are going to buy bitcoin whether they like it or not.\nGet this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.

With so many different finance and business apps , people of all ages and in various industries have the chance to trade in the traditional stock market. But investing isn’t for everybody, as it isn’t always the safest route to go for beginners—especially since 95% of traders fail at investing.\nAlready, people have confronted the volatility of investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, resulting in a return to real coins for financial promise. Financial experts claim that gold does well when other types of assets, like crypto, do badly, and it does even better when people lose faith in central banks. In today’s financial market, purchasing real coins as investments has a number of advantages and may even be the wisest, safest avenue for making a long-term venture.\nAdvantages of Buying Gold\nBuying a 1 oz gold coin or other hard metal coin has been a long-standing tradition for collectors, as these coins have special significance, real weight, and are often passed down through generations. Still today, there are a number of benefits to investing in gold coins, including the fact that gold is protected against inflation. With currencies like crypto being in almost constant flux, gold or real coins can be a more dependable investment.\nAnother advantage of buying gold coins is that gold tends to go up when other investments are declining, which will provide a stabilizing effect for people wishing to maintain a sound investment portfolio. You also don’t have to pay any capital gains tax on gold coins until you decide to sell. Furthermore, nobody will know that you have made these investments, which may or may not matter to you.\nWays to Invest in Real Coins\nIf you want to invest in some real coins to counterbalance the unpredictability of the stock market, there are several ways to do so. You will want to make sure that you buy the coins from a financial institution or a reputable dealer. If you decide to otherwise by the coins from an individual, you should have the coins authenticated first.\nIt is also important to know that you should generally buy “bullion coins,” which include the American Gold Eagle, Canadian Gold Maple Leaf or South African Krugerrand. Unless you are familiar and knowledgeable about collector’s coins, you will want to stick with bullion coins, as they are the standard. U.S. gold coins come in one-quarter, one-half or one denominations, and you will pay a higher price for them if you buy the coins less than one ounce each.\nKnowing the advantages and ways to buy real coins, people looking to make an investment can seek this out as an alternative to the somewhat unstable financial market.

Licensed Bitcoin Savings Accounts 16 May 2018 8531 Osato Avan-Nomayo · May 16, 2018 · 1:00 pm\nLedgerX has introduced a Bitcoin savings product licensed by the CFTC. The Bitcoin asset management platform has designed this new product to cater to long-term hodlers. The LedgerX Bitcoin ‘Call Overwrite’\nLaunched on May 15th, the LedgerX Bitcoin savings account enables investors to earn a fiat-based yield on their Bitcoin holdings. Instead of hodling in the hope of a significant price increase, savers can now earn revenue from a call overwrite. Usually, overwrite contracts are for assets that are deemed to be undervalued or overvalued. The trader overwrites calls if the latter is the case and overwrites puts if the former is the case.\nWith this investment technique, traders deposit Bitcoin in their LedgerX accounts. The trader then sets a call option sold at a longer date with an accompanying slightly higher strike call option. LedgerX already offers similar trading techniques, but this new product makes the process a lot less complicated.\nThe new Bitcoin savings account will enable less finance-savvy investors to earn USD premiums on their Bitcoin holdings. Traders have the freedom to select both the number of bitcoins and the premium rate. Options contracts on the new account will be offered in both three months and six months duration. LedgerX will also charge a transaction fee for the product. CFTC Regulations\nLedgerX’s new Bitcoin savings account is provided under license from the CFTC. The company has both the CFTC derivatives clearing organization (DCO) and the swap execution facility (SEF) licenses. In an interview with Forbes , Juthica Chou spoke about the importance of being a licensed Bitcoin company. The LedgerX co-founder and CTO said that the company’s products are all in compliance with statutory regulations. She also said LedgerX takes a deliberate approach to ensuring that it stays within the confines of the law.\nCommenting on the new product, Chou expressed optimism that it would become a favorite of the company’s customers. The LedgerX CTO based her confidence on the current trading pattern already established in the company. According to Chou, more than 70 percent of LedgerX’s trading volume comes from similar Bitcoin options contracts.\nLast quarter, the company also recorded a notional transaction average of $30 million per month. Another reason for Chou’s optimism is the Bitcoin volatility which makes call overwrites an attractive investment strategy.\nWill the LedgerX Bitcoin savings account encourage more long-term holding of the cryptocurrency?

[ Dan Frommer / Recode ] [Want to get the Recode Daily in your inbox? Subscribe here .] Facebook is throwing more money at defending its platform against hate speech and bad actors. The annual budget for some of Facebook’s content-review teams has ballooned by hundreds of millions of dollars for 2018, much of which will go toward hiring 10,000 people — including staffers and contractors — to work on safety and security issues including content review, roughly doubling the total in place this past fall. Earlier this month Mark Zuckerberg said his company would lose money on the political ads it runs in 2018, because it will spend so much on humans who will review those ads . Facebook has already disabled almost 1.3 billion fake accounts over the past six months, and will begin publishing more data about how many posts it takes down.

Samsung wants to limit damages to $28 million.

Both companies have waived a confidentiality requirement for sexual assault victims. [ Johana Bhuiyan / Recode ] Online grocer Good Eggs almost went bankrupt, but a $50 million investment from Silicon Valley VC Bill Gurley has saved its organic bacon. With the new funds, Good Eggs expects to slowly expand its reach — going after what it believes will be at least a $7 billion online grocery market in California alone. It will be competing for customers with local farmers markets, giant competitors like Amazon and Whole Foods and heavily funded startups such as Instacart, which has raised $1 billion in investor money.

Why is 'Bitcoin Jesus' Positive about Bitcoin Cash?\nVer is often called ‘Bitcoin Jesus’ as he was one of the early investors in Bitcoin. Jesus is now switching his preference to another cryptocurrency. (See also, Who Is Roger Ver, aka \"Bitcoin Jesus\"? )\nBitcoin Cash, which emerged last year as a hard fork of the original Bitcoin cryptocurrency network, is now the fourth largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization . The original version of bitcoin, often called core bitcoin to differentiate it from various forked out versions, suffers from transaction processing delays, making its adoption as a day-to-day medium of transaction difficult. (See also, Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash: What's the Difference? )\nRoger Ver rightly calls Bitcoin core software as \"slow, expensive and unreliable.\" Based upon the continuous development of infrastructure and new innovations being built on Bitcoin Cash, he sees more potential for Bitcoin Cash in future \"because it actually works.\"\n\"The economic path that bitcoin cash is on is the one that led to Bitcoin's original success,\" Ver said. \"I'm incredibly bullish on Bitcoin Cash for the exact same reasons I was bullish on bitcoin back in 2011,\" Ver told CNBC. \"Bitcoin cash works as money; bitcoin core, sadly, no longer does.\" Bitcoin Cash Offers Utility for Everyday Use\nMentioning Bitcoin Cash’s advantage as a robust and reliable medium of transaction that has great utility in paying for things, Ver compared it against the bulk of other cryptocurrencies that are merely being driven by speculation without offering any real utility. Ver is banking on this utility which will allow further adoption leading to an increase in valuation of Bitcoin Cash.\nOver the last month, Bitcoin Cash valuations have seen wide price swings on the upside. From the levels of $620 during early April, it almost tripled in value to $1,745 during early May, though it has given up gains partially and is now hovering around the exchange rate of $1,300. It emerged as the best performing large-cap cryptocurrency over the month beating other popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Ripple and Core Bitcoin.

[1] All of this goes to display that acceptance of Bitcoin Hard cash is increasing steadily. [1] Even though no one will deny that Bitcoin Hard cash is a extremely thriving and well known altcoin, there is nevertheless a lot of get the job done to be accomplished. [1]\nCorgan: Blockchain 'Bashing' Bitcoin In a long series of tweets summarizing the event, which ends May 16, Corgan highlighted what he described as \"cargo-cult engineering\" taking preference among speakers. [3] \"So we?re destroying the private key used by our Bitcoin (sic) wallet,\" they decided. [3] Kind of funny, but in reality what Laszlo Hanyecz did was crazier: he singlehandedly gave an actual value to Bitcoin.

[1] At the time, the value of 10,000 Bitcoins was $40, so in his mind, he ended up paying $15 more than what the pizzas would have normally been. [14] On the 22nd of May 2010, a developer called Laszlo Hanyecz bought two Papa John?s pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins, worth around US$40 at the time. [15] Laszlo Hanyecz (laszlo) made the first documented purchase of a good with bitcoin when he bought two Dominos pizzas from jercos for 10,000 BTC. laszlo had made contributions to Bitcoins source code in the past. [16] Laszlo Hanyecz, a programmer living in Florida, sent 10,000 Bitcoins (BTC) to a volunteer in England, who then spent $25 to order Hanyecz two Papa John?s pizzas. [14]\nThe latter thinks the guy who spend 10,000 bitcoins to buy 2 pizzas in 2010 was a fool, while the former knows that this guy was a pioneer in using a burgeoning new currency. [17] The current USD value of those two pizzas or 10,000 bitcoins is around $80 million. [15] He decided to reach out to people on a forum, asking the people on there if anyone wanted to trade 10,000 Bitcoins for a couple of pizzas. [14]\nBitcoin has taken the market by storm and the number of people looking to make transactions through this currency is increasing each day.

[18] Let?s take a look at some of the major ways in which Bitcoin is different from paper money. [18] Bitcoin is supposed to compete with fiat currency, by being the technical analogy to gold as money. [17] Ignoring the entire point of Bitcoin in the first place - to challenge and outcompete fiat as money - not to make people who hold it wealthy. [17] The users are in complete control of their money as there is no central authority to regulate the Bitcoin flow. [18] Bitcoin users that are looking to purchase large sums of bitcoin would probably opt for buying bitcoins with their bank account.

[19] As the original Bitcoin grew from 1 to 10, to 1,000 and 10,000 - why wouldn't one expand the blocks to handle 100,000 while working on the solution for millions? This appears to be what BCH chose to do, while BTC simply shut off the hot new website - but don't worry, it will be great once they build the new super infrastructure. [17] Bitcoin - whether BTC or BCH - isn't going to be replacing gold's special role as an insurance asset/currency of last resort any time soon, if ever. [17] The best way to invest in bitcoins is to buying bitcoin with Paypal when they are being sold for less than $10 per BTC as this will give investors a larger margin of safety. [18] There is still a long way to go before Bitcoin gets to its full potential.

[14] He said at that time he used Bitcoins because he didn?t think it had any value to it, which sounds pretty ironic now. [14] What the Austrian school of economics has been advocating for a long time is fully reserved banking based on gold - which is exactly analogous to what the Bitcoin white paper proposed. [17] Mainly due to the fact that Bitcoin is relatively new and will take the time to reach to its full potential. [18]\nThe currency can be obtained via Bitcoin exchanges or mining. [18] The race is reaching some limits, and it?s expected that with the fall of ASIC prices, Bitcoin mining would once again be heating our homes. [18] The entire process of Bitcoin mining has become a profitability race and only big corporations are able to mine new coins. [18] Al-Naji's passion for cryptocurrencies began with a bitcoin mining rig he built in his Princeton dorm. [15]\nThis article contains top 10 bitcoin facts for crypto users. [18] What?s more interesting is that even the most experienced Bitcoin users lack the most basic and interesting information about Bitcoin. [18] The fact that Bitcoin users are not supposed to reveal their identity is extremely handy as it provides protection against identity theft. [18] The miners around the world assemble blocks and are given mathematical problems to solve using Bitcoin algorithms. [18] The supply of Bitcoin is fixed, and this the major part which makes Bitcoin so volatile and takes its value so high. [18] Absolutely no one is buying Bitcoin as a store of value anyway.

[16] The delivery person was instructed to only deliver the pizza if Hanyecz showed him the first and last four characters of the string of code that proved he had made the payment. [14]\n\"No one is really using it the way it?s supposed to be used, as a currency,\" said Dan Sim, who accepts Bitcoin at his Lean Crust pizza shop in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. [21] A user of the BitcoinTalk forum wanted to order two pizzas and was asking if anyone could order it to be delivered to him in exchange for 10,000 bitcoins. [5]\nThe authenticity of each transaction is protected by digital signatures corresponding to sending addresses, allowing all users to have full control over sending Bitcoins from their own Bitcoin addresses. [22] What is Blockchain? Blockchain is a digital ledger in which transactions made in Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically and publicly. [22] If you look at permissionless blockchains, like the Bitcoin blockchain or the Ethereum blockchain, anyone can join the network, as well as write and read transactions. [5] While distributed ledgers existed prior to Bitcoin, the Bitcoin blockchain marks the convergence of a host of technologies, including time-stamping of transactions, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks, cryptography, and shared computational power, along with a new consensus algorithm. [5] Using a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain, BIFI is trying to create an effective, secure and environmentally friendly storage network. [10] If for example, you have 1 Bitcoin in your possession when the fork occurs, you'll still have that 1 Bitcoin, but you'll also be able to claim 1 \"new Bitcoin\" on the network that's running the \"new Bitcoin rules\" (since that coin didn't start out from scratch and is continuing the original Bitcoin's history).

Ethereum predicted to overtake Bitcoin this year\nFor the past 12 months, there have been those in the crypto world who have become obsessed with the flippening – the moment that Bitcoin gets surpassed by another cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization. It started back in June 2017, when ETH’s market cap was more than 80 percent of Bitcoin’s and rising by the day. Over the remainder of 2017, Ethereum market cap dropped off, while Bitcoin’s steadily rose till that ratio went all the way down to less than 20 percent in December. But throughout the opening months of 2018, there have been those dedicated to sitting on flippening watch . With Ethereum showing steady and sustained growth over recent months and Bitcoin as unpredictable as ever, many commentators are saying it is a case of when, not if, the flippening happens. From the horse’s mouth If there is one person who knows the crypto space well, it is Roger Ver. The serial investor was one of the early adopters in the Bitcoin space and describes it as “the most important invention in the history of the world since the internet.” If you think that makes him in some way partisan and “pro-Bitcoin” you couldn’t be more wrong. Ver is certain that the flippening is coming, and it is only a matter of months. He told UK newspaper The Independent: “Ethereum could overtake Bitcoin by the end of the year and Bitcoin Cash could do the same before 2020.” He feels Bitcoin is stymied by the increasing costs and transaction times that have accompanied the cryptocurrency’s rise in popularity. As blockchain continues to gain wider use and adoption, Ver believes that this pattern will only increase and that the world is already seeing that Ethereum is a better alternative. Is Ethereum ready? Scalability has always been one of the biggest challenges for any cryptocurrency, but there is a sense that Ethereum, with its charismatic young founder Vitalik Buterin, is facing up to these challenges more effectively. Developers have been working on innovative methods of database sharding, while off-chain transactions are another avenue being explored to relieve some of the burden from the blockchain itself. Also, read about Ethereum’s new consensus protocol called Hybrid Casper on cryptovoyage.net to see the significant investment Buterin is pouring into meeting scalability concerns head on. Does the flippening matter? While in certain quarters, the finance world seems to be as obsessed with the flippening as the sports world will soon be with the football World Cup, many more are treating the entire debate with a shrug of the shoulders. Does it really matter which out of Bitcoin, Ethereum or something else has the greater market capitalization? There are those who argue that the two cryptocurrencies are serving different needs and therefore it is not a matter of which is “winning or losing.” After all, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are seeing steady growth in market capitalization, and surely if that continues, both can be considered “winners.” Perhaps the most important consequence of the flippening, if and when it happens, is a conceptual one. It will demonstrate once and for all that cryptocurrency does not just mean Bitcoin, and that Ethereum is more than just an altcoin but is an increasingly important player that will shape the future of the cryptocurrency landscape.

Bitcoin Aussie System Review, Fake Bitcoin Aussie Scam Exposed!\nBitcoin Aussie System Review and Scam Investigation The Bitcoin Aussie System SCAM by Jasper Boyle is a fake cryptocurrency trading robot and thieving software. In our detailed Bitcoin Aussie System review, our staff will produce conclusive and unequivocal proof and evidence of malicious SCAM and foul play in the form of a get-rich-quick crypto scam which is targeting Australian traders and opportunity seekers. There is a reason why this is happening, and as we progress with our investigation we will explain exactly what the main problem is with the Bitcoin Aussie System and how it is a copied from other fake apps such as the Bitcoin Code. If you have received a “personal invitation” via SPAM email illegally soliciting you to join this trashy and fraudulent crypto app, you had best keep your distance as we have identified the affiliate fraud ring behind this latest get-rich-quick scam and they are relentless con artists with an insatiable appetite for picking your pocket. The affiliate links associated with this latest crypto app are also infected with a virus, so please refrain from clicking on any links. We will reveal the name of the name and identity of this thieving network in the most transparent and factual manner. Let there be no room for confusion or hesitation, the Bitcoin Aussie System SCAM is neither legit nor genuine, and it was devised by online promoters with the sole and malicious intent of defrauding innocent opportunity seekers and would-be day traders and stealing their money. Keep reading our detailed and informative Bitcoin Aussie System review to see how we exposed the crooks behind it and shed light on their dirty little operation.\nOfficial Website, Login Page, and Members Area : https://bitcoinaussiesystem.co/lp.php\nProof of SCAM Below is a screenshot taken directly from the main sales page of the Bitcoin Aussie System scam software. In it you will see a testimonial provided by one of the “new millionaires” which this new system has created.\nRight next to it you will see that same person begging for business on his fiverr.com profile where he explicitly states that he will “be your spokesperson with a green screen background”.\nMoving forward, below is the testimonial section of the Bitcoin Aussie System app. All of these profiles are fake and ripped off the internet without any form of legal written consent.\nThe staff and management here at Binary Scam Alerts has heard that some advertisers view this form of activity as mainstream and legitimate. We beg to differ and do not condone or accept this form of deceptive and misleading advertising tactic since we found it to be an extremely effective baiting tactic which is totally fallacious.\nWhat Is Bitcoin Aussie System and Who Is Jasper Boyle? It is being advertised as a game-changing software putting power directly into the hands of regular people. Jasper Boyle is a not existent entity and fake persona designed to lend this fake app an aura of legitimacy.\nBitcoin Aussie System Review Bitcoin is making quite an impact on economies world wide, and Australia is no exception. That is how the sales pitch for the Bitcoin Aussie System scam starts, and the hype is just mounting by the minute! After that they continue talking about a democratized monetary system and a peer-to-peer ledger which is supposed to ensure transparency and security. Then there is a statement about how Australia is a “trailblazer” in the realm of bitcoin as it moves to regulate the cryptocurrency and legitimize it as a legal trading unit. So if you are ready to join the “Bitcoin Revolution” and start making money, the time to act is now as the Bitcoin Aussie System is the “way of the future”.\nIs Bitcoin Aussie System Scam or Legit Software? The Bitcoin Aussie System SCAM is already responsible for defrauding thousands of Australian traders and opportunity seekers.\nWhy Are Australians Being Targeted? This is happening because Australia is considered to be a rich Western country with many people who lack basic education and training in Bitcoin. So naturally it is a fertile breeding ground for online scammers and con artists looking to cheat people out of their money. In this case we see clicksure as the leading affiliate fraud ring endorsing this system.\nIs It Free? No it is not. Get ready to part with at least $250, and that money will be charged to your credit card by greedy offshore brokers looking to steal your money and send you on your way.\nFake Reviews We have seen a few Bitcoin Aussie System reviews, and we know that the people who publish them on their seemingly “legit” websites are affiliate marketers looking to get bribes in the form of affiliate paychecks.\nOther Viral Scams Trending The ones to watch out for are Bitcoin Trader and Maximus Cryptobot .\nIn Reality What we are seeing here is a classic get rich quick crypto scam designed to drain your money. We got all the classic tell signs such as hyped-up and exaggerated claims of easy money, fake testimonials, inflated bank accounts, and outright lies and fabrications. Make sure to avoid at all costs.\nForex EA’s, Signals, and Crypto Robots Just today we have seen 4 launches of new automated trading systems and they are all SCAMS designed to steal your money in a New York minute and feed the advertisers and brokers. Fortunately our staff compiled a short list of consistent money-making apps which have endured the test of time. These are proudly showcased in our recommended section.\nBitcoin Aussie System Review Conclusions and Summary The Bitcoin Aussie System SCAM by Jasper Boyle is a blacklisted automated crypto app (AKA crypto robot). It is in many ways similar to other scam trading robots our staff has exposed, and it is for that reason that we are warning all our members and viewers in regards to this fraudulent software. It also comes as no surprise that the crooks behind this latest sham are also involved in the daily maintenance and operation of HYIPs, Ponzi Schemes, Fake ICO’s and Faucets. Chances are if you have invested your credit card will be overcharged and you should be aware of other complaints we have received such as identity theft, credit card fraud, software manipulation (rigged and set to lose), and tax evasion. In a nutshell, it’s plain to see that our Bitcoin Aussie System review has shed light and exposed this latest crypto scam. In light of our conclusive and indisputable findings, we have to choice but to advise all our members and viewers to seek alternative and more genuine investment channels.
