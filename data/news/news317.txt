Is Bitcoin Really About to Take off to the Moon or Has It Been Shot Down?\nMeanwhile, Litecoin slipped 0.2% to $159.04.\nThe cryptocurrency markets were under pressured since the beginning of the week after Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett called Bitcoin “rat poison” and that the “asset itself is creating nothing”.\nCo-founder of Microsoft Bill Gates echoed Buffet’s comment and said he would bet against Bitcoin if he could.\nReports that Nasdaq chief executive Adena Friedman is bullish on cryptocurrency received some attention on Thursday.\nIn an interview with CNN, Friedman said that cryptocurrency feels like the “right next step in the space of currency” because a “globalized payment mechanism is a natural fit for the cross-border digital economy.”\n“How it evolves and which of the cryptocurrencies may or may not be the one that ultimately gets embraced, I think that really the jury is still out on that. But I do think the idea of a more globalized payment mechanism that is more efficient than what we have today allows for money to transfer across countries and certainly supports the Internet economy.”\nFriedman then noted that she believes blockchain technology will first take place gradually in markets with less regulation or high levels of inefficiency before being adopted in the global financial system.\n“The first uses of the blockchain will be in the less regulated markets, less efficient markets, more bespoke markets. Test it out, show that it works, demonstrate the efficiency in the Nasdaq private market or in the fund industry,” Friedman said. “It takes a village to make it work, but people are going to be highly motivated if we show that the use cases bring a lot of efficiency.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "warren buffett warren buffett warren buffett bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "adena friedman adena friedman adena friedman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway berkshire hathaway berkshire hathaway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasdaq nasdaq nasdaq click", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft microsoft microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cnn cnn cnn click", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T10:01:34.065+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a6b142468502b0040f7b6deca6de05aad7a312dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTZfrUXhh7ec55B8CvAdPcs-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "What if you forget your bitcoin wallet password？", "title_full": "What if you forget your bitcoin wallet password？", "published": "2018-05-10T09:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 18, "participants_count": 18, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a6b142468502b0040f7b6deca6de05aad7a312dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTZfrUXhh7ec55B8CvAdPcs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EditorX", "published": "2018-05-10T09:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "What if you forget your bitcoin wallet password？", "text": "I don't want to imagine it because it's so horrible.\nIf I made a Bitcoin wallet, I would write down the private key in my notebook.\nThen, if my house isn't robbed, I won't lose my wallet key.\nAlways remember.

While most aren’t as famous as Satoshi’s Times headline of January 3 2009, each one will live for as long as bitcoin does, testaments to mankind’s obsession with steganography, spam, and unorthodox marriage proposals. Also read: No, There Isn’t Child Porn on the Bitcoin Blockchain The Bitcoin Blockchain Is Riddled with Messages There are six ways to encode messages in the bitcoin blockchain, using such fields as the coinbase parameter and OP_RETURN. Over the years, every single one of these has been used to encode cryptic messages, some frivolous, some practical, and some extremely dubious . For example, bitcoin miners have used this ability to signal support for protocol changes such as the acceptance of Segwit. The message that started it all You don’t have to be running a bitcoin miner to encode your own messages in the blockchain for all eternity – or for as long as humanity exists, for even if bitcoin were to inconceivably die, copies of the blockchain would remain. With over 100,000 backups distributed around the world, someone’s bound to retain a copy. There are detailed guides to encoding your own messages in the blockchain. Alternatively, for those who don’t relish setting up a Bitcoin Core client, Eternity Wall does all the hard work to deliver “messages lasting forever”. It promises “Even if this site goes down or disappears, your message is guaranteed to persist [in the bitcoin blockchain] for generations to come.” Memorable Messages Buried in the Blockchain As Nic Carter recently pointed out , there are at least six marriage proposals embedded in the bitcoin blockchain. In keeping with tradition, all appear to have been posted by men. Whether their significant others ever saw the messages while idly parsing hexed blockchain data is unknown. These inscriptions – plus many more – can be found simply by typing the desired keyword or phrase into Blockchair’s blockchain explorer . Predictably, adding profanities to the blockchain has proven more popular than marriage proposals. The N-word has appeared over 60 times to date, most of which surface in the bitcoin cash blockchain for some reason. The F-word appears over 1,000 times, around the same number of times as “Satoshi”. By default, messages that are encoded in the blockchain don’t stand out – the human eye isn’t programmed to decode hexadecimal – but a number of tools and projects have been developed to unshroud the mysteries that lie within the bitcoin ledger. Messages from the Mines A Florida design agency has created an interactive art installation for decoding blockchain messages and bringing them to life. Messages from the Mines reveals the “cryptic poems, ASCII art, signatures, eulogies and more” that form “a creative misuse of the Bitcoin transaction protocol, a form of digital graffiti…cultural artifacts forever embedded in one of the most contemporary digital technologies.” Ascii art revealed by Messages from the Mines Real world graffiti fades through time or is pressure washed into oblivion by killjoy municipal departments. But on the blockchain, every inscription, no matter how profound, political, or crude, remains forever, free from censorship, just as bitcoin was made to be. https://news.bitcoin.com/a-brief-history-of-hidden-messages-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain/?utm_source=OneSignal%20Push&utm_medium=notification&utm_campaign=Push%20Notifications ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T09:35:10.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b39f95d9980109bc7c769f0cb84a1931d6efcd9d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYgF_smZ_DfUUjf2prsBzjFiW7wWdHenCjVSumgM9mMhDEPyqMnwXYz1wLrtQB43sJhfp.5qrjYkLrdche507WB1MhoC6RqaZDYSbytTn_Bj3LIS1rmh.iiugxOPQU3Iju9FJoLgJ.OMWese11ibRV", "site_full": "www.wesrch.com", "site": "wesrch.com", "site_section": "http://www.wesrch.com/RSS_feed/rss_feed_press_release.php", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "WeSRCH.com: Latest Press Release", "title": "Get more information about bitcoin mining", "title_full": "Get more information about bitcoin mining", "published": "2018-05-10T09:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.wesrch.com/assets/images/logo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 18562, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b39f95d9980109bc7c769f0cb84a1931d6efcd9d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYgF_smZ_DfUUjf2prsBzjFiW7wWdHenCjVSumgM9mMhDEPyqMnwXYz1wLrtQB43sJhfp.5qrjYkLrdche507WB1MhoC6RqaZDYSbytTn_Bj3LIS1rmh.iiugxOPQU3Iju9FJoLgJ.OMWese11ibRV", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-10T09:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Get more information about bitcoin mining", "text": " Get more information about bitcoin mining Thomas Shaw 9th-May-2018 11\nIn easy terms we can define Bitcoin mining because the approach of adding transactions for your ledger. The course of action aids in confirming that adequate computational work is devoted to a block. The method also creates new Bitcoins in each and every block. Get more details about bitcoin exchange\nTo mine you need to check out the transactions in a block and after that confirm their validity. You should then choose one of the most current transactions in the header of your most recent block and insert them into the new block as a hash.\nJust before a new block is added towards the neighborhood blockchain, you need to resolve the proof of function issue. This is a problem that is definitely designed to make sure that the new block to be developed is tricky plus the data utilised in making the block satisfies the laid down needs.\nBitcoin makes use of the Hashcash proof of perform; hence, for you to resolve the problem you will need to make a hash.\nWays to build a hash\nWhen you know how to complete it it's incredibly simple to create a hash from a collection of Bitcoin blocks. The unfortunate point is that you can not work out the information by simply looking at the hash-you need to have to test different blocks.\nHashes are located at the blocks and also you have to combine them to prove that your information is legitimate. You will find some miners who try and take the simple route by looking to fake a transaction by changing an already stored block.\nYou should note that each and every hash is distinctive and particular to a provided block; thus, if you manipulate a given block, you change the hash. When a given miner runs a hashtag function around the manipulated block, the block is discovered to become fake, and you will not get any rewards.\nMining reward\nAny time you effectively solve a proof of operate, you get a mining reward. The amount of Bitcoins inside the reward depends on many components for example complexity in the issue. For you personally to make much more funds you will need to solve quite a few difficulties. You also require to possess higher speed computers to allow you to resolve as lots of troubles as possible.\nCurrently, mining pools have sprung up and are found on a really uncomplicated notion. Here a group of miners come collectively and function on quite a few blocks. Once the issue is solved, the miners share the rewards.\nConclusion\nUsing the proper facts and tools Bitcoin mining isn't only rewarding, it's also a enjoyable and protected solution to transfer revenue across the online world. To produce as significantly cash as you possibly can you may need to have the ideal software program and powerful laptop or computer hardware.aa", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas shaw", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T09:47:13.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "86bc27b3f17218f89b6e3226b90da83c51de12e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8c71yJUs090AMPADeQH5akAwq18JqA9Uvx1WoMEUM.aZA08erng7xfvHhAuR6PkiE-", "site_full": "www.timebomb2000.com", "site": "timebomb2000.com", "site_section": "http://www.timebomb2000.com/vb/forumdisplay.php?9", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Timebomb2000", "title": "INTL Bitcoin runs the new matrix...by design!

The company is known for its ads targeting kids, and this publicity stunt showcases how marketers are turning to cryptocurrency hype to tap into a younger demographic.\n\" Oscar Mayer is the gold standard of bacon because of our dedication to hand-selecting the best cuts and then naturally sugar curing and naturally hardwood smoking our bacon,\" said Matt Riezman, brand manager for Oscar Mayer. \"Add to that our proven expertise in the bacon-tech space, Bacoin is poised to deliciously revolutionize the cryptocurrency market.\"\nSilicon Valley to Reality HBO's comedy series Silicon Valley, which parodies startup culture, has recently featured bitcoin as part of an episode.

The rational for the move was the IOTA team's repeated threats against critics that reviewed its technology. The Financial Times covered the topic last week, and the bad press must have proven too much for UCL.\nThe academic institution's website now reads: \"UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies is no longer associated with the IOTA Foundation. In relation to recent news report, we reaffirm our support for open security research, as a prerequisite for understanding the assurances provided by any blockchain technology. It is inappropriate for security researchers to be subject to threats of legal action for disclosing their results.\"\nWikimédia France to Accept Crypto Donations Wikimédia France, the French branch of the global internet movement, has recently announced it will soon begin accepting donations in cryptocurrencies through a partnership with the Request Network Foundation.\n\"Blockchain technology has been a hot topic of late, and its adoption is exponential. Its decentralized nature, coupled with its security and transparency, makes it possible for unprecedented applications for NGOs, particularly in the management of donations, both on the part of the donor and the recipient.

conference May 10, 2018 489 Due to the consensus conference, which has always led to price increases in recent years, expected top analyst Thomas Lee this year, a significant increase in price of Bitcoin.\nFrom May 14th to 16th New York will be hosting the Consensus Conference organized by Coindesk. The conference, which focuses on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, is the largest conference of its kind in the world.\nAlready in recent years there have been significant increases in the price of Bitcoin during and after the conference. While nearly 2,750 people attended the conference last year, there are already over 7,000 this year.\nThomas Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global and former Chief Equity Strategist at J.P. Morgan, believes due to the increased number of participants and the much greater interest of the public that it can come this year to a significant increase in Bitcoin.\nAt the conference, many companies will present their new products, which should further boost the price of individual crypto currencies. However, whether it actually can become 70% as Thomas Lee predicts remains questionable. After all, the market environment is currently very favorable, because not only Goldmann Sachs has announced that it will enter the Bitcoin trade, but also the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange will soon offer a platform for bitcoin trading.\nFinally, it should not be forgotten that analysts with very positive or negative forecasts can also make a lot of press for themselves. The incentive is therefore very high to make extreme predictions. On the other hand, Thomas Lee was right that in mid-April, the first bottomed out and then it goes up again.

I still think bitcoin is a bad medium of exchange and a rubbish store of value . It's just too volatile and unhinged, and it'll always be that way. But bitcoin still has an important role to play... just not the role that most people assume.\nSara Hess and Eugene Soltas recently published a fascinating article on the life of Russian ponzi-scheme architect Sergei Mavrodi, who passed away last month. I found it interesting that in the latter part of his career, Mavrodi openly advertised that his schemes were pyramids, yet people still bought in.\nPonzi-schemer Sergei Mavrodi clearly advertised MMM's risks and promised nothing in return, yet still people bought in. If he didn't trick people into joining, maybe society genuinely needed him to manage ponzis? https://t.co/5RAzDFvTgx pic.twitter.com/pUghQJQB00 — JP Koning (@jp_koning) April 26, 2018\nThis got me thinking. I've always sort of assumed that ponzi schemers were just con men who fooled innocent people into giving up there money. But even after Mavrodi lifted his skirt and told the truth, people still flocked to join his schemes. Maybe there is a constant demand on the part of willing and informed individuals for ponzis. Which would mean that folks like Mavrodi aren't just conmen. Rather, society genuinely needs them to manage ponzi games.\nWe already knew that anyways, you might say. After all, Las Vegas exists, right?\nThe role that lottery and casinos operators play is certainly similar to that played by ponzi schemers. People take joy in gambling, and lottery operators and croupiers make sure these games run smoothly. Ponzis, lotteries, and poker are all versions of a zero sum game. If you win $10, it's only because someone else who was playing the game lost $10. Zero sum games are different from win-win games, say like stocks, bonds, and other liabilities including banknotes. Someone doesn't have to lose $10 on Google shares for you to be able to make $10 on Google. The underlying business generates income from its customer base and this provides each and every shareholder with a return.\nWhat differentiates one type of zero-sum game from another is the rule used for redistributing money from losers to winners. Ponzis and pyramids are early-bird zero sum games: the jackpot goes to the earliest entrants and is funded by money provided by the latest entrants. A lottery, on the other hand, awards a randomly chosen participant with everyone else's money. Being the last buyer of a lottery ticket provides one with the same odds of winning the jackpot as the first buyer.\nThe coexistence of different types of zero sum games indicates that while the public has an ongoing demand for the chance to win jackpots, it also values the way those jackpots are rewarded. Perhaps early bird game like a ponzis provide a different set of psychic returns than other zero sum games; getting in line early and looking back at all the late comers may offer a sense of satisfaction that a lottery can't provide.\nSociety has typically legalized lotteries while criminalizing ponzis and pyramids, although in Mavrodi's case there was some ambiguity since he cheekily advertised them as ponzis rather than trying to decieve the publi. Luckily for authorities, ponzis and pyramids are easy targets. They have central points of failure. An administrator needs to collect money from new entrants and then pay it out to older entrants. So there is a physical entity with an address that can be sued by unhappy participants or pursued by the authorities.\nBecause they are illegal, ponzis have been driven underground. Unfortunately, the delegitimization of markets can have perverse effects. For instance, street drugs are often mixed with dangerous contaminants, say like how heroin is laced with carfentanil, an elephant tranquilizer. If the drug market were brought into the open, it could be that producers would be pressured by market forces to provide a purer product and fewer users would die from accidental overdoses.\nThe same argument applies to ponzis. Those who play them have to rely on fly-by-night operators who may abscond with the funds at any moment, the ponzi collapsing before reaching its natural end. If ponzis were legitimized, it would be much easier to have a transparent and well-run ponzi market.\nLike ponzis and pyramids, a chain letter is an early-bird game, a type of zero-sum game that use entrance order as its redistribution rule. And like ponzis and pyramids, they are illegal. The Circle of Gold chain letter that began in San Francisco in 1978 and spread to the rest of the U.S. through 1979 and 1980 is a good example of the genre.\nIn brief, I buy an existing copy of the letter from you for $50, and simultaneously mail $50 to the name at the top of the list, for a total outlay of $100. I then make two copies (removing the name at the top of the list an inserting my own at the bottom) and sell them for $50 each, for a total of $100, thus breaking even. By selling the letters directly rather than sending them via the mail, presumably I avoid mail fraud. The buyers in turn make copies and sell them on, the chain continuing. Once my name starts arriving at the top of the list the money will pour in. The letter exhorts recipients not to break the chain.\nHODL is similar to the \"DO NOT BREAK THE CHAIN\" exhortations commonly found on chain letters. They're not wrong—if the chain holds, the money keeps flowing! https://t.co/Ha0qaJGWsC pic.twitter.com/xcgpW1OV25 — JP Koning (@jp_koning) December 22, 2017\nWhereas a ponzi relies on a central node—or operator—for managing the game's flow of funds, a chain letter decentralizes the role of operating the system. Any participant who has bought a copy of the letter is delegated the job of faithfully modifying their version of the ledger (by removing the name at the top and inserting theirs at the bottom), sending the $50 by mail, and then passing the updated ledger on. Lacking attackable central nodes, chain letters are more difficult for the authorities to shut down than ponzis.\nThere are still a few key flaws with a chain letter. The first is that everyone who joins the chain letter needs to leave their physical address. And so it is possible for the authorities to target participants by getting a copy of the chain letter, visiting their home, and shutting it down that way. To avoid this risk, many would-be ponzi players will probably choose not to play.\nThe second flaw is that chain letters are not secure. Each participant has an incentive to mis-copy the list and put themselves at the top, thus cutting into the queue. This lack of credibility hurts the chain letter's ability to propagate.\nAll of which gets me back to bitcoin. Bitcoin is not a win-win game. It is a zero-sum game that uses entrance order as its redistribution rule, or an early bird game like a ponzi, pyramid, or chain letter. The only way to get ahead is if a subsequent participant buys one's bitcoins at a higher price.\nBut bitcoin brings a few unique features to the table. To begin with, Bitcoin is decentralized. Rather than a lone administrator like Sergei Mavrodi handling the scheme, the ledger is maintained by a disparate set of nodes. This makes bitcoin much harder to shut down than a ponzi.\nChain letters are also decentralized, but Bitcoin doesn't inherit the weaknesses of a chain letter. Although there are many different copies of the bitcoin ledger, these copies are constantly being checked against each other to ensure that they are all in sync. This means that—unlike a chain letter—there is no way to budge in line, say by re-writing the bitcoin ledger in one's favour. And this improves the durability of bitcoin.\nBefore I bring this all together and make my case for bitcoin, there is one other early bird game I haven't got into yet: the speculative bubble.\nUnlike chain letters, ponzis, and bitcoin, which are pure early bird games, bubbles occurs on the back of an already useful asset, say like a stock or commodity. During the late 1990s internet mania, for instance, the return on an internet stock could be decomposed into two components: a fundamental component and a zero-sum game that was being played on top of the stock's fundamental value. Those playing a zero sum game by purchasing internet stocks didn't give a damn whether the underlying internet business made sense. No, they were betting that a late-comer would arrive to take the stock off their hands at a much higher price.\nTo a fundamental investors (say like Warren Buffett), zero-sum game players are a nuisance. The zero sum game that they are playing adds a wasteful premium to stocks, pricing fundamental investors out of the market. At the same time, zero sum game players are probably just as annoyed by the fundamental component of the asset they are buying and selling. Its presence dampens the jackpot that they stand to win.\nPrices provide useful signals to society. A zero-sum game that runs on top of an intrinsically valuable asset like a stock or a commodity distorts that signal. This can lead to wasted resources. Producers who decide to add capacity—say a new production plant—in response to a commodity's high price may only be reacting to the transitory mood changes of those playing that commodity's attached zero-sum game, and not a fundamental need for new supply.\nSo having said all that, let me finally make my case for bitcoin. Bitcoin shouldn't be categorized along with monetary instruments like bank deposits, coins, and banknotes. Nor does it belong in the same category as win-win games like the stock and bond market. No, bitcoin should be grouped with other zero-sum games such ponzis, pyramids, speculative bubbles, and chain letters.\nBut this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It should be embraced.\nCity planners build bike lanes in order to prevent the dangerous mixing of cars and bikes. Likewise, if people who are playing zero-sum games on top of regular stocks and commodities can be diverted into bitcoin (and other pure early bird games like ponzis) instead, maybe that would make for a more ordered financial system. Early-bird games that are played on top of useful assets taint their price, and thus play havoc with the signal this price provides. But bitcoins, ponzis, and chain letters have no use as commodities, so there is no underlying real good that can be contaminated by the presence of zero-sum game players.\nWhen criminalization drives ponzis underground, the supply of trustworthy ponzis shrinks and the supply of untrustworthy ones increases. Bitcoin has a role to play here. It is an open system. The set of rules that governs it are automatic and available for all to see, unlike the closed books of a ponzi administrator. There is no way for the system operator to abscond with everyone's funds. So bitcoin is a safer zero-sum game than an illegal ponzi. If people have a genuine need to play zero-sum games, shouldn't they at least be able to play a good one?\nIs bitcoin expensive? Sure. Lots of electricity is required to ensure the integrity of bitcoin. But if bitcoin has managed to displace a bunch of poorly-run underground ponzis and pyramids, as well as reducing the signal-destroying participation of zero-sum game players in traditional financial markets, maybe the expense was worth it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mavrodi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sara hess", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eugene soltas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jp koning", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sergei mavrodi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mmm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T09:13:50.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4fe2b0798a8098571d4d63e62076602a8f8ba5d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhOdvSUyHaxcDnXw8Tpm7N74-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-10T09:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4fe2b0798a8098571d4d63e62076602a8f8ba5d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhOdvSUyHaxcDnXw8Tpm7N74-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-10T09:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 10, 2018 WEB Bitcoin Cash -Rising wedge takes it to 1250 USD TradingView Bitcoin Cash / U.S. Dollar (BITFINEX:BCHUSD).

Before diving into the process, you may be wondering what is cold storage? In simple terms, cold storage refers to keeping your Bitcoin Core (BTC) completely offline. Cold storage, also known as a cold storage wallet, is the opposite of a hot wallet where your BTC is kept online. Since Bitcoin Core is a digital asset, keeping them online increases your risk or attack surface for having your bitcoin stolen when kept online using a custodial service. By keeping your bitcoin in cold storage, at https://wiki.bitcoin.com/w/Cold_storage your attack surface is greatly diminished. (Update: Bitcoin Core is less usable as money due to much higher fees and delayed transaction times.\nThe Core team has also expressed an interest in keeping these fees high since they view BTC as a “store-of-value” and not something to be transacted on a daily basis. In contrast, Bitcoin Cash’s transaction fees cost pennies and payments can be validated even with zero confirmations. These facts make BCH the ideal cryptocurrency for sending and receiving money anywhere in the world.) Getting started. The first step to getting your Bitcoin Core into cold storage is creating an offline Bitcoin address. This address will have both a public and private key-pair which never goes online (until you’re ready to spend it). With this guide, we will show you how to make a free cold storage wallet using the paper wallet method. Setting up a paper wallet. Setting up your cold storage paper wallet is fairly simple and requires very little technical knowledge. The first step will be to go to the Bitcoin.com paper wallet tool here at https://tools.bitcoin.com/paper-wallet/ .\nBefore doing anything else, while on this page you will want to save it locally to your computer. To save a web page to your local machine, press Ctrl-S and save the file as a complete webpage (to your desktop for example). After saving, simply close out the open Bitcoin.com paper wallet tool page. Then disconnect your computer from the internet; don’t worry, you only need it offline temporarily for this task. After disconnecting from the internet, open the saved file (on your desktop). Move your mouse around on the page and/or type some random characters into the text box to create extra entropy (randomness). By doing this, you create a random Bitcoin address that has both a public and private key-pair. Since you saved the file locally and are not connected to the internet, the Bitcoin address you created was done completely offline. Print the page.\nThe next step is making an offline copy of your Bitcoin address which you can later load with Bitcoin for a complete cold storage solution. While on the locally saved paper wallet page, while still disconnected from the internet, click on the Print button. Warning: before printing the page, make sure your printer is also offline (not connected to the internet through Wi-Fi for example). Once you are sure, print the page. Congratulations, the hard part is over! You have now created an offline Bitcoin address and made a hard copy of it locally for safekeeping.

Indeed, the growing interest of financial institutions in trading Bitcoin is transforming the cryptocurrency market. Meanwhile, experts are already debating whether retirement plan sponsors should include Bitcoin in 401(k) plans.\nBig Money Players are Replacing Retail Bitcoin Investors The theory that big financial institutions are reshaping the market is gathering steam. In an article entitled \"Bitcoin frenzy settles down as big players muscle into market,\" Reuters describes the changes occurring in the market, stating:\nThe cryptocurrency landscape has indeed changed. Mom-and-pop investors who drove bitcoin's skyrocket rise in 2017 have been pushed aside by government bans on trading, and replaced by cryptocurrency funds, wealthy individuals and established financial firms.\nAccording to the Reuter's article, the advent of new OTC (over-the-counter) exchanges and platforms managed by big digital asset traders, such as Octagon Strategy, Circle, Cumberland, and Kraken, is also contributing to a reduction in market volatility.\nCrypto Funds to Flood the Market A recent Thompson Reuters survey, which included more than 400 of its clients, determined that one in five financial businesses plan to start trading cryptocurrencies within the next few months.\nFor example, hedge funds focusing on cryptocurrencies more than doubled in the four months before February 15th, reaching a record high of 226, according to data from Autonomous NEXT, a leading research provider in the financial sector. In this regard, Reuters reported :\nAssets under management hit between $3.5 and $5 billion, according to the Autonomous NEXT.\nA growing number of influential financial industry actors contemplate joining the cryptocurrency bandwagon. For instance, Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman, in a recent CNBC interview, said , \"Certainly Nasdaq would consider becoming a crypto exchange over time.\"\nExperts believe that big money players will make the crypto market less volatile and more liquid.\nA more stable and mature Bitcoin will undoubtedly make it more attractive to financial institutions and could trigger them to start designing saving instruments for 401K plans in Bitcoin.\nIn effect, discussions as to whether Bitcoin has a place in the retirement plan space have already started. For example, Charles Hodge, Investment Services Consultant at Milliman, discusses in his paper, \"Bitcoin: Should plan sponsors consider it for retirement plans,\" whether Bitcoin would be a suitable investment vehicle for retirement plans. He concludes that, at present, blockchain technology is already an attractive investment opportunity. However, he says, \"At this time, Bitcoin and other currencies are not appropriate for retirement sponsors.\"\nNotice, however, that the firm BitcoinIRA claims to have processed USD 300 million in the last 12 months.\nWhat influential forces do you foresee changing the cryptocurrency landscape?

Today’s post will be a review of Bitcoin’s trend from its beginning until now.\nWhen you look at the changes in the market price since 2009, you will notice how fast the growth has been. With a comparison of its initial, top and current price, we will be able to get a general sense of how Bitcoin has developed. Observing such data will help us to enhance our insights to discern which cryptocurrency has potential to become successful.\nHere is the Bitcoin Chart. Its initial price was at around 135 USD in 2013.\nThe price reached its peak in 2017. Its highest price was 19,535 USD. That year, 2017, was also the time when the world began to talk about making its regulations necessary~~\nBelow is the price at present. The price is 8000USD today. Just few days ago, however, it was around 9,111 USD…\nAs you can see above, the ups and downs of the Coin market are quite big at present. The movement of Whales would also be a big part of that reason…But, I won’t go into too much detail about that. What I want you to note is that despite its rise and falls, the price of Bitcoin has been remaining above its initial price (135USD —8000USD). We can apply this same idea to ICOs. Although Bitcoin did not have ICO, its trend still gives us some sense of how a smart investment in the beginning will lead to great results.\nThe most important thing is information.

Hence, we expect the Consensus rally to be even larger than past years, wrote Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors.\nAccording to Lee, the prior Consensus rallies have yielded gains between 10% and 70%, meaning if this year does outdo the previous, bitcoin could surge back above $15,000.\nFundstrat\nWhile regulation is sure to be a topic of conversation, Lee said he doesnt expect this to hinder, what he sees as a pending rally.

With our best-in-class products and customer service, BitPesa can significantly lower the cost of payments from Ghana to other important trading partners such as Nigeria. Since Nigeria is a very important market for BitPesa already, Ghana was a natural choice for expansion, as these are the two largest economies in West Africa,” the company added.

Currently, Bitcoin is trading at: 9,344.3555, +305.20, or +3.38%, a s of 6:24a BST, the market is open\nPrices ranged within $9,200 – 9,300 for most of the trading day. Bitcoin and some of the other cryptocurrencies moved into the Green, some larger digital assets by market cap registered losses.\nA jury may sometime decide if ICOs (initial coin offerings) ought to be considered securities, adding their perspective to the fray fiercely debating the topic throughout the crypto world Wednesday.\nA jury will be called by a US District Court in which businessman Maksim Zaslavskiy faces fraud charges related to 2 ICOs that regulators allege were in violation of securities laws.\nMr. Zaslavskiy pleaded not guilty to the charges in December 2017, arguing that the ICO token sales did not constitute securities offerings, moving to dismiss the Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department case against him.\nA jury decision on whether ICOs are securities may set a precedent in the crypto space, but it might not, since the cases is complex, and the ultimate decision may be the US Supreme Court. Judge Raymond Dearie did not decide on the matter in preliminary hearings this week, instead opting to let the jury decide when the case goes to trial some time in Y 2019.\nEarlier this week, SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce told a crowd at the Medici Conference that “sandbox” regulation for ICOs will not work.\n“My fear that regulators will grab hold of the shovel and buckets is why I am often wary of so-called regulatory sandboxes. I am entirely in favor of finding ways to make appropriate regulatory allowances that clear the way for innovation to flourish. What troubles me about sandboxes, however, is that the regulator is typically sitting there next to the entrepreneurs,” Ms Pierce said.\nThe commissioner went on to say that, in her experience, all ICOs are securities. But, “Given the undeveloped nature of this area, I am wary of any blanket designation for all ICOs,” and urged regulators to “evaluate the facts and circumstances of each offering.”\nProfede ICO Launch Singapore\nPrior to launching their ICO, Profede – a highly promising new blockchain-based protocol aiming to revolutionize the professional recruitment industry will holding its first ICO presentation in Asia on 23 May 2018 in Singapore. The launch event is organized by ICO Event Company “Founder and CEO” and attendance will be by invitation only.\nProfede is a new blockchain protocol which aims to transform the professional recruitment industry by allowing professionals (“sellers”) to be paid for their work history and CV information whilst also ensuring full data protection.\nIn the Professional recruitment industry, data on professionals, their work history and professional experience is worth billions of Dollars to major corporations. However, recruiters and headhunters collect this data for free from professionals and sell it to their clients.\nProfede allows professionals to upload their data to their blockchain protocol, called the Profede Professional Protocol, which will then distribute data to partner platforms.\nProfessionals can control how much of their data is made public and what portions remain protected by the blockchain protocol. If a business (“buyer”) decides that it is interested in the data set of a specific professional, the buyer can pay a fee set by the professional to see the full data on work history.\nAs such, Profede allows for professionals to be compensated when their data is being accessed. On the other hand, Profede makes talent search for corporations more cost-effective as candidates (sellers) will have a public rating and businesses will be able to buy only the data information they require.\nProfede has recently signed a partnership agreement with beBee, a career platform that counts over 12 million users in over 100 countries. Profede is also in discussions with other platforms such as Adecco, Monster, Glassdoor, Freelancer and Randstad, to integrate the Profede Professional Protocol into their platforms as well.\nProfede aims to launch their final product on Ethereum’s main net in 2019. To date, Profede has exceeded its soft cap of USD 3 million in the presale period of its initial coin offering (ICO) and will start offering its token to the public from June 1st.\nProfede’s concept has already gained international media attention and its CEO – Juan Imaz is a successful serial entrepreneur with 3 exits that valued over USD 110 million in the online business field.\nFor further information on the event and attendance, please contact: [email protected]\nStay tuned…\nBitcoin Focused on Cracking, Breaking Key Resistance at $10,000 added by Paul Ebeling on May 10, 2018", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.addthis.com/help/api-spec", "http://www.heffx.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-peirce-050218", "http://www.g-bit.io/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "curre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maksim zaslavskiy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zaslavskiy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us district court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "securities and exchange commission and justice department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T12:18:04.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c95a185b1ce8f19d251289d64593602ca0fc9742", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21Rec8ynsrZtlRbEi_CySh3Ldm6wsBbAEgyPL4Mo5YkZw2NshFSf0sSrRjaZVe.4RjLl0Vs6A_g1E74ZutGYy6v4ipfMRZ0hd_I-", "site_full": "alzibluk.com", "site": "alzibluk.com", "site_section": "http://alzibluk.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Al Zibluk:  Just Keeping It Real", "title": "Bitcoin Wallet App Caught Stealing Seed Keys", "title_full": "Bitcoin Wallet App Caught Stealing Seed Keys", "published": "2018-05-10T08:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c95a185b1ce8f19d251289d64593602ca0fc9742", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21Rec8ynsrZtlRbEi_CySh3Ldm6wsBbAEgyPL4Mo5YkZw2NshFSf0sSrRjaZVe.4RjLl0Vs6A_g1E74ZutGYy6v4ipfMRZ0hd_I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Zibluk", "published": "2018-05-10T08:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Wallet App Caught Stealing Seed Keys", "text": "Al Zibluk Leave a comment Bitcoin Wallet App Caught Stealing Seed Keys\nThe team behind Electrum, a Bitcoin wallet app, has exposed a copycat product named Electrum Pro as a malicious app that steals users' seed keys.\nElectrum developers made their accusations in a document published on GitHub yesterday.\nThe document contains a step-by-step guide to decompiling a rival product named Electrum Pro that popped up online two months ago in March.\nObvious copycat is obviously malicious\nThe Electrum team has long suspected this is a scam product.

This decision comes after months of controversy that the pull request on the website's GitHub repository. The change now reflects the original description that includes \"fast peer-to-peer\" transactions and \"fraud protection.\"\nBitcoin.org: How it all Began The story of the controversial decision to change the description on the website began in December 2017. Bitcoin was experiencing a spike in usage which led to high transaction fees. Many users became disenfranchised with the transaction delays that accompanied the massive charges. The bitcoin price increased during this period, going as high as $20,000 USD.\nBy December 24, Bitcoin.org developers proposed an alteration of the website description to better mirror the current network situation at the time. The change involved removing taking away the \"fast\" from the \"fast peer-to-peer transactions\" and replacing \"low processing fees\" with \"fraud protection.\" The GitHub pull request to effect these changes was merged in January 2018 to the chagrin of Cobra Bitcoin, the website co-owner.\nBitcoin Winter Over as Fees and Transaction Delays Decline Beginning in March, bitcoin transaction fees dropped considerably and transaction delays also reduced. The average transaction fee for a 225-byte transaction decreased from between $40 and $60 to $1.90 . The number of transactions has also reduced by more than half from 400,000 to 180,000\nThere is no consensus as to the reason for the decline in the Bitcoin network demand. Some commentators attribute this to the massive drop in bitcoin prices from late December 2017 to March 2018.\nAccording to them, the price drop which exceeded 50 percent forced many investors to lose interest in the market. Other commentators say the adoption of Segwit and transaction batching protocols are responsible for the decrease in congestion.\nWith the fees and delays reduced, the Bitcoin.org admins decided to revert to the 2010 website front page descriptions.\nCommenting on the revert request , Cobra Bitcoin said that:\nThere was also not enough thought put into the original pull request since it's still showing the old labels for languages other than English. I propose we comprehensively change the text across all languages when the fees are very high on a permanent basis, which I think is some years off thanks the ecosystem taking better care to optimize usage of the blockchain.\nWhat are your thoughts on the bitcoin.org website description changes? Do you think the decline in bitcoin transaction delays is due to reduced network demand or the adoption of SegWit?

Although not below 9K but at least wait until bitcoin in sufficient condition down.\nwell, I think this is an opportunity to buy bitcoin in large quantities. well, the wait might be good, but we do not know when the price will go up, so we have to be prepared with that risk. Well, I think buying right now is a very good opportunity, but the risk is just the same.\nWell if you are thinking about risk then risk will remain the same now and day after now, but if you will be late then price will be high day by day then profit will be low and now in market bitcoin price has started to grow so dont wait any more to me it is perfect time to buy bitcoin and not to sell so early, until price become higher than our expectation, so buy now dont get late any more price is increasing but is not very high.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T06:19:32.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "50a2fe03d6f167106334d8d828f64b91c1a52725", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va722cKxmStm.0tq3YrtFBF0q3yrWGfLoQirmP9g8LYT8EFevbMe7ClhuWKXnT.S5DsQ--", "site_full": "bitcoin.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions -

There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $1,400 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair declined and tested another crucial support near the $1,240 level. Bitcoin cash price declined sharply below $1,300 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD must stay above the $1,240 support to avoid further downsides.\nBitcoin Cash Price Resistance There was an attempt to break $1,500 , but bitcoin cash price failed and moved down against the US Dollar. The price started a fresh downside move and declined below the $1,420 support level. There was also a break below the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,235 low to $1,481 high. It opened the doors for more losses and the price settled below $1,400 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nMore importantly, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $1,400 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair traded towards the last swing low and a crucial support at $1,240. Buyers appeared and the price started consolidating losses above $1,240. An initial resistance on the upside is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,481 high to $1,240 low. However, the previous support near $1,400 may perhaps act as a strong resistance on the upside.\nLooking at the chart , the 100 hourly simple moving average is positioned at $1,405 to act as a barrier for buyers. On the downside, the $1,240 support holds a lot of importance. BCH should stay above $1,240 to avoid further losses in the short term.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is now back in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD has reached the oversold levels.\nMajor Support Level – $1,240\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,400\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Technical Analysis – BCH/USD Breaks Key Support appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin cash price technical analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T07:57:39.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5334e03058d7679c5b501372298747b2a502140e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdIf78EiZBLzFDJawLa3gdT6UPDQv5g8wnPVlDc.WviLg--", "site_full": "cafe.naver.com", "site": "naver.com", "site_section": "https://openapi.naver.com/v1/search/cafearticle.json?query=i&start=84&sort=date&display=100", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "ICO Help (2): How to Create your Bitcoin Wallet", "title_full": "ICO Help (2): How to Create your Bitcoin Wallet", "published": "2018-05-10T07:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "KR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 89, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5334e03058d7679c5b501372298747b2a502140e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdIf78EiZBLzFDJawLa3gdT6UPDQv5g8wnPVlDc.WviLg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "anonymous", "published": "2018-05-10T07:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "ICO Help (2): How to Create your Bitcoin Wallet", "text": ">\nHello Everyone, this is Chris Kim from the Hilarium Block Chain Institute.\nChances are that you’ve heard of Block Chain, the technology that many predict is the future of humanity. All those technical jargons and unfamiliar processes, however, stop people from investing further. I hope my blog posts will help you to understand the Blockchain economy and the ICO process more easily. In my previous blog post, I showed you a way to create your Ethereum wallet. Today, I will introduce another way to create a Cryptocurrency Wallet: Bitcoin Wallet.\nAs I mentioned before, you either need Bitcoin or Ethereum in order to participate in any ICO. While the market trend is tilting towards making more Coins applicable, these two coins still serve as the standard coins for ICO. Here’s how to set your Bitcoin Wallet.\n1. Go to https//:blockchain.com.\nClick the ‘Get a free wallet’ button.\n2. Create your wallet by putting your email and password. Remember to not lose your password because there’s no way to retrieve it once its gone.\n3. Go to your email that you indicated for verification. After the verification process, your Wallet ID is created. Again, make sure to not lose it and keep it somewhere safe. I suggest you to store your Wallet ID in your private memo.\n4. Log-in by clicking the ‘Wallet’ on the up-left side of the page.\nYou’ll see the log-in page when you click the button.\n5. Enter your Wallet ID that you received in your email and password to log-in.\n6. After logging in, get your Bitcoin Address. Click the ‘Receive’ button to receive your Bitcoin Address. You can think of it as your account number.\nSave it on your memo by copy and pasting it.\n7. Set up Security At the main page, click ‘Security Center’ on the left category.\nThen, click the ‘Security Backup Paragraph’. Please read the details carefully.\nClick ‘Print Recovery Document’.\nThen, proceed to the next step by clicking ‘next step’.\nNext, you will see 12 words that you need to put in on a separate page. Please write down the words (2) on the page (1). Click ‘final step’ when you are done.\nAmong the 12 words, you will be asked to write down few of them that come under the categories.\nYou can close the page when you see the indication that you have finished the Recovery Backup process.\nYou will see the mark saying that the backup process is complete.\n8. Make a Password Hint. Create your password hint by using English capitals and numbers. Click ‘save’ button after.\nThat will be your Password Hint.\n9. Connect with your phone. After indicating your phone number, click ‘save’. If you’re using a phone in Korea, either 010 or 10 works.\nPut in the certification number that you have received on your SMS.\nCongratulations! You have now finished all your steps. Creating Bitcoin Wallet may seem a bit complicated and bothersome. You can still go through them if you follow the steps carefully.

This week's major bearish trend line with resistance at $1,580 was broken on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair also moved above the $1,600 resistance level, which is a positive sign in the near term. Bitcoin cash price is back in a positive zone above $1,600 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD must settle above $1,675 and the 100 hourly simple moving average to gain momentum.\nBitcoin Cash Price Support After further declines , bitcoin cash price was able to find support near the $1,460 level against the US Dollar. The price traded as low as $1,463 and later started an upside move. It traded higher and broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,702 high to $1,463 low. It opened the doors for more gains and the price traded above a few important hurdles such as $1,550 and $1,600.\nMore importantly, this week's major bearish trend line with resistance at $1,580 was broken on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair also moved above the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,702 high to $1,463 low. These all are positive signs since the price is now well above the $1,600 level. At the moment, buyers are struggling to place the price above $1,650 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Moreover, the $1,675 level is also a crucial resistance.\nLooking at the chart , it seems like a proper close above the $1,650 and $1,675 resistance levels may push the price further higher. On the downside, the broken resistances at $1,600 and $1,565 may now act as supports.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is currently flat in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is now well above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $1,565\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,675\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Technical Analysis – BCH/USD Breaks Key Resistance appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin cash price technical analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T07:49:11.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "66e357ade74ae51281d0502a259490c4f0514f7c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScP1WpxThAb4DKVhpdoMpILNyZXYYyvIKJNkvP3HEHqm", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin in Iran", "title_full": "Bitcoin in Iran", "published": "2018-05-10T07:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "66e357ade74ae51281d0502a259490c4f0514f7c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScP1WpxThAb4DKVhpdoMpILNyZXYYyvIKJNkvP3HEHqm", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-10T07:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin in Iran", "text": "Bitcoin in Iran\n/u/shenanigans38\nHi guys.\nMy dad is looking to send me money through bitcoin from Iran. i've been told that he should buy the bitcoin on localbitcoin, and send it to my wallet address.

While most aren’t as famous as Satoshi’s Times headline of January 3 2009, each one will live for as long as bitcoin does, testaments to mankind’s obsession with steganography, spam, and unorthodox marriage proposals.\nAlso read: No, There Isn’t Child Porn on the Bitcoin Blockchain The Bitcoin Blockchain Is Riddled with Messages\nThere are six ways to encode messages in the bitcoin blockchain, using such fields as the coinbase parameter and OP_RETURN. Over the years, every single one of these has been used to encode cryptic messages, some frivolous, some practical, and some extremely dubious . For example, bitcoin miners have used this ability to signal support for protocol changes such as the acceptance of Segwit. The message that started it all\nYou don’t have to be running a bitcoin miner to encode your own messages in the blockchain for all eternity – or for as long as humanity exists, for even if bitcoin were to inconceivably die, copies of the blockchain would remain. With over 100,000 backups distributed around the world, someone’s bound to retain a copy. There are detailed guides to encoding your own messages in the blockchain. Alternatively, for those who don’t relish setting up a Bitcoin Core client, Eternity Wall does all the hard work to deliver “messages lasting forever”. It promises “Even if this site goes down or disappears, your message is guaranteed to persist [in the bitcoin blockchain] for generations to come.” Memorable Messages Buried in the Blockchain\nAs Nic Carter recently pointed out , there are at least six marriage proposals embedded in the bitcoin blockchain. In keeping with tradition, all appear to have been posted by men. Whether their significant others ever saw the messages while idly parsing hexed blockchain data is unknown. These inscriptions – plus many more – can be found simply by typing the desired keyword or phrase into Blockchair’s blockchain explorer .\nPredictably, adding profanities to the blockchain has proven more popular than marriage proposals. The N-word has appeared over 60 times to date, most of which surface in the bitcoin cash blockchain for some reason. The F-word appears over 1,000 times, around the same number of times as “Satoshi”. By default, messages that are encoded in the blockchain don’t stand out – the human eye isn’t programmed to decode hexadecimal – but a number of tools and projects have been developed to unshroud the mysteries that lie within the bitcoin ledger. Messages from the Mines\nA Florida design agency has created an interactive art installation for decoding blockchain messages and bringing them to life. Messages from the Mines reveals the “cryptic poems, ASCII art, signatures, eulogies and more” that form “a creative misuse of the Bitcoin transaction protocol, a form of digital graffiti…cultural artifacts forever embedded in one of the most contemporary digital technologies.” Ascii art revealed by Messages from the Mines\nReal world graffiti fades through time or is pressure washed into oblivion by killjoy municipal departments. But on the blockchain, every inscription, no matter how profound, political, or crude, remains forever, free from censorship, just as bitcoin was made to be.\nHave you ever encoded a message in the bitcoin blockchain?

(Steven Senne/Associated Press) Bitcoin has been an exceedingly volatile commodity of late, with its price plummeting from around $20,000 in mid-December to under $6,000 by early February before beginning to rebound. That could scare away some investors but — and it’s a big but — Ricky Williams is actually more excited than ever about the cryptocurrency, and it has everything to do with Uranus. Lest you think Williams is guilty of a bum steer, he explained his reasoning to CNBC on Wednesday. It has to do with astrology, in which the former running back has taken a keen interest since his retirement from the NFL in 2012. “When I look at things, I tend to look at astrology to get insight,” Williams told CNBC. “The insight that got me interested in Bitcoin was the planet Uranus is about to enter into Taurus.” The 1998 Heisman Trophy winner claimed that Uranus “is about revolution; it’s about a change in the way we do things; it’s about innovation.” For its part, Taurus “is about resources and finances.” Williams may be onto something — after all, the website cafeastrology.com says, “Uranus is forward-looking.” Put that characteristic together with a money-related zodiac sign such as Taurus, and it’s no wonder the former Saints and Dolphins player thinks this celestial convergence is “going to totally change the way we view and understand” our finances. “I think as people are starting to become disillusioned with our institutions, that things like blockchain and cryptocurrency, it’s the perfect time for them to catch fire and really change the way we do things,” Williams said. Astrology can’t make you rich, but it can make you better at being yourself which could make your life more fulfilling and that often includes less money issues.\n— Ricky Williams (@Rickthelaureate) May 9, 2018 To his credit, Williams is not simply talking about Bitcoin’s potential; he has put his money where his mouth is by investing $50,000 in it. “I had to get a little piece of that action,” he said, before adding, “I didn’t want to go crazy.” Williams hasn’t just been dabbling in astrology, either, he’s teaching classes in it and, for $300, will even give people 90-minute readings based on their natal charts. Of course, apart from his football career, he’s best known for a long-standing interest in marijuana, and he recently launched his own line of “salves, tonics and vape cartridges” that “harness the positive effects of herbs like cannabis in a more conscious and controlled way.” So even if the Bitcoin investment doesn’t work out, Williams has other potential sources of revenue. He told CNBC that he wasn’t overly concerned about the sharp ups and downs of the cryptocurrency, pointing to what lay behind his reasoning. “Especially with the planet Uranus and change, [it’s] always going to be volatile in the beginning,” Williams said. “But, still, it’s more of a conscious choice to contribute to the change. If I do well, then great. If not, I’ll still feel like I did my part to contribute to things moving forward.” Read more from The Post: Papa John’s tried to blame the NFL for bad sales.

Bitcoin has undergone a rough-and-tumble period since the weekend.\nThe currency had incurred several price hikes of $100 or more to bring it to a Sunday total of $9,800. The currency dropped by $300 to $9,500 within 24 hours, then fell to $9,300 and $9,100 respectively during yesterday’s early morning hours. Today, however, the currency has jumped back to the $9,300 mark, and the MIT engineers and Wall Street analysts of Trefis say that based on their interactive Bitcoin Price Estimator, the asset could surpass $15,000 by the end of the year.\nThe team points to the new Bitcoin futures trading desk from Goldman Sachs as the main reason. Additionally, the MIT engineers say that as more Wall Street players follow suit, mainstream acceptance amongst financial institutions will continue.\nThus, the overall price and value of Bitcoin will undoubtedly spike. In addition, many analysts – like BBC Apprentice winner and Bitcoin investor Mark Wright – disagree with Warren Buffett’s recent criticism of digital assets.\nAs a longtime opponent of Bitcoin, Buffett has stated he does not hold any cryptocurrency, and that he doesn’t understand how Bitcoin works. He is also “certain” that cryptocurrencies will come to a bad end.

Instead, you’re speculating – speculating that “somebody else will come along and pay more money tomorrow.” Investments need to generate a return. And nobody is at all clear on how to value these crypto-assets. This is noteworthy, of course, because it’s Buffet.\nBut I thought Fred Wilson wrote a good rebuttal on his blog where he points out that, while, yes, a discounted cash flow model isn’t going to be very useful in helping you determine value in this instance, what we are actually seeing is, “the creation of a new internet, built upon protocols that allow for decentralized networks to form…” We’ve talked about this many times before on the blog.\nSo where I stand on this debate is that I agree with both Warren and Fred. I don’t see crypto-assets as something I want to start putting a lot of money into right now because I don’t know how to calculate what the IRR may be. But at the same time, if crypto-assets are creating decentralized infrastructure that will one day power the “new internet”, I am positive this new internet will eventually create businesses that will fit into Warren’s definition of an investment.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Favc.com%2F2018%2F05%2Fis-buying-crypto-assets-investing%2F&t=ODYyOTVjNGYwNzUwYWMxYWFkOWU4NmViMGNhNTZmYzc4ZjI5NWJhZixWN29HdDVlWA%3D%3D&b=t%3Aq6J56CbdLUTOHhvoKh6ssA&p=http%3A%2F%2Fbrandondonnelly.com%2Fpost%2F173755881068%2Ftwo-sides-of-the-same-bitcoin&m=1", "https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Fwarren-buffett-buying-bitcoin-not-investing-110702015.html&t=YjE4NzQ3YjhjMmFmZTEyYmExZGYxMzExNzcyZGJjMGRmMGU5MTE3YSxWN29HdDVlWA%3D%3D&b=t%3Aq6J56CbdLUTOHhvoKh6ssA&p=http%3A%2F%2Fbrandondonnelly.com%2Fpost%2F173755881068%2Ftwo-sides-of-the-same-bitcoin&m=1"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "warren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "warren buffet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yahoo finance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T11:33:35.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a125488515d083e10e9ef6a20f004e012c739757", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXjvX6YlIHXgspgAXKqp42s-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "What happens to bitcoin? up or down?", "title_full": "What happens to bitcoin? up or down?", "published": "2018-05-10T06:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a125488515d083e10e9ef6a20f004e012c739757", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXjvX6YlIHXgspgAXKqp42s-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "exstasie", "published": "2018-05-10T06:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "What happens to bitcoin? up or down?", "text": "Quote: from: exstasie on May 09, 2018, 05:58:21 AM It's \"do or die\" time.

Bitcoin loves to hang off the edge of the cliff before breaking upwards. That possibility is still open; SL has not triggered. But it's definitely time to pay attention, and if we fail this level, you should consider cutting leveraged longs and hedging.\nWoohoo! Bulls held $9,000 and formed a spring! This is good news for two reasons. First, we are seeing impulsive bullish action off the lows, which usually means more impulsive behavior will follow:\nSecondly, the strong reaction off the local lows means we can be very confident that stop-lossing sub-$8,980 is the correct move.

While most aren't as famous as Satoshi's Times headline of January 3 2009, each one will live for as long as bitcoin does, testaments to mankind's obsession with steganography, spam, and unorthodox marriage proposals.\nAlso read: No, There Isn't Child Porn on the Bitcoin Blockchain\nThe Bitcoin Blockchain Is Riddled with Messages There are six ways to encode messages in the bitcoin blockchain, using such fields as the coinbase parameter and OP_RETURN. Over the years, every single one of these has been used to encode cryptic messages, some frivolous, some practical, and some extremely dubious . For example, bitcoin miners have used this ability to signal support for protocol changes such as the acceptance of Segwit.\nThe message that started it all You don't have to be running a bitcoin miner to encode your own messages in the blockchain for all eternity – or for as long as humanity exists, for even if bitcoin were to inconceivably die, copies of the blockchain would remain. With over 100,000 backups distributed around the world, someone's bound to retain a copy. There are detailed guides to encoding your own messages in the blockchain. Alternatively, for those who don't relish setting up a Bitcoin Core client, Eternity Wall does all the hard work to deliver \"messages lasting forever\". It promises \"Even if this site goes down or disappears, your message is guaranteed to persist [in the bitcoin blockchain] for generations to come.\"\nMemorable Messages Buried in the Blockchain As Nic Carter recently pointed out , there are at least six marriage proposals embedded in the bitcoin blockchain. In keeping with tradition, all appear to have been posted by men. Whether their significant others ever saw the messages while idly parsing hexed blockchain data is unknown. These inscriptions – plus many more – can be found simply by typing the desired keyword or phrase into Blockchair's blockchain explorer .\nPredictably, adding profanities to the blockchain has proven more popular than marriage proposals. The N-word has appeared over 60 times to date, most of which surface in the bitcoin cash blockchain for some reason. The F-word appears over 1,000 times, around the same number of times as \"Satoshi\". By default, messages that are encoded in the blockchain don't stand out – the human eye isn't programmed to decode hexadecimal – but a number of tools and projects have been developed to unshroud the mysteries that lie within the bitcoin ledger.\nMessages from the Mines A Florida design agency has created an interactive art installation for decoding blockchain messages and bringing them to life. Messages from the Mines reveals the \"cryptic poems, ASCII art, signatures, eulogies and more\" that form \"a creative misuse of the Bitcoin transaction protocol, a form of digital graffiti…cultural artifacts forever embedded in one of the most contemporary digital technologies.\"\nAscii art revealed by Messages from the Mines Real world graffiti fades through time or is pressure washed into oblivion by killjoy municipal departments.

His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.\nIn the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: how much digital cash does it really hold?\nTwo Xapo clients said it houses roughly $10 billion of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoins price, after all, is hardly steady.\nPatient Zero\nEven in the colorful world of crypto the cache is remarkable -- amounting to about 7 percent of the global Bitcoin supply. It would mean Xapo, just 4 years old, has more deposits than 98 percent of the roughly 5,670 banks in the U.S. But as a custodian its regulated differently. The Swiss subsidiary is overseen by the self-regulating Financial Services Standards Association, which audits members to ensure they comply with anti-money-laundering rules. Xapo serves U.S. customers through a Delaware corporation thats registered with the U.S. Treasury Departments Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and is licensed in several states.\nThe outsize holdings underscore the faith that Casares -- a serial entrepreneur nicknamed Patient Zero for stirring Silicon Valleys interest in Bitcoin -- has garnered among his acolytes and at major crypto investment firms, such as Grayscale and CoinShares.\nXapo has a network of underground vaults on five continents.Photographer: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images\nEveryone who isnt keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo, said Ryan Radloff of CoinShares, which has more than $500 million of Bitcoin stored at Xapo. You couldnt pay me to keep it with a bank.\nXapos billionaire backers include LinkedIn Corp. co-founder Reid Hoffman and former Wall Street trader Mike Novogratz, whos in the process of setting up his own cryptocurrency merchant bank. Their bet is that Bitcoin is here to stay, and so is its biggest scourge, theft.\nThe first rule of owning Bitcoin is to securely keep your private key -- the code that lets you spend your coins. If thieves get it, they can loot your holdings in an instant, with no hope of recovery. Putting keys on a device connected to the Internet is both convenient and perilous: Hackers have proven adept at obtaining them from afar.\nThe most popular alternative is called cold storage, keeping the key in an offline device such as a thumb drive. But risks remain: Hackers have also proven adept at setting traps on computers to access cold-storage devices the moment theyre online. More traditional criminals have committed home invasions and kidnappings. Some Bitcoin tycoons have resorted to hiding their identities, fortifying their homes and studying self-defense.\nTrading Desk\nXapos solution is to bury a cold-storage device in a mountainside and layer on electronic safeguards.\nTheyre the first folks who recognized custodial and security functions would be key, said Hoffman, whose venture capital firm Greylock Partners led a $20 million investment in Xapo in 2014, a couple of years after Casares persuaded him to buy his first Bitcoin. He made the pitch in the morning and in the afternoon I called him with an offer.\nAt Xapo, retrieving Bitcoin from the vault takes about two days. The company verifies a clients identity and authenticates the request before manually signing the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations. Approval from three separate vaults is required for any transactions to be authorized. The company also offers customers a trading desk to buy and sell Bitcoin and created the first Bitcoin debit card to spend it.\nCasares, 44, declined to comment for this story. After a flurry of publicity at Xapos launch, he has drawn big audiences at crypto conferences but largely shunned media interviews.\nYet his persuasiveness is legendary. His evangelizing of Bitcoin is so pervasive in Silicon Valley that when Hoffman asked his family office to buy some, his banker asked when hed spoken to Casares. Xapos advisers now include former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, ex-Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Officer John Reed and Visa International founder Dee Hock.\nSuch salesmanship has been critical to Xapos success. First Block Capital, Canadas first fully registered crypto firm, picked Xapo as its custodian after months of due diligence, including touring the Swiss vault.\nEvery part of their DNA is geared to security, said Sean Clark, First Blocks founder, who noted the vaults fingerprint scanners were equipped with a pulse reader to prevent amputated hands from being used. Whenever we make big transfers they FaceTime us, we have duress words, if its big enough theyll fly out to see us.\nXapo is doubling down on its pursuit of institutional clients, with President Ted Rogers enlisting Peter Najarian, a veteran of emerging-market trading at UBS Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, to oversee outreach to investors including pension funds, private banks, assets managers, family offices and hedge funds.\nTidal Wave\nThe perceived lack of an institutional-grade custodial solution for Bitcoin has been one of the sticking points for many money managers looking to try the asset class. Xapo says its already offering precisely that solution. If it persuades them of its merits, the implications for Bitcoin would be profound.\nA fraction of that kind of institutional money flowing into the space would be a tidal wave, Najarian said.\nCasares has made acceptance of Bitcoin his lifes mission. Born to sheep ranchers in Argentinas remote Patagonia region, he experienced the impact of inflation throughout his youth.\nThat drove him to build a series of fintech startups that made him millions before he encountered Bitcoin. He sold 75 percent of Patagon, a Latin American financial-services website, for $529 million in 2000 and digital wallet startup Lemon for $43 million 13 years later to focus on crypto. By then, he was already a big holder of Bitcoin.\nI am personally allocating a percentage of my net worth to this that is borderline irresponsible because I believe in it so much, Casares told Lemon board member Eric OBrien, according to Digital Gold, a book by Nathaniel Popper. Two years ago, he joined the board of PayPal Holdings Inc.\nHigh Hurdle\nBitcoins meteoric rise in recent years has spurred the proliferation of rival currencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple that also have multibillion-dollar valuations. Yet Xapo only safeguards Bitcoin because of Casaress belief that it alone will succeed. Such dogmatism has seen Xapo turn away customers looking to store rival currencies.\nOther purists say ventures such as Xapo have no place in the Bitcoin ecosystem, slowing down whats supposed to be a seamless transfer.\nXapos top brass wrestle with that paradox, too.\nIts a subject we discuss a lot, and we believe Bitcoin wont reach the mainstream if people have to hold their own private keys, Rogers said. Its a pretty high hurdle technically to be your own bank with lots of security.\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/bunkers-for-the-wealthy-are-said-to-hoard-10-billion-of-bitcoin\nGood piece on xapo. Tried to bold the best parts but tbh the entire thing is probably worth reading. It appears xapo could hold as much as 7% of the world's global bitcoin supply. That type of long term hold commitment could benefit HODLers. To know that near 10% of bitcoin will be held and will likely never be sold anytime soon could lend credence and confidence long term investments in btc.\nIt seems that the head of xapo could be similar to batman. It is said he was born in patagonia and witnessed many evils of inflation while growing up which might have motivated him to invest heavily in bitcoin. Not far from resembling the origins story of a comic book superhero.\nAlso is it my imagination or do these articles always mention(recommend) some of the worst altcoins out there like ripple and eth?
