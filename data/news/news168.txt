As it became established, prices would rise exponentially. Over time, this price appreciation would slow as it reached a steady state. High-But-Declining Volatility : Similarly, early volatility would be extreme, as its long-term sustainability would be in question. But over time, that volatility would tail off as the asset became more established. That’s exactly what we saw in gold, and Bitcoin is following the same path. Bitcoin’s price rose exponentially in its earliest days, and that growth is slowing over time. Volatility—while still high—has declined markedly, and will likely fall further as derivatives and market-making activity increase.\nBuy Bitcoin Worldwide Bitcoin Volatility Is Declining Over Time\nWhy Store of Value Matters: The Valuation Case for Bitcoin\nThe store-of-value argument is important because it answers the biggest question surrounding Bitcoin: What is it worth?\nA store of value is worth what people will pay for it. While gold has some use as an industrial metal and in jewelry, it would not trade for $1,300 per ounce based on those uses alone. It’s worth $1,300 per ounce because people are willing to pay $1300 per ounce for it as a store of wealth.\nIf you accept Bitcoin as an emerging store of value, you can look at the current price and argue it’s cheap. The current market cap of Bitcoin—the value of all Bitcoin in existence—is $143 billion. The current market cap of gold is somewhere around $7.5 trillion. In other words, Bitcoin is storing around 2% of the wealth of gold.\nLook out 10 years: As the digital world becomes an ever-larger part of our lives, and the millennial generation moves into its prime age range for saving, it’s not hard to imagine a world where Bitcoin holds 1/10th the value of gold. That would imply a 500% price increase, from current levels of around $8,000 to about $40,000.\nCould Bitcoin’s value be equal to gold? That would suggest a shade under $400,000.\nCould it be higher, because Bitcoin has more potential utility?\nDon’t listen to the folks who say Bitcoin will never be a store of value. It’s actually right on track, following in the footsteps of every other significant store of value that’s come into the world. There’s no guarantee it will stay on that path, but if it does, the opportunities are significant.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T15:22:04.079+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7fdd6ec740f63b4b79fb165239dea22d89bfe9ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9VqMl3jEUPk_kdu4SC7QbT0BbbFoftVS5KCGpB6B8Yjbf8Nb2OK76U2WTO.uRfSPZWLJVW_FqsF3McLGH.U0n0r5BUYtWuH4SkgxhFHG1nMqcpkGU0uTPSxpWtTWC0H3L8yLDrCFE9X77F2pgNO7Zl7eHcVKulz4Q-", "site_full": "www.newspatrolling.com", "site": "newspatrolling.com", "site_section": "http://www.newspatrolling.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NewsPatrolling.com", "title": "​From Barter to Bitcoins: The Evolution of Money Transfers – Info-graphic by InstaReM", "title_full": "​From Barter to Bitcoins: The Evolution of Money Transfers – Info-graphic by InstaReM", "published": "2018-05-23T15:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7fdd6ec740f63b4b79fb165239dea22d89bfe9ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9VqMl3jEUPk_kdu4SC7QbT0BbbFoftVS5KCGpB6B8Yjbf8Nb2OK76U2WTO.uRfSPZWLJVW_FqsF3McLGH.U0n0r5BUYtWuH4SkgxhFHG1nMqcpkGU0uTPSxpWtTWC0H3L8yLDrCFE9X77F2pgNO7Zl7eHcVKulz4Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Team | NewsPatrolling", "published": "2018-05-23T15:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "​From Barter to Bitcoins: The Evolution of Money Transfers – Info-graphic by InstaReM", "text": " PR\nAs a medium for exchanging value, Money is probably the most important invention that has had a such a deep impact on the way the humanity has evolved. It will not be an exaggeration to state that the shape of world today is largely a result of an amazing invention, which has been an integral part of human history for more than 3000 years!\nAs a concept, money is not meant to stay static or idle. Money serves its purpose only when it moves from one hand to another and from one place to another, reflecting economic activity that benefits its participants. The concept of exchange of value, which originated as a system of barter – exchange of goods and services for other goods or services – has evolved over time taking various forms such as clay tokens, agricultural products, livestock, metal coins, paper notes, plastic cards, electronic/mobile records, cryptocurrencies, with each new form aiming to eliminate the pitfalls of its earlier forms.\nInternational Money Transfers for trade payments as well as for individual remittances, too, have evolved over time with the changing shape of money and breakthroughs in industry and technology. As a provider of digital international money transfers, we at InstaReM, look back in the past to understand how the concept of money transfers has evolved, and crystal-gaze into future to visualize how the way it may move from here.\nBarter System – 3000-600 B.C.\nThe earliest long-distance trade is recorded between Mesopotemia and Harappan civilization of Indus Valley around 3000 B.C. For a long time, the trade between nations was largely based on the barter system. For centuries, the traders from the East and the West exchanged gold, silver, ivory, precious stones, spices, musk, camphor, sandalwood, wine, tea, salt, wool, silk, muslin etc. in barter trade.\nMetals & Metal Coins – 600 B.C. to 16 th Century AD\nThe earliest coins – made of gold and silver alloy – are recorded to be minted between 610 and 600 B.C., as national currency in Lydia, a region that is part of today’s Turkey. As international trade expanded, gold and silver ruled the roost as the currency of trade. The invention of money made trade between nations simpler, as traders could negotiate though the medium of exchange.\nCurrency Exchange/Trading– Ancient Times – 4 Century AD\nCurrency trading and exchange first occurred in ancient times. Money-changers (people helping others to change money and also taking a commission or charging a fee) lived in the Holy Land in the Biblical times. During the 4th century, Byzantine government kept a monopoly on the exchange of currency.\nInternational Banking – 15 th to 18 th Centuries AD\nDuring 15th century, the Italian banking family Medici opened banks at foreign locations to exchange currencies on behalf of textile merchants. To facilitate trade, the bank created nostro (“ours” in Italian) account book which contained 2-columned entries showing amounts of foreign and local currencies.\nForex Market in Amsterdam – 17-18 Century AD\nDuring the 17th (or 18th) century, Amsterdam maintained an active Forex market. In 1704, foreign exchange took place between agents acting in the interests of the England and Holland.\nBirth of the US Dollar – 18 th Century\nWhen the British colonized America, the government restricted the colonists from minting currency. But the colonists used any foreign currency they could get their hands on. Particularly popular was the large silver Spanish “Dollar”, which gained significance during the American Revolution. The US adopted the Dollar in April 1792, which over time became the best-recognized currency in the world.\nWestern Union – Mid-19 th Century\nThe New York & Mississippi Valley Printing Telegraph Company was founded in 1851 – renamed the Western Union Telegraph Company in 1856. In 1872, Western Union launched Wire Transfer – a method of electronic funds transfer from one person or entity to another – on its telegraph network, changing forever the way money moved within and across the borders.\nInternational Wire Transfers Become Mainstream – Late 19 th Century\nWith a boom in globalized industrialization, Wire Transfers became increasingly popular in the late 19th century. As more and more people started working with contractors and innovators overseas, banking became increasingly globalized, including how people sent and received funds internationally on an individual basis. This had never happened before.\nInternational Payment Network (SWIFT) – Late 20 th Century\nGlobal network the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) facilitates international payments. Founded in 1973, SWIFT does not actually move money; their network transmits messages between banks that allow the banks to make transfers. Used largely for business and banking-related transfers, SWIFT handles about transactions worth $5 trillion per day.\nPayPal Revolutionizes Money Transfers – End of 20th Century\nAt the fag end of the 20th century, PayPal emerged as the first online money transfer company to get into the limelight. PayPal made online money transfer possible, that too at a fraction of the cost that larger money transfer companies and banks were charging. In 2017, PayPal’s annual payment volume amounted to US$ 451.27 billion.\nThe Money Transfer Industry Today\nThe world has become an entirely globalized place, where people’s careers, travel, and general way of life is much more nomadic than it ever has been before. With evolution in technology, options for money transfer have also become more advanced. InstaReM, Asia-Pacific’s leading digital cross-border money transfer company was set up in 2014, offering convenient, cost-effective and efficient money transfer to a vast majority at a fraction of the costs of the traditional Money Transfer Operators.\nBitcoin/Blockchain/Cryptocurrencies – 21 st Century\nBitcoin is a digital currency of 21st century. It uses a peer-to-peer system and the transactions take place between users directly without an intermediary. Transactions are verified by network nodes and are recorded on a publicly-distributed ledger called blockchain. Based on the blockchain technology, Bitcoin was invented in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto as an open source technology. Today, the Blockchain is increasingly being adopted by fintechs for facilitating fast cross-border money transfers.\nLooking Ahead\nWith fintech firms increasingly taking on banking sector with efficient and cost-effective offerings in financial services, the future of the International Money Transfer industry looks exciting. While we see increasing adoption of Blockchain by the Money Transfer companies, with new breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence, we see immense possibilities in Voice-based cross-border transfers. 2018-05-23", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "international money transfers", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T20:11:16.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cf03757efdc42c6365a34e1ac67226c2c5ead2d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTcDXTc7RaCvr1qjbSuqV3POPybKjYASHUQN.YZt_bwrka9YWO3B3Wm8fFoauBP8HY-", "site_full": "seekingalpha.com", "site": "seekingalpha.com", "site_section": "https://seekingalpha.com/market-news/on-the-move", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "mutual_funds"], "section_title": "Stock Picks, Stock Market Investing | Seeking Alpha", "title": "Bitcoin skids below $8K - American Security Resources Corp.

I always thought he posted it on either his social media page or some random forum.\nAnyways, while reading through comments made on this topic, I noticed a strange thing. Most members who posted at that time are no longer active on Bitcointalk. Many were last seen years ago. Even Laszlo isn't, even though he has somewhat of a celebrity status in Bitcoin community. Many even credit his sacrifice of Bitcoins as the main reason for Bitcoin's current price.\nAnd it's not that he has gone anonymous or so, because recently ledger launched limited edition Nano S, themed on Bitcoin Pizza Day and Laszlo gave the permission to do so. https://www.ledger.fr/2018/05/22/bitcoin-pizza-day-ledger-nano-s-limited-edition/\n**Does anyone know what happened of the guy (jercos) who actually provided the pizzas for Bitcoin? He/she was equally important in this milestone.\nBut what I am curious about, especially from the old members here; that why the early adopters of Bitcoin and then active members of Bitcointalk have gone inactive now. Is it because they are bitter about not holding to their Bitcoins and selling it for a few Dollars or because they have found better platforms to discuss Bitcoin. Or maybe that they made quite a fortune and don't care anymore. I read that even Vitalik was an active user here, but again he has also become totally inactive on Bitcointalk.

The virtual currency has been showing a downward trend and touched a low of 6620 on April 6. Since then, the Bitcoin market saw a mid-term recovery, and rose by more than a third in value.\nBitcoin had jumped above $9,000 in late April, and it continued to climb to nearly $10,000 on May 6. Then started the next phase of descent, reflecting a 20 percent drop over the past two weeks.\nAll the other major currencies were trading in the negative territory on Wednesday, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\nBitcoin -4.45 percent, Ethereum -9.48 percent, Ripple -6.92 percent, Bitcoin Cash -9.41 percent, EOS -10.43 percent, Litecoin -6.07 percent, and Cardano -11.38 percent.\nThe market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is at its one-month low with $352 billion changing hands.\nExperts attributed the dramatic fall mainly to concerns over increased regulation. Besides, the hype around a post-Consensus conference rally also didn't take off.\nby Joji Xavier RTTNews Staff Writer\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\nEconomic News\nWhat parts of the world are seeing the best (and worst) economic performances lately?

In an interview for CNBC, the professor at Yale University expressed his rather negative sentiment towards Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, saying:\nTo me it’s another example of faddish human behavior.\nShiller’s opinions on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are also consolidated in a blog post that he published on May 21 st . Apples and Oranges\nShiller lays down his take on cryptocurrencies, bringing forward what he believes are comparable examples of other failed attempts to replace conventional fiat currency.\nHe touches the so-called Labor Theory of Value, as well as John Pease Norton’s proposition of introducing a dollar, the value of which was backed by electricity. Both of those examples attempted to replace the gold standard, which, for the US, meant that 40% of its notes had to be backed by gold. This ended in 1933 when the country abandoned the gold standard, severing the connection between gold and the dollar.\nAs it is painfully obvious, both those examples proposed new models during an existing, pre-determined standard. They attempted to disrupt what was currently existing and replace it with something new – money backed by labor and electricity, respectively, and not by gold, which was the merit at the time these propositions came to light. As Shiller notes:\nEach of these monetary innovations has been coupled with a unique technological story, […] But, more fundamentally, all are connected with a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society.\nBitcoin, on the other hand, does nothing of the kind. It’s not backed by any actual asset like gold, silver, or time. All Aboard the Bitcoin Revolution!\nApparently, Shiller thinks Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies were introduced by some sort of anti-governmental villains, a community of aspiring entrepreneurs who “hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.”\nLet’s break that down. Bitcoin was introduced by an anonymous person or a group of people going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. As it stands, Bitcoin’s founder(s) remain anonymous, so it’s hard to say that they are holding themselves above any government.\nAnother leading project in the field is Ethereum, the founder of which is well-known – Vitalik Buterin. While he’s particularly active on social media, never has he proposed that digital currencies are to overthrow any government, let alone to cause some sort of social revolution. Ambiguity Levels Over 9000!\nAs it is with quite a lot of people who stand to refute the merits of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, Shiller also goes on to say that he doesn’t mean to “dismiss it.” He also lightly touched on the fact that “some smart people got into this (Bitcoin) and some other cryptocurrencies.” So which is it?\nAs a matter of fact, whole countries are jumping on the cryptocurrency wagon, assembling teams to create their own virtual currencies – China and Iran are prime examples. Major companies from different sectors are launching their own blockchain-based projects. Cases in point: JP Morgan, Facebook, LG, Microsoft, Oracle, HTC, and many more.\nEven the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the US launched a mock crypto project to help spread awareness and to advocate caution when dealing with cryptocurrencies, essentially recognizing that they are here to stay.\nYet, Shiller’s merits lie within what seems to be a rather old sentiment:\nPractically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work, and that mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal, […] None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a seemingly compelling story may not be enough.\nIt’s probably safe to say that there is something a lot more measurable than “mystery” and “revolutionary zeal” when countries are assembling task forces and working hard towards regulating a field. If anything, it speaks that institutions have recognized what this new field has to offer and that they are attempting to work out a way to incorporate it into our everyday lives.\nDo you agree with Professor Shiller that Bitcoin’s mysterious glamor is all there is to it?

As Shiller notes:\nEach of these monetary innovations has been coupled with a unique technological story, […] But, more fundamentally, all are connected with a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society.\nBitcoin, on the other hand, does nothing of the kind. It’s not backed by any actual asset like gold, silver, or time. All Aboard the Bitcoin Revolution!\nApparently, Shiller thinks Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies were introduced by some sort of anti-governmental villains, a community of aspiring entrepreneurs who “hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.”\nLet’s break that down. Bitcoin was introduced by an anonymous person or a group of people going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. As it stands, Bitcoin’s founder(s) remain anonymous, so it’s hard to say that they are holding themselves above any government.\nAnother leading project in the field is Ethereum, the founder of which is well-known – Vitalik Buterin . While he’s particularly active on social media, never has he proposed that digital currencies are to overthrow any government, let alone to cause some sort of social revolution. Ambiguity Levels Over 9000!\nAs it is with quite a lot of people who stand to refute the merits of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, Shiller also goes on to say that he doesn’t mean to “dismiss it.” He also lightly touched on the fact that “some smart people got into this (Bitcoin) and some other cryptocurrencies.” So which is it?\nAs a matter of fact, whole countries are jumping on the cryptocurrency wagon, assembling teams to create their own virtual currencies – China and Iran are prime examples. Major companies from different sectors are launching their own blockchain-based projects. Cases in point: JP Morgan , Facebook , LG , Microsoft , Oracle , HTC , and many more.\nEven the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the US launched a mock crypto project to help spread awareness and to advocate caution when dealing with cryptocurrencies, essentially recognizing that they are here to stay.\nYet, Shiller’s merits lie within what seems to be a rather old sentiment:\nPractically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work, and that mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal, […] None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a seemingly compelling story may not be enough.\nIt’s probably safe to say that there is something a lot more measurable than “mystery” and “revolutionary zeal” when countries are assembling task forces and working hard towards regulating a field. If anything, it speaks that institutions have recognized what this new field has to offer and that they are attempting to work out a way to incorporate it into our everyday lives.\nDo you agree with Professor Shiller that Bitcoin’s mysterious glamor is all there is to it?

During the past 50 bars, there have been 0 white candles and 0 black candles.\nA falling window occurred (where the bottom of the previous shadow is above the top of the current shadow). This usually implies a continuation of a bearish trend. There have been 24 falling windows in the last 50 candles–this makes the current falling window even more bearish.\nA gravestone doji occurred. This often signifies a top (the longer the upper shadow, the more bearish the signal).\nMomentum Indicators\nMomentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators.\nStochastic Oscillator\nOne method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 30.0241. This is not an overbought or oversold reading. The last signal was a buy 0 period(s) ago.\nRelative Strength Index (RSI)\nThe RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 44.10. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 36 period(s) ago.\nCommodity Channel Index (CCI)\nThe CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -83. This is not a topping or bottoming area. The last signal was a buy 1 period(s) ago.\nMACD\nThe Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a sell 7 period(s) ago.\nRex Takasugi – TD Profile\nNYSE BitcoinIndx closed down -165.957 at 8,230.820.

They are not dealing in those things. They are in tatters as we speak.”\nAlthough police in South Africa have reported a recent rise in kidnappings, the ransom demand in cryptocurrency appears to be a first.\nIn December, kidnappers in Ukraine received a ransom worth more than one million in dollars bitcoins for releasing their victim – an employee of a British cryptocurrency exchange.\nCopyright LEADERSHIP.

If anyone wants to send me pizza for Bitcoin today, I'll take three large ones with an address in PM, for 0.01 BTC (they are worth less than half that at the moment). I can only accept one offer and will update this post when I do... I can't eat more than 3 unfortunately!\nNo escrow, you're just gonna have to trust me like people trusted Laszlo 8 years ago\nME ME! Looks like I am the first one who gets to try this..\nNever done this before but I would love to try and order an international pizza. PM me your address.\nOK! You're getting a PM from me, we can take our time to get things done over forum and PM. I neglected to mention a max time but am aware most of the world is half a day ahead of me. A bit late to do it right now (way past dinner here) but I'll make sure you get your Bitcoin for pizza, provided all goes well of course. On to our own small piece of history\nSo our time-zones are making delaying the celebrations a bit.. Waiting for some inputs. It remains to be seen what hurdles my country's \"awesome\" currency laws are going to throw up.\nBy the way, the site i found even accepts BTC. How cool is that?

Democratic congressional candidate Brian Forde has been targeted by anti-crypto political advertising for accepting Bitcoin (BTC) donations to his campaign, VICE reported Tuesday, May 22.\nForde’s rival Dave Min, who is also running for the Democratic nomination for the upcoming congressional elections in California, circulated an ad suggesting that Forde’s donors are “Bitcoin speculators that oppose cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.” In correspondence with VICE, Forde responded to the ad’s claims, saying:\n“These comments about my supporters are sensationalist, wildly inaccurate, and in line with my opponent’s lack of understanding of the technology. If they were speculating they wouldn’t have donated to my campaign in Bitcoin. They didn’t HODL, they donated to my campaign in Bitcoin because they believe in the technology.”\nForde, who formerly advised the Obama administration on crypto and headed MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, is a stalwart crypto advocate, leading Bloomberg to dub him “the crypto candidate for Congress.” According to Bloomberg, his campaign has attracted support from the likes of crypto community giants Mike Novogratz and the Winklevoss brothers . His opponent Min on the other hand is a former SEC attorney and current professor of law at the University of California, Irvine.\n“While [Min’s] ad disparages a technology he clearly doesn’t understand, the United Nations uses it to address human trafficking,” Forde told Bloomberg, referring to a UN initiative for a blockchain-based digital identity system designed to combat child trafficking globally. “We need more rational scientists and technologists in congress armed with evidence-based policymaking, not politicians making irrational decisions based on their emotions,\" he stressed.\nAs VICE notes, back in 2014 the US Federal Election Commission (FEC) ruled unanimously in favour of allowing political action committees to accept BTC donations, provided donors identify themselves. New Hampshire was the first US state to implement the FEC 2014 rulings, with Colorado suggesting it will follow suit just this week.\nThe FEC currently treats Bitcoin contributions to campaigns as as in-kind donations, meaning that candidates have 10 days to put the BTC raised into their official campaign depository. As Cointelegraph has reported , the FEC has been assessing whether to amend its regulations so that virtual currencies would in future be treated like cash. ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : cointelegraph.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/j5kpxb/cryptocurrency-attack-ad-brian-forde-bitcoin", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/michael-novogratz", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/01/cryptocurrency-candidates-politicians-embrace-bitcoin.html", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-colorado-proposes-accepting-cryptocurrency-for-political-campaigns", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-08/bitcoin-s-candidate-for-congress", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/sec", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/un-partners-win-to-fight-child-trafficking-with-blockchain", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/winklevoss-twins", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/pro-bitcoin-us-congressional-candidate-starts-accepting-bitcoin-donations-for-2018", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-white-house-advisor-elimination-of-double-spend-is-bitcoins-true-innovation"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "forde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian forde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave min", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T14:37:06.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b84b0921c93adffa12accecdd2cd93f610959c0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmY2y3ylC2tu9.FViz3gX4TE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "some good info about bitcoin", "title_full": "some good info about bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-23T14:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.05, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b84b0921c93adffa12accecdd2cd93f610959c0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmY2y3ylC2tu9.FViz3gX4TE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "hamim18", "published": "2018-05-23T14:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "some good info about bitcoin", "text": "Quote: from: purple.thoughts on May 04, 2018, 02:38:58 PM Bitcoin is really the fastest way to earn money or growing your money.

In fact, all of the 25 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap (excluding Tether, which is based on the U.S. dollar) are down today.\nHere's a look at the latest cryptocurrency prices and what might be behind this massive drop.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nToday's cryptocurrency prices Here's a look at the 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and how much each has changed over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is down by more than 7% over the last 24 hours, and is actually the best-performing of the 10 largest cryptocurrencies. Six of the top 10 are down by double digits, and only three of the top 100 cryptocurrencies are positive on Wednesday. In short, this is about as broad of a sell-off as you can get.\nCryptocurrency Name (Code)\nPrice in U.S. Dollars\nDay's Change\nBitcoin (BTC)\n$7,594.90\n(7.2%)\nEthereum (ETH)\n$588.48\n(11.8%)\nRipple (XRP)\n$0.61\n(8.4%)\nBitcoin Cash (BCH)\n$1,027.70\n(11.7%)\nEOS (EOS)\n$10.81\n(16.7%)\nLitecoin (LTC)\n$120.66\n(7.6%)\nCardano (ADA)\n$0.21\n(13.5%)\nStellar (XLM)\n$0.28\n(9.4%)\nTRON (TRX)\n$0.07\n(10.8%)\nIOTA (MIOTA)\n$1.48\n(14.5%)\nData source: www.investing.com. Prices and daily changes as of May 23, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. EDT, and prices are rounded to the nearest cent where appropriate.\nWhy are cryptocurrencies plunging? There are a few possible negative catalysts. For example, some of the hype surrounding the well-publicized \"Blockchain Week\" in New York City may have bolstered prices, and now that it's over, we could be seeing lower investor interest.\nPerhaps the biggest catalyst driving down cryptocurrency prices is regulatory fears.\nFears of increased global regulation have been the culprit in several big cryptocurrency sell-offs this year. The South Korean cryptocurrency saga in particular caused quite a bit of volatility.\nThis time, it's closer to home. On Monday, regulators in the U.S. and Canada announced \"Operation Crypto-Sweep,\" which is being led by the North American Securities Administrators Association and has more than 40 states and provinces participating.\nTo be clear, the crackdown is focused on cryptocurrency investment schemes, particularly initial coin offerings, or ICOs. It is not targeting major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC-USD) or legitimate businesses such as cryptocurrency exchanges. Even so, it seems to have the market on edge.\nThis comes on the heels of increased cryptocurrency scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), whose chairman has issued strongly worded warnings to cryptocurrency and ICO investors in recent months.\nA good thing? As I've written before, cryptocurrency regulation isn't necessarily a bad thing . Rather, it is the uncertainty surrounding regulation that drives the market crazy.\nRegulation could be a good thing over the long term for cryptocurrencies. A regulated market would likely attract more institutional investors, and I don't think any legitimate cryptocurrency believer thinks that getting rid of scams is a bad thing for the industry. And, the implementation of global cryptocurrency regulation could help provide much-needed stability to the market, which could solve one of the biggest obstacles standing in the way of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption -- volatility.\nIn the meantime, however, it remains to be seen whether the current sell-off is nearing its end or if investor jitters will continue to send cryptocurrencies downward.\nBitcoin is overhyped: 10 better buys for you now\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

May 23, 2018\nCNBC Fast Money and Brian Kelly have come under fire on Twitter from prominent crypto-sphere enthusiasts WhalePanda and Samson Mow. The allegations point to various points in the past and connections between CNBC and Bitcoin Cash executives. Many Twitter users saw the need to bring this to the SEC’s attention, frequently tagging the SEC and SEC Enforcement Twitter accounts.\nFirst on the timeline is the eponymous Brian Kelly’s failed altcoin. In July 2015, CNBC’s Brian Kelly claimed to have created a coin that reduced volatility. The coin in question was called NautilusCoin. In an article promoting it on CNBC, which itself is self-promotion using a trusted outlet, Kelly said:\n“Bitcoin, the elegant elixir for our fractured financial system, is actually flawed. It’s vulnerable to attacks. There is, however, a fix — something I had installed on my own coin experiment. Here’s how it works…”\nThe coin in question was created using the now-down website coingen.io, which allowed users to automatically create an altcoin based on parameters entered into a form. It was also clarified that the “stability fund” will hold majority ownership stake in the coin.\nTwitter user Samson Mow said on this:\n“A little birdie tipped me off on this gem. @BKBrianKelly was pumping & dumping NautilusCoin back in 2015. Makes perfect sense that he got the crew back together to do the same on @CNBCFastMoney.”\nThere were added allegations of CNBC Fast Money conducting a shill campaign for Bitcoin Cash, assumed from their constant posts on Twitter promoting Bitcoin Cash. This comes after Brian Kelly covered developments on Bitcoin Cash yet again this morning, saying it was a buy. He says:\n“#BitcoinCash has rallied over the past month while other cryptos, including $BTC, have fallen during that time. Can $BCH keep the crypto crown?”\nHe continues to say:\n“@BKBrianKelly reveals why he thinks the #BitcoinCash rally is far from over and takes some tweets to answer questions about the cryptocurrency $BCH”\nThis series of tweets by Samson Mow speaks up on this issue, saying:\n“Gotta love @CNBCFastMoney shilling $BCH at every opportunity. Watch how they highlight it here, but when it’s the worst performing of a particular day, there’s no mention.”\n“Convenient that @CNBCFastMoney doesn’t mention $BCH in the red.”\n“Nice selective timeframe to pump the $BCH altcoin to your viewers. May as well make a graphic putting it on a throne for dramatic effect right? Seriously, if these guys at @CNBC aren’t in jail by year end, someone isn’t doing their job. @SEC_Enforcement”\nA potential conflict of interest was also brought up as an issue, with user whalepanda bringing out a connection between Gaby Wasensteiner and Paul Wasensteiner. They are married, with Gaby working at CNBC as a marketing manager, while Paul is an Executive Director of the Bitcoin Cash fund. This brings about an alleged conflict of interest between the two companies, which, when coupled with the pro-Bitcoin Cash posts on the Twitter profile of CNBC Fast Money.\nUser Pier agreed saying:\n“Holy conflict of interest Batman. Does CNBC legal know it’s employees are using CNBC platforms it to do this? This is some next level shit.”\nBrett MacDonald:\n“Hey @SEC_Enforcement you guys ever consider doing your job?

They had a similar spiel as bitcoin but failed to take off. For example, the Cincinnati Time Store sold items based on “labor notes” or paper notes that were time units that represented the amount of labor required to bring the product to market. In effect, they represented a promise by the buyer to perform an equivalent amount of work for the store’s owner in exchange for the product. But the concept proved to be unpopular and the store closed down in 1830. (See also: Bitcoin Best Example Of Irrational Exuberance Right Now ).\nOther examples provided by Shiller in his note relate to the use of energy as units of payment. For example, Technocracy, a movement at Columbia University, intended to use units of energy, known as ergs, to replace the dollar. Economist John Pease Norton came up with the idea of using electricity as backing for the dollar. “At a time when most households in advanced countries had only recently been electrified, and electric devices from radios to refrigerators had entered homes, electricity evoked images of the most glamorous high science,” writes Shiller. “But, like Technocracy, the attempt to co-opt science backfired.”\nCryptocurrencies share characteristics with these other attempts to create an alternative to fiat currencies. Further, their complex technology further confuses people. “Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work,” wrote Shiller. “That mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal.” In a reference to the Satoshi Nakamoto origin myth associated with bitcoin, Shiller cautioned that a “compelling story” may not be enough to attract the masses.\nShiller joins a long list of prominent names, from legendary investor Warren Buffett to JPMorgan head Jamie Dimon, who have cast doubts on cryptocurrencies and bitcoin. In April, he told CNBC that bitcoin’s rise was a result of “faddish human behavior”. “..it's a story that I think goes way beyond the merit of the idea. ... It is more psychological than something that could be explained by the computer science department,” he said.

We soon realized this was relatively uncharted water. […] There were a couple of mosques abroad that also announced they were going to accept cryptocurrency. It looks like we may be the first in Britain to do so. Dealing With ‘Incompatible’ Crypto\nAs Britain’s only Turkish-owned mosque, Shacklewell is in a unique situation in terms of Ankara’s perspective on cryptocurrency.\nLate last year, Bitcoinist reported on how government advisors had determined that Bitcoin and altcoins were “not compatible” with Islamic tradition and were thus unsuitable for Muslims.\nIn response to a civil request, Turkey’s Directorate of Religious Affairs, also known as the Diyanet, said:\nBuying and selling virtual currencies is not compatible with religion at this time because of the fact that their valuation is open to speculation, they can be easily used in illegal activities like money laundering and they are not under the state’s audit and surveillance.\nCountering the suspicion, however, Singh pointed out that Western capitalism had produced its worst crashes specifically due to the presence of the speculation to which some Islamic scholars object.\nSingh added:\nWould we have had […] the granddaddy of them all, the Wall Street Crash of 1929, if speculation was not standard practice in our conventional, Western banking system?\nWhat do you think about Shacklewell Lane Mosque’s decision to accept Bitcoin?

He explained that they are generally long term investors that will spend billions on the market. \"Expect the top ten coins to go through the roof fairly quickly. The bulk of altcoins will soon follow,\" the software guru wrote. Admitting he had no more information than his followers, John McAfee advised them to check the recent news and use their heads.\nMcAfee was probably referring to several recent announcements indicating possible developments in that direction. Earlier this month, reports suggested that Goldman Sachs is going to launch a bitcoin trading operation to buy and sell bitcoin futures on behalf of institutional clients. More recently, US crypto exchange Coinbase announced new services meant to attract big money players such as crypto hedge funds. The plans include the launch of a crypto custodian service and a suite of tools specifically designed for institutions called Coinbase Prime. The San Francisco-based company has also discussed with regulators the possibility to apply for a banking license.\nHowever, McAfee's optimistic prognosis coincides with the return of the bears to the cryptocurrency market. The price of bitcoin (BTC) has just dropped below the $8,000 mark, hitting a month's low. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently trading at over $1,000 (at the time of writing). John McAfee has previously predicted that the price of bitcoin will reach $1 million USD by the end of 2020.\nStudy: Investors' Mood Determines the Value of Cryptocurrencies According to a new study published by Warwick Business School, the value of cryptocurrencies is determined primarily by the mood of investors and not so much by economic factors or indicators. Assistant professor of finance Daniele Bianchi has found that the price patterns of the 14 largest cryptocurrencies reflect past returns of investors, combined with the hype and emotion experienced as they watch the value climb or fall. The research is titled \"Cryptocurrencies as an Asset Class: An Empirical Assessment,\" the Independent reports.\nAccording to the author, this behavior can be attributed to the fact that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fall outside the remit of governments or financial institutions. Investing in digital currencies is therefore more similar to buying equity in a high-tech firm rather than a normal currency, he notes. Bianchi also points out that the study shows limited similarities between bitcoin and gold. At the same time, because of the high volatility of the prices of the biggest cryptocurrencies, they can hardly be seen as a reliable savings instrument.\nCFO: If Bitcoin Gets 'Better', Paypal Will Support It John Rainey, the Chief Financial Officer of Paypal, has stated in a recent interview that the payment platform will proceed with a bit more caution towards cryptocurrencies. At the same time, he admitted that if cryptocurrency stabilizes in the future and becomes \"better currency\", his company will \"certainly support that\". Rainey added that the volatile crypto swings threaten the viability of the businesses Paypal is working with.\n\"If you're a merchant and you have, let's say, a 10 percent margin on a product that you sell and you accept bitcoin, for example, and the very next day it moves 15 percent, you're now underwater on that transaction,\" Paypal CFO told CNBC . \"You could have something that appeals to consumers, but if merchants don't accept it, it's of little value. Right now, we don't see a lot of interest from our merchants. But if it's something that stabilizes in the future and is a better currency, then we'll certainly support that,\" Rainey elaborated.\nDespite Paypal's current position on cryptocurrencies, a recent patent filing revealed that the payment provider might be considering expanding its exposure to the crypto ecosystem. Reports came out in March this year that Paypal has filed a new patent application with the US Patent and Trademark Office for an \"expedited virtual currency transaction system\". Back in 2016, it was reported that the company had applied for another crypto-related patent – one that envisages the development of a payment module accepting bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin.\nWhat are your thoughts on today's topics in Bitcoin in Brief?

To see our extensive list of cryptocurrency sectors, read this post at https://www.tradingheroes.com/cryptocurrency-sectors-cheatsheet/. How do You Buy Cryptocurrencies? First have to go to an exchange or service that will allow you to purchase cryptocurrencies. Some of the bigger exchanges are: Coinbase at https://www.tradingheroes.com/coinbase. Poloniex at https://poloniex.com/. CEX at https://www.tradingheroes.com/cexio. Bittrex at https://bittrex.com/. Bitfinex at https://www.bitfinex.com/.\nBinance at https://www.tradingheroes.com/binance. LocalBitcoins at https://localbitcoins.com/. Many of them will allow you to use a credit card or link a bank account. As much as possible, do not store your cryptocurrency at the exchanges because they can be hacked. See the cold storage section in this post for details on how to store you coins safely. It’s easy to get Bitcoin, Ether and Litecoin. But if you want the smaller altcoins, you will have to do an exchange. How to Buy Altcoins. First buy Bitcoin or Ethereum because those are the coins that are most easily transacted against the smaller altcoins. When in doubt, buy Bitcoin. If you want $10 of Bitcoin for free, use this link at https://www.tradingheroes.com/coinbase (while supplies last). Then find out where the altcoin that you want is traded. Go to Coinmarketcap at https://coinmarketcap.com/ and click on the coin you want to buy. Next, click on the Markets tab for that coin. For example, here’s where you can get NEM. The Source column will show you the exchanges where this coin is being traded. Notice how most of them are traded against Bitcoin or Ether. Open an account at the most reputable exchange on the list. Once you are in your account, find the “deposit” wallet address for the altcoin you want to buy. Here’s an example from Poloniex. Copy this wallet address.\nNext, login to the account where you bought your Bitcoin or Ether. If you bought it from Coinbase at https://www.tradingheroes.com/coinbase, then you can go to: Accounts then Send and paste the deposit address into that field. Enter the amount you want to send, then click the send button. It may take some time for the transaction to go through, so be patient. Then you see the balance in your destination exchange account, you are now ready to buy altcoins. Here’s what it would look like when you have a Litecoin balance at Poloniex. This can be found in Balances > Deposits and Withdrawals in Poloniex. Now go to the Exchange area of the website. In Poloniex, it would look like this. Then click on the BTC tab. These are the currencies that you can exchange for Bitcoin. Click on the altcoin that you want to trade. Here’s and example from Civic (CVC). Next, scroll down and look for the buy/sell box. Enter the amount of altcoin that you want to buy. If you want to trade all of your Bitcoin, click on the link at the top with your total balance. Click the Buy button and you are all set. The trade might not happen right away, so check your Orders then My Open Orders page to see the status. The exact process will be different at different exchanges, but the basic idea is the same for all exchange.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network at https://mypr.co.za/beginners-guide-to-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-trading-part-3/ .\nFrom: Clyde Thorburn", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.dash.org/.", "https://storj.io/.", "https://bittrex.com/.", "https://bitcoin.org/en/.", "https://www.tradingheroes.com/coinbase,", "https://gamecredits.com/.", "https://www.tradingheroes.com/coinbase.", "http://bitclub.network/clydethorburn", "https://www.tradingheroes.com/cryptocurrency-sectors-cheatsheet/.", "https://www.ethereum.org/.", "https://www.stellar.org/.", "https://poloniex.com/.", "https://www.tradingheroes.com/binance.", "https://maidsafe.net/.", "https://localbitcoins.com/.", "https://getmonero.org/home.", "https://www.bitfinex.com/.", "https://litecoin.org/.", "https://www.reddcoin.com/.", "http://sia.tech/.", "https://coinmarketcap.com/", "https://z.cash/.", "https://ripple.com/.", "https://www.tradingheroes.com/coinbase", "https://tether.to/.", "https://www.tradingheroes.com/cexio."], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hugh kimura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "applica", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "banking and financial services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T16:08:53.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "890b0804c3f571851680971f1c7d4262105f9aa1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvjsJ5K.06B1krY7k3wifNpZyINmpylEibAV428EuODPrvGvgcoEkiL5YcTPnjg7CBgukUJVCqPsW9nN.Nm8xSgVq2_s5rW4TC91cZTopzsu7lpcf7Xuvmlj3xdquzY3w-", "site_full": "redliontrader.com", "site": "redliontrader.com", "site_section": "https://redliontrader.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "RedlionTrader", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Wednesday: McAfee Predicts Bull Run as Crypto Markets Dip", "title_full": "Bitcoin in Brief Wednesday: McAfee Predicts Bull Run as Crypto Markets Dip", "published": "2018-05-23T14:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "890b0804c3f571851680971f1c7d4262105f9aa1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvjsJ5K.06B1krY7k3wifNpZyINmpylEibAV428EuODPrvGvgcoEkiL5YcTPnjg7CBgukUJVCqPsW9nN.Nm8xSgVq2_s5rW4TC91cZTopzsu7lpcf7Xuvmlj3xdquzY3w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MrTopStep", "published": "2018-05-23T14:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Wednesday: McAfee Predicts Bull Run as Crypto Markets Dip", "text": "Bitcoin in Brief Wednesday: McAfee Predicts Bull Run as Crypto Markets Dip Posted By: MrTopStep May 23, 2018\nIn today’s Bitcoin in Brief, internet security expert John McAfee expects bulls to come back to the crypto market, despite recent drops in prices across the board.

McAfee claims this will lead to significant changes in the market capitalizations of the leading cryptocurrencies, but also those of most altcoins.\n“Institutional investors are preparing to enter the cryptocurrency market with a vengeance,” McAfee said in his tweet . He explained that they are generally long term investors that will spend billions on the market. “Expect the top ten coins to go through the roof fairly quickly.

Study: Investors’ Mood Determines the Value of Cryptocurrencies\nAccording to a new study published by Warwick Business School, the value of cryptocurrencies is determined primarily by the mood of investors and not so much by economic factors or indicators. Assistant professor of finance Daniele Bianchi has found that the price patterns of the 14 largest cryptocurrencies reflect past returns of investors, combined with the hype and emotion experienced as they watch the value climb or fall. The research is titled “Cryptocurrencies as an Asset Class: An Empirical Assessment,” the Independent reports.\nAccording to the author, this behavior can be attributed to the fact that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fall outside the remit of governments or financial institutions. Investing in digital currencies is therefore more similar to buying equity in a high-tech firm rather than a normal currency, he notes. Bianchi also points out that the study shows limited similarities between bitcoin and gold.

The Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Hackney announced that it is hoping to raise at least £10,000 in cryptocurrency donations over Ramadan, through both bitcoin and ethereum. Muslims are asked to give away 2.5 per cent of their wealth during the 30-day festival as part of zakat. “We are trying to appeal to a wider audience with the new money,” Erkin Guney, the chairman of the board of trustees, told The Hackney Gazette . “It’s big in the Islamic world, and we have set up a platform for wealthier Muslims outside our community to support and donate to our mosque.” Last month, Muhammad Abu-Bakar of Blossom Finance in Indonesia explored the functionality of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to determine whether they fit with Islam’s strict definitions of money. “Several recent fatawah issued by prominent Muslim scholars offered incomplete or contradictory opinions on the topic,” said Matthew Martin, CEO of Blossom Finance. “With all the confusion out there, we wanted to offer clear guidance supported by solid research that benefits both laypeople and practitioners of Islamic finance.” The conclusion of his study was that bitcoin is permissible in principle as it is accepted by a wide variety of global merchants. The bitcoin wallet address used by the mosque to receive the cryptocurrency has so far only received one donation, worth just over £100 at today’s prices. Gurmit Singh, founder of blockchain startup Combo Innovation who helped advise the mosque on setting up the bitcoin wallet, is hopeful for more donations. “If Muslims, who make up a quarter of the world’s population, hold just 1 per cent of bitcoins – or £1.04 billion – then £26 million in Zakat contributions is due,” Mr Singh said. “It is likely the actual figure is much higher. Currently hardly any mosques or Islamic charities accept Zakat in cryptocurrency.

They lack the support of economic fundamentals and their prices are determined by speculation about their eventual adoption and use, the economist said.\n\"With no cash flows and extreme volatility, the investment case for bitcoin is hardly compelling,\" Davis said.\nFurther, cryptocurrencies are not necessarily tied to the value of blockchain applications that may improve their efficiency in terms of cost and speed, the economist pointed out. Hence, an investment in cryptocurrencies do not offer a chance to capitalize on blockchain technology, he added.\"As innovation quickens and competition increases, the majority of networks (and their associated cryptocurrencies) may be rendered obsolete, leaving many cryptocurrencies like tulip bulbs in 17th-century Holland—soaring to incredible heights before the speculative bubble pops,\" Davis said.\nThe Nobel laureate Robert Shiller wrote in an op-ed on Project Syndicate, early this week, that cryptocurrencies could turn out to be just another failed currency experiment.\n\"As in the past, the public's fascination with cryptocurrencies is tied to a sort of mystery, like the mystery of the value of money itself, consisting in the new money's connection to advanced science,\" the Yale University Professor wrote.\"That mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal. None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a compelling story may not be enough.\"\nby Jyotsna V\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joe davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vanguard economist says bitcoin price may reach zero vanguard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vanguard", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T15:27:07.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0f9b8b59eb9dd364de901e4b16b0d800e0286f48", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqanwzxgeNa9RWeKsXBeTt1h5OrUD86DE.JFn5T3UIqFFgRvHpiV0EgRmvqUzVnI3DIneT3LH9gK.ye6VLTSgdJXQ--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "(Raw and Uncensored) Bitcoin Foundation Founder, Charlie Shrem Interviews Scott Scheper of XYO", "title_full": "(Raw and Uncensored) Bitcoin Foundation Founder, Charlie Shrem Interviews Scott Scheper of XYO : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-23T13:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.008, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0f9b8b59eb9dd364de901e4b16b0d800e0286f48", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqanwzxgeNa9RWeKsXBeTt1h5OrUD86DE.JFn5T3UIqFFgRvHpiV0EgRmvqUzVnI3DIneT3LH9gK.ye6VLTSgdJXQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Harrynoy92", "published": "2018-05-23T13:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "(Raw and Uncensored) Bitcoin Foundation Founder, Charlie Shrem Interviews Scott Scheper of XYO", "text": "submitted by /u/Harrynoy92\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K1znsKQghg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T09:34:53.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b630a3d57b35956c016c792e8b71198ddee41a91", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWE4Mt1H34qT_o3fwvu0lDs-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin VS.

What makes this case quite interesting is that the kidnappers want ransom paid in Bitcoin. Yup, you heard it right, they want at staggering total of 15 bitcoins for the safe release of the boy. That is around 1.5 million rands they asking for.\nTheir terms as laid out in their ransom letter are that 1 bitcoin must be paid by midnight of 23rd May 2018 and the want the remaining balance or the bitcoins by the 27th May 2018.\nI have been following the bitcoin address where they asked the ransom to be paid into so far and what I have established is that the 1 bitcoin payment they have requested has been paid already. Please see the link below for the kidnappers bitcoin wallet:\nKidnappers bitcoin wallet\nThe story is on the official South A frican Police Service(SAPS) twitter account, link is below:\nSAPS twitter link\nThe ransom letter with the bitcoin wallet address of the kidnappers can be seen in the link below:\nRansom Letter\nAm kindly appealing to the Reddit community at large to help trace the funds as they move this address . The kidnappers are at some point would want to exchange the bitcoins for cash via an excha nge.

They are not dealing in those things. They are in tatters as we speak.”\nAlthough police in South Africa have reported a recent rise in kidnappings, the ransom demand in cryptocurrency appears to be a first.\nIn December, kidnappers in Ukraine received a ransom worth more than $1 million in bitcoins for releasing their victim - an employee of a British cryptocurrency exchange.

We soon realized this was relatively uncharted water. […] There were a couple of mosques abroad that also announced they were going to accept cryptocurrency. It looks like we may be the first in Britain to do so. Dealing With ‘Incompatible’ Crypto\nAs Britain’s only Turkish-owned mosque, Shacklewell is in a unique situation in terms of Ankara’s perspective on cryptocurrency.\nLate last year, Bitcoinist reported on how government advisors had determined that Bitcoin and altcoins were “not compatible” with Islamic tradition and were thus unsuitable for Muslims.\nIn response to a civil request, Turkey’s Directorate of Religious Affairs, also known as the Diyanet, said:\nBuying and selling virtual currencies is not compatible with religion at this time because of the fact that their valuation is open to speculation, they can be easily used in illegal activities like money laundering and they are not under the state’s audit and surveillance.\nCountering the suspicion, however, Singh pointed out that Western capitalism had produced its worst crashes specifically due to the presence of the speculation to which some Islamic scholars object.\nSingh added:\nWould we have had […] the granddaddy of them all, the Wall Street Crash of 1929, if speculation was not standard practice in our conventional, Western banking system?\nWhat do you think about Shacklewell Lane Mosque’s decision to accept Bitcoin?

(great answer by D. Harding)", "text": "up vote 5 down vote accepted\nNothing directly prevents it in Bitcoin, and indeed the attack has been demonstrated on testnet3 many times---it's the primary reason that testnet3 currently has almost three times as many blocks as Bitcoin, despite being launched several years after Bitcoin mainnet and with a something similar to[1] Bitcoin's 10-minute average block interval.\nIndirectly, there are several reasons the time warp attack is less practical on Bitcoin mainnet than testnet3 or altcoins like Verge:\nObvious: once blocks used in a time-warp attack are broadcast, anyone can see that median-time-past (the monotonic clock in Bitcoin) is lagging far behind real time.\nSlow: the time warp attack exploits the formula used for retargeting, but retargeting only runs once every 2,016 blocks (two weeks at normal rate) and can only reduce difficulty by a maximum of 75% per period. Now, 75% is a lot, but so is spending two weeks executing a publicly-visible attack. Further difficulty increases can be executed faster due to the modified difficulty, but they're still pretty slow: 3.5 days for the second retarget; about 1 day for the third; about 6 hours for the fourth; etc...\nEasily fixable by miners: if honest miners control the majority of the hashrate, they can simply refuse to build on top of blocks whose timestamps are too far in the past. If median-time-past is restored to its normal trailing average before the end of the initial 2,016-block retarget period, difficulty won't be changed any more than normal.\nIf all these reasons do indeed provide indirect mitigation, then why do we see the attack on testnet3 every few months? Mainly because testnet3 uses the same SHA256d proof of work function as Bitcoin and so anyone who wants to mine blocks really quick can hook up some modern ASIC miners to create a bunch of testnet blocks quickly. This would normally rapidly increase difficulty, but the increase is prevented using the time warp attack. That said, in at least one case in the past where a time warp attacker made testnet3 unusable for an extended amount of time, some generous person pointed their own huge mining rig at testnet3 to overwhelm the attacker and bring difficulty back up.\nOn Bitcoin mainnet, if the attack was ever executed, I think the story would be different. Within days, a large percentage of the userbase would know the attack was ramping up and would start to pressure honest miners to reject the attacker's blocks. I personally expect miners would comply (as the next step would be for people to start throwing around phrases like \"PoW function change\"), which would defeat the attacker and cost him expected revenue for every rejected block.\nIf attackers expect the scenario would play out basically the same way I think it would, then there's no point in them starting the attack in the first place---which I think is what ultimately prevents time warp attacks on Bitcoin.\n[1] Testnet3, unlike Bitcoin, has a rule that if no block has been mined within 20 minutes (according to block header time), that a miner can create a difficulty-1 block (the lowest difficulty). That means that even completely honest mining on testnet3 is faster than on mainnet, as on mainnet something like 20% of blocks take longer than 20 minutes to find.\nSome extra notes:\nA fork could change the retarget calculation to use median-time-past instead of raw block header time. This could fix the time warp attack on Bitcoin, but it would probably have to be a hard fork.\nSince the BIP113 soft fork, median-time-past has been used to restrict which nLockTime transactions miners can include in their blocks. Not many transactions use nLockTime with a time at present, but if there was a time warp attack, users could start doing so to create a large fee incentive for miners to bring median-time-past closer to real time.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "d. harding", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T19:50:06.036+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32209, "moreResultsAvailable": 15409, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=16800", "requestsLeft": 494}
