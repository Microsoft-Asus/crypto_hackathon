Bitcoin is…an irrefutable demonstration of spontaneous order in action. — Francis Pouliot\nCryptocurrency is a perfect example of catallaxy and of a remedy for its polar opposite: central planning. The opposites are at war, of course.\nThe concept of “catallaxy” is similar to that of “spontaneous order,” but the latter concept can be broadly applied to most areas of life. Catallaxy applies specifically to how economic order emerges in a system through the uncoordinated and diverse actions of individuals who pursue their own self-interests. The social theorist Friedrich Hayek defined it as “the order brought about by the mutual adjustment of many individual economies in a market”.\nThe obscure term captures a dynamic that is essential to the creation of civilization: cooperation. If human beings are to rise above the level of Robinson Crusoe or savagery, then they must interact to mutual advantage. Historically, the “cooperation” is usually orchestrated by a central authority-a government, a tribal leader, a religion-that negates the voice of the individual. One reason people agree to be silenced is because they worship the authority, which makes them willingly or unthinkingly sabotage their individualism.\nAnd yet, human beings are conflicted. Most hope to be the type of person who would stand between a lynch mob and the black man it is hunting. There is a yearning to be heroic and unique, even if it is expressed by standing in a crowd in which everyone yells, “I am unique!” This is not always hypocrisy. It is often a conflicted but honest response to two antagonistic urges: worship of authority; and, the need to feel real as an individual.\nRecent centuries have given us a new paradigm of how cooperation creates civilization-a paradigm other than control from on high. Civilization rises from the grassroots. It arises through the uncoordinated and voluntary association of individuals and groups. It comes from catallaxy, which is sometimes called “catallactics.” The concept was a long-sought-after intellectual breakthrough that allowed free-market advocates to explain the evolution of society without a central authority.\nIn his masterpiece Human Action , Ludwig von Mises attributed the concept’s origin to the 19 th century economist and academic Richard Whately who wrote, “A[dam] Smith, indeed, has designated his work a treatise on the Wealth of Nations ; but this supplies a name only for the subject-matter, not for the science itself. The name I should have preferred as the most descriptive, and on the whole least objectionable, is that of catallactics, or the ‘Science of Exchanges’.” Whately sought what Mises called praxeology-the science of human action-but he focused on economics.\nDigital currencies are the most fascinating example of economic spontaneous order that has occurred in decades. It may not seem to be grassroots economics because it is so technologically sophisticated, but it is as grassroots as it gets. As a practical matter, however, free-market crypto stumbles over an obstacle. Users still buy into the trickle-down version of organization, and they tend to surrender their independence to centralized exchanges that function as central banks. Like banks, the exchanges maintain control of deposits, which is de facto ownership, and they report all transactions to the government. People are free to choose for themselves, of course, but central powers inevitably violate the principle of free choice by banning anything that competes with them for power or money.\nThus, the ideological struggle within crypto is between centralization and decentralization. Governments need the first to control the economy; individuals need the second to achieve financial independence. There can be no compromise between the two because they are antithetical. But, as a matter of brute reality, both operate side by side within most societies because they each satisfy a competing urge within many human beings: a desire for authority, and a desire to be free. Authorities benefit tremendously, of course, and their motives are clear. But they could not prevail if a sufficient percentage of the population did not agree enough to go along.\nBoth government and the free market provide conflicting models for social order and civilization.\nNo one championed the free-market dynamic more vigorously than Hayek. He argued persistently against what he called “constructive rationalism”-the belief that social order should be constructed by a central authority. He argued that it should not be but also that it could not be constructed. All that could emerge was government-imposed order, which was the opposite of social order. Hayek’s definition from The Constitution of Liberty : “ Order with reference to society thus means essentially that individual action is guided by successful forethought, that people not only make effective use of their knowledge but can also foresee with a high degree of confidence what collaboration they can expect from others.”\nHayek’s arguments differ from the usual crypto critique of trusted third parties because he does not dwell on the corruption of the system. He focuses on its disutility. Satoshi Nakamoto’s White Paper also touches on the practical flaws of the central banking system, but Hayek differs from Satoshi as well. Satoshi offers precise critiques of real practices; Hayek offers fundamental critiques of the inherent inability of the system to provide what it claims. Another way to state this: conceivably, the faults addressed by Satoshi could be corrected because they are practices. The faults attacked by Hayek are insurmountable because they form the ideological foundation of central planning.\nCentralization Versus Decentralization\nHe knew first-hand the consequences of central planning, which he called rational constructivism. Hayek had witnessed the devastation of classical liberalism by two world wars, but especially by World War I, which broke the mold of the free market. Wartime governments clamped centralized control over the private sector to ensure the flow of armaments and other “necessary” goods. Governments inflated their monies to pay for massive military build-ups. And war strangled the flow of free trade that classical liberals considered to be a prerequisite to peace, prosperity, and freedom. In short, Hayek had watched as 20 th century statism replaced 19 th century classical liberalism. Central planning was the mechanism through which freedom had been destroyed.\nIn response, Hayek developed a sophisticated system of social theory to explain how the institutions of society naturally evolved from the bottom up, which meant they could evolve once more. He maintained that the natural institutions of society were the collective and unintended results of human action. Even complex social phenomena-such as religion, language, or money-were the unintended consequences of individual interactions. For example, no central authority decided to invent human speech, let alone to design a language as specific as English. Acting solely to achieve their own ends, individuals began making sounds to facilitate getting what they wanted from others, whether the goal was economic or more personal. Speech resulted from human action but not from human design, and it naturally evolved into language. The evolution may not have proceeded with scientific efficiency, but it was efficient enough to speed along the development of civilization. The efficiency of government programs suffer by comparison, to say the least.\nYet constructivists claimed that an unplanned society is chaos. With sufficient knowledge and a scientific approach, a perfectly efficient society could be engineered. No surpluses, no scarcities, no waste. Stock markets would not crash, and currencies would not fluctuate. Society could be designed so that its members walked in unison toward the same desirable social goals, just as they marched toward victory in war.\nHayek bluntly stated that the knowledge constructivists sought is unattainable. It is not possible to plan the dynamics of tomorrow based on yesterday; predictions may be possible but knowledge is not. It is impossible because people and circumstances are erratic. Even a small thing, like the price of bread yesterday, does not give knowledge of the price tomorrow or what a person will be willing to pay. The price of bread might skyrocket due to a shortage, or the person might value the loaf differently. Using yesterday to engineer tomorrow goes against a fundamental tenet of human action: the principle of inevitable change. Human beings are fundamentally different from the physical objects examined by the hard sciences. A scientist can learn everything he needs to know about the behavior of an object, and the information might not change over time. But human beings act on psychological factors and motivations that are hidden, often from themselves. Society does not consist of objects that can be neatly categorized and made to obey the laws of science. Society consists of unpredictable individuals who react to changing circumstances.\nIn Human Action , Mises commented, “Human action originates change. As far as there is human action there is no stability, but ceaseless alteration…The prices of the market are historical facts expressive of a state of affairs that prevailed at a definite instant of the irreversible historical process….In the imaginary-and, of course, unrealizable-state of rigidity and stability there are no changes to be measured. In the actual world of permanent change there are no fixed points…”\nConclusion\nThroughout the work of Hayek and Mises, two closely related concepts emerge again and again: methodological individualism, and spontaneous order. The two concepts are an essential part of the ideological backbone that forms the structure of cryptocurrency. They also explain why the explosion of freedom brought by crypto was so unexpected. It sprang from individuals and from freedom of action.\nCryptocurrency resembles the lone-gunman theory. History stumbles along a fairly steady, though not necessarily salutary path. Then a lone gunman jumps out of nowhere and shoots Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, or some other prominent figure. In the case of Franz, the assassination sparked WWI. History changed forever.\nThe centralized financial world was stumbling along a path until crypto jumped out of the bushes and assassinated the banking system. Economic history changed forever, and it cannot be undone. But, to understand the power and potential of crypto, a clear sense of spontaneous order is necessary.

Bitcoin is trading higher by 3.05%, making it a lower crypto performer on the day. IOTA was today’s worst performer, with gains of 2.54%, while Ripple also traded higher on the session with gains of 5.19%. Today’s Top Crypto Performances\nThe trend in cryptocurrencies remained higher on the day, which is not moving in-line with the longer-term outlook for the asset class. Bitcoin underperformed most of the major cryptocurrencies today, but technical analysis readings suggest that this may not continue tomorrow. Chart View: Bitcoin / U.S. Dollar (Short-Term)\nSupport Level: 7590\nResistance Level: 7690\nPrice Direction: Sideways to Higher\nOn the short-term time frames, Bitcoin is showing sideways to higher readings. Against the U.S. dollar, the price of Bitcoin has moved up over the last 24 hours. Market prices are now trading at 7658 against the USD. Bitcoin is trading at the upper end of its recent trading range, and the technical indicator readings have turned neutral at 60. The RSI indicator is stalling, which indicates a decline in momentum. If we see a break of the resistance on the 15-minute charts, traders will likely consider moving into new long positions in BTC. Chart View: Bitcoin / U.S. Dollar (Long-Term)\nSupport Level: 7090\nResistance Level: 7930\nPrice Direction: Down\nOn the long-term time frames, the picture is much more bearish. Bitcoin has been caught in a downtrend since May 4, 2018. Bitcoin is trading at the lower end of its long-term trading range, and this suggests that contrarian crypto traders might take advantage of these lower levels to buy the cryptocurrency and try pushing prices higher. Long-term, the technical indicator readings are rising, suggesting overbought conditions . The RSI indicator is trading near 60, which indicates rising momentum. On the other hand, if we see a break of the support on the 4-hour charts, traders will likely consider moving into new short positions in BTC. Bitcoin Trader’s Outlook\nThe recent market activity in Bitcoin suggests a mixed outlook for the market-leading cryptocurrency. Short-term indicators are bullish, and a break of resistance could force a retest of the previous highs near 7690. Long-term indicators are more negative, and a break of the prevailing support could inspire bearish trading activity for Bitcoin traders interested in taking long-term positions.

Pantera Capital has seen Bitcoin as a valuable investment and made a fortune out of BTC.\nDuring the interview, Dan was asked about the institutional investors entering the space as a big catalyst and the way for them to invest.\nThe CEO said:\n“I think there’s an image that there’s an On/Off switch. It’s Off now and they will flick it and the institutions will pile in. We have had institutional investors since 2013 and its a process. Obviously, risk and reward go together. A couple of years ago, there was a lot of risks but there was a lot of rewards.”\nHe further added:\n“We have yet to get to the point. where we have an S.E.C custodian, but institutions are buying the rumour and selling the fact, -getting invested now so that in 3, 4, 5 months when the institutional quality regulated custodian that we are hearing about come on line, they will already have their positions.”\nPantera Capital Management is a firm and an investment hedge fund with concentrates mainly on tokens, projects, ventures related to the technology of blockchain, digital currency and digital assets. The company holds $1 billion in the market of cryptocurrencies.\nWhen the CEO was asked whether he was active in trading around Bitcoin position and where does he see value in terms of the price level.\nHe said:\n“In our view, all cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now, they are down, 65% from their highs. At the highs, everybody wants to get invested. It’s much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally and goes, and there is a good technical indicator that we look at when the currency breaks through. Its 200-day moving average, if you buy that day and sell a year later, you make an average of 239%. It is a very simple strategy.”\nDan Morehead, runs one of the world’s largest crypto hedge funds. He is also the former head and CEO of Macro Trading at Tiger Management. He recently foretold that Bitcoin will be worth 10 or 100 times more of what it worths at the present.\nAlphaSeeker, a Twitter user commented:\n“Because he needs an exit….His fund is down over 50% in the last few weeks and he needs YOU to come in and BUY”\nRobin Dirickx replied:\n“His fund is averaging 25000% profit at the moment.”\nCharles Thomas commented:\n“Hilarious 🤣 but keep the fraud alive by constantly promoting it.”\ntraderblast commented:\n“You asked ZERO hard questions of this guy.

GMO Internet Inc. announced the launch via a statement on its website on May 31, 2018. The move represents the latest attempt to integrate the emerging crypto market into the mainstream gaming industry. CryptoChips: A Bitcoin Gaming Rewards Application\nCryptoChips is an application that will allow players to earn Bitcoin as rewards for playing mobile games. Players can earn these rewards by unlocking hidden levels, completing challenging missions, and several other milestones. According to GMO, CryptoChips will be premiered on its “ Whimsical War ” mobile game. Whimsical War is a real-time battle game available for both iPhone and Android smartphones.\nAccording to the CryptoChips launch announcement:\nCryptoChips can be mounted on the game application and allows players to receive cryptocurrency as remuneration within the game – like a “secret pocket money”– depending on the players’ rankings or when players have achieved missions or acquired items. The players must also have their own wallets (cryptocurrency accounts) to receive the remuneration (cryptocurrencies). The Continuing GMO Internet and Bitcoin Love Affair\nThis latest move by GMO is another step toward the company’s goal of becoming a leading figure in the global Bitcoin market. According to the company, part of the reason behind the CryptoChips launch is to increase cryptocurrency awareness around the world. By so doing, GMO is leveraging the popularity of the global gaming industry to facilitate the advancement and adoption of cryptocurrencies.\nGMO Internet is heavily involved in Bitcoin mining . The company began its mining activities in December 2017 with an initial investment of $3 million, choosing Northern Europe as its base of operations. The choice of Northern Europe as the location was based on the availability of cheap electricity as well as the favorable climate. In the space of three months, the company recouped its investment, having earned more than $3 million mining Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. By May 2018, GMO announced that it had so far mined more than 900 BTC and 500 BCH .\nApart from Bitcoin mining, GMO Internet operates a cryptocurrency exchange and wallet service . In fact, the wallet and crypto exchange platform was the company’s first foray into the world of cryptocurrencies. In December 2017, GMO also announced that it pays a percentage of staff salaries in Bitcoin .\nWill CryptoChips improve cryptocurrency adoption among members of the gaming community?

Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy. News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system .

There are a couple of organizations worth mentioning when speaking about blockchain usecases for Charity. The list includes organizations such as The World Food Programme, the Red Cross, Wikimedia, EFF, Save the Children, or Alice, which all have participated in various blockchain-based projects.Also, the World Food Programme (WFP), which started as an experimental project in 2017, has been able to raise funds for over 10,000 Syrian refugees using cryptocurrencies. Last year in March, Britain’s Start Network teamed up with the social enterprise startup Disberse to use blockchain technology for charitable purposes. Recently, The English Heritage Organisation, a UK-based charity that oversees the care for historic sites, saw the great features that blockchains had to offer and implemented them to develop new ways of interacting with donors.The charity partnered with Giftcoin to allow donors the tracking of payments from the time they were made to when the funds are being spent. It can help catering to war refugees, help provide support for natural disaster survivors around the world, or be used to send the less privileged to school by giving and raising funds via blockchain payments. The application of blockchains for charity purposes has brought grand innovation schemes to the technology as it allows donations for charity to become traceable and comprehensible, thereby making the whole system protected and fool-proof.

Here’s our populous review. What is populous?\nPopulous is a blockchain technology platform that lets you sell your invoices online and take control of your cash flow. The company is rebuilding invoice and trade finance using their blockchain technology.\nFound online at populous.Co, the platform is a mix between blockchain and invoice finance. It relies on blockchain technologies like XBRL, smart contracts, stable tokens, and more to create a unique trading environment for investors and invoice sellers worldwide.\nUsing populous, companies can sell invoices quickly, then redeem their populous digital tokens for real-world fiat currencies. They can do this in a cheaper, faster, and more transparent way than what is currently available through conventional invoice marketplaces. The price of bitcoin\nThe overall goal of populous is to make a new, next-generation financial marketplace. To date, populous is the first and only invoice and trade finance platform on the ethereum blockchain. It allows you to buy and sell invoices globally.\nThe ecosystem is based around the use of populous’s custom tokens called pokens, which are pegged 1 to 1 with fiat currencies around the world. The value of pokens is backed by investors who deposit funds on the platform to finance invoices.\nYou can sell your invoice for pokens, then redeem those pokens for currencies in the real world. It’s just like selling an invoice through an ordinary marketplace, but with cheaper transaction fees and faster processing thanks to blockchain technology. How does populous work?\nPopulous is based around the distribution of pokens. The price of bitcoin\nOnce invoices are financed by investors, pokens are sent to invoice sellers (also known as borrowers). Pokens can be exchanged for fiat currency or transferred to an external ethereum wallet.\nPokens work in two different ways: inside and outside the platform. Inside the platform, populous manages an internal ledger with the balances of each borrower’s and investor’s accounts for each currency. Outside the platform, populous offers a publicly accessible smart contract for each token.\nThe tokens are based on the ERC20 token standard. The populous blockchain itself is a combination of the ethereum and RSK blockchains. Other technologies in use with populous include XBRL, the Z score formula, smart contracts, stable tokens, and others.\nYou can view more detailed technical information about populous at the company’s whitepaper here. The price of bitcoin how to use populous\nThere are three main parties in the populous ecosystem, including the administrator, borrower, and investor.

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

In an email recently sent to customers of the exchange, Golix sought to clarify that it has been granted “an interim relief,” that its accounts have not yet been restored, and that legal proceedings are currently still ongoing.\nAlso Read: The Top Ten Altcoin Markets of 2014 – How Are They Faring Now? Golix Discusses Appealing Zimbabwe’s Cryptocurrency Ban\nGolix states that on the 11th of May, “the RBZ issue[d] a circular to all the banks instructing them to close all of our bank accounts,” however, a “60-day window” was given to the exchange. On the 15th of May, Golix “issued a statement to [their] customers” informing customers that the company was “aware of the directive” and had “started the process of engaging the RBZ” to discuss and address the central bank’s concerned.\nIn response, the RBZ “issue[d] a second circular that was addressed to Golix where they instructed Golix to cease all operations immediately” on the 17th of May, with Golix adding that all of their bank accounts had been closed by the following day. On the 21st of May, Golix “file[d] an urgent chamber application at the High Court requesting the ban on Golix to be lifted.” Golix Granted “Interim Relief” by High Court\nThe exchange states that on the 24th of May, 2018, “the High Court grant[ed] Golix an interim relief that lifts the ban on cryptocurrencies by the Central Bank.” Despite comprising positive news, the exchange states that “The interim relief does not guarantee that we will get our bank accounts reopened.”\nGolix emphasized that “the court case is still ongoing,” meaning that the “interim relief is only valid until the outcome of the case is determined in court.” The exchange added that “Because the case is still in court, we cannot comment on questions that are related to the case and this is the response you will get if you contact anyone on the Golix Team to make an inquiry that is related to this case.”\n“We are working hard to get our bank accounts reopened and we will send another update to let you know how this goes,” the exchange said. Ramifications of Interim Relief for Customers\nGolix has sought to deter customers from depositing funds with the exchange, stating “Please do not make any deposits into Golix until we have announced that we have resumed trading. If you try to deposit funds to our bank accounts right now, it may take weeks before we are able to recover those funds because, unless we tell the bank in advance, those funds will go straight to a suspense account.”\nThe exchange added: “Although we are working hard to have our bank accounts reopened, we have started a separate conversation with banks to allow us to send customer funds we are holding back to the customers and because the bank would like to limit the activity on the accounts, we cannot be able to process withdrawals as often as we used to […] Because of the logistics involved in processing withdrawals, we encourage every customer to initiate the withdrawal of the funds in their Golix accounts between Monday and Wednesday so that we have all the withdrawals processed on Friday.”\nGolix also recommended that customers not store their funds on the exchanges, stating “We recommend that you initiate a withdrawal your crypto and/or fiat funds right now until we recommend that we have resumed trading.”\nDo you think that Golix will be successful in appealing the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe’s cryptocurrency ban?

But what if the biggest innovations moving forward come from a bunch of smaller gorillas, operating profitably and autonomously? That’s what the “meta layer” is all about and blockchain is an enabler.\nThere is a great deal of blockchain investment talk about fat protocols and decentralized applications, but the big value will be in the layers that connect this ecosystem. The meta layer is a horizontal layer that accesses all your data across all apps, across all domains.\nThe meta layer is a horizontal layer that accesses all your data across all apps, across all domains.\nLet’s use the video domain as an example: It’s similar to how Apple TV brings together Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, HBO, and iTunes content into one frictionless interface through the (unimpressively named) “TV” app. It’s a meta app that pulls from all your various services and data sources, from all of your domains including video, social, physiological, knowledge, and empathy among others.\nHowever, with blockchain, that aggregated data will not reside with one centralized company. Instead, it will be in your personal data wallet, with discreet bits shared only with select service providers — and only with your conscious intention. A world of missed opportunities\nRight now, there’s an avalanche of personal data that goes unused. Your sleep habits are measured by your Apple watch, your gym app knows whether you checked in for yoga, your Fitbit knows your stress levels, Facebook knows how much you’ve been messaging your partner, Amazon Kindle knows what you read this week, United knows you went on a trip with friends to Utah, Instagram has the photos, etc.\nThis is crucial data that we’re not examining the way we should. Why not? There is too much friction in sharing and connecting data right now. Companies don’t want to share data. Their data, I mean YOUR DATA, is their competitive asset. Customers don’t trust companies with privacy. Data is siloed. There is a lack of transparency. It requires additional computing power. There are transactions costs.\nThere is too much friction in sharing and connecting data right now.\nAnd there’s also a major friction problem with the input/output of data. The purpose of the phone is to be an input/output device to get to an app. And the purpose of an app is to be an input/output device to get to a feature. So there’s a minimum of two points of friction right there, just to get to the feature that you actually want to use – and many more steps to find the actual piece of content you seek.\nAnd the way we currently navigate that world is via hundreds of different apps. They’re vertical silos. You go into the bottom, climb back out, go into another one, etc. It’s too much hassle. Seriously, think about this.\nYou may say this feels pretty easy and way better compared to how it was 10 years ago. But remember, before we saw a touchscreen iphone in 2007, no one felt they needed a touchscreen iphone. Decentralization can change the game\nBlockchain will help us collect this data and connect the dots in new ways. It provides distributed layers of computing power from core to edge, data extraction, data mobility, and trustless, frictionless transactions. Of course, we can do (most) all these things today without blockchain — but we can’t do it at a mass consumer scale across disparate applications. Don’t trust a centralized corporation to enable it for us.\nIn the future, decentralized world of applications, there may be no 800 pound gorillas like Facebook and YouTube. They will be replaced by 800 gorillas that are 1 pound each, operating across different sectors with microeconomic fairness for all participants, including audience, creators, widget providers, curators, analysts, writers, and much more.\nAnd those smaller gorillas are going to solve different issues within their respective ecosystems. They’re going to be hyperfocused on providing solutions to their niche cohorts. And they will be independently profitable — this is a game changer. How many pure play video copy protection technical solutions do you know to be sustainably profitable today? Think privacy, copy protection, community comments, streaming quality, customer service and many more critical applications, no longer needing to be rolled up and “acquired” as an exit strategy, but instead coexisting together yet autonomously, exchanging liquid currency between them, creating a vibrant digital economy that’s no longer controlled by a few companies.\nIn the current system, the incentives are not properly aligned for the good of the community. The incentives are aligned for shareholders. But isn’t this backwards since the count of the community members that use these services far outnumber the count of shareholders? Think about it, Netflix subscribers outnumber Netflix shareholders, Facebook users outnumber Facebook shareholders. Blockchain can help switch this paradigm and better align the interests of the shareholder and the customer.\nBlockchain can help align the interests of the shareholder and the customer. Situational awareness and recommendations on steriods\nThis will give us “situational awareness,” where the right apps are in front of us at the right time. If I’m walking to work, that’s the wrong time to show me Netflix’s “what to watch” options — but it’s a great time to present me with a discount on coffee at a nearby café or a shift in the weather. This is when I need quick alerts, not a 15 minute read on Medium.\nSituational awareness: The right apps are in front of us at the right time.\nWe’re going to be covered with this layer of applications that are situationally aware of what’s going on in our lives and the power of it will be enormous.\nWhen data comes out of its silo, it will bring a whole new depth to recommendation engines too. We’ll be able to reach deep in the preferences of our network, following a ladder of interrelated desires to pinpoint what’s right for us, right now.\nFor example: Headspace captures my meditation habits, Seamless captures what I ate for lunch this week, my Apple watch is pinging my sleep and heartbeat patterns, my Mindbody app has my workout history, the Moon Phase app is capturing changes on gravitational pull and the amount of light I’m seeing at night, Facebook knows my girlfriend broke up with me, and 23andMe has my genome mapped.\nCombining and connecting these data silos provides a predictive layer that will know what’s right for me at all times. But it’s not just a bottomless recommendation engine, it’s based on both my real time data graph as well as years of my data along with the anonymized data of people with similar profiles. Access and privacy\nThe data is already out there. You can download all of your shopping data for the last several years from Amazon. On LinkedIn, you can download detailed information on your contacts. It’s incredible what you can find there. Yet these companies don’t make it easy for you to find, download, and use your data. They want to keep it siloed.\nSovereign data wallets and others will solve for this. Someone is going to figure out privacy and make it, gasp, fun for us to manage our data. Security will be gamified. You’ll swipe on data to share/hide the way you do with potential mates on Tinder. We’ll all have a much stronger grasp over our privacy (or be okay with letting it go).\nOne reason we don’t have that now is because pure play privacy is not a standalone profitable business. You have to have it plugged into Facebook or whatever. But in the future, we’ll be exchanging value via tokens and the privacy game will change. This is another way blockchain will be key to the meta layer process.\nIn the future, we’ll be exchanging value via tokens and the privacy game will change.\nLet’s look at a couple of use cases… Sample gorilla: Sports\nLet’s say Suzy in Ohio has created a new trading cards application and Joseph in Taiwan has created a new fantasy sports application. They meet in an online community, and decide to team up and use a Swiss startup company that’s created a data wallet as a kernel in their platform. So now you’ve got three of these small “gorillas” getting together and seeing network effects from what they’re doing on their small scale. Others are going to want to plug into that ecosystem too: ESPN, the NFL, Nike, and/or people who sell sports memorabilia on eBay. Once there’s a platform with targeted users like this, others will want to join up. The network effects expand exponentially, and economic abundance is spread across the tiny gorillas. 0_ln8WvNa-d--rlYEF.jpg 906x576 147 KB Sample gorilla: Health\nLet’s say you use the Headspace app to meditate. Well, there’s a whole log of data in there about how often you meditate. And that’s going to get more robust in the future. Plus, you might be journaling in another app, tracking your yoga practice in another, monitoring your sleep patterns in yet another. And think about what happens when we combine that data with data on the serotonin levels in our brain, the cortisol levels in our blood, etc.\nOnce we start to connect these dots and understand our behavior, we’ll make better decisions about buying products, participating in events, who we want to see. Think about that future compared to how Facebook/Netflix/other companies make recommendations to you today.\nCollecting data across these different “gorillas” builds a data profile about me that really represents who I am, what I’m feeling, and what I’m ready to do right now. So when I go to buy lunch, I might get an alert that I should increase my sugar intake by three grams because my metabolism is fast today or whatever. That’s the future where the blockchain meta layer becomes social network 3.0 in a way that’s genuinely useful.\nCollecting data across these different “gorillas” builds a data profile about me that really represents who I am. The smart investment approach to the meta layer\nWho is going to create this meta layer? Most great innovations happen by accident so here’s my prediction: It will start when someone finds a killer combination of two smaller apps. After a few of these, there will be killer app combinations that “bond” with other killer app combinations.\nSoon, the network effect and law of accelerating returns will take hold. We’ll see a snowball effect, the world’s new mega-social network will form itself. It will dynamically change, adding arms and removing legs. Eventually, 4 billion people will be connected digitally in a way that is orders of magnitude more sophisticated than Facebook today. And the enablers for the meta layer will be communication and visualization technologies on distributed ledgers that reduce friction for all of this data to connect, process, and be interpreted.\nEventually, 4 billion people will be connected digitally in a way that is orders of magnitude more sophisticated than Facebook today. Advice for investors\n“I am looking to invest in a decentralized Facebook.” That is the wrong way of thinking. Instead, look to invest first in basic layer technology on distributed ledgers. Then identify those first few killer app combination use cases. The social network of the future will be decentralized. It won’t have a singular name the way we acknowledge Facebook or Twitter today. Rather the social network will be a digitally connected layer of bi-directional data streams you have authorized from different sources. The data connections will be endless and the user will be in complete control. Welcome to the world of tiny gorillas!\nSome areas to pay attention to include sovereign data wallets, cross chain interoperability, and decentralized exchange protocols.

BCH prices tested the $1030 level, but eventually, it failed to move past the stated resistance. Following the $1030 level was a significant downside reaction that moved BCH prices towards the $980 level, breaking several retracement levels including the $945 low at the $1033 high against the USD.\nHowever, the decline by the pair fell short as more BCH buyers bought at $980 support level. The $945 low acted as support as well as $1033 high also serving as support. At the time of this writing, BCH prices were valued at $980. If the BCH/USD pair is to move below $980, the next possible support level would be at $950. On the upside, there seems to be a significant bullish trend developing forming a resistance near $1020.\nThe BCH/USD pair charts seem to be facing near significant resistance levels at $1020 and $1040. At the $1040, BCH/USD needs a break and close for buyers to take control and lead to a bullish trend past the $1040 resistance level. Above $1040, buyers would likely form another resistance level at $1100.\nBitcoin Cash currently has a market cap of $16.86 billion where a total volume of $557 million was traded in the past 24 hours. Understandably, the slide in the market cap of Bitcoin Cash can be linked to the poor overall performance of the entire cryptocurrency market in the month of May. The performance of BCH cannot be pointed out to any technical glitch or loss of user case application. It should be noted that Bitcoin Cash has had more bears in the month of May than it did in the month of April. For this reason, many critics are satisfied with the performance of BCH/USD.\nWhat is even more encouraging about the shape of the BCH/USD pair charts is the fact that retracements are followed by higher highs just as was the case in April. BCH buyers have made it a habit of reappearing when BCH prices are at their lower lows in short time frames. Following the bullish candlestick that was the order of the day yesterday, BCH traders should expect to see undervaluation in the lower time frame charts which might be in plenty, and trade the pair with the trends. Buyers should look to a target value of $1700 and enter a stop loss at $900.\nIn conclusion, the last 24 hours have seen BCH scale up the bull ladder against the USD. There is high probability chance that BCH could continue scaling up in the days to come. The BCH/USD pair has continued to perform well despite the news of the full node migration problem and the good news of listed at the De Vere and this opens up BCH to a new pool of investors. In the meantime, BCH is continuing to consolidate below $1040 against USD, but given the prevailing market conditions, BCH/USD pair could gain momentum above $1040.

Like my Moore’s Law article, this is an excerpt from a much larger article. It’s good enough to serve as a standalone piece because the misconception this aims to put to rest is a commonly raised one that becomes annoyingly repetitive. The full article this is cropped from will be linked at the end when it’s published. Understanding the Bitcoin network without math. Bitcoin is more than just a chain of blocks. I want to help you understand how Bitcoin’s blockchain network is designed because it’ll help you fill in some gaps as you begin to acquire more knowledge in this field. I say blockchain network because Bitcoin also has a payment channel network (lightning) layered on top of it that doesn’t effect the structure of the blockchain network. I won’t be discussing Bitcoin’s lightning network in this article though, as it’s not that relevant to the points I’ll make. Below is a rough example of the Bitcoin network scaled down to 1000 fully validating nodes (there’s really 115,000 currently) . Each node here has 8 connections to other nodes, because this is the default amount of connections the client makes without any changes made to it. My node is in here somewhere, and if you’re running one, it’s in there too. Coinbase’s nodes are in there, Bitmain’s nodes are in there, and if Satoshi is still around, Satoshi’s node is in there too. Please note that this is just a diagram, and that the real network topology can (and probably does) vary from this. Some nodes have more than the default amount of connections while others may opt to connect to a limited number or stay behind just one other node. There’s no way to know what it actually looks like because it’s designed with privacy in mind (although some monitoring companies certainly try to get very close approximations) and nodes can routinely changed who their peers are. I started with that diagram because I want you to understand that there are no differences in these nodes because they all fully validate. This means they all check the entire chain to make sure each and every transaction and block follow the rules. This will prove to be important as I explain further. The ones on the inside are no different than the ones on the outside, they all have the same amount of connections. When you start up a brand new node, it finds peers and becomes one of the hive. The longest distance in this graph from any of these nodes to another is 6. In real life there are some deviations to this distance because finding new peers isn’t a perfectly automated process that distributes everyone evenly, but generally, adding more nodes to the network doesn’t change this. There are 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon, and in 6 hops my transaction is in the hands of (almost) every node, if it’s valid. I’m going to select “my” node from this group and drag it out, so I can demonstrate what happens when I create a transaction and announce it to the network. Below you’ll see my node all the way to the right, and then you’ll see the 8 other nodes (peers) that mine is connected to. When I create a transaction and “send it out to the world”, it’s actually only going to these 8 peers. Since Bitcoin is designed from the ground up to make every node a fully validating node, when these 8 nodes receive my transaction they check to see if it’s valid before sending it out to their 8 peers. If my transaction is invalid it will never break the “surface” of the network. My peers will never send that bad transactions to their peers. They actually don’t even know that I created that transaction. There’s no way for them to tell, and they treat all data as equal, but if I were to keep sending invalid transaction to any of my 8 peers, they would all eventually block me. This is done by them automatically to prevent me from spamming my connection to them. No matter who you are, or how big your company is, your transaction won’t propagate if it’s invalid. Now let’s say you’re not running a full-node, but you’re using a light-client instead. Various light-clients exist for the desktop, and for your mobile phone. Some of them are Electrum, Armory, Bread, and Samourai Wallet. Light-clients tether to a specific node. Some can be set up to change the one they connect to over time, but they are still ultimately tethered. This is what tethering looks like: I want you to note that this is just a diagram, and it’s easy to demonstrate tethering using a node that happens to be on the rim, but there is no real rim, and tethering is tethering wherever that node happens to be within this diagram. I’ve highlighted this in yellow. The nodes being tethered to are green, and the blue dots are light-clients. All information going to or coming from the light-client goes through the node they’re tethered to.They depend on that node. They are not part of the network. They’re not nodes. Here’s where it gets fun, and where other people try to misrepresent how the network actually works: What if I wanted to start mining? Mining a block is the act of creating a block. Much like a transaction you want to send, you must create the block and announce it to the network. Any node can announce a new block, there’s nothing special about that process, you just need a new block . Mining has gotten increasingly difficult, but if you want you can purchase specialized hardware and connect it to your personal node. Remember that bit about invalid transactions? Same goes for blocks, but you need to understand something very specific about how blocks are created. First watch this video. I skipped to the important part about hashing, using nonces (random value) and appending the chain with that new block header : Please watch the entire thing if you have time. It’s personally my favorite video explaining how mining works. When you get to the following part in the video where the labels “Prev hash” are applied, those are the block headers: What’s not mentioned in this video is you can create valid blocks headers even if all the transactions inside the block are invalid . It still requires the same amount of time to mine blocks with invalid transactions as it does to mine a block with valid transactions. The incentive to spend all that time and energy creating such a block would be to push through a transaction that rewards you with Bitcoin that aren’t yours. This is why it’s important that all nodes check not just the block headers, but the transactions as well . This is what stops miners from spending that time. Because all nodes check, no miners can cheat the system. If all nodes didn’t check you’d have to rely on the ones that do check. This would separate nodes into “types”, and the only type that would matter would be the ones that check. So what if you join a mining pool? You might do this because mining is too difficult for you to do alone, or if you’re a slightly larger entity you might prefer a steady income as opposed to a sporadic one. Many miners do this, and they connected their specialized hardware directly to a mining pool using an entirely different protocol call the Stratum mining protocol . Just like creating a transaction with your non-node cellphone, you don’t have to run a node to connect your hardware to a mining pool. You can mine without running a node, and many miners do exactly that. Here’s what that looks like below in blue. I’ve used Slush Pool for this example: Remember, I dragged these pool-run nodes out of the diagram for demonstration purposes. Just like any other node, these pool-run nodes need peers. They need peers to receive transactions & blocks, and they need peers to announce blocks they create. Allow me to reiterate again: All nodes validate all blocks and all transactions. If any of these pools announce an invalid block, their peers will know because they fully-validate , and they won’t send it out to other nodes. Just like transactions, invalid blocks do not enter the network. Here’s another way to look at this without pulling these nodes out from the diagram. Below is a private miner who doesn’t want to be known, it has 8 random peers, and none of those peers knows that it’s a miner . Again, this is intensionally designed this way for privacy reasons. There’s no way for any node in the network to know that the block they received was created by their peer, or relayed by their peer. All they know is if it’s valid or not, and if it is they send it along, if it’s not, they don’t. Hopefully you’re getting the picture, and I don’t believe I used any fancy math or equations to get here. I’d like to move on because I feel like this is complete coverage, but there is one final thing I’d like to address because it’s this final aspect that is used to confuse others who don’t fully understand everything I just explained. It’s so rampantly used that I need to address it. https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1000232465540136960 My original comment was talking about light-clients, also called SPV clients, and how they aren’t part of the network. I demonstrated this above with the blue tethered dots. His follow-up comment tries to imply that nodes that mine are the only nodes who’s rejection matters. Remember: nodes have no way of knowing which other nodes mined a block versus who relayed a block, this was designed intentionally. Now for a final diagram so I can try and explain the logic that’s used when people say “only mining nodes matter”. Some miners connect directly to other miners so that out of their peer list with the network, some of them are also other miners. Not all miners do this . Some of these miners that connect directly also use optional relay networks like the FIBRE network being designed by Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo, but even this side-network isn’t exclusive to miners, anyone can join including you or me and it’s just there to help block relay across the network. Either way, people try to argue that this interconnectivity of “nodes that mine” (whether using something like FIBRE or not) implies they’re the only ones that matter, and it’s absurd: In this example I left the node’s peers inside the diagram. You should get the point by now. They reject invalid blocks. That group of nodes inside the green circles are most definitely not the only set of nodes that matter in this network.

By the 12 months 2140, all Bitcoin can be absolutely excavated. Because of this after that, the miners is not going to proceed to obtain bitcoins as mining incentives. Will the miners disappear consequently? How will Bitcoin blockchain safety be protected? That’s not how Bitcoin ’s foreign money is assured. For instance: Common Coin ， bitBTC . HomeBlockCoin , Soma, BlockPay, Rimbit, EthBet, MojoCoin In actual fact, the miner’s mining income consists of two components, a few of that are block rewards. The preliminary package deal of a transaction reward is 50 items of Bitcoin, halved as soon as each 4 years; the opposite half comes from transaction charges. With a purpose to make sure that their trades might be confirmed by the miners as quickly as doable, merchants normally pay them a fee charge. The upper the charge, the extra possible it’s that trades can be packaged preferentially. The existence of charges can improve the brink for switch on the one hand and stop the blockchain from being crammed with junk transactions. Then again, it may additionally encourage miners to compete for billing in order that they’ll proceed to work for Bitcoin after Bitcoin has been dug up. The safety gives safety safety. So theoretically, in spite of everything bitcoins are issued, miners have purpose to proceed mining so long as there are sufficient buying and selling wants. As well as, from the attitude of Bitcoin’s improvement historical past, the actual issue that influences the continued mining of miners just isn’t whether or not or not there are mines that may be mined, however what the income from mining are. Within the case of accelerating Bitcoin transaction quantity and processing charges, or rising Bitcoin costs, the mining income can be appreciable, and the miner’s enthusiasm for funding will rise accordingly. Miners usually are not merely involved concerning the present value of Bitcoin. I keep in mind that among the mine swimming pools used grasping algorithms and had been utilizing the facility to dig “essentially the most worthwhile foreign money”, that’s, transformed to the best greenback worth of the foreign money, however it turned out that this type of grasping algorithm isn’t any higher than at all times dug a form of The place is the nice foreign money? why? As a result of mining just isn’t initially a one-off game, cash might be saved, that’s, every miner has its personal prospects. That’s, their judgment on the longer term value of Bitcoin often is the similar or completely different. Even when Bitcoin falls by $1 in the present day, so long as the miners consider that bitcoin can nonetheless rise again sooner or later, then they won’t care concerning the present loss, however will proceed to dig down and reap the benefits of the foreign money to promote. Subsequently, considering the heterogeneity of Bitcoin beliefs, that is again to a sample of depletion. Miners want to make use of their very own time to help their beliefs. However it could be a bit higher than Bitcoin’s prospects.

A new lead to the movie business\nSlate intends to broadcast the documentary Beyond Bitcoin via its blockchain based online streaming platform Binge. The decentralized Binge platform provides low-cost, high-speed, high-definition media access for consumers worldwide, says the text of the press release.\nDuring the Cannes festival in May 2018, Slate appeared at the center of the buzz surrounding blockchain technology and its potential to alter the entertainment industry. In Cannes, Slate announced their newly formed partnership with Sitges International Fantastic Film Festival (Sitges), where Sitges will adopt its digital ticketing platform, Slatix , powered by the cryptocurrency SLATE SLX, for the purchase of tickets and festival passes.\n“This will mark the first time in industry history that a film festival will accept cryptocurrency as well as traditional forms of payment”, says the Slate press release.\nSlatix is a blockchain-based, low-cost tokenized ticketing system that aims to provide benefits to consumers based on their loyalty. According to the press release, small and medium sized enterprises can benefit from Slatix’s low setup and operating costs, while the user-friendly app is intended to simplify DIY ticket distribution and redemption. Listings and token sale\nBased in Toronto and Los Angeles, the Slate Entertainment Group has launched several media platforms on its own blockchain, including Binge and Slatix.\nSlate has launched its presale in May 2018. The public token presale will remain open until June 9, 2018. So far, the Slate team has overpassed its soft cap goal, having raised over $20 mln. The current discount is 45 percent and bonus is 3 percent.\nAs the Slate team reported to Cointelegraph, Hong Kong based HitBTC, one of the top 10 cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, will be listing SLX on its exchange. HitBTC will host SLX with trading pairs against Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether (USDT).\n“Slate Entertainment Group is especially pleased to announce the agreement during the presale as it assures buyers that they will be able to trade SLX on the open market. The listing on a major exchange will also expand SLX’s exposure to new markets and increase distribution after the initial sale” says the press release.\nDisclaimer.

Payment providers are known to discriminate against the industry, and cryptocurrencies offer the opportunity for indiscriminate payments. Sparks spoke about the industry and said that they have “if it ain’t totally broke, it doesn’t need fixing” attitude towards infrastructure of the industry in general. She also said:\n“….because of the taboo nature of the adult industry, many of the industry issues have a hard time getting heard by the rest of the world, so problems have been slowly piling up in the background over the years.”\nShe believes that the cryptocurrency industry is full of visionaries who will take notice of the problems and change it. She also said that no one in the adult industry will make the changes required and that she will be more vocal on the matter as time goes on.\nOn the free market ideas associated with cryptocurrencies, she said it was a modern and reliable way to exchange value. Individual power to make decisions that were previously not an option was also a point she mentioned.\nShe mentioned a few cryptocurrencies that she favoured. Her favourite cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin [BTC], SONM [SNM], Odyssey [OCN], Spankchain [SPANK], and Ark [ARK].\nShe spoke at length about her idea to release an instructional video series on blockchain and cryptocurrencies. The twist is that she will be doing the tutorials naked. She also spoke up about her time as a camgirl, and how she received tips. She said:\n“I was tipped pretty often in cryptocurrency, mainly because the clients had crypto and wanted to actually use it.”\nShe further mentioned that she keeps her coins in deep cold storage as opposed to a wallet. The crypto-revolution is close at hand in the adult industry, she stated. With camgirls and production companies beginning to use the technology, the systems that exist in place today to prevent payment providers from discriminating against the industry will not exist. She said:\n“These are just common issues and aren’t even all that creative. This whole industry can be flipped around by cryptocurrency, for the betterment of it. Bottom line is, people love cash, but it’s becoming more and more inconvenient to carry it.”\nShe also mentioned that crypto takes the “best parts of cash and debit cards and removes the other junk.” She said:\n“Cryptocurrency is just the natural step forward when it comes to using money in a modern society and I am convinced that that majority of us will adapt to it.” .

Sparks is a big believer in Bitcoin technology and thinks that someday in the future it will revolutionize the entire adult industry. Furthermore, Sparks is planning to film a few tutorials on how to use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but with a catch — Brenna plans on filming the educational videos naked. We decided to chat with Brenna about cryptocurrencies so our readers can get an in-depth view of how digital currencies like Bitcoin could transform the sex industry from someone who has a close perspective on how these business models operate. Cryptocurrency Will Solve All of the Current Problems in the Adult Industry\nNews.Bitcoin.com (BC): Can you tell our readers how you first got into bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?\nBrenna Sparks (BS): Silkroad! I lived in a boring old town with nothing to do, and I wanted to get weed but didn’t know any dealers. I heard about Silkroad and was guided to using Bitcoin like that, spending hundreds of Bitcoins like it was nothing. Back then I bought my Bitcoins from Silkroad members, using Greendot Moneypaks. I literally gave them money and hoped that I could trust this criminal to give me the Bitcoins! Ahhh…good times. At least, I wasn’t Goxxed.\nBC: You recently wrote a blog post about cryptocurrencies providing workers in the adult industry censorship resistance from payment processor discrimination. What prompted you to write that post?\nBS: It’s something that isn’t talked about often. Most of the people in the industry don’t really discuss how we can make our industry more advanced and safer from a tech perspective. Everyone, just sort of deals with it and has an “if it ain’t totally broke, it doesn’t need fixing” perspective. Also, because of the taboo nature of the adult industry, many of the industry issues have a hard time getting heard by the rest of the world, so problems have been slowly piling up in the background over the years.\nMy belief is that I should alert the world of potential opportunities, because if the current people in the industry don’t want to build it further, someone else will. The crypto industry is full of visionaries, so I believe sharing these problems with the crypto community will gain attention from one of these visionaries who could actually make these changes happen, because it’s become obvious that no one in the adult industry will do it. As time goes on, I’ll grow to be more elaborate on the matter.\nBC: What do you think about libertarian and free market views involved with cryptocurrencies?\nBS: This question reminds me of a time a while back when I thought to myself, “What if I could choose where my tax money went to? What if I could see exactly where it all went and when?” A few years later, this started becoming a clear reality with cryptocurrencies. The technology that exists today can completely turn the government upside down, and that would be a good thing. Technology is the way of the future.\nTechnology brings order, brings stability, brings growth, brings hope for a better future, not a government.\nI believe cryptocurrency provides many of the things a libertarian wish they could have. It’s a medium that allows us, merchants of the world, to exchange in a modern and reliable way that is free from the government, built on protocols that are open to the public to view and contribute to. Cryptocurrencies are changing the way we interact at an increasingly massive scale. We can fund whatever we wish to fund, we can raise money in ways and speeds that were never possible, and for things that we, as individuals, want or need. It provides visionaries the ability to test the most ambitious ideas that no investor would ever be able to fund, which in my opinion translates to an increase in technological growth rate.\nFinally, cryptocurrencies automate a giant list of tasks that we unnecessarily delegate to our government. In other words, the government is doing too many things that it doesn’t actually need to be doing. Humans may have various views on what is important to them, but we also share many as well. For example, a majority of human beings can agree that we need hospitals, we need proper health care, we need safe roadways and safe buildings. Even if some disagree, it doesn’t matter, it’ll get funded because that’s something a majority mass will agree with, we don’t need a government to “guarantee” that. Just as well, we don’t need a government to tell us what is legal tender, we can do that ourselves.\nWe don’t need a government producing that legal tender either, computers do a far better job at producing an acceptable medium of exchange. Finally, we don’t need a government deciding what matters on our behalf. I believe a country of millions is much more capable of making decisions than a small handful of “elected” individuals. Governments of the past and present serve as a means to an end, that’s all. The future is in less governing, and eventually no governing or autonomous governing that corresponds to a successful self-governed society (or societies). This is not to say that we don’t need a government, but rather that we need a lot less of it. Working at a Crypto-Friendly Establishment Felt Futuristic\nBC: What are your favorite cryptocurrencies right now?\nBS: Besides Bitcoin, I would say – SONM (SNM), Odyssey (OCN), Spankchain (SPANK), and Ark (ARK).\nBC: How do you envision cryptocurrencies helping individuals in the adult industry in the future?\nBS: I talk about this further below, but basically cryptocurrency will solve all of the current problems in the adult industry without creating major new problems in the process.\nBC: You recently tweeted that you planned on giving cryptocurrency lessons naked. Do you still plan on giving these lessons?\nBS: Yes, I’m in the process of filming it right now. At first, I thought about filming and releasing each video at a time, but I’ve decided to film multiple videos to ensure and schedule each release. My calendar is all over the place so I figured this is the best way to approach it.\nBC: When you work at clubs like the Legends Room how many tips have you gotten in cryptocurrency, and can you tell our readers what it’s like working at a crypto-friendly establishment like that?\nBS: I was tipped pretty often in cryptocurrency, mainly because the clients had crypto and wanted to actually use it.\nWorking at a crypto-friendly establishment felt futuristic, for lack of a better word. It really feels like you’re in a new world and it just feels right. When it came to using it, everything was straightforward and comfortable. Cryptocurrency Takes the Best Parts of Cash and Debit Cards and Removes the Other Junk\nBC: Do you still use the Bitcoin.com Wallet?\nBS: As of this moment, no. Reason being is that most of my coins are in deep cold storage.\nBC: Are there any other people you know that work in the adult film industry that also accept cryptocurrencies?\nBS: Yep! There is a growing number of talent, both male and female, like Shelby Paris, Holly Hawkes, and Kyle Mason. I also have directors approaching me for help regarding crypto on set and on my social media. It’s growing quietly, but noticeable. I believe camgirls and individual content produces will be the ones that utilize it the most though, especially in the early stages. I can only see it becoming a standard in the adult industry once a large number of people have become familiar enough with it.\nBC: Do you envision cryptocurrencies taking over the adult industry online in the future as far as payments are concerned for subscriptions, cam shows, pics, movies, and other services?\nBS: I definitely think so. For one, cam sites already use a token system so it’ll be quite easy for camgirls to pick up on it. Escorts can perform a transaction safely and discretely, especially when using a privacy-oriented coin like Monero or Bitcoin Private. Production companies can skip using checks and performers can get paid same day. Production companies won’t need to pose under different company names to get around bank etiquette. Performers don’t need to explain where their legally obtained funds came from. Individual content producers can easily set up a reliable payment method for their customers without running through a processor that will shut them down and take their money.\nThese are just common issues and aren’t even all that creative. This whole industry can be flipped around by cryptocurrency, for the betterment of it. Bottom line is, people love cash, but it’s becoming more and more inconvenient to carry it. If a company like Brazzers had to pay everyone on set using cash, it’d be a nightmare for whoever is responsible for distributing the money. Our evolving lifestyle is pushing us to move our cash into a bank account and turn it into digital money which we can then use with a debit card, but then that has its plethora of problems and limitations attached to it too, many of which severely impact the adult industry.\nCryptocurrency takes the best parts of cash and debit cards and removes the other junk. I think life has shown that humans are very flexible with what they consider is money and what isn’t. Cryptocurrency is just the natural step forward when it comes to using money in a modern society and I am convinced that that majority of us will adapt to it.\nBC: Since you got into bitcoin do you have a lot of cryptocurrency followers now on social media?\nBS: There has been a growing number of crypto followers on my twitter and it’s all been pretty gradual. One day I figured I’d start mentioning crypto in passing, which led to more and more engagement from the crypto community. Now I’m starting to think that the future of my social media will consist mostly of crypto fans, which I’m okay with!\nCheck out our podcast series ‘Humans of Bitcoin’ featuring Brenna Sparks below.\nWhat do you think about cryptocurrencies transforming the adult industry?

Ethereum (ETH) advocates are citing block explorer Etherscan claim to passed 35 million unique addresses, a doubling in something like five months, averaging reportedly 100K a day. The last available figures for bitcoin core (BTC) addresses had them at roughly 25 million as of spring this year. ETH enthusiasts are insisting this is a positive step in the march to eventually snatch the number one coin by market capitalization spot.\nAlso read: India Rejects Venezuelan Crypto Despite 30% Discount Flippening Close or Just Hopeful Hype?\nHopeful hype is starting again in pockets of the crypto ecosystem, especially among Vitalik Buterin fans and ETH followers. It’s due to their long held belief the world’s second most popular cryptocurrency by market capitalization must eventually replace bitcoin core (BTC) at the top in what’s been dubbed the flippening. Hype is arguably the best word at the moment, if only because of that pesky market capitalization: as of publication , BTC has nearly three times the market cap of ETH, and 24 trading volume seems to follow a similar ratio.\nWhat is causing a restirring of such flippening just might be a relatively recent milestone. According to Etherscan, ETH has pulled out ahead of BTC in unique addresses, gaining something in the neighborhood of one hundred thousand per day. The number floating around is rather eye popping: 35 million uniques.\nBTC stopped marking the number earlier this year for a variety of reasons, so ETH followers’ celebrations are based mostly on supposition, inference. The last figures available for BTC had unique addresses around 24 million. Still, the leap passed BTC also includes active addresses , perhaps a more profound metric when attempting to make the ETH flippening case: ETH has over 500K, BTC about 25K less. BTC Might Have Only Itself to Blame\nAddresses do not equate to actual users, however. One ETH user can hold many addresses, and in the case of ETH smart contracts are also being smuggled in the numbers. Yet, wallets for the respective cryptos can be telling when placed against the above stats. Ethereum wallet address are reused as a matter of course, while bitcoin core wallet address are frequently particular to each transaction. By every rational theory, BTC should far outstrip ETH in at least this category. As explained, that’s not the case. Caveats include how the 100K per day number is actually quite a fall off from as soon as the beginning of this year when ETH was clocking 300K per day at times. The Crypto Winter sapped much of those records, and truth is only on-chain activity is being measured (to the exclusion of exchanges, for example). In terms of raw transaction numbers, ETH is crushing BTC, 800K to 200K.\nFor BTC enthusiasts, however, who insist including the counting of ETH smart contracts to be gilding the lily, cooking the books or whatever, are probably on the weak side of that argument. After all, as bitcoin cash (BCH) is beginning to show, increasing block size would allow for such use cases to have taken place, something the bitcoin core community has stubbornly refused to concede. Add to it gaffs in transaction fees and times, mempool congestion, plaguing BTC at the height of its price and corresponding media coverage only compounded block size issues. Should the flippening happen, the BTC community would have itself to blame.\nDo you think anything like the flippening is happening?
