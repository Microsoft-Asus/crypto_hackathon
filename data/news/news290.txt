In parts 1 and 2 of How Bitcoin Cash …, we uncovered the important principles of community education and clarity. Now it is time to turn our attention to one of the most obvious things that went wrong in BTC — the centralization of protocol development. Also read: How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid the Same Mistakes as Bitcoin Core, Part 2 How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid Centralization Decentralization comes in many forms: decentralization of nodes, mining pools, wealth, and so on. One thing that was overlooked for a long time in Bitcoin BTC was that while many things were well distributed, there was only one main group of developers (Bitcoin Core). Decentralized Development Most of the BCH community is now well aware of this folly, and that is why we seek to have multiple independent teams of developers along with multiple full node implementations. Miners need established, robust software they can rely on, and its important to have several choices; otherwise it means that a single group of developers essentially controls the protocol. Entrenchment of “The Reference Implementation” Bitcoin Core became entrenched as “the” Bitcoin software, which led to stagnation. Although there were already several different implementations, the dominance of Bitcoin Core has been overwhelming. Technically, it’s hash power that matters, not how many different nodes are running a certain software… But given the totally lopsided distribution, it was clear that anyone running a different version from Core would be a tiny minority. That means Bitcoin Core calls all the shots as far as BTC protocol rules. BCH is Doing Better Already We’re heading in the right direction but we’re not out of the woods yet. One interesting phenomenon is that the current level of BCH development decentralization is often either underestimated or overestimated. On one extreme, some believe development is fully decentralized (since there’s, what, 6 node implementations now?). By contrast, others see the leading team (Bitcoin ABC) as having become the next reference implementation. The truth is somewhere in the middle. Bitcoin ABC runs around 60–70% of the BCH nodes and Bitcoin Unlimited runs about a third of them. Essentially, instead of one main implementation, there’s now two. Maybe that sounds a bit disappointing, but that’s twice as many as BTC. Meritocracy A meritocracy is defined as “the holding of power by people selected on the basis of their ability.” There’s often a misguided notion that the main development groups in BCH should have magically have equal influence, rather than acknowledging that influence must be earned. Those fearful of ABC having too much power might not understand this principle, or more likely, they haven’t seen all that ABC has accomplished to earn what is currently a majority “market share”. The fact of the matter is that Bitcoin ABC has been the best in class when it comes to leading protocol development, producing timely releases of solid code, and solving problems. To be specific, it was Bitcoin ABC that created the first node software for Bitcoin Cash, and spearheaded both hard fork upgrades along with the Cashaddr addresses. Healthy Competition is the Way Forward This is not to say that Bitcoin Cash wouldn’t benefit from an even more disbursed landscape, with several of the smaller implementations gaining more market share and influence. Instead of the misplaced idea that ABC should be reigned in, other teams should catch up to ABC by competing. That means they need to do as good a job as ABC has done at leading protocol development and delivering reliable software that serves the community. While its good to have a healthy fear of avoiding another “Core”, Bitcoin ABC actually has been extremely inclusive toward other teams. ABC organizes meetings with other BCH devs (both online and in real life), has created open work groups for various Bitcoin related topics, has invited developers from other groups into their private discussion channels, and has even written code for other teams. It feels that we’re on the right track with decentralizing protocol development, and I expect it will continue to improve over time. In the upcoming conclusion (Part 4), we’ll take a look at mining, development funding, and some big picture solutions.

New York has a lot of news happening this week, with the New York Stock Exchange's parent company looking to get into bitcoin trading and Blockchain Week kicking off with the CDX Summit. South Korea continues to be a leader in blockchain technology, rolling out new partnerships with neighboring countries, and building out more blockchain technology.

Bitmain’s Antminer Z9 Mini Designed to Mine Zcash, Threatens ASIC Resistance Bitmain announced, via Twitter, the release of its new Antminer Z9 mini, an ASIC miner capable of mining any cryptocurrency running the Equihash proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm. This includes, most notably, Zcash , which is a decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency designed to offer users complete privacy in transactions. Zcash has always used the Equihash PoW mining algorithm to prevent the progress of Zcash ASIC miners and has predominantly been mined by general-purpose GPU chips. The development of ASIC hardware is causing some cryptocurrencies to change their proof-of-work mining algorithm. Bitcoin Gold has a hard fork coming to defeat it and Monero has already modified their mining algorithm to counter ASIC hardware. GlobalData: South Korea Among the World’s Leading Markets for Blockchain Technology According to analytics firm GlobalData , South Korea has become a leader in the blockchain community. Businesses like Korea Telecom are already working to determine how the blockchain can be used to lessen production expenses and generate new types of revenue. Representatives of the South Korean telephone giant have already joined with Sprint and Japan’s SoftBank to launch a “blockchain-powered data roaming service” in the coming weeks. Executives say the company has big plans to use the blockchain to power “finance, IoT, smart energy and healthcare businesses.” South Korea is also attracting businesses from neighboring countries like Japan, whose social messaging platform Line is set to launch a blockchain subsidiary known as Unblock within South Korea’s borders. The purpose of the subsidiary will be to further study the blockchain and determine how it can best be applied to the company’s remaining divisions. As the nation leads the blockchain revolution, neighboring regions are also taking the bait and looking into how blockchain technology can best be utilized to further cement operational security and efficiency. NYT Report: Parent Company to NYSE Is Planning a Bitcoin Exchange Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), wants to establish its own cryptocurrency exchange. According to New York Times (NYT) sources, ICE has been in talks with legacy banks and financial institutions to facilitate swap contracts for potential bitcoin trading. These contracts would essentially allow banks to buy contracts for bitcoin, giving the exchange sure anchors of liquidity. Once an exchange user buys one of these contracts, cash changes hands and the corresponding bitcoin would appear in their wallet the next day. The report reveals that the exchange, which would be built with “large investors” in mind, would permit direct bitcoin trading, not futures contracts as we’ve seen with the CBOE and CME. CDX Brings Inaugural Blockchain Summit to New York The latest installment of the Chief Digital Officer Global Forum (CDX) summit series will be held in New York on May 11, 2018. Established in 2013, the summit has set up shop in Chicago, San Francisco, Singapore and, most recently, Las Vegas, with focuses on emerging innovations in mobile, IoT and digital advertising technologies. This latest installment will concentrate on advancements in blockchain technology and its application to traditional industries. To this end, the CDX Blockchain Brand Innovation Summit has an extensive list of speakers and panelists both from within and without the blockchain space, featuring representatives from the likes of Hulu, CNBC, IBM and BTC Media. Breaking Bitcoin Conference Heading for Lisbon This Summer as “Building on Bitcoin” The Breaking Bitcoin conference, first organized last summer in Paris, is returning for its second edition under the name “ Building on Bitcoin ,” this time in Lisbon, July 3–4, 2018. While the event in the French capital was centered around security, the one in the Portuguese capital will focus on second-layer technologies and other creative uses of the Bitcoin protocol. Building on Bitcoin will focus on second-layer technologies in a broad sense. The best known and most popular of these is probably the Lightning Network , of which the first implementations entered their beta stage over the past couple of months. But other areas of research and development include different types of sidechains like Liquid , RSK or drivechains ; privacy technologies like TumbleBit ; smart contract solutions like MAST ; and more.

This is especially true in countries where buying Bitcoin is not deemed appropriate by the government. In China, for example, this practice is heavily frowned upon. Huawei, the smartphone manufacturer, may have come up with a solution in this regard. Huawei has a Rather bold Plan One has to commend companies such as Huawei for trying to let consumers buy Bitcoin with relative ease despite the opposition by China’s government. At the same time, one also has to wonder if this is a smart idea, as making this process easier could land the technology company in the proverbial dog house. Only time will tell how this rather surprising decision will pan out in the coming months. In any event, various Bitcoin wallets have been added to the Huawei AppGallery. Unlike traditional mobile app stores such as the Google Play Store and a portion of Apple’s store, the AppGallery is freely accessible throughout China. This means any application listed on this platform can be downloaded by any Chinese resident without any major problems. Giving Huawei mobile phone users the option to download Bitcoin wallets without repercussions is a positive development for the industry as a whole. China takes its stance on Bitcoin very seriously, and it will continue to crack down on any and all related activities for as long as possible. The purchase of Bitcoin with the Chinese yuan has been barred for some time now, and it seems that won’t be changing anytime soon. It is also the first time that a cryptocurrency-related wallet will be offered as part of the Huawei AppGallery. It also appears that the wallet in question will be preinstalled on all new Huawei and Honor phones, which will introduce a lot more people to Bitcoin. That won’t necessarily lead to more Bitcoin adoption in China, yet it sets a very interesting precedent regardless. It will be interesting to see how the Chinese government responds to this news. After all, they were the ones responsible for blocking Android’s Google Play Store and a portion of Apple’s App Store. It is possible that AppGallery will end up in the government’s crosshairs because of this development, although no immediate action will be taken by the look of things. Owning cryptocurrency is not illegal in China, but buying it is a different matter as of right now. With Chinese consumers flocking to mobile and digital payment solutions, introducing native Bitcoin wallet support makes a lot of sense. This news comes at an interesting time for Huawei as well. The company has made it clear they are actively exploring the concept of building a mobile phone specifically designed to run blockchain-related applications. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huawei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T21:11:42.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bd5a7bf4476138ca4fdeee6bed705349f5e0f5e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCyjq67PVl1sFtiJtonOmNI7CJ8ZEEE1ecoYh7WYeo4Vo6vMYzMh81gUoNxVyJJpkE.wsq.e8eHQHjuKarOp3DgTRHpqPVehX1K6uP0CT4nslDfHsj.Byi.RRTw0cGEn5dvF1AU7etlqapiHOdrN_5PA--", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "The FUD Goes On… BofA CTO and Noted Economist Try (and Fail) to Call Out Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies", "title_full": "The FUD Goes On… BofA CTO and Noted Economist Try (and Fail) to Call Out Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies", "published": "2018-05-12T23:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1526119699_26704224.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bd5a7bf4476138ca4fdeee6bed705349f5e0f5e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCyjq67PVl1sFtiJtonOmNI7CJ8ZEEE1ecoYh7WYeo4Vo6vMYzMh81gUoNxVyJJpkE.wsq.e8eHQHjuKarOp3DgTRHpqPVehX1K6uP0CT4nslDfHsj.Byi.RRTw0cGEn5dvF1AU7etlqapiHOdrN_5PA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-12T23:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "The FUD Goes On… BofA CTO and Noted Economist Try (and Fail) to Call Out Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies", "text": "8 hours ago Bitcoin Technology Bitcoinist 89 While Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market goes through what some might consider a healthy pullback, two figures in the world of traditional finance have taken yet another shot at Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. ‘Designed to be Not Transparent’ Bank of America’s chief technical officer, Cathy Bessant, believes cryptocurrencies are preventing authorities from catching criminals and bad actors. She explained on CNBC ‘s “Squawk Box” on Thursday: As a payment system, I think it’s troubling, because the foundation of the banking system is on the transparency between the sender and the receiver, and cryptocurrency is designed to be nothing of the sort. In fact [it’s] designed to be not transparent. Bessant has apparently never visited one of the many websites tracking Bitcoin’s very public ledger . If she had, she might realize that it’s extremely transparent – significantly more so than private banking ledgers. Nevertheless, Bessant claims police forces are incapable of tracking criminal transactions on the public ledger, stating: The way we sort of quote-unquote catch bad guys is by being transparent in the financial moment of money. Cryptos is the antithesis of that. Bank of America is one of the many institutions which banned cryptocurrency purchases via credit card. She explained: Just like we don’t allow stocks to be purchased on our credit cards, we’re not going to allow cryptos or other currencies to be purchased on our credit cards. Bessant also took the time to praise traditional banking’s security, stating: I do actually think we’re in a better position every day. Awareness is higher, the sophistication of our defense and detection efforts are growing every day. There are more players in the mix with a lot of expertise, and the threat environment is beginning to show patterns that make prediction and even automated prediction something we can do every day. So I do believe we’re in a better place. ‘It’s Never Going to Work’ Bank of America’s CTO isn’t the only one throwing FUD at Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Economist Nouriel Roubini, most widely known for correctly predicting the global financial crisis, claimed digital currencies create “chaos” in the world of traditional payments. He explained at the Fluidity Summit in Brooklyn on Thursday: It’s totally inefficient. It’s never going to work. You are going to the world of the Flintstones to buy any good you have to exchange, you go back to the Stone Age of bartering. As noted by CNBC , Roubini loves digital payment platforms like Alipay, Venmo, PayPal, and Square. Interestingly, he doesn’t think blockchain technology will have any significant impact on the future of finance He stated: I’m affirmative on that significant disruption, but most of this has nothing to do with blockchain, nothing to do with cryptocurrency. Do you agree that blockchain technology won’t have a future in the financial sector? Do you think cryptocurrencies are preventing authorities from catching criminals?

All with the aim of facilitating access to the first cryptocurrency in China. The portfolio of bitcoin is available in the store from today, so that users can download for the first time in their Huawei devices a portfolio to store bitcoin , according informed Bloomberg this same Thursday. The company of Chinese origin is the third largest telephone manufacturer in the world and the first in the region, so the commercial operation represents a strategy with greater impact in view of the current restrictions in the Asian country. The portfolio that integrates Huawei has been developed by BTC.com, the parent company of Bitmain, the hardware manufacturer and the largest mining group in the world. In this way, the application of cryptocurrencies will be the first offered by Huawei in its AppGallery. This wallet will be pre-installed on all new Huawei phones and Honor phones. In the coming months, it will be available for older devices, said Alejandro de la Torre, vice president of commercial operations at BTC.com. This integration represents, for BTC.com, the opening to a great market that previously could not have access, since China could be presented as a good use case for this asset class due to how the community in that region has been adopting the technology in recent years.

A look at CMC’s rankings shows only a couple of coins posting positive 24-hour price changes. However, in the midst of the general cratering, Bitcoin appears to be the least affected of the lot. South Korea: The Epicenter of Events\nUPbit , the largest cryptocurrency exchange platform in South Korea, is currently under investigation. A joint task force of local police and financial regulators raided its Gangnam headquarters on May 10th. The platform is accused of diverting client funds into the wallets of its executives and forging its accounting records to cover up the malfeasance.\nThe reaction from the crypto community to the news followed the established script – panic. At some point on May 11th, the top 25 cryptos, according to market capitalization, were all in the red. Prices were declining by as much as 16 percent for tokens like Stellar, EOS, and Cardano .\nAccording to Marius Rupsys , a digital currency investor:\nThe main reason seems to be UPbit news. Most are talking about it, and if you look at prices in Korean exchanges, they are leading the drop.\nCrypto prices in South Korea are usually at a premium ( KimChi premium ) to the rest of the market. For the most of 2018, this premium was non-existent as the market recovered from a slow start to 2018. By the last week of April, market observers reported that the premiums were back . This return coincided with a considerable increase in average prices and total market capitalization values. As a result, any blip in the country’s local crypto market causes shockwaves in the global arena.\nHowever, some analysts believe that the present situation is an exaggerated reaction. According to Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of the crypto hedge fund firm, BitBull Capital:\nAs is so often the case, an event that should rightfully cause turbulence in a specific region seems to be creating shockwaves globally. The UPbit raid is not the first of its kind, and the markets overreacted in past similar instances as well. As the market continues to mature, these events should grow fewer and farther between, and investors will grow a thicker skin. Bitcoin Resilience\nBitcoin has so far suffered less of a decline than most other cryptos. The number one crypto fell below $9,000, but regarding percentage movement, its fall was much lower than the other top ten cryptocurrencies. Some analysts are attributing this to the stability of Bitcoin compared to other cryptos. Commenting on the stability of Bitcoin, Shone Antsey of Blockchain Intelligence Group said:\nBTC is the anchor crypto that all other cryptos are tied to in terms of price. Bitcoin is the most stable and dominant cryptocurrency with the largest network effect. Bitcoin is the one to watch, since if it fails they all fail.\nCrypto enthusiasts expect Bitcoin to make a full recovery beginning from the upcoming Blockchain Week in New York.\nIs the market reaction to the UPbit saga exaggerated?

The main is because of the manipulation by big players known as whales in the market. it can also be because of huge popularity and wide usage of Bitcoin. The more demand means more people holding and trading Bitcoin which fluctuates the process of Bitcoin heavily. This can be reduced if the more players enter the market which can makes it difficult for the whales to manipulate the price. As bitcoin is still in the early stages so there is a lot skewness in holdings of people we have pretty low middle level traders.\nYes a Big player does have the power to be able to manipulate bitcoin prices so things can change very quickly. That's what causes a very high Bitcoin volatility. But as you say that as more and more people are attracted to Bitcoin it will help Bitcoin's development to avoid the big players' power. Increasing demand will make the bitcoin more and more owners so it will add Bitcoin power, in the absence of a bad sentiment from the big player. The development of bitcoin will be more evenly distributed and this will make Bitcoin more trusted by various layers of society.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T22:58:32.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "280d23242dd6fd51dba8e7a411a38053d973da33", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZSlPi9OmntoHSGUFgoFzHfUDOqUUv6BakBm5tIzWn9bi9nIjhiws4UCZWpP5Fq5LlA-", "site_full": "www.merkle.press", "site": "merkle.press", "site_section": "https://www.merkle.press/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Merkle News", "title": "Greek Police Uncover Plot to Murder Alleged Bitcoin Launderer Alexander Vinnik", "title_full": "Greek Police Uncover Plot to Murder Alleged Bitcoin Launderer Alexander Vinnik", "published": "2018-05-12T22:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "280d23242dd6fd51dba8e7a411a38053d973da33", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZSlPi9OmntoHSGUFgoFzHfUDOqUUv6BakBm5tIzWn9bi9nIjhiws4UCZWpP5Fq5LlA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Adi (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-12T22:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "Greek Police Uncover Plot to Murder Alleged Bitcoin Launderer Alexander Vinnik", "text": "\nAdvertisement Join our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nGreek authorities have reportedly managed to uncover a murder plot targeting Russian national Alexander Vinnik, which was arrested in the country earlier this year, suspected of laundering $4 billion in bitcoin through cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e.\nAccording to news source Sputnik, Greek police received information about the murder plot earlier this year, but decided not to make it public to assist investigators. Per Sputnik’s source:\n“It all began after Vinnik’s extradition to the United States was blocked. There people who are extremely interested in him not coming to Russia. The assassination was ordered by some unknown person from Russia.”\nThe murder plot, the source added, isn’t connected to any special services, as it is “linked to the criminal world.” It added that it all began when Vinnik’s extradition to the United States was blocked, as there are individuals who are “extremely interested in him not coming to Russia.” Per his words, the assassination plot was ordered by someone in Russia.\nNotably, Vinnik reportedly wrote an acknowledgement of guilt in Russia, and is set to testify in the country to assist investigators. This, after he admitted to knowing about crimes “committed in the sphere of financial technologies.”\nThe Russian national’s lawyers, in response to the situation, stated:\n“Such statement should be investigated via a proper procedure, rather than through public statements and discussions.”\nAs covered by CCN, Vinnik was arrested at the request of the US government. At the time, it was believed he was BTC-e’s chief executive, but the exchange soon denied he was even an employee there, while Vinnik claimed innocence.\nFor a time, Vinnik’s future was thrown into turmoil, as he and his lawyers argued he should stand trial in Russia, while a Greek court agreed to a US extradition request. His fate was in the hands of Greece’s Minister of Justice, Nikos Paraskevopoulos.\nAt the time of Vinnik’s arrest, BTC-e’s domain was seized and taken down. The embattled exchange managed to come back online, and rebranded to WEX. WEX has, as covered, seen its share of controversy as some of its users’ funds were stuck in limbo, while the company blamed a third party. Since CCN’s report, the exchange has helped users get their money back.\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alexander vinnik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russ", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vinnik", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T02:17:42.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1abe753889af5b5d14a0f7a53c41e91c947b15e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmW0clbN3zPLrJlCSM5sFqS8-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Better than Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Better than Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-12T22:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.11, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1abe753889af5b5d14a0f7a53c41e91c947b15e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmW0clbN3zPLrJlCSM5sFqS8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "milah_ah", "published": "2018-05-12T22:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "Better than Bitcoin?", "text": "Bitcoin is the best at the moment.

Did you remembered when you are in school you always thought that you need to study hard to get a nice job in order to help your family and for you also to establish your own family. But at this generation you noticed that even though you are working with full time job it is not enough to make better way living. That's why you would try to look in another opportunities that helps you to earn more money for family.\nDo you think Investment in education is better or Investment in cryptocurrency especially in bitcoin is much better?\nBase of this articles which is better investment in future for you?\nShare your thoughts about this.\nBitcoin is viewed from an investment perspective, it is more often compared to gold than it is to other currencies. That is because bitcoin and gold have a lot in common as assets. Both are limited in supply, have functional use and are considered by many, despite their volatility, to be good stores of value. When gold and bitcoin were compared as investments over the last five years, bitcoin greatly outperformed the precious metal, generating an annualized return of 155 percent compared to golds annualized loss of 6 percent during the same period. These exuberant returns indicate that bitcoin is getting investors excited about the prospect of placing funds into a brand new asset class.\nBitcoins soaring value and its proven investor performance compared to the gold standard, are indicators that it is high time to weigh the opportunities and risks that come with investing in the worlds leading digital currency.\nOpportunities:\nMany argue that bitcoin, like other currencies, has value only because people perceive it to have value. It is for this reason that many critics view bitcoins price development as nothing more than a bubble. However, there are drivers behind bitcoins excellent returns that have nothing to do with hype or speculative opportunism.\nClickk Here to view source link https://www.google.com.ph/amp/s/www.nasdaq.com/article/bitcoin-as-an-investment-opportunities-and-risks-cm740800/amp?espv=1\nWhy an Education is the Best Investment you can Make\nWhether you consider your education a right, a privilege or something you just need to do as part of life, you should always consider it an investment. If you think of your future professional life as a business, your education is an integral part in the overall structure and quality of that business.\nAnd it doesnt matter if you end up working for yourself or someone else, the education element is an investment that provides the tools necessary for you to move forward and become successful. Every expert, leader and big shot in every industry started by learning the basic skills they needed to get the ball rolling, and the same will be true for you.\nThe Time of Your Life\nBesides having a great time with new experiences, connections are the first reason your education is a worthwhile investment. Quite often, college years are networking disguised as fun. It may not seem like youre making professional connections for the future, but its not uncommon to reconnect with the people you shared this experience with later on, especially in the age of social networks.\nDecision-Making Leverage\nSmart decisions are crucial for a business to excel, and getting a good education puts you in a position to make the right professional decisions at the right time. Being educated in your field gives you a sense of accomplishment and confidence, which enable you to make decisions with confidence moving forward.\nCareer Boost\nIt goes without saying that an education is a great investment if you plan to work in a career for someone else. Depending on your career choice, a formal education might be a must-have to even get into the field. But even if it isnt, taking that extra step will get you started higher up the ladder and will help you move up at a faster pace.\nFuture Security\nSecurity is a word you see come up regularly when speaking about education and employment.

This was a weekly decline of -38 contracts from the previous week which had a total of -1,597 net contracts.\nSmall traders, meanwhile, raised their existing bullish positions this week by an equally offsetting 38 contracts to the current level of 1,635 net contracts.\nThe large speculator position had seen its bearish position decrease in the previous two weeks before this week’s small rise. Overall, the trader positions in this crypto market have stayed rather subdued and have not seen any major swings since the start of futures trading. The open interest level remains small around the 5,000-6,000 contract threshold.

The data includes trader classifications of only speculators and small traders and without commercial traders (typically business hedgers or producers of a commodity).\nSpeculators continue to be bearish as they have since the beginning of the bitcoin data releases while the small traders remain on the bullish side of this market.\nBitcoin per USD:\nOver the same weekly reporting time-frame, from Tuesday to Tuesday, the Bitcoin Cryptocurrency Futures closed at approximately $9182.74 which was a gain of $108.33 from the previous close of $9074.41, according to unofficial market data.\n*COT Report: The COT data, released weekly to the public each Friday, is updated through the most recent Tuesday (data is 3 days old) and shows a quick view of how large speculators or non-commercials (for-profit traders) as well as the commercial traders (hedgers & traders for business purposes) were positioned in the futures markets. The CFTC categorizes trader positions according to commercial hedgers (traders who use futures contracts for hedging as part of the business), non-commercials (large traders who speculate to realize trading profits) and nonreportable traders (usually small traders/speculators).

for every subject in the world, inclusive of computers-Internet-wireless, a daring beginning.\nThese very great founders, the students of the entire world, so sacrificed, dared and pushed to build one of the greatest, most democratic of organizations mankind could ever have conceived.\nBuilding a great service, building a great honor requires a very great beginning. When you dedicate yourself to that, it shifts the way you think-\nNEW HAVEN : Tuesday, a few days ago, was a huge day for online speech. Facebook finally released the internal rules that its moderators use to decide what kinds of user content to remove from the site -\nIncluding once-mysterious details on what counts as ''graphic-violence,'' 'hate speech' or ''child exploitation''.\nIt also announced the introduction of an appeal process for users who want to challenge the removal of their posts.\nThese developments represent a big step towards the process, which is essential on a site where so much of our speech now takes place.\n*But an entity with such enormous power over an online expression should do even more to listen to its users about what kinds of expression are allowed, and its users should be ready to be heard*.\nWhat now for Facebook?\nSINDRI STEFANSSON - of the Bitcoin Heist escaped from a low-security Icelandic prison, Soga, where inmates-\nHave their own rooms and can talk, and plan some hot stuff, and make merry on their cellphones. And all this while, somewhere out there is the booty - roughly $2 million worth of Bitcoin-mining computers - is stashed.\nThen, like the computers, Mr. Stefanson disappeared. For the next five days he was an international fugitive.\nAfter escaping from the prison - a feat that took surprisingly little effort, given the institution's bare minimum approach to security - he hopped a taxi to the country's largest airport, where - he boarded an early morning flight to Stockholm.\nIn a twist that seems borrowed from a cheesy caper film, the plane also carried Katrin Jakobsdottir the prime minister of Iceland.\n''We did not chat,'' Mr. Stefansson said, calling from a prison near Amsterdam in his first interview since he was arrested two weeks ago in the Netherlands.\nBUT ON FACEBOOK, after they are duped, the may struggle with what to do next, Mr. Bernhardt, the retired forklift driver, said he didn't know how to report the scammers to Facebook.\nMs. Keithley said she had called a number for Facebook that she had found online, though she was not sure the number was authentic.\nShe also reported the scam to the local police, who said they couldn't help, and to the Pennsylvania attorney general.\nA spokesman for the Pennsylvania attorney general said that the office did not have record of Ms. Keithley's report. The spokesman said the office planned to contact her.\nOthers said they regularly report scammers to Facebook, but the company can be slow to act.\nKathryn Schwartz, 55, from Lodi, N.J. said she has been in credit-card debt since she lost $1,742 trying to claim bogus Facebook lottery winnings in 2016.\nShe said she has since been barraged by scammers and regularly reports them, including in messages to the real Mr. Zuckerberg.\nOne Facebook account named Mary Williams recently messaged Ms. Schwartz, saying it would help her claim her winnings.\nA review of the account showed that in March it had renamed itself, purporting to be a Boise, Idaho, native who works at Facebook. Years of posts before that depicted a man in Nigeria.\nWhen Ms. Schwartz posed on Facebook that Mary Williams was a con artist, the account left a comment :\n''You think you are smart but you are not. if you were smart why were you scammed.'' The emojis tracked at the end of the message were crying with laughter.\nMr. Bernhardt said that since he wired his last payment to the Mr. Zuckerberg masquerader in January, he has heard from two other Mark Zuckerbergs, one Sheryl Sandberg and other accounts promising him winnings in return for more cash.\nNo conversations have gone as deep as with his original scammer. ''I thought we were getting real close,'' Mr. Bernhardt said. ''He started calling me Mr. Gary and I started calling him Mr. Mark.''\nHe said he had told his scammer about growing up in a foster home and his dream of owning a house on a lake.\n''They sucked me in because they knew my dreams,'' he said.\nThe Honor and Serving of the latest Operational Research on Technology, Social Networks and !W O W! continues. As we stop to thank many authors and researchers all, David Segal, and Kate KIonick.\nWith respectful dedication to the Grandparents, Parents, Leaders, Students, Professors and Teachers of the world.\nSee Ya all ''register'' on !W O W! : WSSCIW.blogspot.com.

For Those Who HEDL\nThe company’s first watch, called the CRYPTOMAT (i.e. Crypto-diplomat), was born during the early years when the first “Bitcoin embassies” started popping up around the world. It reflected the spirit of individuals representing the crypto movement all over the globe and who could deal with skeptics and naysayers in an effective way.\n“It was intended to be humorous, but the word stuck and became the name of our first collection,” says Cryptomatic’s watch designer, Luis Rosende, whose team has been in business for over a decade, helping a number of fashion and watch brands design and manufacture their collections.\nHowever, when the Cryptomat launched in 2014 , the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market entered a prolonged bearish cycle that lasted through 2016.\n“It was a real winter for Bitcoin, it truly tested people’s faith in the idea,” he explains.\nThe belief didn’t die. Bitcoin came back stronger than ever as its price has skyrocketed in recent years while giving rise to a booming new industry in the process.\nRosende adds:\nAfter that roller coaster of a ride, it was quite clear that the second collection should be dedicated to those patient souls who HEDL through the hard times, and so, the HODLER was born. A Timeless Design\n‘Hodling’ is a term that has taken on a life of its own, evolving from a typo meme on an online forum to an entire subculture that believes in the long-term transformative power of Bitcoin technology.\nOn the surface, the Cryptomatic watch is a stark contrast. It’s fully mechanical, based on old-world watch technology that doesn’t use any batteries, digital dials, or electronics.\nUpon a second look, however, its metal gears, springs, and jewel bearings made of ruby to reduce friction are a testament to Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer design that eliminates the need to trust middlemen. The glass back reflects the transparency of its public ledger and proof-of-work backbone.\nHand-assembled in Japan, the country of pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, the watch’s binary hour markers is another unique design element that pays homage to digital currency.\nAnd like Bitcoin, which remains the indisputable king of cryptocurrencies despite an ever-increasing amount of novel altcoins, Cryptomatic believes that mechanical watches are the only type of timepieces that are here to stay in the long run as Rosende states:\nQuartz watches didn’t kill mechanicals and smartwatches won’t either, you can quote us on that now and ten years from now.\nAll the gadgety smartwatches will most likely stop being useful when the next technology cycle hits the market or when there’s no more support for firmware or replacement parts.\nThe build does feel incredibly solid when wearing it on your wrist. The watch comes with a lifetime warranty, for which you can register by scanning the QR code printed on the individual customer card. It also comes with either steel or genuine leather strap options. (I personally prefer the black leather strap after trying both.) Staying Crypto\nCryptomatic is a pretty unique company as it only takes payments in Bitcoin for their watches, which means no credit cards and no cash. The Holder collection watch currently costs around 0.09 BTC, or from $819 to $849 USD depending on the model.\n“About 98% of the watches have been sold for Bitcoin,” Rosende says. “The other ~ 2% are sales to clients who asked if they could pay in other cryptocurrencies, to which we have been mostly open.”\nTo date, Cryptomatic has produced a limited number of editions numbering a few hundred watches per collection. The most popular and fastest selling model has been the Silver & Black HODLER , while the original Silver and Rose Gold CRYPTOMAT was the favorite from the first collection, says Rosende.\nHe notes that Cryptomatic intends to remain a small and exclusive brand while continuing making small runs of high-quality, hand-assembled watch es but doesn’t rule out the addition of “smart” features in the future.\nSo will we ever see a price ticker or a Bitcoin wallet integrated into a Cryptomatic?\n“One thing we can say is that our watches will always have a mechanical heart even if we decide to add ‘smart’ elements to them,” he says.\nThe company does a lot of brainstorming when it comes to their designs, constantly thinking about new collections, though we probably won’t see a Litecoin-themed design in the near future.\n“What about putting in a moon rock if Bitcoin price breaks a new all-time high this year?” I asked Luis.\n“For now we will stick to Bitcoin as it is the origin of all cryptos,” Rosende says. “We’ll see what happens in the future. The moon rock idea is a really good idea by the way.”\n[Disclosure: Cryptomatic provided Bitcoinist with a free Cryptomatic watch for review purposes.]\nWhat do you think of the new Cryptomatic watch?

However, in a significant diversion from the scandal Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook’s creator) now finds himself embroiled in, new revelations have come to light concerning plans by Facebook to leverage blockchain technology.\nZuckerberg himself dropped a big hint about the project, expressing interest recently too,\n“…go deeper and study the positive and negative effect of these technologies and how best to use them in our service.”\nThough the details are scarce, comments by active team members, including David Marcus (the former leader of Facebook’s Messenger application), have given credibility to a series of internet rumors surfacing over the past week.\nMr. Marcus remarked,\n“I’m setting up a small group to explore how to best leverage blockchain across Facebook, starting from scratch”\nWith the realization of a new team being employed to research the potential uses of cryptocurrency within the platform, we can no longer turn a blind eye to the possibilities, and possible repercussions, of our data forever being stamped onto the blockchain. For now, however, investors have reason to be excited by the potential of Facebook pushing into the payments business.\nFacebook, with over 2 Billion users, may just create the first mass-market cryptocurrency. And while the project at this point remains exploratory, some believe the use of blockchain technology may help solve some of the issues surrounding privacy (or the lack thereof) the social media giant is known for.\n87 Million users were exploited by what Zuckerberg’s team calls “malicious actors.” Compromising personal data in the largest scandal in recent memory, the real evil actor is likely Zuckerberg himself, who profits significantly on the exploitation and sale of our personal details.\nStill, the news will probably be met with a positive response from investors as more and more people become enlightened by the use of blockchain in our daily lives.\nOnly time will tell if a new cryptocurrency can help protect our data going forward. And with the ‘Drop Facebook’ movement gaining steam, it is no doubt useful for Zuckerberg to use this news as a healthy diversion from the current scandal.\nWith the daily news cycle focusing away from the recent scandal and grabbing instead onto the hottest topic on the web (cryptocurrency), Facebook may even be able to boost the value of their shares in a time they should be dropping like a stone.\nWe can’t say for sure how far Facebook will go toward creating a blockchain based payment system. Indeed, before more is revealed, we can only speculate on the team’s intentions. In the meantime, we have the right to remain skeptical about the real intentions behind the world’s largest social media corporation.\nWhile the news gives investors a chance to make serious gains on the valuation of the Facebook stock, users of the platform may be wise to divulge a bit less information than they have become accustomed to until more light is shed on the rumors.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

It's not cheap, either.The wireless industry is built on high-priced auctions for chunks of spectrum in different parts of the nation, with billions paid to the FCC to gain access.Not all of the spectrum is being used, and shake-ups are happening now and in the near-future. One significant new part of the spectrum to be opened up was announced in 2015 , as a future release by the FCC. 150MHz of spectrum between the 3550-3700MHz band, also known as the 3.5GHz Band, and called the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS).Previously for the military-only, the attractive CBRS band will be opened upThis very useful band was previously exclusively under military control. The military will still get priority access to CBRS, only now as part of a three-tier framework that will make it available for a variety of commercial uses.At Mobil… May 09, 2018 PicsArt, the self-described \" world's largest photo editor and creative community \" has today announced it has been working with Google to add support for Google's new ML Kit in its app . The short of this is those who use the PicsArt Android app going forward will be able to apply even more, and greater effects to their photos and images to create even more unique and appealing content.ML Kit was announced today by Google as part of the company's annual developer conference , and is in essence a one-stop solution for app developers to make use of Google's machine learning advancements with minimal integration needed. In this case, the benefits of the ML Kit is that it can help to apply more visually appealing effects to an otherwise normal-looking image. To be clear, PicsArt already offers its users its own AI-powered solution which underlines its \"Magic Effects\" feature that lets users change the look of an image, and in some cases quite drastically –… May 09, 2018 Posted by Chris Sells, Benjamin Poiesz, Karen Ng, Product Management, Android Developer Tools Today we're excited to introduce Android Jetpack, the next generation of components, tools and architectural guidance to accelerate your Android app development.Android Jetpack was inspired by the Support Library, a set of components to make it easy to take advantage of new Android features while maintaining backwards compatibility; it's currently used by 99% of every app in the Play Store. Following on that success, we introduced the Architecture Components , designed to make it easier to deal with data in the face of changes and the complications of the app lifecycle. Since we introduced those components at I/O just one year ago, an overwhelming number of you have adopted them. Companies such as LinkedIn, Zillow and iHeartRadio are seeing fewer bugs, higher testability and more time to focus on what makes their app unique.The Android developer community has been clear -- not only do yo… May 06, 2018 Welcome to the 242nd edition of Android Apps Weekly ! Here are the big headlines from the last week: Twitter had a mishap this week . A bug in their system had passwords stored as plain text. That is obviously not great news. However, Twitter did find the bug, fix it, and issued a notice to all of their users. Thankfully, they fixed it already. There isn't any evidence of a hack, exploit, or anything like that. Sometimes it's nice to hear that something is a bug and not a hack. Still, we highly recommend that everyone on Twitter change their password for obvious reasons. Google has a secret gaming startup, apparently . A report this week indicated that Google is working on a bunch of arcade games with social elements.

All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions – private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing – mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends. “\nBuying and Selling Bitcoin\nBitcoin can be purchased on these cryptocurrency exchanges: HitBTC, OTCBTC, Binance, OKEx, Ethfinex, Paribu, Poloniex, Livecoin, BCEX, BTCC, Sistemkoin, LakeBTC, Kucoin, B2BX, CoinBene, Octaex, Bitfinex, Fatbtc, Gate.io, EXX, BitMEX, Bithumb, BtcTrade.im, C2CX, Trade By Trade, Bit-Z, WEX, Bittrex, OOOBTC, Exrates, Korbit, Kraken, Zaif, Coinhub, DragonEX, Bitbank, CoinTiger, Exmo, BitBay, CEX.IO, OEX, Upbit, Bitinka, RightBTC, itBit, Coinone, IDAX, Simex, Coinsuper, BTCBOX, GOPAX, xBTCe, Neraex, Fisco, Gemini, Hotbit, fex, Negocie Coins, Cobinhood, Luno, Coinrail, Coinroom, Iquant, CoinsBank, Bitstamp, YoBit, Omicrex, BitForex, Lbank, Quoine, CoinEgg, bitFlyer, Tidex, ZB.COM, Huobi, Bibox, GDAX, CoinEx Market and TOPBTC.

For Those Who HEDL\nThe company’s first watch, called the CRYPTOMAT (i.e. Crypto-diplomat), was born during the early years when the first “Bitcoin embassies” started popping up around the world. It reflected the spirit of individuals representing the crypto movement all over the globe and who could deal with skeptics and naysayers in an effective way.\n“It was intended to be humorous, but the word stuck and became the name of our first collection,” says Cryptomatic’s watch designer, Luis Rosende, whose team has been in business for over a decade, helping a number of fashion and watch brands design and manufacture their collections.\nHowever, when the Cryptomat launched in 2014 , the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market entered a prolonged bearish cycle that lasted through 2016.\n“It was a real winter for Bitcoin, it truly tested people’s faith in the idea,” he explains.\nThe belief didn’t die. Bitcoin came back stronger than ever as its price has skyrocketed in recent years while giving rise to a booming new industry in the process.\nRosende adds:\nAfter that roller coaster of a ride, it was quite clear that the second collection should be dedicated to those patient souls who HEDL through the hard times, and so, the HODLER was born. A Timeless Design\n‘Hodling’ is a term that has taken on a life of its own, evolving from a typo meme on an online forum to an entire subculture that believes in the long-term transformative power of Bitcoin technology.\nOn the surface, the Cryptomatic watch is a stark contrast. It’s fully mechanical, based on old-world watch technology that doesn’t use any batteries, digital dials, or electronics.\nUpon a second look, however, its metal gears, springs, and jewel bearings made of ruby to reduce friction are a testament to Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer design that eliminates the need to trust middlemen. The glass back reflects the transparency of its public ledger and proof-of-work backbone.\nHand-assembled in Japan, the country of pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, the watch’s binary hour markers is another unique design element that pays homage to digital currency.\nAnd like Bitcoin, which remains the indisputable king of cryptocurrencies despite an ever-increasing amount of novel altcoins, Cryptomatic believes that mechanical watches are the only type of timepieces that are here to stay in the long run as Rosende states:\nQuartz watches didn’t kill mechanicals and smartwatches won’t either, you can quote us on that now and ten years from now.\nAll the gadgety smartwatches will most likely stop being useful when the next technology cycle hits the market or when there’s no more support for firmware or replacement parts.\nThe build does feel incredibly solid when wearing it on your wrist. The watch comes with a lifetime warranty, for which you can register by scanning the QR code printed on the individual customer card. It also comes with either steel or genuine leather strap options. (I personally prefer the black leather strap after trying both.) Staying Crypto\nCryptomatic is a pretty unique company as it only takes payments in Bitcoin for their watches, which means no credit cards and no cash. The Holder collection watch currently costs around 0.09 BTC, or from $819 to $849 USD depending on the model.\n“About 98% of the watches have been sold for Bitcoin,” Rosende says. “The other ~ 2% are sales to clients who asked if they could pay in other cryptocurrencies, to which we have been mostly open.”\nTo date, Cryptomatic has produced a limited number of editions numbering a few hundred watches per collection. The most popular and fastest selling model has been the Silver & Black HODLER , while the original Silver and Rose Gold CRYPTOMAT was the favorite from the first collection, says Rosende.\nHe notes that Cryptomatic intends to remain a small and exclusive brand while continuing making small runs of high-quality, hand-assembled watch es but doesn’t rule out the addition of “smart” features in the future.\nSo will we ever see a price ticker or a Bitcoin wallet integrated into a Cryptomatic?\n“One thing we can say is that our watches will always have a mechanical heart even if we decide to add ‘smart’ elements to them,” he says.\nThe company does a lot of brainstorming when it comes to their designs, constantly thinking about new collections, though we probably won’t see a Litecoin-themed design in the near future.\n“What about putting in a moon rock if Bitcoin price breaks a new all-time high this year?” I asked Luis.\n“For now we will stick to Bitcoin as it is the origin of all cryptos,” Rosende says. “We’ll see what happens in the future. The moon rock idea is a really good idea by the way.”\n[Disclosure: Cryptomatic provided Bitcoinist with a free Cryptomatic watch for review purposes.]\nWhat do you think of the new Cryptomatic watch?

Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.”\nClients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally.\nAlbrecht's service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013. His office employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month.\nMost clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don't exceed 50,000 dollars. In 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since.\nAdoption of Bitcoin has been rapid in Germany. It trails only the U.S., according to Bitnodes, which tracks the location of all the Bitcoin nodes that transmit data about new transactions.

lot of advantages and an activity that to me is very challenging so it makes me have the passion to get what I want through bitcoin mining.\nBut mining bitcoin needs not only an initial investment that many people can't afford , but also a minimum of knowledge to setup a mining rig/farm with that initial investment and make the best use out of it without screwing it all up and putting it in danger (putting it in bad conditions/aeration/electricity sources .. ) and it needs continuous maintenance and care and that can be really challenging for people who lack skills and knowledge . Buying bitcoin certainly needs the same initial investment but is way easier to do and just by holding it you can make profit without going through any trouble .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T16:27:28.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c2dd5fb753b92f93daf9ea1e5165183114f9f293", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdc_.vC256dNeL25q5clyxQcDcyVtETQ6lcFQukOjGCHzxngy8U8neclRyMIDK1wJjfrXPdOG3kMf9sO8DciEiZ", "site_full": "canadianstocktrader.ca", "site": "canadianstocktrader.ca", "site_section": "http://canadianstocktrader.ca/feed", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Canadian Stock Trader", "title": "Bitcoin Trading – live bitcoin trading", "title_full": "Bitcoin Trading – live bitcoin trading", "published": "2018-05-12T20:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://canadianstocktrader.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hqdefault-889.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c2dd5fb753b92f93daf9ea1e5165183114f9f293", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdc_.vC256dNeL25q5clyxQcDcyVtETQ6lcFQukOjGCHzxngy8U8neclRyMIDK1wJjfrXPdOG3kMf9sO8DciEiZ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Canadian Stock Trader", "published": "2018-05-12T20:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Trading – live bitcoin trading", "text": "You Can Start Practise Here – https://goo.gl/mNzQwP Bitcoin Trading – live bitcoin trading Share this:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://goo.gl/mNzQwP"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T21:37:22.071+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e6d8e1ef16f0025c48152006dcd7669cc2119247", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaqfehavpVXryd7AHAVBkvY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Safest way to Store Bitcoin (BTC) ?", "title_full": "Safest way to Store Bitcoin (BTC) ?", "published": "2018-05-12T20:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.087, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e6d8e1ef16f0025c48152006dcd7669cc2119247", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaqfehavpVXryd7AHAVBkvY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "salintheonline", "published": "2018-05-12T20:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "Safest way to Store Bitcoin (BTC) ?", "text": "Quote: from: harshmonty3 on April 20, 2018, 08:57:37 AM Which wallet is safe to store BTC for long time?\n For me the safest way to store bitcoin are through electrum wallet and coins.ph here in our country.

Not to do so, he told CNN , is “almost irresponsible.” Crypto To Disrupt Every Vertical\nOn Wednesday, Novogratz’s firm and Bloomberg launched the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index , an index that tracks 10 cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and Ethereum.\nInvesting in cryptocurrency is important not on account of expected gains, Novogratz said, but because in two to four years blockchain technology, which allows companies to make and record near instant transactions, will be challenging every vertical.\nWhile the decentralized version of Uber may not be Uber, it will be a challenge and it constitutes a “real value proposition,” he said.\nNovogratz, a former hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group and Goldman Sachs partner, said he has invested 10% of his net worth in cryptocurrencies. Traditional Institutions Testing The Waters The owner of the New York Stock Exchange is reportedly considering launching a cryptocurrency exchange. | Source: Shutterstock\nMainstream financial institutions, meanwhile, are finding ways to allow traditional investors to benefit from bitcoin. Nasdaq in April signed an agreement with Gemini Trust, a cryptocurrency exchange.\nOne unknown, however, is how governments will regulate cryptocurrency.\nNovogratz predicted the New York Stock Exchange will be active in cryptocurrency trading in less than six months.\nNot everyone on Wall Street agrees with Novogratz. Warren Buffett, an investment icon, has been bearish on bitcoin, having most recently called bitcoin “probably rat poison squared” at Berkshire Hathaway ’s annual shareholder meeting on Saturday.\nNovogratz said the difference in opinion is age-related, with older players much more skeptical about cryptocurrency.\nAlso read: Bitcoin bull Novogratz raises $250 million for cryptocurrency merchant bank Galaxy Digital Moves Forward\nGalaxy Digital , meanwhile, has announced plans to buy Canadian startup First Coin Capital and then merge with Bradmer Pharmaceuticals — which is publicly listed on the Toronto-based TSX Venture Exchange (TSX-V) — through a reverse takeover.\nFollowing the merger, Bradmer will be renamed to Galaxy Digital, allowing the company to trade publicly without having to undergo traditional financial disclosures associated with listing on an exchange.\nGalaxy Digital’s cryptocurrency merchant bank — which Novogratz reportedly hopes to make the “Goldman Sachs of Crypto” — will have a fourfold business model, according to public statements made by the firm.\nThe bank will open a cryptocurrency trading desk and initially seek to capitalize on opportunities for cross-exchange arbitrage. It will also invest in blockchain startups and ICOs, much as Novogratz intended to do through his now-shelved cryptocurrency hedge fund.

It is quite telling the fact that they have launched their token sale on the very day the news of the RBZ ban broke.\nThey have sent out a press release announcing the developments and you can read it below: advertisement\nGolix, a cryptocurrency exchange that enables Africans to have financial autonomy through cryptocurrencies, is excited to announce the launch of its token, the GLX Token.\nGolix is an African fintech startup that has been facilitating African customers to buy and sell cryptocurrency, using payment channels that are predominately available to Africans, such as mobile money. Over 1 billion Africans currently do not have access to a cryptocurrency exchange that will accept the fiat in the hands of the majority and Golix will accomplish this through their token sale raise.\nThe GLX token, an Ethereum ERC-20 token, will be available for purchase from Monday 14 May 2018 on the Golix token sale website, tokensale.golix.com . Potential buyers can use their bitcoin (BTC) and/or ethereum (ETH) to buy the GLX token which has been priced at $0.05612 per GLX token.\nGolix has been operational in Zimbabwe as an exchange for 3 years already and boasts of over 50,000 customers having transacted over US$20m to date. The funds raised will see them opening exchanges in more African countries as well as expanding their portfolio of services offered.\nThe total supply of GLX tokens will be 1,274,240,097 tokens, with fifty percent (637,120,049 tokens) available for sale during the token sale. The hard cap for the token sale has been set at a sale of the 637,120,049 tokens.\nGolix has essectially began their Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Quick lesson: An ICO is similar to how a company gets to list on the stock exchange through an Initial Public Offering (IPO). The ICO allows cryptos to grow since they are initially sold to investors before being later acquired by the general public just like shares.\nIn the case of Golix though, the token is not a security token meaning it is not exactly like buying shares. The GLX will have its specific benefits and functions that will give it inherent value thus it is a utility token. The idea is that if indeed this token will be deemed useful by people, it will grow in value as a result. Thus buying the token during this ‘ICO’ stage will be an investment into that possibility of growth or it would be because you want to use it for whatever its uses will be.\nThe uses of the GLX will be in the white paper that is published as part of the token sale. You should be able to access the white paper on the Golix website above. Roadmap of the ICO\nAnyway, back to the matter at hand. Golix also released the roadmap they will follow with this ICO and they expect to be done by the 26 th of June 6th of July which is just two months days away. The roadmap is as follows: 12.2014 – BitFinance incorporation 10.2017 – Profitable after only US$63 000 investment 05.2018 – Mauritius incorporation 06.2018 – Open Office in South Africa 07.2018 – Token Sale End 07.2018 – List GLX token on Golix.com for trading Q4 2018 – Launch exchange in new country Q4 2018 – Launch Golix mobile application Q4 2018 – Launch API for third-party integration Q4 2018 – Launch exchange in 4 new markets\nFrom this roadmap, it appears the Pre-Token sale has already been conducted, and this pre-Token is the period where investors are buying (or at least they are supposed to be) into the project and the funds from this often provide operational costs from whoever is ICO-ing, in this case, Golix. Public sale\nThe public token sale will be starting on the 14 th of this month (Monday) and will go on for the next month until the 10 th of June. After this process, the GOLIX token will be listed on their exchange and trading will commence.\nThis ICO will see Golix issue out 1,274,240,097 tokens and these will be based on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC20).\nThe tokens will be issued out as follows: 10% Marketing, investment fund, partners 15% issued to investors, shareholders 25% founding team, future employees 50% Open market token sale\nIt’s going to be an interesting few weeks for Golix and co as they handle the drama around the RBZ’s directive alongside with their ICO and it will be interesting to see the outcome after everything is done and dusted.\nGLX_Tokensale_Litepaper Golix RBZ\nGolix is a Cryptocurrencies exchange in Zimbabwe.

Palihapitiya told CNBC that, despite his respect for the Oracle of Omaha, he thinks Buffett missed the mark on cryptocurrencies. According to Palihapitiya, “Something like bitcoin is really important because it is not correlated to the rest of the market.” Palihapitiya continued on Buffett, adding that, “Not everybody is right all the time,” and noting that bitcoin is outside Buffett’s “circle of competence.” Buffett most recently called bitcoin “probably rat poison squared,” and has before likened it to a gamble instead of an investment.\nCrypto Could ‘Fuel a New Internet’\nAlexis Ohanian, founder of Reddit, said bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have the power to “fuel a potential new internet,” even with their volatile trading nature. Ohanian, who made the comments as a guest on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, posed the notion of crypto as a “store of value not backed by a single country.” The founder said the real utility in something like bitcoin is extending financial inclusion to the underserved, primarily in undeveloped countries. “For so many people in the world to have that security of knowing what’s yours is yours – because [cryptocurrency] is now digital, it can be transferred with you wherever you are going – is actually pretty empowering,” Ohanian said.\nKODAKCoin to Launch This Month\nAfter a number of delays, Eastman Kodak Co. (KODK) announced that its KODAKCoin will begin fundraising later this month.

Kodak is seeking to raise $50 million in the fundraising, which will be carried out by WENN Digital. Kodak first announced the coin and its planned offering in January. “Our goal with this offering is utmost security and transparency, working to bring digital tokens to investors by adhering to industry best practices and in a manner that we hope instils public confidence in the crypto space,” said WENN, according to Coindesk.\nRobinhood to Expand Crypto\nMobile stock trading app Robinhood announced that it has completed a $363 million series D funding round that will allow the platform to expand its current cryptocurrency trading capabilities nationwide by the end of 2018. This funding round values the company at $5.6 billion and was led by DST Global with Iconiq, Capital G, Sequoia Capital and KPCB. Robinhood’s cryptocurrency trading is currently available in 10 states in the U.S., but the company said this funding will allow it to expand to the other 40 in the country as soon as it receives requisite licensing.
