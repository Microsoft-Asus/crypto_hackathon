The currency is now trading for about $500 less than where it stood yesterday afternoon. At press time, the currency is wallowing in the $8,600 range after previously hovering at $9,100. Prior to that, the currency had experienced a weekend high of $9,800, but subsequently dropped to $9,500 and $9,300 respectively within a 48-hour period. This ultimately marks a $1,200 drop in only five days. No doubt many investors are pulling their hair out of their scalps right about now. It appears there are several reasons for the price drop – one stemming out of Asia where digital trends are allegedly set, especially in the crypto arena. One of South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Upbit, has been raided by government authorities, once again renewing the notion that South Korea is heightening its regulatory scrutiny. Should this occur, bitcoin and its crypto-cousins will undoubtedly suffer. Enthusiasm is likely to drop significantly, and digital asset enterprises around the world will be feeling the heat. Upbit is suspected of illicitly moving customer funds to the accounts of its executives. While an official report has not yet been released, authorities state that if evidence is discovered that points to any illegal activity, the exchange could be temporarily or permanently shut down. At press time, general sentiment remains that Upbit had no reason to make such a move, and The Merkle will bring you more on this story as it comes along. In addition, it appears we just can’t seem to get away from Mt. Gox. It is widely suspected that a Mt. Gox trustee has moved some heavy bitcoin funds into four separate wallets, which may have triggered a sell-off and contributed to the price drop. Since last September, trustees of the now infamous Japanese cryptocurrency exchange have continued to move large sums of bitcoin despite their own personal acknowledgements that such action may contribute to wide price swings in what is already a very unstable and volatile market. It has been indicated that as many as 2,000 bitcoins were placed in each wallet over a 24-hour span. And yet despite all the hype and drama, many remain loyal to bitcoin and suggest its price is about to surge higher than ever before . One of those figures is financial strategist Robert Sluymer, who says that while bitcoin is likely to suffer a turbulent month, it will undoubtedly get stronger from here. Sluymer attributes the present drops to ongoing attempts to regulate the currency, but feels this is on the verge of thinning out. “The regulatory risk, the fundamental risk around what’s happening with cryptos has hit a bottom, and now we’re in a state of general recovery,” he assures. Other figures, like head of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco John Williams admit that while there are benefits to bitcoin use, the currency is plagued by issues that need to be fixed. While discussing the setup or institutional arrangement around bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with CNBC, Williams exclaimed, “They have problems with fraud, money laundering and terror financing. There are a lot of problems, there.” - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "upbit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T02:30:04.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "46ee49885211dd644222a2a765239c0b051c39b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCAxUCgRaWOpBIk.O2yjtYzmEZmlkZ4dJqiZQAwAi4QZRAsld.PT_GsSSE3cTXF.WH5jhMlSIb0sTVgqPfjJUjbioqav8jnbmp", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "Bitcoin Moons to $36,000 by End of 2019 According to Fundstrat", "title_full": "Bitcoin Moons to $36,000 by End of 2019 According to Fundstrat", "published": "2018-05-12T04:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1526076515_17118644.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "46ee49885211dd644222a2a765239c0b051c39b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCAxUCgRaWOpBIk.O2yjtYzmEZmlkZ4dJqiZQAwAi4QZRAsld.PT_GsSSE3cTXF.WH5jhMlSIb0sTVgqPfjJUjbioqav8jnbmp", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-12T04:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Moons to $36,000 by End of 2019 According to Fundstrat", "text": "9 hours ago International Bitcoin.com 104 Fundstrat Global, a favorite research firm in the cryptosphere with Wall Street-street cred, is once again providing eye-popping bitcoin (BTC) predictions. This time analysis depends largely on what’s known as the mining economy. Hash power and hardware advancement all combine to show a possible $36,000 BTC price by the end of next year, they claim. Also read: JP Morgan Chase Eats Humble Pie, Applies for Blockchain Patent Fundstrat Continues Moon Price Predictions Fundstrat’s head of data research, Sam Doctor, explained, “The release of the next generation of rig hardware should trigger a new round of capex as well as hash power growth, which could accelerate if BTC price appreciates.” Capex is short for capital expenditure, and refers here to upgrades in technology such as mining rigs. Hash power growth can be thought of as cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin using proof of work, relying on a unit of measure basically recording power consumed by the network to keep it humming along, in this case, roughly every ten minutes a block is found or generated. Internal Fundstrat research document “We believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range,” Mr. Doctor continued. “The primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors.” If a multiple of four from its current price seems ambitious, the actual range from Fundstrat pushes the high to nearly twice even that number. Mr. Doctor uses mining economics to establish a floor support level due to its supposed relative growth going forward. Through next year, researchers believe mining hash power will indeed boom by 350 percent. A Rosy Immediate Future Most of the price moon prediction depends upon miners Fundstrat assumes will hold their position through the crypto winter, and then sell once it recovers (and better). Moving variables in the mining economy include rig innovation, electricity cost, and the ability to lower hardware temperatures. Mr. Doctor further elaborated how “miners verify and process transactions, supporting the network in exchange for mining rewards and transaction fees. We argue that the Price/Miner’s Breakeven Cost multiple has proven a reliable long-term support level, and further, that the likely trajectory of future mining infrastructure growth should underpin Bitcoin price appreciation into year-end 2019.” And harder numbers Fundstrat asserts to be $6K per BTC for Bitmain’s Antminer S7, and just over $2K for its S9 model. Such rosey price predictions are nothing new for Fundstrat Global. Its very public face, and really only prominent Wall Street analyst to take cryptocurrencies seriously as an asset class, Tom Lee, famously last Summer forecast BTC becoming a store of value on par with gold, reaching a high of as much as $55K by 2022. As more information has come in, Mr. Lee has also said he expects the digital asset could moon to $25K by the end of this year alone. Still other analysts believe the causal connection between mining activity and speculative price is not well established, leading to perhaps more outlandish price calls as a result. And with other cryptocurrencies battling it out for market share, offering varieties of features not currently found in bitcoin, the BTC price explosion might not be such a given.

Pine, the anonymous benefactor of the fund, thanked everyone who contributed and supported the project. The Pineapple Fund donated 5,104 bitcoins to about 60 charities around the world. Due to the decline in the value of the crypto since the December 2017, the total amount donated was $55.75 million. Some of the beneficiaries include the Open Medicine Foundation (OMF) , Pencils of Promise, and the Internet Archive. The OMF funds research into complex and chronic diseases. It received a total of $5 million in bitcoin donations from the fund. Pencils of Promise received $1.25 million worth of bitcoin. The organization focuses on improving the education infrastructure in countries like Laos, Ghana, and Guatemala. The Internet Archive is an online library that provides books and software free of charge. It received about $2 million in bitcoin from the fund between December 2017 and May 2018. Other beneficiaries include the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) and GiveDirectly. MAPS focuses on PTSD therapies using psychedelics while GiveDirectly supports the transfer of money to people in need. According to Pine, the fund received tens of thousands of applications from charities around the world. Speaking in the farewell message, Pine expressed gratitude to all who took part in the project, saying: I want to thank everyone for supporting this project. Thank you for all the charity suggestions, many of which were funded. Thank you for all the positive messages and love sent my way. And also, thank you, the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community, for turning a Sourceforge project into a $0.5T industry. Positive Bitcoin Contributions to Humanity The efforts of the mysterious donor known only as Pine, through the Pineapple fund shows the positive impact that cryptocurrency and blockchain technology can have. In a time when the technology is maligned in the mainstream arena as being an enabler of crime, stories like this help to change the narrative. Back in December, Pine promised to donate 5,057 bitcoins to charities, and the donor achieved the target. The donor even surpassed the mark by 47 bitcoins (approximately $430,000).

Wired’s Pump And Dump The fateful day for the publication came about in May 2013 after an experiment with mining Bitcoin on a desktop computer. While considering what to do with the funds they had collected from the process, the journalists concluded that “the world’s most popular digital currency really is nothing more than an abstraction.” “So we’re destroying the private key used by our Bitcoin (sic) wallet,” they decided. The journalists then fatefully added: That leaves our growing pile of Bitcoin lucre locked away in a digital vault for all eternity. The funds linked to the public address provided in the original article currently total 13.35 BTC ($117,000). Lesson Learned (Again): Hodl Wired’s failure to “hodl” provides a curious window into the mindset of many casual cryptocurrency experimenters at the time. “Naturally, our first impulse was to use the Bitcoins to replenish our old pal, Beer Robot, (San Francisco’s Pacific Brewing Laboratory said they’d sell us a keg for BTC 1.5),” the miners wrote on the topic of how to spend the funds. “But that didn’t pass the journalistic ethics sniff test.” When the private keys were lost forever, BTC/USD was averaging around $115 . Wired continued to receive mining payouts of around 0.02 BTC until the end of 2013. While the publication has yet to comment on the increasingly widely-circulating faux pas , its efforts still pale in comparison to the infamous Pizza Day episode from 2010. According to the Bitcoin Pizza Index , even as prices fall under $9,000 on May 11th, the cost of the original $41 order is currently $89,430,000 – or 10,000 BTC.

The move seemed to cripple many of the most bullish markets leaving some altcoins seeing 30–40% drops before finding any local bottoms. Last night’s move marked the first new low since the trading range (TR) formed 3 weeks ago: Figure 1: BTC-USD, 2-HR Candles, Potential Distribution Trading Range Until last night’s drop, the current trading range had many hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range (a continuation pattern) that gave many bulls confidence in their investments. However, the drop came on heavy volume and managed to puncture the lower boundary of the TR — signifying an underlying weakness in the current market. This drop below the TR is referred to as a Sign of Weakness (SOW). A SOW is an indication that market still has plenty of overhanging supply (interested sellers) and not enough demand to keep market afloat. Sometimes, the lower time frames make it difficult to actually see the impact of a move. As we start to zoom out we can see just how substantial the volume was in relation to the previous weeks of market activity: Figure 2: BTC-USD, 4-HR Candles, Higher Time Frame Volume View At the time of this article, we are in the process of testing the lower boundary of the TR from the bottom-side. The reaction to this lower price range will give us further insight as to the upcoming market movements. This is the first sign of weakness in our current trend, so it stands to reason that we will see a bounce in price to retest the resistance within the TR and further test the supply/demand of the market. Without proper distribution, its unlikely to see a sustained continuation of the downtrend, but at this point we shouldn’t rule anything out. On the short term, we can expect a retest of the $8,800s and possibly the lower $9K values. A somewhat alarming development is occurring as a consequence of this drop. Shortly after the market saw a golden cross of the 50/200 EMAs on the daily chart, we saw a definitive puncture of that support. Typically, the market doesn’t just plunge through the 200 EMA without seeing some sort of resistance, but a daily candle close below the 200 EMA marks a more macro bearish signal. That, combined with a Bollinger Band expansion, gives us an indication that the move downward may, on a macro scale, be a prolonged move over the coming days and weeks: Figure 3: BTC-USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro View Summary: A strong move downward brought the entire crypto market to its knees as bitcoin saw an $800 drop in a few short hours. This move marked the first sign of weakness in our current uptrend The sign of weakness combined with macro signals interacting with the Bollinger Bands and 50/200 EMAs hint toward a possible macro move downward.

We recently discussed how <> BTC/USD looked \"toppy\" after missing the $10,000 mark . The $9000 area was a key support. As we will see on the 1H chart, there was indeed a bounce, but the subsequent resistance at $9400 became a harbinger for further decline.\nBTC/USD 1H Chart\n(click to enlarge) In the previous assessment, we noted that if price can hold above $9400, it might go back up to $10,000. Instead, price found resistance at $9400, which was where the 200-hour simple moving average resided. Meanwhile, the 1H RSI held under 60, which is a sign that prevailing bearish momentum is being maintained. Bearish Outlook: But if price falls below $9000 and the RSI below 40, the bullish trend could be over. Below $9000, we can anticipate a dip to $8400. The bearish outlook improves if $9000 now becomes resistance. As we can see on the 1H chart, price did not stop at $9000 on the second test and fell straight through. We can also see that $9000 acted as resistance before price continued to fall. Finally, the anticipated $8400 target was reached during the 5/11 session, and Bitcoin is stalling here so far as the Friday session winds down. This $8400-$8600 area is a support/resistance pivot area - so no surprise price is stalling here. Maybe price will rebound at least in the very short-term. If there is a rally, we should monitor the $8800-$9000 area as resistance. Breaking above $9000 will be needed to relief Bitcoin from its now bearish outlook.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nUnlike 2017, the rallies in most major cryptocurrencies this year has been subdued. We believe that they are forming a bottom, which can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. During this process, the price will remain volatile as the bulls, and the bears battle it out to establish their supremacy. The supportive news will see prices move up while adverse news can lead to a decline. The latest set of news that influenced the decline for most cryptocurrencies is the investigation of South Korean exchange Upbit by the country’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) and liquidation of Bitcoin by the executives in charge of refunding users affected by the collapse of the former Japanese exchange Mt.Gox. The news on the fundamental side has also been positive with many financial institutions planning to enter cryptocurrencies, but it is still not reflecting in the price. Investment research firm Fundstrat believes that this will soon change and Bitcoin can reach $36,000 by end-2019. They have projected a probable range of $20,000-$64,000. Even if Bitcoin only reaches the lower end of the range, it will return about 125 percent from the current levels. Let’s see whether we should buy the current dip or wait it out. BTC/USD Bitcoin attempted to hold bounce off the 20-day EMA on May 09 but could not find buying support at higher levels. On May 10, it broke below both the 20-day EMA and the small trendline support. Our stop loss at $8,900 was hit today as the cryptocurrency plunged to a low of $8539.62. On the downside, the 50-day SMA at $8423 is a strong support, below which the fall can stretch to $7,900. If this level also breaks, the BTC/USD pair can sink to $7,000 levels once again. If the 50-day SMA holds, the digital currency will attempt to move up, but it might face resistance at the 20-day EMA. The flattening of the moving averages points to the formation of a range. The supports and resistances of the probable range have still not established. Hence, we are not recommending any trade today. ETH/USD Ethereum failed to sustain above $745 on May 10. This resulted in a fall that has broken below the 20-day EMA triggering our stop loss at $680. With the fall, the ‘V’ shaped bottom formation has been invalidated. The ETH/USD pair has support at $656.55, which is the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the rise from the lows of $363 to $838. If this level also breaks, $600.50 should act as a strong support, which is the 50 percent retracement level. Traders should wait for buying to emerge at lower levels before entering any long positions. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash failed to sustain above the $1,600 levels on May 10, resulting in a breakdown below the ascending channel. Today, the BCH/USD pair plunged below the 20-day EMA and hit our stop loss at $1,400. Currently, prices have recovered from the lows, and the bulls are trying to climb back above the 20-day EMA. If the levels hold, Bitcoin Cash will again attempt to scale above $1,600. The critical support on the downside is $1,221. If this level breaks, the slide can extend to the 50-day SMA. XRP/USD Ripple has broken down of the range which gives it a lower target of $0.58223. Currently, the bulls are attempting to defend the 50-day SMA. Even if they succeed, the rebound will face a stiff resistance at $0.76 and the 20-day EMA. If the XRP/USD pair breaks below the 50-day SMA, the fall can extend to the next support zone of $0.56-$0.58. Here too, the odds of formation of a large range have increased. We shall wait for the cryptocurrency to find some support before buying it. XLM/USD Stellar has broken below the horizontal support at $0.334 and is currently attempting to take support at the 50-day SMA. The failure of the bulls to hold a critical support indicates weakness. If the XLM/USD pair breaks below the 50-day SMA, it can decline to $0.184. The probability of the digital currency forming a cup and handle formation has decreased. It is likely to become range-bound between $0.184 to $0.477. We shall wait for a new buy set up to form before suggesting any trade on it. LTC/USD Litecoin has broken below the ascending channel, the 20-day EMA, and the 50-day SMA. It is currently struggling to hold the horizontal support at $141.026. If the LTC/USD pair sinks and closes (UTC) below $141 levels, it will become negative and can decline to $127 and below that to $115 levels. If the levels hold, the digital currency will continue to trade inside the small range of $141-$167. Due to the overall weakness, it is better to wait for the decline to end before buying. ADA/BTC The cup and handle formation on Cardano has failed. The bulls failed to sustain the price above the breakout levels of 0.00003445, which resulted in a slump that broke below our stop loss at 0.000032. The other stop loss at 0.000029 was saved by a small margin as the digital currency had slid to 0.00002902 levels today. The ADA/BTC pair is currently at the 50-day SMA. If this level holds, the bulls will try to break out of the overhead resistance once again. If this level breaks, it can again slide down to 0.000020 levels. Therefore, we suggest maintaining the stops at 0.000029 on the remaining position. IOTA/USD IOTA has broken below the horizontal support, the 20-day EMA and the support line of the ascending channel. This shows short-term weakness. The IOTA/USD pair has a minor support at the $1.81 levels from where it is trying to rebound. If this level breaks, the fall can extend to $1.63, which is a critical support. We anticipate buying to emerge close to the 50-day SMA. Let’s wait for the buyers to return before entering any long position. EOS/USD The consolidation in EOS has resolved on the downside as the price has broken down of the tight range. The bulls are trying to defend the 50 percent retracement levels of the rally from $5.9610 to $23.0290. The EOS/USD pair can decline to the support line of the descending channel, which also coincides with the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels. The 50-day SMA is also just below this level. While the trend still remains positive, it’s better to wait for the pullback to end before initiating any fresh long positions.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

On the subject of hackers, police investigator Mick Gallagher says:\nThese people generally feel they can operate with impunity, that they can’t be touched. We have now debunked that.\nInvestigators say that West, who went by the online name “Courvoisier,” was behind cyber attacks on more than 100 different companies, including gambling shops, mobile phone companies, and supermarkets. The report also notes that “Courvoisier” used Bitcoin to launder his proceeds from the sale of passwords, credit card numbers, and personal information on the Dark Web.\nAn interesting twist to this cryptocurrency seizure is that the police were able to snag the bitcoins due to the fact that West was still logged into his computer, and investigators found his access keys that were saved on his computer. Cybercriminals and Cryptocurrencies\nMany cybercriminals have used cryptocurrencies to launder their proceeds from illegal activities. Some cryptocurrencies are also massively used in Dark Web markets to purchase illegal goods or services like drugs, credit card information, DDoS attacks, etc. Alex Lakatos, a lawyer from Washington D.C., states:\nWhen it comes to transactions on the Dark Web, (people) nearly universally use cryptocurrency.\nHe also added:\nThe use of virtual currency for illicit purposes has been a huge success.\nSome cybercriminals may believe that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin may offer anonymity, but it has been pointed out that investigators often times can track certain cryptocurrencies but cannot tell who owns them.\nAnother point of fact is that the vast majority of Bitcoin transactions are for perfectly legal reasons. However, the media and centralized authorities love to play up the meme of crypto and illicit activity.\nWhat are your thoughts on the cryptocurrency seizure by the London police? Will police be able to enhance their ability to go after hackers or will hackers stay a few steps ahead?

Paladiya, along with Amreli police officials, had got 176 bitcoins from a Surat-based realtor Shailesh Bhatt out of which 34 were converted into money and distributed among the accused of the case whereas 142 coins remained with Paladiya.\nCID had found a digital wallet belonging to him out of which 119 bitcoins have been recovered. “Currently, the Binance account belonging to him has the money in the US dollars which will be converted into bitcoins. The cryptocurrency will then be converted into Indian rupees in a cryptoexchange at the prevailing rate. The money will be deposited in a State Bank of India (SBI) account which has been opened specifically for the case,” said a senior CID official.\nThe officials said that it is only the second such instance where the Gujarat Police have got custody of cryptocurrency as evidence in a criminal case. Earlier, Surat Police had to get custody of the bitcoins which were converted from stolen money by an accused two years ago. However, the amount involved in this case runs into crores with the prevalent rate of one bitcoin at Rs 5.79 lakh.\nOfficials want to complete the procedure before Paladiya’s remand gets over on Saturday.\nKotadiya has stopped using phone: CID\nA CID team reached the residence of Nalin Kotadiya, former BJP MLA from Dhari, on Friday. “Kotadiya in his fax message had assured us that he would remain present before us for questioning in the bitcoin case on May 11, hence we checked in his house in Amreli.

Now, the firm has revealed it has succeeded in mining a total of 900 bitcoin and 537 bitcoin cash since catching the crypto fever in 2017. Smooth Operations\nIn its business report for April that it released the week beginning May 7, GMO revealed that at current, it mines only bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH).\nAs seen in the document, GMO has steadily improved on its mining operations since inception. In February it mined 124 BTC and 287 BCH. In March GMO increased its capacity to 295 BTC and 12 BCH, while in April, it mined a staggering 373 BTC and 0 BCH.\nIn total, GMO has mined 906 BTC and 537 BCH since it ventured into bitcoin mining. Increased Hash Rate\nGMO has also revealed it has been making substantial efforts to increase its hash rate since venturing into the business.\n“Hash rate rose due to the increase in the number of computers we are operating as planned,” they wrote. The company also disclosed that back in January its Hashrate was just 27 PH/s, It beefed it up to 108 PH/s in February, 129 PH/s in March and 241 PH/s in April.\nGMO has made it clear that it will continue to increase its hashrate until it gets to at least 3,000 PH/s before the end of 2018. “Hash rate is an important indicator for estimating our mining share. Our goal is to see the hashrate reach 3,000 PH/s this year,” GMO declared. Advertisement advertisement\nGMO is working tirelessly round the clock to be a formidable force to reckon with even though leaders in the field such as Bitmain and others are light years ahead. GMO to Work on R&D for Mining Chips\nIn September 2017, GMO Group announced its intentions to venture into the crypto mining industry with $3 million. The conglomerate also hinted it was looking to create own mining hardware to enhance its operations.\nNotably, on January 22, 2018, GMO revealed it had successfully developed its 12 nanometer FCC process based mining chip. “As the first step of the research and development, we have succeeded in developing a new 12 nm FFC*2 process based mining chip (12 nm FFC mining chip),” the firm stated in January.\nThe firm added “…cutting-edge 7 nm process technology for chips will be used in the mining process, and GMO Internet will continue to work on research and development, using the next-generation mining boards in the mining process in the first half of 2018.”\nWhile the crypto mining arm of GMO Group has been doing considerably well, the same cannot be said of their crypto exchange, GMO coin. The parent company of the exchange recently released GMO Coin’s earnings report, and it shows an operating loss of a whopping 760 million yen (roughly $7 million), in Q1 of 2018, and the operating cost rose by 560 million yen ($5.1 million).\nOn March 2018, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) issued a business improvement order to the exchange, after finding loopholes in the business processes of GMO Coin.

The head of the task force, Michael Andrew, described the reasons people use cash in a recent podcast, giving as an example a shopkeeper who runs two tills, keeping some money out of sight of the taxman.\n“It’s basically paying people cash who want to maintain their welfare, their visa status or avoid their child maintenance,” Mr Andrew said. “That is widespread in certain areas particularly … the services-based economy, security industry, hospitality, cleaning, couriers, personal trainers, hairdressing and nail salons for example.”\nGovernments around the world are interested in cracking down on cash, and not just to get those dodgy nail salons paying tax, but also to kill off terrorist financing, to reduce money laundering, and even to let them reduce interest rates below zero. (If you make interest rates negative, people will just take cash out of the bank, but if you also make cash illegal, that’s not possible.)\nANARCHY IN THE BLOCKCHAIN\nAll these anti-cash trends are giving life to Bitcoin, and other digital currencies that could serve as an alternative to cash. For some people, that’s the whole point of cryptocurrencies. A big part of the early adopters of Bitcoin were people who are deeply worried about government. Many early Bitcoin adopters were libertarians and anarchists who feared an Orwellian world where government constantly monitored and controlled you.\nWhen Mr Morrison bans cash, those libertarians and anarchists get their “I told you so!” moment. But these days, as Bitcoin aims for mainstream acceptance, the industry is keen to distance itself from those people.\n2 LEGIT 2 BIT\n“It is not about encouraging a black market economy,” says Caleb Yeoh, the co-founder of Travel by Bit, which has made buying things with cryptocurrencies possible at about 150 Australian businesses, including mainstream outlets such as Red Rooster.\n“We signed up over 150 businesses across Australia. Each one of them gets a tax reporting functionality on our platform, so they declare taxes even thought they take payment in Bitcoin.”\nYeoh, whose business is part-funded by government grants, points out that Bitcoin maintains a record of every transaction in its Blockchain.\n“People often have this impression that if you take payments in Bitcoin you’re creating a cash economy, under the table, can’t be monitored by government. That’s not true at all. It is transparent on the Blockchain. If you are doing something bad with Bitcoin you should be able to be caught.”\nWhile this is true of Bitcoin, it is not the case with every other cryptocurrency, some of which are designed to be anonymous.\nSo the big risk is not when businesses agree to take Bitcoin, like this labour hire firm has. (“You could be forgiven for thinking that accepting Bitcoin payments is a publicity stunt,” the firm’s website says, insisting it will actually be efficient. However, you can check its Bitcoin address on the Blockchain and see that no customers have paid bitcoin to that address yet).\nThe big risk is when the guy who is installing your new kitchen asks if he can be paid in anonymous cryptocurrencies like Monero or Dash. That’s when the government’s cash ban could really backfire.\nSIGN-OFF\n Cash ban plays right into Bitcoin’s hands", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/federal-budget/could-scomos-cash-ban-be-just-what-cryptocurrencies-want/news-story/031d44e722cb242b526a127464a5dd4d", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/federal-budget/cash-payments-over-10000-to-be-banned-as-government-targets-50-billion-black-economy/news-story/9df0646ba704bd170df5b3996d512f52?from=rss-basic", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/efa0720f665be20f6a16fcb9fc59419c?width=650"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scott morrison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "black economy task force", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T14:31:56.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3e48a23b8419ec7d562573609e2d935032635c8e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2IR95VYfCVry1jO0xu4cj82cVsU7siOHIBzSOr0FOT.bqpyI9ZqYZFEQvAn86HwabF2RFww6.05EC6tGhVQEpQlVjhhWzK_5OlyYN45bxb0Ggr1EYO_JtsNuhwM6ICitmIPp7fwpsJ5DGqZzTtRnelvsaKMTeDBQ5JzTve5ZZh3XMyfqxtoowCutww7pGgPM-", "site_full": "www.dailytelegraph.com.au", "site": "dailytelegraph.com.au", "site_section": "https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/business/economy", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Economy News and Economic Announcements | Daily Telegraph", "title": "Bitcoin: Federal 2018 cash ban to affect cryptocurrencies", "title_full": "Bitcoin: Federal Budget 2018 cash ban to affect cryptocurrencies | Daily Telegraph", "published": "2018-05-12T03:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/40d2d125a2c843aafe83982de980f75c", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 7674, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3e48a23b8419ec7d562573609e2d935032635c8e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2IR95VYfCVry1jO0xu4cj82cVsU7siOHIBzSOr0FOT.bqpyI9ZqYZFEQvAn86HwabF2RFww6.05EC6tGhVQEpQlVjhhWzK_5OlyYN45bxb0Ggr1EYO_JtsNuhwM6ICitmIPp7fwpsJ5DGqZzTtRnelvsaKMTeDBQ5JzTve5ZZh3XMyfqxtoowCutww7pGgPM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jason Murphy", "published": "2018-05-12T03:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin: Federal 2018 cash ban to affect cryptocurrencies", "text": "THE Australian Government has made big cash payments illegal, but is it just giving a free kick to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin?\nIn Tuesday’s Budget, announced a crackdown on the “black economy”, and a ban on cash payments was the centrepiece .

Many early Bitcoin adopters were libertarians and anarchists who feared an Orwellian world where government constantly monitored and controlled you.\nWhen Mr Morrison bans cash, those libertarians and anarchists get their “I told you so!” moment. But these days, as Bitcoin aims for mainstream acceptance, the industry is keen to distance itself from those people.\n2 LEGIT 2 BIT\n“It is not about encouraging a black market economy,” says Caleb Yeoh, the co-founder of Travel by Bit, which has made buying things with cryptocurrencies possible at about 150 Australian businesses, including mainstream outlets such as Red Rooster.\n“We signed up over 150 businesses across Australia. Each one of them gets a tax reporting functionality on our platform, so they declare taxes even thought they take payment in Bitcoin.”\nYeoh, whose business is part-funded by government grants, points out that Bitcoin maintains a record of every transaction in its Blockchain.\n“People often have this impression that if you take payments in Bitcoin you’re creating a cash economy, under the table, can’t be monitored by government. That’s not true at all. It is transparent on the Blockchain. If you are doing something bad with Bitcoin you should be able to be caught.”\nWhile this is true of Bitcoin, it is not the case with every other cryptocurrency, some of which are designed to be anonymous.\nSo the big risk is not when businesses agree to take Bitcoin, like this labour hire firm has. (“You could be forgiven for thinking that accepting Bitcoin payments is a publicity stunt,” the firm’s website says, insisting it will actually be efficient. However, you can check its Bitcoin address on the Blockchain and see that no customers have paid bitcoin to that address yet).\nThe big risk is when the guy who is installing your new kitchen asks if he can be paid in anonymous cryptocurrencies like Monero or Dash. That’s when the government’s cash ban could really backfire.\nSIGN-OFF\n Cash ban plays right into Bitcoin’s hands\nShare this on Facebook social-facebook_circle Share this on Twitter social-twitter_circle Share this by Email social-email_circle", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=135086289853833&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fnews-story%2F031d44e722cb242b526a127464a5dd4d&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fnews-story%2F031d44e722cb242b526a127464a5dd4d", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/efa0720f665be20f6a16fcb9fc59419c?width=650", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Why%20Bitcoin%20fans%20are%20crowing&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fnews-story%2F031d44e722cb242b526a127464a5dd4d", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/federal-budget/cash-payments-over-10000-to-be-banned-as-government-targets-50-billion-black-economy/news-story/9df0646ba704bd170df5b3996d512f52?from=rss-basic", "https://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/federal-budget/could-scomos-cash-ban-be-just-what-cryptocurrencies-want/news-story/031d44e722cb242b526a127464a5dd4d"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scott morrison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "black economy task force", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T17:56:44.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4bc0f9a6e977213e2f412081ae9c8b9d1f1a8219", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa0l_88Vp9VDW3H3ko2iEzFAdPW.w80.Mb4HmXrL4uImWY892LdhIGA_ji4HgD7EQC.8spwlFqEWf1op7UT77DLQ--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "8,200 Bitcoins from Mt.

Here is a verifiable proof that \"Electrum Pro\", a fake version of @ElectrumWallet , is in fact Bitcoin-stealing malware: https://t.co/FvhkTp29wI — Electrum (@ElectrumWallet) 9 Mei 2018 Despite protests to the contrary, Electrum Pro clearly intended to trick users into believing that it was an upgraded version of the official wallet. In addition to utilizing a similar domain name, Electrum Pro’s logo and website content gave the impression that the two projects were connected. From an archived version of the Electrum Pro website: Electrum has been securing payments since 2011and is one of the most popular Bitcoin wallets. ElectrumPro is free software, released using the MIT license. Anyone can run an Electrum server. No single entity controls the network. Additionally, an advertisement for the copycat website ranked first in Google searches for “Electrum,” which likely diverted many would-be users away from the official website and to its doppelganger. The website has now been taken down and replaced with a message from potentially-pseudonymous Electrum Pro creator Lucas Lofgren. Lofgren accuses the official Electrum of slandering his project’s reputation and says he and his team have decided to move onto other projects He added that he will sell the electrum.com domain for 25 BTC, worth roughly $215,000 at the current exchange rate. “Due to false accusations from electrum.org, they have ruined our reputation and brand of Electrum Pro. They managed to trick several news outlets to slander us,” Lofgren wrote. “We decided to go our seperate (sic) ways to work on different projects.

Japan 30y bond auctions will probably be dismal. EU bond auction will likely be bid with the ECB doing most of the work. Don`t expect much. Bitcoin US$10k was a resistance level. Now we are looking for support. US$8500 has some buyers coming back into market. Fear still abounds about a Mt Gox sell-off, so look for support to be in the mid-7k level (US$7300 - US$75000). That support level assumes that there are no whales slamming price. Put in low-ball buy orders if a whale slams price to get a long position on the spike lower. Friday action looks like traders closing out a long positions to enjoy their weekends. This would make sense with companies like Goldman-Sax getting into the crypto trading market. If you are an avid crypto trader, there are more industry jobs available than any other segment of the market as commodities, bond and stock desks close. Weekend-traders are passing time by getting long positions in crypto, so expect Saturday and Sunday buying support (limited volume) to come into market. Expect more of the week-day-trader sell action on Fridays with these institutional buyers buying back into the market on Mondays. Bitcoin traders are also expecting a dump of coins from Mt Gox liquidators so every dip has a heavy amount of short term fear selling. Considering Mt Gox liquidators poor trading abilities, expect them to dump into market when price bottoms out. Because Japan open is Sunday night in the USA, it will likely occur when American traders are not watching the feed. This will provide a buying opportunity, so buy-and-hold traders might want to put in low-ball offers over the weekend to capture that spike lower. KCS & KuCoin Crypto Market The big money in the crypto space is in crypto markets (as I posted before). Getting a piece of that action is a challenge. I have come to find that there is a crypto market that pays back some of the exchange fees to holders of their crypto currency: KuCoin KCS. https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=Rrg8dr That link above has included a referral code (Rrg8dr) which I will explain. When you use that code to sign up, I get a piece of the action from your trades for the next year. I don`t get anything else from this site. So, if you decide to sign up, then use that code instead of just throwing the bonus away (I might make about $0.12 out of it yay!). I also have invested in KCS coins, so I have skin in the game. That is my full disclosure. KuCoin offers their own crypto coin KCS. For holders of KCS, they get discounts when making trades, depending on the size of holding. Holders of more than 6 coins (about US$25 at the time of writing) get a 50% payout of trading fees charged by the exchange. These fees are often paid out in the crypto currency that was traded so you end up with pennies of many cryptos. That means that by holding this crypto, you are receiving a passive income (dividend) for holding it. This is a novel concept because it makes holding this crypto currency more like stock ownership. As the site grows, and more trades are executed, so will your income. For many investors (not traders) this can be an option to collect off the crypto boom without having to watch charts all the time. Be aware that if the fee schedule drops, or drastically changes, then you should expect the KCS coin to sell off. Drawbacks of this site / investment are in risk. Just as most crypto trading sites are barely regulated, there is always the chance that the entire site will just evaporate. This is unlikely to happen as the site has been trading for a while but with all crypto sites, this is a risk. The site only allows you to deposit and withdraw in other crypto currencies. So you must already have access to other crypto to deposit (you would need a Bitcoin ATM if you only have cash). As you receive interest in various crypto instruments, and then in limited quantities, these would probably need conversion to a more active crypto (Bitcoin, Ether, Monero, etc.) to withdraw. That would probably mean sitting on your investment until you have acquired enough of small instruments to make a trade. However, you can trade back into KuCoin KCS crypto which would be a manual version of a dividend reinvestment plan. As trading sites go, it is on par with other sites which means that it is not great. That being said, the order entry and depth of market are straightforward so it is functional. It does require Google Authenticator to use the site, for security, but it is not too frustrating if you keep your phone handy. So, open an account and have a look (using my referral code if you are feeling kind: Rrg8dr).

On May 10, it broke below both the 20-day EMA and the small trendline support. Our stop loss at $8,900 was hit today as the cryptocurrency plunged to a low of $8539.62. On the downside, the 50-day SMA at $8423 is a strong support, below which the fall can stretch to $7,900. If this level also breaks, the BTC/USD pair can sink to $7,000 levels once again. If the 50-day SMA holds, the digital currency will attempt to move up, but it might face resistance at the 20-day EMA. The flattening of the moving averages points to the formation of a range. The supports and resistances of the probable range have still not established. Hence, we are not recommending any trade today. ETH/USD Ethereum failed to sustain above $745 on May 10. This resulted in a fall that has broken below the 20-day EMA triggering our stop loss at $680. With the fall, the ‘V’ shaped bottom formation has been invalidated. The ETH/USD pair has support at $656.55, which is the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the rise from the lows of $363 to $838. If this level also breaks, $600.50 should act as a strong support, which is the 50 percent retracement level. Traders should wait for buying to emerge at lower levels before entering any long positions. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash failed to sustain above the $1,600 levels on May 10, resulting in a breakdown below the ascending channel. Today, the BCH/USD pair plunged below the 20-day EMA and hit our stop loss at $1,400. Currently, prices have recovered from the lows, and the bulls are trying to climb back above the 20-day EMA. If the levels hold, Bitcoin Cash will again attempt to scale above $1,600. The critical support on the downside is $1,221. If this level breaks, the slide can extend to the 50-day SMA. XRP/USD Ripple has broken down of the range which gives it a lower target of $0.58223. Currently, the bulls are attempting to defend the 50-day SMA. Even if they succeed, the rebound will face a stiff resistance at $0.76 and the 20-day EMA. If the XRP/USD pair breaks below the 50-day SMA, the fall can extend to the next support zone of $0.56-$0.58. Here too, the odds of formation of a large range have increased. We shall wait for the cryptocurrency to find some support before buying it. XLM/USD Stellar has broken below the horizontal support at $0.334 and is currently attempting to take support at the 50-day SMA. The failure of the bulls to hold a critical support indicates weakness. If the XLM/USD pair breaks below the 50-day SMA, it can decline to $0.184. The probability of the digital currency forming a cup and handle formation has decreased. It is likely to become range-bound between $0.184 to $0.477. We shall wait for a new buy set up to form before suggesting any trade on it. LTC/USD Litecoin has broken below the ascending channel, the 20-day EMA, and the 50-day SMA. It is currently struggling to hold the horizontal support at $141.026. If the LTC/USD pair sinks and closes (UTC) below $141 levels, it will become negative and can decline to $127 and below that to $115 levels. If the levels hold, the digital currency will continue to trade inside the small range of $141-$167. Due to the overall weakness, it is better to wait for the decline to end before buying. ADA/BTC The cup and handle formation on Cardano has failed. The bulls failed to sustain the price above the breakout levels of 0.00003445, which resulted in a slump that broke below our stop loss at 0.000032. The other stop loss at 0.000029 was saved by a small margin as the digital currency had slid to 0.00002902 levels today. The ADA/BTC pair is currently at the 50-day SMA. If this level holds, the bulls will try to break out of the overhead resistance once again. If this level breaks, it can again slide down to 0.000020 levels. Therefore, we suggest maintaining the stops at 0.000029 on the remaining position. IOTA/USD IOTA has broken below the horizontal support, the 20-day EMA and the support line of the ascending channel. This shows short-term weakness. The IOTA/USD pair has a minor support at the $1.81 levels from where it is trying to rebound. If this level breaks, the fall can extend to $1.63, which is a critical support. We anticipate buying to emerge close to the 50-day SMA. Let’s wait for the buyers to return before entering any long position. EOS/USD The consolidation in EOS has resolved on the downside as the price has broken down of the tight range. The bulls are trying to defend the 50 percent retracement levels of the rally from $5.9610 to $23.0290. The EOS/USD pair can decline to the support line of the descending channel, which also coincides with the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels. The 50-day SMA is also just below this level. While the trend still remains positive, it’s better to wait for the pullback to end before initiating any fresh long positions.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

The case has been listed for further hearing on May 17, 2018.\n“Banking is an essential service. How can one deny access to an essential service when I’m not doing anything illegal? You have not declared VCs ( virtual currencies ) illegal in the country,” said one of the petitioners requesting anonymity.\nThe Reserve bank of India on April 6, 2018 mandated banks, e-wallets, and payment gateway providers to withdraw support for cryptocurrency exchanges and other businesses dealing with virtual currencies in India.\nThe writ petition filed by a group of eleven different representatives from various crypto related businesses challenges the constitutionality validity of the RBI’s decision.\nThe petition came up for hearing before the court of the Chief Justice of India on May 11, 2018. The Supreme Court issued notices to the RBI and Union of India after hearing the petition. The matter has been listed for further hearing on May 17, 2018.\nA writ petition is usually filed for the speedy review of an issue. The RBI’s circular mandates financial institutions to block services by July 5, 2018 putting crypto-related businesses in a spot. In this case, the writ is primarily to see if the government action is constitutionally sound.\nThe writ petition - Rajdeep Singh v. Reserve Bank of India - is the fourth in the series of writ petitions against the RBI for blocking off banking services to cryptocurrency exchanges in India.\nOn April 6, 2018, Kali Digital Eco-systems Pvt. Ltd. which runs the exchange CoinRecoil filed a writ in the Delhi High Court on the grounds that the RBI circular infringes on their right to trade, that is guaranteed in our constitution.\nA while after, another exchange moneytradecoin.com approached the High Court of Delhi challenging the RBI Circular. The Delhi High Court has clubbed these two cases that will come up for hearing on May 24, 2018.\nOn May 8, another joint writ petition was filed by four cryptocurrency exchanges in the Supreme Court against the RBI circular.\nThe Indian government has set up a committee under Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs that is currently working on a framework to regulate cryptocurrencies. The committee is yet to come out with its decision.\n“The RBI has given an affidavit saying that there is a committee at the highest level in the Finance Ministry examining virtual currencies.. Coming up with a circular while awaiting a decision has a chilling effect on any kind of business dealing with virtual currencies,” the petitioner said.\nThe move by RBI has already resulted in the flight of many Indian blockchain startups and cryptocurrency exchanges. Many more are mulling the move to crypto-friendly nations like Australia, Estonia, Cayman Islands, Australia and the like.\nThe newest petition was tagged with two pending writ petitions filed in public interest. The two pending writs filed last year pertain to deciding the legality/illegality of cryptocurrencies in India.\n0 Comments ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/eleven-individuals-approach-supreme-court-challenging-rbi-circular-blocking-banking-services-for-bitcoin-businesses/articleshow/64141463.cms&title=11", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=11"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bank of india", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T21:18:46.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d70e743d17dc4d3bae7df648002a4fc4f95159f6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVS3EzjeA0C2l9OIIti.AkUUdHw4s7uWStT4bvyeXhRfWh_GRkQwSIIQ--", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "5,000 Developers in India Ready to Work on Crypto Projects - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "5,000 Developers in India Ready to Work on Crypto Projects - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/indian-developers.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d70e743d17dc4d3bae7df648002a4fc4f95159f6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVS3EzjeA0C2l9OIIti.AkUUdHw4s7uWStT4bvyeXhRfWh_GRkQwSIIQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kevin Helms", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "5,000 Developers in India Ready to Work on Crypto Projects - Bitcoin News", "text": "5949 5,000 Developers in India Ready to Work on Crypto Projects\nAccording to a recent study, 5,000 Indian software developers currently have the skill sets to work on cryptocurrency and blockchain projects. 10,000 more developers can be easily trained but an additional 30,000 would require extensive training.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space 5,000 Developers Qualified\nA recent study by HR company Belong shows that, out of an estimated two million software developers in India, about 0.25% of them have the skills to work on cryptocurrency and blockchain projects, the Times of India reported this week. The study was conducted on two million software developers over the last year. The company found that only 5,000 of them have the necessary combination of skills such as “data science, algorithms and cryptography” to be qualified to work with cryptocurrencies or blockchains.\nBelong co-founder Rishabh Kaul asserted that “India does have the potential to train another 10,000 developers” with prior experience in the fintech industry so that they are equipped with the proper skill sets to work on cryptocurrency projects. However, he noted that another 30,000 software developers who have worked “in back-end tech roles” still “require extensive training and upskilling” before they have the proper skill sets to work as blockchain experts on crypto projects.\nHowever, companies are facing challenges in finding qualified developers, Belong’s study revealed. Kaul explained that the demand for developers with the right skill sets needed for projects related to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is expected to grow further, adding that:\nDevelopers must essentially have skills in data science, algorithms and cryptography to work on such platforms. Popular Demand\nThe number of companies looking to enter the cryptocurrency space is increasing. Burning Glass Technologies wrote in October last year that “because of its connection with ‘cryptocurrencies,’ blockchain is associated with finance, and major banks like Liberty Mutual, Capital One, and Bank of America have posted openings.”\nEarlier this month, freelance employment website Upwork released its Q1 2018 skills index. “The Upwork Skills Index ranks the site’s 20 fastest-growing skills in a quarterly series that sheds light on new and emerging skills as an indication of hot freelance job market trends,” the company described. Blockchain tops the top 20 fastest-growing skills in the time period, the company detailed, adding:\nIts growth exceeded 2,000% for three quarters in a row on Upwork.com, and in Q1 it experienced more than 6,000% year-over-year growth, making it the fastest-growing skill out of more than 5,000 skills on the site.\nWhat do you think of the number of qualified Indian developers?

That me bit cookie.”\nCookie Monster then goes on to talk about self-regulation — a key topic of discussion within the nascent cryptocurrency indsutry. He confesses that he has an issue with regulating himself. He explains, if he sees a cookie he’s not supposed to eat, he takes a step back and looks away. Then, he would eventually eat it.\n“Me, OK, me do have issues with controlling meself. Fruit, cookie, fruit, cookie. Ah. This tough decision. So me got strategies me use to help me to control meself. Well, what me like to um, to control meself, me sometimes like to take deep breath. And it calm youself down.

New York has a lot of news happening this week, with the New York Stock Exchange’s parent company looking to get into bitcoin trading and Blockchain Week kicking off with the CDX Summit. South Korea continues to be a leader in blockchain technology, rolling out new partnerships with neighboring countries, and building out more blockchain technology.\nFeatured stories by Colin Harper, Nick Marinoff and Aaron van Wirdum.\nStay on top of the best stories in the bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. Subscribe to our newsletter here . Bitmain’s Antminer Z9 Mini Designed to Mine Zcash, Threatens ASIC Resistance\nBitmain announced, via Twitter, the release of its new Antminer Z9 mini, an ASIC miner capable of mining any cryptocurrency running the Equihash proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm. This includes, most notably, Zcash , which is a decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency designed to offer users complete privacy in transactions. Zcash has always used the Equihash PoW mining algorithm to prevent the progress of Zcash ASIC miners and has predominantly been mined by general-purpose GPU chips.\nThe development of ASIC hardware is causing some cryptocurrencies to change their proof-of-work mining algorithm. Bitcoin Gold has a hard fork coming to defeat it and Monero has already modified their mining algorithm to counter ASIC hardware. GlobalData: South Korea Among the World’s Leading Markets for Blockchain Technology\nAccording to analytics firm GlobalData , South Korea has become a leader in the blockchain community. Businesses like Korea Telecom are already working to determine how the blockchain can be used to lessen production expenses and generate new types of revenue. Representatives of the South Korean telephone giant have already joined with Sprint and Japan’s SoftBank to launch a “blockchain-powered data roaming service” in the coming weeks. Executives say the company has big plans to use the blockchain to power “finance, IoT, smart energy and healthcare businesses.”\nSouth Korea is also attracting businesses from neighboring countries like Japan, whose social messaging platform Line is set to launch a blockchain subsidiary known as Unblock within South Korea’s borders. The purpose of the subsidiary will be to further study the blockchain and determine how it can best be applied to the company’s remaining divisions. As the nation leads the blockchain revolution, neighboring regions are also taking the bait and looking into how blockchain technology can best be utilized to further cement operational security and efficiency. NYT Report: Parent Company to NYSE Is Planning a Bitcoin Exchange\nIntercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), wants to establish its own cryptocurrency exchange. According to New York Times (NYT) sources, ICE has been in talks with legacy banks and financial institutions to facilitate swap contracts for potential bitcoin trading. These contracts would essentially allow banks to buy contracts for bitcoin, giving the exchange sure anchors of liquidity. Once an exchange user buys one of these contracts, cash changes hands and the corresponding bitcoin would appear in their wallet the next day. The report reveals that the exchange, which would be built with “large investors” in mind, would permit direct bitcoin trading, not futures contracts as we’ve seen with the CBOE and CME. CDX Brings Inaugural Blockchain Summit to New York\nThe latest installment of the Chief Digital Officer Global Forum (CDX) summit series will be held in New York on May 11, 2018. Established in 2013, the summit has set up shop in Chicago, San Francisco, Singapore and, most recently, Las Vegas, with focuses on emerging innovations in mobile, IoT and digital advertising technologies.\nThis latest installment will concentrate on advancements in blockchain technology and its application to traditional industries. To this end, the CDX Blockchain Brand Innovation Summit has an extensive list of speakers and panelists both from within and without the blockchain space, featuring representatives from the likes of Hulu, CNBC, IBM and BTC Media. Breaking Bitcoin Conference Heading for Lisbon This Summer as “Building on Bitcoin”\nThe Breaking Bitcoin conference, first organized last summer in Paris, is returning for its second edition under the name “ Building on Bitcoin ,” this time in Lisbon, July 3–4, 2018. While the event in the French capital was centered around security, the one in the Portuguese capital will focus on second-layer technologies and other creative uses of the Bitcoin protocol.\nBuilding on Bitcoin will focus on second-layer technologies in a broad sense. The best known and most popular of these is probably the Lightning Network , of which the first implementations entered their beta stage over the past couple of months.

Shiraz Jagati 14 hours ago 3 min read Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Telegram\nAfter hitting a low of $6,850 earlier this year, Bitcoin experienced a resurgence in the past month as prices climbed back to $9,950. According to Tom Lee , Head of Research at Fundstrat, the intrinsic weakness of currencies like Bitcoin lies in the fact that investors have to keep selling their virtual holdings in order to “raise cash to pay for their 2017 gains.”\nWhile it’s impossible to predict exactly why this past week’s crypto drop occurred, some have attributed it to the comments made by business magnates Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger at the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting, where they criticized Bitcoin and other virtual assets — likening them to “rat poison.” Before this week, Bitcoin was on a strong recovery path, hitting a 2018 high of $9950 on May 5th.\nAfter falling to just over $9,300 last weekend, the crypto powerhouse remained relatively stable for a few days until it dropped to $8,320 yesterday.\nIn the midst of this latest price drop, Lee believes that the upcoming Consensus 2018 Conference — scheduled to take place in New York City between May 14 – 16 — will help the crypto sector rebound and once again display strong bullish signs. The Korean Impact Related Story: Top South Korean Crypto Exchange Raided by Local Police\nAnother reason for the Bitcoin dip may have been caused by the recent police raid of Upbit , South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, by the nation’s Financial Supervisory Commission.\nAccording to a respected Korean news outlet, Chosun , ten financial investigators visited Upbit’s Gangnam-gu office after they were notified of certain fraudulent activities that the trading platform had been involved with.\nThe prosecution claims that Upbit is “deceiving their customers” and is falsely portraying currency holdings that they do not actually own, primarily by faking their balance sheets.\nData from CoinMarketCap shows that Upbit is the fourth largest cryptocurrency exchange by trade volume yet it accounts for less than 2% of Bitcoin’s total trading volume over the past 30 days. Tokyo Whales Ready to Dump BTC Related Story: Tokyo Whale Prepares 8,000 BTC Dump as Crypto Bloodbath Continues\nSimilarly, it is being reported that a Mt. Gox trustee is positioning to liquidate 8,200 Bitcoins to pay off previous investors from the 2014 hack that bankrupted the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange at the time.\nWhile seeing such a large amount of BTC moving has alarmed crypto investors, besides having a physiological effect, this move should not have any major impact on the value of Bitcoin in the long-term. Consensus 2018 Starts Next Week\nConsensus 2018, a three-day conference dealing with all matters related to crypto and blockchain, starts on Monday of next week. The event is hosted by CoinDesk and boasts of over 250+ speakers along with nearly 7,000 attendees from a host of different industry startups and financial institutions.\nStarting in 2015, the conference has morphed into a go-to destination for crypto enthusiasts from across the globe. This is reflected by its growing annual attendance, which has increased tremendously since its inception in 2015: #Consensus2018 >7k registered vs est. 2,750 last yr (our est.), 3x increase… hence, crypto market expected to see large moves next week and in 2017, alts rose sharply https://t.co/mj7WArjy1P\n— Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) May 9, 2018 2015 Conference Attendees: 400 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shiraz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jagati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie munger", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook share", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city turn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T17:28:22.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1395d244c570dd7c37f5bbcc024ff48a18e694c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBYwudzuNKE.GaCoI3B7VhzL4beoNZlaMRMBpCLPNxPdM7vxaWQ_h2U97_wIUZNJXxVqlzTvWcmUyecEY6M2CH7QFAIKt8mFo-", "site_full": "themerkle.com", "site": "themerkle.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "CBS Gives Cryptocurrency YouTuber His Own Bitcoin Show – The Merkle", "title_full": "CBS Gives Cryptocurrency YouTuber His Own Bitcoin Show – The Merkle", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://themerkle.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_729630679.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 90224, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1395d244c570dd7c37f5bbcc024ff48a18e694c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBYwudzuNKE.GaCoI3B7VhzL4beoNZlaMRMBpCLPNxPdM7vxaWQ_h2U97_wIUZNJXxVqlzTvWcmUyecEY6M2CH7QFAIKt8mFo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jp Buntinx", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "CBS Gives Cryptocurrency YouTuber His Own Bitcoin Show – The Merkle", "text": "Pin 1 Shares 56\nCryptocurrency has begun making an impact on the TV landscape. Dozens of TV shows have made references to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies over the years, though not always in a positive manner. It now seems a YouTuber known as Crypto Crow will be getting his own TV show on CBS, CW, and Roku starting next month. Crypto Crow on Television\nIt is good to see major US TV broadcasters pay attention to cryptocurrency. All of the drama and controversy in the crypto industry often makes for some pretty good headlines, and even generates ideas for TV shows every now and then. Indeed, CBS’s New York affiliate will broadcast its very own show on cryptocurrency starting June 25.\nThe show will be hosted by Jason Appleton. That name might not necessarily ring a bell for most people, as he is better known as Crypto Crow on YouTube. His videos have generated a lot of views over the past few months, mainly thanks to his ICO reviews and his successful investments in various currencies and tokens.\nAlthough a following of 70,000 YouTube subscribers doesn’t warrant getting a dedicated TV show on CBS New York, it seems the channel is more than interested in what Appleton brings to the table. He is a valuable influencer in the world of cryptocurrency, and the Crypto Crow brand has become increasingly popular over time. Through an agreement with CBS Television networks, 13 episodes of “Crypto Crow Show” will be aired in select markets.\nMore specifically, the first season of this show will air in New York, Philly, Pittsburgh, Detroit, Atlanta, Tampa Bay, and on Roku. In total, “Crypto Crow Show” will be broadcast to over 47 million homes. Just because this show can be watched in so many locations doesn’t mean it will ever get 47 million viewers per episode. However, it is an interesting experiment by CBS, to say the very least.\nThe show itself will focus on many topics, ranging from ICOs to bot trading and cryptocurrency mining. This industry involves a lot of topics and aspects, all of which will need to be highlighted. Allowing people to gain a better understanding of how cryptocurrency works is vital for getting people excited about Bitcoin and altcoins.\nThis is the first time a cryptocurrency YouTuber has launched their own TV show. While it is not on the grand scale most people would have liked to see, it can set a precedent for future shows on major US TV channels. CBS is definitely taking a gamble, and one that may not necessarily pay off in the long run. Nonetheless, it’s a major development for fans of Crypto Crow.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.Unlike 2017, the rallies in most major cryptocurrencies this year has been subdued. We believe that they are forming a bottom, which can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months.During this process, the price will remain volatile as the bulls, and the bears battle it out to establish their supremacy. The supportive news will see prices move up while adverse news can lead to a decline.The latest set of news that influenced the decline for most cryptocurrencies is the investigation of South Korean exchange Upbit by the country’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) and liquidation of Bitcoin by the executives in charge of refunding users affected by the collapse of the former Japanese exchange Mt.Gox.The news on the fundamental side has also been positive with many financial institutions planning to enter cryptocurrencies, but it is still not reflecting in the price.Investment research firm Fundstrat believes that this will soon change and Bitcoin can reach $36,000 by end-2019. They have projected a probable range of $20,000-$64,000. Even if Bitcoin only reaches the lower end of the range, it will return about 125 percent from the current levels.Let’s see whether we should buy the current dip or wait it out. BTC/USD Bitcoin attempted to hold bounce off the 20-day EMA on May 09 but could not find buying support at higher levels. On May 10, it broke below both the 20-day EMA and the small trendline support. Our stop loss at $8,900 was hit today as the cryptocurrency plunged to a low of $8539.62.On the downside, the 50-day SMA at $8423 is a strong support, below which the fall can stretch to $7,900. If this level also breaks, the BTC/USD pair can sink to $7,000 levels once again.If the 50-day SMA holds, the digital currency will attempt to move up, but it might face resistance at the 20-day EMA.The flattening of the moving averages points to the formation of a range. The supports and resistances of the probable range have still not established. Hence, we are not recommending any trade today. ETH/USD Ethereum failed to sustain above $745 on May 10. This resulted in a fall that has broken below the 20-day EMA triggering our stop loss at $680. With the fall, the ‘V’ shaped bottom formation has been invalidated.The ETH/USD pair has support at $656.55, which is the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the rise from the lows of $363 to $838. If this level also breaks, $600.50 should act as a strong support, which is the 50 percent retracement level.Traders should wait for buying to emerge at lower levels before entering any long positions. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash failed to sustain above the $1,600 levels on May 10, resulting in a breakdown below the ascending channel.Today, the BCH/USD pair plunged below the 20-day EMA and hit our stop loss at $1,400.Currently, prices have recovered from the lows, and the bulls are trying to climb back above the 20-day EMA. If the levels hold, Bitcoin Cash will again attempt to scale above $1,600.The critical support on the downside is $1,221. If this level breaks, the slide can extend to the 50-day SMA. XRP/USD Ripple has broken down of the range which gives it a lower target of $0.58223. Currently, the bulls are attempting to defend the 50-day SMA. Even if they succeed, the rebound will face a stiff resistance at $0.76 and the 20-day EMA.If the XRP/USD pair breaks below the 50-day SMA, the fall can extend to the next support zone of $0.56-$0.58.Here too, the odds of formation of a large range have increased. We shall wait for the cryptocurrency to find some support before buying it. XLM/USD Stellar has broken below the horizontal support at $0.334 and is currently attempting to take support at the 50-day SMA. The failure of the bulls to hold a critical support indicates weakness.If the XLM/USD pair breaks below the 50-day SMA, it can decline to $0.184. The probability of the digital currency forming a cup and handle formation has decreased. It is likely to become range-bound between $0.184 to $0.477.We shall wait for a new buy set up to form before suggesting any trade on it. LTC/USD Litecoin has broken below the ascending channel, the 20-day EMA, and the 50-day SMA. It is currently struggling to hold the horizontal support at $141.026. If the LTC/USD pair sinks and closes (UTC) below $141 levels, it will become negative and can decline to $127 and below that to $115 levels.If the levels hold, the digital currency will continue to trade inside the small range of $141-$167. Due to the overall weakness, it is better to wait for the decline to end before buying. ADA/BTC The cup and handle formation on Cardano has failed. The bulls failed to sustain the price above the breakout levels of 0.00003445, which resulted in a slump that broke below our stop loss at 0.000032. The other stop loss at 0.000029 was saved by a small margin as the digital currency had slid to 0.00002902 levels today.The ADA/BTC pair is currently at the 50-day SMA. If this level holds, the bulls will try to break out of the overhead resistance once again.If this level breaks, it can again slide down to 0.000020 levels. Therefore, we suggest maintaining the stops at 0.000029 on the remaining position. IOTA/USD IOTA has broken below the horizontal support, the 20-day EMA and the support line of the ascending channel. This shows short-term weakness. The IOTA/USD pair has a minor support at the $1.81 levels from where it is trying to rebound. If this level breaks, the fall can extend to $1.63, which is a critical support. We anticipate buying to emerge close to the 50-day SMA.Let’s wait for the buyers to return before entering any long position. EOS/USD The consolidation in EOS has resolved on the downside as the price has broken down of the tight range. The bulls are trying to defend the 50 percent retracement levels of the rally from $5.9610 to $23.0290.The EOS/USD pair can decline to the support line of the descending channel, which also coincides with the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels. The 50-day SMA is also just below this level.While the trend still remains positive, it’s better to wait for the pullback to end before initiating any fresh long positions.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

Fundstrat’s technician Robert Sluymer says Bitcoin has bottomed with an upside seen from here. Blockchain Week New York to Trigger Next Bullish Momentum, Says Fundstrat Analyst\nThe most important annual conference for the cryptocurrency ecosystem is taking place in New York while Bitcoin sits just above the 50-day moving average. While the blockchain industry gets together to move the technology forward, digital currency investors wait on the sidelines and hope for the best.\nAccording to Robert Sluymer, managing director and head of technical research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, a lot of people are looking for clarity on projects as uncertainty around regulation still looms. He added that it should all become clearer as ‘we move around Consensus.’\nWith regard to the technical analysis, Sluymer told CNBC that he expects Bitcoin to shake a few traders, but to hold around the 50-day average, which is fairly close to where we are now.\n“Bull-bear scenario developing where folks are arguing it’s getting lower. Our view is this is a much bigger bottom that has developed. If that’s the case, this pullback will be relatively shallow. It’s already pulling back from the 200-day. It’s sitting just above the 50-day moving average. So, between the $8,800 and $8,200 – and I know it’s a big range – but that’s where we will see support and we think Bitcoin continues higher from here.”\nRegulatory risk is the fundamental issue driving the downward pressure on cryptocurrencies, but Sluymer is confident that the market has bottomed. He is of the opinion that it is in a stage of general recovery and that the Blockchain Week will be the next big catalyst for Bitcoin .\nFundstrat’s Global Advisory forecast is based on three data points, the past events in 2015, 2016, and 2017. All of the previous conferences were followed by a bullish response from the cryptocurrency market.\nThe week-long event includes high-profile names such as St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard, European Parliament member Eva Kaili, and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, among other movers and shakers in the cryptocurrency world.\nThe organization expects to host approximately 8,000 people, half of whom are coming from abroad. Last year’s event had a turnout of 2,700 attendees, which shows how much the blockchain community has grown in size and importance in a single year. Featured image from Shutterstock.

However, in a significant diversion from the scandal Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook’s creator) now finds himself embroiled in, new revelations have come to light concerning plans by Facebook to leverage blockchain technology.\nZuckerberg himself dropped a big hint about the project, expressing interest recently too,\n“…go deeper and study the positive and negative effect of these technologies and how best to use them in our service.”\nThough the details are scarce, comments by active team members, including David Marcus (the former leader of Facebook’s Messenger application), have given credibility to a series of internet rumors surfacing over the past week.\nMr. Marcus remarked,\n“I’m setting up a small group to explore how to best leverage blockchain across Facebook, starting from scratch”\nWith the realization of a new team being employed to research the potential uses of cryptocurrency within the platform, we can no longer turn a blind eye to the possibilities, and possible repercussions, of our data forever being stamped onto the blockchain. For now, however, investors have reason to be excited by the potential of Facebook pushing into the payments business.\nFacebook, with over 2 Billion users, may just create the first mass-market cryptocurrency. And while the project at this point remains exploratory, some believe the use of blockchain technology may help solve some of the issues surrounding privacy (or the lack thereof) the social media giant is known for.\n87 Million users were exploited by what Zuckerberg’s team calls “malicious actors.” Compromising personal data in the largest scandal in recent memory, the real evil actor is likely Zuckerberg himself, who profits significantly on the exploitation and sale of our personal details.\nStill, the news will probably be met with a positive response from investors as more and more people become enlightened by the use of blockchain in our daily lives.\nOnly time will tell if a new cryptocurrency can help protect our data going forward. And with the ‘Drop Facebook’ movement gaining steam, it is no doubt useful for Zuckerberg to use this news as a healthy diversion from the current scandal.\nWith the daily news cycle focusing away from the recent scandal and grabbing instead onto the hottest topic on the web (cryptocurrency), Facebook may even be able to boost the value of their shares in a time they should be dropping like a stone.\nWe can’t say for sure how far Facebook will go toward creating a blockchain based payment system. Indeed, before more is revealed, we can only speculate on the team’s intentions. In the meantime, we have the right to remain skeptical about the real intentions behind the world’s largest social media corporation.\nWhile the news gives investors a chance to make serious gains on the valuation of the Facebook stock, users of the platform may be wise to divulge a bit less information than they have become accustomed to until more light is shed on the rumors.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a circular essentially banning crypto services, which will remain in place at least until a formal hearing.\nAlso read: Bitcoin’s Anonymous $55 Million Pineapple Fund Gives Final Donation Indian Supreme Court Denies Grant of Injunction Against RBI\nCrypto Kanoon (@cryptokanoon) is a group of lawyers active in the space concerned with regulatory analysis and legal awareness. They’ve been particular watchful of goings on regarding India’s central bank, RBI, and its recent circular demanding banks it serves shut down any business with cryptocurrency companies. Through a petition challenging the RBI ban, enthusiasts hoped by this week to see some relief at the country’s highest court. An interim measure employed by most courts around the world is to cease a particularly controversial action until such time as a final decision can be made. And it was just such a move crypto advocates were hoping would be followed during the petition’s consideration: allow banks to continue serving cryptocurrency clients as they had prior to the RBI ban.\nYesterday, the Supreme Court instead declined an interim injunction, for now allowing the RBI ban to stay in place. It was a blow to the near dozen representatives from India’s crypto community. It is important to note that such a procedural decision theoretically has no bearing on the eventual outcome of the petition for relief itself. The case will return before the Supreme Court May 17th.\nThe Reserve Bank of India’s circular from April ordered “with immediate effect, entities regulated by the Reserve Bank shall not deal in VCs [(virtual currencies)] or provide services for facilitating any person or entity in dealing with or settling VCs.” The ban appears to be rather comprehensive in scope, including “maintaining accounts, registering, trading, settling, clearing, giving loans against virtual tokens, accepting them as collateral, opening accounts of exchanges dealing with them and transfer / receipt of money in accounts relating to purchase / sale of VCs.” Indian Crypto Community Pushes Back\nWest Bengal’s Dwaipayan Bhowmik was the originator of a petition, asking government to regulate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin core (BTC). His request was to galvanize the various ministries, from the country’s Securities and Exchange Board (SEBI) to the Reserve Bank itself. Mr. Bhowmik was quoted by regional media as wishing “to prevent financial crimes such as money laundering, flesh trade, etc.”\nA quirk of the judicial appeal process in the world’s second most populated country is to allow petitioners, no matter their side advocacy, to appeal together. Two petitioners are diametrically opposed on the issue, in other words, with one wanting an outright ban and the other wanting it formally recognized by the government. For his part, Mr. Bhowmik insisted he falls in neither camp. “I just want it to be regulated,” he said .\nThere is yet another case, filed by crypto exchange startup Coil Recoil and various exchanges, to be heard in the Delhi High Court May 24th. The two cases are unrelated. As reported in these pages , many felt “the RBI directive is arbitrary and a violation of the Constitution of India, and the court should therefore quash it. The document presented to the count, which news.Bitcoin.com has obtained, explains that due to the RBI Circular the company will not be able to secure banking services that are imperative for the business’ operations rendering it ‘stillborn.’”\nWhatever the case, May promises to be a critical month for India’s crypto community.\nDo you think India’s Supreme Court will overturn the RBI ban?

Gox was positioning to liquidate 8,200 Bitcoins to pay off previous investors. This number of Bitcoins represents about 10% of the cryptocurreny’s past two weeks daily trading volume. If the selling is spread over multiple days it shouldn’t have much of an impact , besides a psychological one.\nCryptocurrency and Blockchain conference in New York City next week\nConsensus 2018 is a three day conference on cryptocurrencies and Blockchain being held in New York City starting on Monday next week. In just four years it has become one of the largest crypto conferences in the world and is hosted by CoinDesk .\nFrom the conference website it says the conference will “feature 250+ speakers and 4,000+ attendees from the leading industry startups, investors, financial institutions, enterprise tech leaders, and academic and policy groups who are building the foundations of the blockchain and digital currency economy.” Its attendance has exploded. Starting from three years ago it should grow by at least 10x and may push 20x. The number of attendees by year is:\n2015 400 2016 1,400 2017 2,700 2018 4,000 plus and it could exceed 7,000 Tom Lee at Fundstrat believes this conference could help Bitcoin rebound\nWhile it is only three data points, Lee believes there is a pattern of Bitcoin moving higher during and after the conference . From a week prior to the end of the conferences, Bitcoin has rallied 10% to 69% and after two months it has increased 78% to 138%. Since Bitcoin is down year to date and with the large increase in attendance, Lee believes Bitcoin is primed to move higher.\nFundstrat, Bloomberg Bitcoin price moves from past and current Consensus conferences\nLee has also developed indexes of other cryptocurrencies, one of which is the FS CryptoFX 250. It tracks the 51 st to 300 th largest cryptocurrencies based on market cap and liquidity. Over the same timeframe of one week prior to the Consensus conferences until their end, this index has increased 9% to 176%. At two months post conference, the index has risen 56% to 552%.\nFundstrat, Bloomberg Alt coin cryptocurrencies price charts from past and current Consensus conferences", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie munger", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "forbes contributors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chesnot/getty images bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T03:47:00.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d52874aa420e7aa09aaeac490273524716a1f383", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQsnthDCSipysm4zct46tk7zY22og.Uujmj1veX2_Eere2eX5hxNybvH177hrBl9d5BTS.jnwtm.stCOp3WlNEI", "site_full": "blog.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "The Story of How Bitcoin was Compromised", "title_full": "The Story of How Bitcoin was Compromised", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.018, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/landing_fb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d52874aa420e7aa09aaeac490273524716a1f383", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQsnthDCSipysm4zct46tk7zY22og.Uujmj1veX2_Eere2eX5hxNybvH177hrBl9d5BTS.jnwtm.stCOp3WlNEI", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Story of How Bitcoin was Compromised", "text": "You are here: Home / Scaling Debate / The Story of How Bitcoin was Compromised The Story of How Bitcoin was Compromised May 12, 2018 by sterlin 25 Comments\nCryptocurrency is a groundbreaking invention. It is truly wondrous and revolutionary. It allows people to take back economic freedom from centralized cartels and undermine oppressive third parties. But even though the technology has the capacity to return power to the people, it is not immune to attacks. Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was compromised in an attack.\nAlso Read: Poor Communication Undermines the Bitcoin Ecosystem\nIt is true the technology that allows bitcoin to function—the blockchain—is antifragile and resilient, but it still has an Achilles tendon. There is at least one attack vector that can harm bitcoin. Matter of fact, when someone creates an allegedly unassailable technology, it practically invites people to launch attacks against it.\nHowever, the weakness attackers exploited was not based in code or mathematics. Instead, the attackers targeted a more vulnerable aspect of the technology: the community .\nThe attackers infiltrated the community and compromised bitcoin to alter the cryptocurrency’s original purpose. They changed bitcoin from a threatening, extremely efficient, peer-to-peer cash system, into a less frightening, slower and more cumbersome cryptocurrency. It is now called “Bitcoin Core” or “Segwit Coin,” rather than Satoshi Nakamoto’s amazing invention, “Bitcoin.”\nThe attack happened almost imperceptibly, somewhat slowly, dragged out over the course of time. The attack was so successful that many people do not feel bitcoin was attacked at all. This is because the psychology of the community has warped in the process. The Scaling Debate\nIt all started with a debate on how to scale bitcoin. A fiery discussion on how to bring bitcoin to the masses erupted between 2014 and 2015.\nThe scaling debate took place primarily on Reddit and bitcointalk.org , because these sites are where the community has regularly convened to discuss matters within the ecosystem. Shortly after the debates started, individuals appeared to rally to the side of the Core development team, as well as the Blockstream company, who promoted the notion that bitcoin cannot scale by increasing the block size.\nThe Core spokespeople said bitcoin can never reach the throughput transaction level that the VISA and MasterCard networks achieve by scaling on-chain. In order for bitcoin to reach this level of growth, second layer solutions would need to be deployed. This would occur by the addition of a protocol referred to as Segwit. It would solve the transaction malleability problem, and allow for the clean addition of second layer protocols, they said.\nCore supporters vehemently argued against any and all block size increases. They said it is not a solution that allows for exponential growth. It would also cause more mining centralization in bitcoin, leading to the possibility of a 51% attack .\nFor anyone paying attention, these arguments would have sounded odd, because bitcoin was intended to scale on-chain. It is true there was a block size limit of 1mb, but this hard limit was only implemented to prevent network spam. The hard limit was meant to be increased as the network expanded.\nThe fear of centralization is also misguided. Bitcoin can scale on-chain without much centralization, because technology grows at an exponential rate. This is expressed in both Moore’s Law and The Law of Accelerating Returns as demonstrated by Ray Kurzweil. In this sense, technology would keep pace with bitcoin growth to curb the possibility of increasing centralization. Censorship Campaign\nFrom the vantage point of an outsider, it would have certainly looked like the Core supporters were winning the debate and gaining more traction. All across popular forums where the bitcoin commentary raged, there seemed to be no defense of on-chain scaling.\nIn fact, the forums would have looked like an echo chamber to most people. However, in reality, Core supporters did not have consensus. There were a lot of people singing the praises of Satoshi by pleading for an on-chain scaling solution . They wanted to expand the blocksize to meet market demand. They were even willing to compromise whereas Core supporters were not.\nThe reason it looked like Core supporters were winning is because they had began censoring posts they disagreed with. As soon as people created a post about on-chain scaling, moderators deleted those posts. They made claims that scaling on-chain wasn’t the goal of bitcoin, and those wanting to scale on-chain were essentially talking about another coin or “fork.” Moderators and Core supporters got it into their head that scaling bitcoin on-chain was somehow antithetical to bitcoin.\nThey used this excuse to delete posts containing arguments for on-chain scaling. The leader behind this agenda was Theymos. He was known for moderating the r/bitcoin subreddit. John Blocke wrote an in-depth article on Medium about Theymos and this censorship campaign. He also cited a ton of evidence, including screenshots. He said:\n“Since the limit was introduced in 2010, there have been countless discussions on the necessity as well as the methods that would be used to increase this limit, and Bitcoin’s transaction processing capabilities with it. Those attempts have repeatedly been blocked by a small group of developers, and in recent years discussion of increasing the limit has been censored from some of Bitcoin’s largest discussion forums, all of which are moderated by the same individual, who posts using the handle Theymos. What is forbidden includes any discussion of code changes that propose increasing the limitation.” A Hegemony of Developers and Bitcoin Crash of 2017\nIt should now be clear how bitcoin was compromised. A group of developers and Segwit devotees gained the trust of the community in order to divert the path of bitcoin. These developers and their followers used censorship to obscure the truth about the scaling debate. During this time frame, many of the original developers were expunged from the project. This includes Mike Hearn and Gavin Andreesen , who Satoshi himself appointed to keep bitcoin on track prior to leaving the project.\nThe insurgent developers did not share Satoshi’s vision. They did not believe that bitcoin could or should scale so that everyone can use it as cash. They believed bitcoin should be a store of value or commodity. They even suggested that high fees and slow confirmation times are a good thing for bitcoin. These developers were either economically ignorant or purposely maneuvering to destroy bitcoin.\nTheir ideas about harming bitcoin came to fruition. During the winter of 2017, bitcoin reached its highest price level, nearing the $20,000 mark. However, during this time bitcoin fees also skyrocketed. They reached an average of $28 dollars per transaction while confirmation times slowed to a snail’s pace. At the beginning of January, the damage was felt across the ecosystem as the price collapsed and the whole cryptocurrency market felt the reverberations. In March, CNBC wrote that bitcoin retraced 70% of its value since the start of the crash.\nIt is true that bitcoin’s price has collapsed as much or more in the past, but this particular collapse has been partly blamed on the “scaling debate” and high fees that plagued bitcoin. Truth and Divisiveness\nIt is not known whether the Core team, including Blockstream , purposely undermined bitcoin. Still, well known people like Jeff Berwick have suggested Blockstream was compromised, because they were bought out by AXA Insurance. Berwick goes on to say the head of AXA is the same person who heads the Bilderberg group. According to Berwick, it appears that central bankers bought out Bitcoin in order to destroy it or hamstring it.\nIn a Dollar Vigilante article Berwick said, “Blockstream is the biggest funder of Bitcoin Core and employs many of the developers. Who owns Blockstream? Well, one of the main shareholders is insurance giant AXA. CEO and Chairman of both the Bilderberg Group and AXA are the same person, Henri de Castries. Yes, essentially, the person most in control of bitcoin development is the Chairman of Bilderberg; the place that I have gone for the last three years to expose from the outside! And, even one time, briefly, from the inside. If the globalists wanted to destroy bitcoin, they would do exactly what they are doing with Blockstream.”\nOthers have stayed more conservative, saying if governments or other entities wanted to harm bitcoin, they would likely do it by causing major divisiveness within the community. They would slowly build a community of distrust, and cause a break in mutual understanding throughout the ecosystem. This would allow for bitcoin to be made vulnerable and thus diverted from its course.\nWhether it was diverted on purpose or by coincidence is still up for debate. The point is that cryptocurrencies can be harmed if they are not protected and nurtured. If the community lets their guard down for a moment, it’s possible to damage cryptocurrencies either by negligence or infiltration. Being mathematically stable and secure is not enough. The communities behind these protocols need to be strong, united, and open to communication. If not, they will leave glaring weaknesses in the network. They will allow the network to fall victim to nefarious actors. The Salvation of Bitcoin\nOn the bright side, not all is lost. Even though the first iteration of bitcoin was practically co-opted, it was born again in the form of bitcoin cash. The community redeemed itself with upgrading the bitcoin protocol by implementing a hard fork and creating bitcoin cash.\nBitcoin Cash has kept the promise and vision of Satoshi Nakamoto alive. It leverages on-chain scaling to grow the network and incentivize adoption. At this point, Bitcoin Cash has instantiated itself as the salvation of bitcoin. It is the true bitcoin that intends on freeing humanity from the clutches of centralized bankers and governments.\nHowever, the community must remain vigilant. What happened to Bitcoin Core should be a lesson to all. If a community falls prey to predatory communication tactics and censorship campaigns, they may lose their cryptocurrency to an attack.\nThey should maintain a healthy community and pay attention to the course of the technology. If they lose sight and vision, their dream will turn to ash. It will get steamrolled. It will be forgotten and placed in the dustbin of history. Everyone must always remember technology is not automatically impregnable. It needs a strong foundation of good people.\nDo you believe Bitcoin was hijacked?\nImages courtesy of Shutterstock\nThis is an Op-ed blog.

It really falls apart with the absurd conspiracy theories.\nDecent storytelling, but completely false. Sterlin Lujan\nYeah, I just mentioned the “conspiracy theory” in passing. I also gave credence to the more conservative positions as well. Edward Iskra\n“The?”\n“In passing”?\nThe piece is rife with absurd conspiracy theories – you seem to like dredging up an assortment of them to go with your lavish partisan praise for Bitcoin Cash… But it’s just revisionist disinformation.\nFor what it’s worth, bonus points for good use of links to raise your SEO. I’m done here; don’t want to put any more activity on this trash. I probably should have just ignored it, and just felt bad for the innocent readers who’d wander by not knowing your post is full of nonsense. -ED-\nYou are a gullible fool that doesn’t understand that everything written in this article is actually correct. BTC was in fact sabotaged by Bitcoin Core people working for Blockstream who are funded by bankers, by brainwashing people like you to think miners are evil a cartel, and lots of other utter bullshit, so to create this manufactured consensus (the way corrupt and bought out governments and MSM do) to fight against Bitcoin system and scalling on-chain. Blockstream sabotaged usability of the BTC and that is a FACT. Bitcoin Cash is unhindered and working Bitcoin system which is why it makes it the real Bitcoin. vikingvista\nBanksters barely knew how to spell “bitcoin”, and cutting edge investors, like some small hedge funds and private equity groups, were betting on higher prices–they are the ones who drove BTC prices up to $20K with nary a care for a measly $30 transaction fee.\nCrypto may be decades from getting legislative changes that permit it to legally function as a frequent small payment method. Because of that, it’s price will be determined by digital commodity investors. And for that purpose, BTC has never been too expensive or too slow. -ED-\n“measly #30 fee”?\nTypical ignorant BTC dummy. Hey moron… most people in the world earn less than that 1 fee, do you fucks ever THINK before you talk? Bitcoin is meant to be used by everyone, to give EVERYONE ability to transact without needing banks… ever…. your “measly” fee is straight away barrier for more than 1/2 the world’s population to use it.\nThis just proves over and over that you fucks that keep attacking Bitcoin Cash, that you have NO FUCKING CLUE what Bitcoin is about.\nNOT A FUCKING CLUE\nAll you are is an ignorant greedy fuck. Greg\nWhy fight this fight? It’s a distraction. If you have full faith in BCH than you should be secure enough to move forward unfettered by the weight of a “dead coin”.\nBut you CAN’T do that, can you? Because you know Bitcoin will remain Bitcoin and BCH will always be an altcoin forked from the bitcoin blockchain; arguing keeps you from having to face that fact. -ED-\nWhy fight? Because bankers hired Blockstream who created Bitcoin Core to fuck BTC up\nBecause these bankers have all the money they want to fund propaganda campaigns to brainwash people to fight against things that are against the bankers, thinking they are fighting for the right thing\nBecause people are brainwashed and they need to be enlightened and educated about this so they stop being brainwashed\nBecause its fight for the right cause, its a fight for decentralised money that can help the world get rid of the fucked up private central banks and fucked up corrupt governments that are controlled by these same private central bankers\n… or have you forgotten already what Bitcoin is about? Faith Sloan\nThe question “Why fight?” still stands. Why fight Bitcoin? Just focus on BitcoinCash and call it a day.\nI am not brainwashed cuz frankly I just don’t give a fart about this fussing back and forth. And not many other people do either. For some reason we have gotten to the point where we think that this ‘issue’ is widespread globally and folks are actually following the train. I hate to bust y’all bubble but that is not reality. A teeny tiny group of folks are in this microsystem fighting in the mirror. Here’s a wakeup call. WE DON’T CARE.\nSo get rid of the “private central banks and … corrupt governments” and stop fussing and arguing. You can put all of your efforts into blah blah blahing or you can actually DO something. -ED-\nDon’t be an idiot (which means you ARE an idiot)… Blockstream and fucks like you that side with them, are the ones that attacked Bitcoin, which is why Bitcoin Cash was created… to get rid of you fucks… and you fucks are the ones that attacked Bitcoin Cash again… as expected… so we are not fighting Bitcoin, we are fighting FOR Bitcoin… Bitcoin Cash IS Bitcoin.\nBTC is not Bitcoin any more.\nAnd as for me DOING something…hey fuckhead! I AM DOING SOMETHING!\nI am fighting against propaganda from Blockstream, Core and you fucks I am supporting actual Bitcoin system I am educating people about Bitcoin, what its all about…\nSo you can go fuck yourself also, together with your friend Greg here.\nAbsolutely. If one believes in cheese, then why is one focusing on applesauce? Just focus on cheese and make it good. Greg\nQuite the infomercial… With all the crap you put togeather to sell an altcoin forked from the bitcoin blockchain, it amazes me that rather than just proclaiming, “The king is dead long live the king”. you try very hard to convince me you ARE the dead king.\nThis rhetoric is losing you ground and is ultimately a waste of time and money. With the advancement of tech, it should be easy to claim to be a better coin.\nBut to try and argue bch is bitcoin is like trying to get people to say facial tissue and not kleenex; cotton swab and not Q-tip; sparkling wine and not champagne. -ED-\nBTC SegWit is an Altcoin. The so called Lightning is an Altcoin. BTC is deliberately sabotaged and cannot scale any more. It has become a useless overpriced shit.\nBitcoin is not a settlement layer for Lightning. Bitcoin is a globally usable true peer-to-peer electronic cash system… which now exist and is known as Bitcoin Cash.\nBitcoin is now BCH… not BTC any more. Greg\nYawn… 99% of the world has decided otherwise. Your insecure rantings aren’t going to change things. -ED-\nOh really? 99% of the world? Have you asked 100% of the world? You talk such shit, please keep your mouth shut as it stinks when you open it.\nBy the way, the only insecure person here is people like you, those that have to write that kind of garbage, as if you fucking know what everyone else thinks and what they “decided”.\nBitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin… it works like one.\nBTC is shit, deliberately crippled crap by the people who work for the bankers, that SegWit shit is in fact an Altcoin, go read Bitcoin white paper again (if you read it ever) it says right there that Bitcoin is a chain of digital signatures, not them being segregated… an don’t get me started on Lighting…. that shit has NOTHING to do with Bitcoin.\nSo pardon me for saying this… just go fuck yourself\nLightning is not a coin. So I stopped reading right there. lol -ED-\nWhat is Lightning then?\nI can see you stepped into your own quick sand… go on… I’m waiting for your answer so I can shut you up with my answer.\nIf Lightning is not a coin, please explain in that case, how can Lighting be scaling of Bitcoin, which is what Core, Blockstream and you lot keep claiming that it is? Go on… I’m all ear… philopolymath\nAstute and absolutely accurate…The goal is not to destroy Bitcoin..merely usurp and control it..Which has been accomplished. In the same fashion Democracies Politics and A Free Press Academia and Science/ Medicine have also become Orwellian/Dystopian tools and vehicles of societal control. Critics of this op-ed are generally too stupid to understand grand strategy and not students of history. They are usually ignorant arrogant sycophants addicted to their illusions ..emotionally immaturely invested in fallacious ideologies. This intellectual weakness has always been the most effective means to exploit the mass. The efficacy of the protocols is irrefutable. Plato was indeed correct to opine the victims would indeed defend their illusions to their own demise. smd\nThis article is basically correct. However the way to go isn’t with 32MB blocks, it’s a bit more complicated. vikingvista\nYou missed April Fool’s day by a month and a half. Better check your calendar.\nThe real story is how all the contention over scaling was almost a complete waste of time by both sides. Long-standing tax legislation is what keeps crypto from being anything but a digital commodity, and it was investing as a digital commodity that temporarily increased fees 5 months ago, so the fees and waits (insignificant for investing purposes) had nothing to do with the crash. Martin Kuvandzheiv\nWho has written this article ? Why all the hate articles about the Real Bitcoin and written by anonymous people? Most of the article has nothing to do with the truth. Bitcoin belongs to the people, everyone can write code and commit a pull request. Scalability cannot happen on-chain. If we imagine that Bitcoin Cash (aka BCH, Bcash) has 32 MB blocks and they are full, this will cause an increase of 4.6 GBs on the blockchain daily increase or over 1.6 TB per year. Moore’s law will not help you as there will be no people to be able to contain the whole BCH blockchain on servers as this would cost 1100 USD for the next year and the value will increase with 960 USD per year. Nobody will do that for Bitcoin Cash. Only BitMain and 2 – 3 other pools will be able to hold that much information on the cloud, no new pools and single miners will spend that much just to hold a pointless history of transactions.\nI do challenge Bitcoin Cash devs to make an off-chain scalability or a way to prune the blockchain, but to keep the chain secure. That way they will do something innovative, not just modify 1 parameter and say that they are the best… Faith Sloan\nYes. They need to do something constructive besides running off at the mouth with Scatological crap-eroni. I am going to go with what’s best for me and the people. When XYZ comes out with a coin that is fungible, usable, low fees, and actually used in commerce, then hallelujah! It could be any of the 1600 coins on the market today. By saying that BCH is the ONLY alternative to BTC and is what will be adopted worldwide is just a pie in the sky wishlist of sorts. SHADDUP and PROVE IT! -ED-\nYou are writing same shit other Core shills have written many times over.\nFact is the cost of storing blockchain is LEAST EXPENSIVE part of mining.\n“Moore’s law will not help”\nWhat? You are an idiot… you can stick to your Floppy disks… world moved on and keeps moving on with tech, improving all the time. ΠΝ\nSo what if BTC is now in the hands of the bankers, why BCH is the only option?\nThe article is suggesting that people should choose BCH over BTC, just because BCH people are good? And what if they fall in the hands of the bad bankers? Then we all switch to bitcoin pizza, that being the real bitcoin?\nSatoshi’s vision was about the technology and the decentralisation, not about the brand. If BTC fails, but the technology exists, people will immediately roll over to other coin or coins and so on.\nUnltimately the vision was not to centralise the decentralisation, but award the option to any person, to print money by creating a consensus. If consesus collapses, people continue to have options. That eventually lead to a society, where everybody, the people, the corporations, the good and the bad, create money, thousands of tokens, end up to one or more coins for every person in the planet, why not? Faith Sloan\nBitcoin is NOT called “Bitcoin Core” by anyone except for those in the BCH camp. It is “Bitcoin” PERIOD. Bitcoin Cash forked from Bitcoin and thus it is Bitcoin Cash. The layman, the consumers, and those who buy and sell Bitcoins do NOT reference it as “Bitcoin Core”. Let us get that straight. I am not going to throw my hat into this boy pissing contest. I think they should just stop the nonsense. If Bitcoin Cash want to be the biggest and the best, then just do what it takes to be the biggest and the best.

From July 1, 2019, any business transaction over $10,000 has to be done using electronic payments. Handing over a hundred $100 notes or more will be illegal, as the government tries to flush out tax avoiders, drug dealers and the rest of the underground economy.\nBitcoiners and other cryptocurrency fans predicted this, and the government is playing into their greedy little hands.\nGRINDING ON UP\nBitcoin surged to $US20,000 last year and then quickly plunged back down to about $6700. Many thought it would continue back down close to zero. Instead, it has rebounded about 40 per cent in the past month to more than $9000, as this next graph shows.\nThe volatile Bitcoin has rebounded in the past month.\nThe recommendation of a ban on cash comes from the government's Black Economy Task Force. The head of the task force, Michael Andrew, described the reasons people use cash in a recent podcast, giving as an example a shopkeeper who runs two tills, keeping some money out of sight of the taxman.\n\"It's basically paying people cash who want to maintain their welfare, their visa status or avoid their child maintenance,\" Mr Andrew said. \"That is widespread in certain areas particularly … the services-based economy, security industry, hospitality, cleaning, couriers, personal trainers, hairdressing and nail salons for example.\"\nGovernments around the world are interested in cracking down on cash, and not just to get those dodgy nail salons paying tax, but also to kill off terrorist financing, to reduce money laundering, and even to let them reduce interest rates below zero. (If you make interest rates negative, people will just take cash out of the bank, but if you also make cash illegal, that's not possible.)\nANARCHY IN THE BLOCKCHAIN\nAll these anti-cash trends are giving life to Bitcoin, and other digital currencies that could serve as an alternative to cash. For some people, that's the whole point of cryptocurrencies. A big part of the early adopters of Bitcoin were people who are deeply worried about government. Many early Bitcoin adopters were libertarians and anarchists who feared an Orwellian world where government constantly monitored and controlled you.\nWhen Mr Morrison bans cash, those libertarians and anarchists get their \"I told you so!\" moment. But these days, as Bitcoin aims for mainstream acceptance, the industry is keen to distance itself from those people.\n2 LEGIT 2 BIT\n\"It is not about encouraging a black market economy,\" says Caleb Yeoh, the co-founder of Travel by Bit, which has made buying things with cryptocurrencies possible at about 150 Australian businesses, including mainstream outlets such as Red Rooster.\n\"We signed up over 150 businesses across Australia. Each one of them gets a tax reporting functionality on our platform, so they declare taxes even thought they take payment in Bitcoin.\"\nYeoh, whose business is part-funded by government grants, points out that Bitcoin maintains a record of every transaction in its Blockchain.\n\"People often have this impression that if you take payments in Bitcoin you're creating a cash economy, under the table, can't be monitored by government. That's not true at all. It is transparent on the Blockchain. If you are doing something bad with Bitcoin you should be able to be caught.\"\nWhile this is true of Bitcoin, it is not the case with every other cryptocurrency, some of which are designed to be anonymous.\nSo the big risk is not when businesses agree to take Bitcoin, like this labour hire firm has. (\"You could be forgiven for thinking that accepting Bitcoin payments is a publicity stunt,\" the firm's website says, insisting it will actually be efficient. However, you can check its Bitcoin address on the Blockchain and see that no customers have paid bitcoin to that address yet).\nThe big risk is when the guy who is installing your new kitchen asks if he can be paid in anonymous cryptocurrencies like Monero or Dash. That's when the government's cash ban could really backfire.

The program was originally launched last month for just bitcoin (BTC) but GMO has now added bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC) and ripple (XRP) to the program.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space GMO Wants to Borrow from Customers\nGMO Coin, the cryptocurrency exchange subsidiary of Japanese conglomerate GMO Internet, announced this week the addition of four cryptocurrencies to its loan service which allows customers to lend their coins to the company.\nThe service “allows you to rent out the virtual currency held by the customer to the company so that you can receive the rental fee according to the quantity of the lent virtual currency,” the exchange detailed. GMO first introduced this service last month for just BTC.\nInterested customers need to apply between May 9 and May 23. If there are more applicants than needed, the company will use a drawing to select whom to borrow from. The target currencies this time are BCH, ETH, LTC, and XRP. About the Program\nCustomers can lend between 100 and 1,000 ETH; 50 and 500 BCH; 300 and 3,000 LTC; and 100,000 and 1,000,000 XRP.\nThe time to maturity is 150 days. Borrowed cryptocurrencies will be returned to customers in the same amounts and types at maturity.\nThe exchange will pay customers 2.04109589 ETH for each 100 ETH borrowed. For 50 BCH, the company will pay 1.02054794 BCH. For 300 LTC, customers will receive 6.12328767 LTC. Lastly, for 100,000 XRP, the fee payable to customers will be 2,041.0958 XRP. GMO explained that the fee “corresponds to 5% / year (tax included),” adding that taxes will also be levied on the loan fees. Fully Licensed Exchange\nGMO Coin is a fully licensed cryptocurrency exchange in Japan. However, it is one of the two licensed exchanges to receive a business improvement order from the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) after the agency tightened its inspection of crypto exchanges following the hack of Coincheck in January. The other is Tech Bureau which operates Zaif exchange.\nThe company recently revealed GMO Coin’s financials, showing an operating loss of 760 million yen (~US$7 million) in the first quarter of this year. The cost of operating the crypto business rose by about 560 million yen (~$5.1 million) for the group from the previous quarter. As for the company’s mining operations, GMO revealed that it has mined a total of 906 bitcoins and 537 bitcoin cash.\nWould you lend GMO your coins?

Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.\"\nClients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally.\nAlbrecht's service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013.

Now it is time to turn our attention to one of the most obvious things that went wrong in BTC — the centralization of protocol development.\nAlso read: How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid the Same Mistakes as Bitcoin Core, Part 2 How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid Centralization\nDecentralization comes in many forms: decentralization of nodes, mining pools, wealth, and so on. One thing that was overlooked for a long time in Bitcoin BTC was that while many things were well distributed, there was only one main group of developers (Bitcoin Core).\nDecentralized Development Most of the BCH community is now well aware of this folly, and that is why we seek to have multiple independent teams of developers along with multiple full node implementations.\nMiners need established, robust software they can rely on, and its important to have several choices; otherwise it means that a single group of developers essentially controls the protocol.\nEntrenchment of “The Reference Implementation” Bitcoin Core became entrenched as “the” Bitcoin software, which led to stagnation. Although there were already several different implementations, the dominance of Bitcoin Core has been overwhelming.\nTechnically, it’s hash power that matters, not how many different nodes are running a certain software… But given the totally lopsided distribution, it was clear that anyone running a different version from Core would be a tiny minority. That means Bitcoin Core calls all the shots as far as BTC protocol rules.\nBCH is Doing Better Already We’re heading in the right direction but we’re not out of the woods yet. One interesting phenomenon is that the current level of BCH development decentralization is often either underestimated or overestimated.\nOn one extreme, some believe development is fully decentralized (since there’s, what, 6 node implementations now?). By contrast, others see the leading team (Bitcoin ABC) as having become the next reference implementation.\nThe truth is somewhere in the middle. Bitcoin ABC runs around 60–70% of the BCH nodes and Bitcoin Unlimited runs about a third of them. Essentially, instead of one main implementation, there’s now two.\nMaybe that sounds a bit disappointing, but that’s twice as many as BTC. Meritocracy\nA meritocracy is defined as “the holding of power by people selected on the basis of their ability.”\nThere’s often a misguided notion that the main development groups in BCH should have magically have equal influence, rather than acknowledging that influence must be earned.\nThose fearful of ABC having too much power might not understand this principle, or more likely, they haven’t seen all that ABC has accomplished to earn what is currently a majority “market share”.\nThe fact of the matter is that Bitcoin ABC has been the best in class when it comes to leading protocol development, producing timely releases of solid code, and solving problems.\nTo be specific, it was Bitcoin ABC that created the first node software for Bitcoin Cash, and spearheaded both hard fork upgrades along with the Cashaddr addresses.\nHealthy Competition is the Way Forward This is not to say that Bitcoin Cash wouldn’t benefit from an even more disbursed landscape, with several of the smaller implementations gaining more market share and influence.\nInstead of the misplaced idea that ABC should be reigned in, other teams should catch up to ABC by competing. That means they need to do as good a job as ABC has done at leading protocol development and delivering reliable software that serves the community.\nWhile its good to have a healthy fear of avoiding another “Core”, Bitcoin ABC actually has been extremely inclusive toward other teams. ABC organizes meetings with other BCH devs (both online and in real life), has created open work groups for various Bitcoin related topics, has invited developers from other groups into their private discussion channels, and has even written code for other teams.\nIt feels that we’re on the right track with decentralizing protocol development, and I expect it will continue to improve over time.\nIn the upcoming conclusion (Part 4), we’ll take a look at mining, development funding, and some big picture solutions.\nWritten by Jonald Fyookball Jonald Fyookball (pseudonym) is a cryptocurrency enthusiast, best known as the project leader of the Electron Cash wallet, and for a series of hard hitting articles on the Bitcoin scaling debate.

Not to do so, he told CNN , is “almost irresponsible.” Crypto To Disrupt Every Vertical\nOn Wednesday, Novogratz’s firm and Bloomberg launched the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index , an index that tracks 10 cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and Ethereum.\nInvesting in cryptocurrency is important not on account of expected gains, Novogratz said, but because in two to four years blockchain technology, which allows companies to make and record near instant transactions, will be challenging every vertical.\nWhile the decentralized version of Uber may not be Uber, it will be a challenge and it constitutes a “real value proposition,” he said.\nNovogratz, a former hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group and Goldman Sachs partner, said he has invested 10% of his net worth in cryptocurrencies. Traditional Institutions Testing The Waters The owner of the New York Stock Exchange is reportedly considering launching a cryptocurrency exchange. | Source: Shutterstock\nMainstream financial institutions, meanwhile, are finding ways to allow traditional investors to benefit from bitcoin. Nasdaq in April signed an agreement with Gemini Trust, a cryptocurrency exchange.\nOne unknown, however, is how governments will regulate cryptocurrency.\nNovogratz predicted the New York Stock Exchange will be active in cryptocurrency trading in less than six months.\nNot everyone on Wall Street agrees with Novogratz. Warren Buffett, an investment icon, has been bearish on bitcoin, having most recently called bitcoin “probably rat poison squared” at Berkshire Hathaway ’s annual shareholder meeting on Saturday.\nNovogratz said the difference in opinion is age-related, with older players much more skeptical about cryptocurrency.\nAlso read: Bitcoin bull Novogratz raises $250 million for cryptocurrency merchant bank Galaxy Digital Moves Forward\nGalaxy Digital , meanwhile, has announced plans to buy Canadian startup First Coin Capital and then merge with Bradmer Pharmaceuticals — which is publicly listed on the Toronto-based TSX Venture Exchange (TSX-V) — through a reverse takeover.\nFollowing the merger, Bradmer will be renamed to Galaxy Digital, allowing the company to trade publicly without having to undergo traditional financial disclosures associated with listing on an exchange.\nGalaxy Digital’s cryptocurrency merchant bank — which Novogratz reportedly hopes to make the “Goldman Sachs of Crypto” — will have a fourfold business model, according to public statements made by the firm.\nThe bank will open a cryptocurrency trading desk and initially seek to capitalize on opportunities for cross-exchange arbitrage. It will also invest in blockchain startups and ICOs, much as Novogratz intended to do through his now-shelved cryptocurrency hedge fund. Finally, it will provide advisory and asset management services to wealthy clients.\nFeatured image from Flickr/ Hudson River Park Follow us on Telegram .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mike novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "galaxy digital capital management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg galaxy crypto index", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fortress investment group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T14:42:17.128+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a854786f8de0611136850b3cac59a1cae2a6d653", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS2VygYal1Nhx0MT_2m7nIEU-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Win $200 in BTC, Earn 4% annual interest on your Bitcoins", "title_full": "Win $200 in BTC, Earn 4% annual interest on your Bitcoins", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a854786f8de0611136850b3cac59a1cae2a6d653", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS2VygYal1Nhx0MT_2m7nIEU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Win $200 in BTC, Earn 4% annual interest on your Bitcoins", "text": "https://goo.gl/qait9X", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T13:35:11.042+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eb4fd60c1ea9817026e6a4b13f625c7fb03661e7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVmEBkwyM28ppMoKGJ6yDrAADy5l_b3WhY4_10KkARk8Jntn7cqkdI2g3JygwHet_57z_7oQOhJMUySr1lssf1Kg--", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Markets Update: Cryptocurrencies Lose Steam During the Weekend - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Markets Update: Cryptocurrencies Lose Steam During the Weekend - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Klopyyuuuaaa.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb4fd60c1ea9817026e6a4b13f625c7fb03661e7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVmEBkwyM28ppMoKGJ6yDrAADy5l_b3WhY4_10KkARk8Jntn7cqkdI2g3JygwHet_57z_7oQOhJMUySr1lssf1Kg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jamie Redman", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Markets Update: Cryptocurrencies Lose Steam During the Weekend - Bitcoin News", "text": "6 The Verdict: Market Optimism Remains Digital Assets Take a Dip During This Weekend’s Trading Sessions\nTraders and cryptocurrency enthusiasts are uncertain of the short-term path ahead for digital assets, as most cryptocurrencies have lost a bunch of value once again. Many believe digital assets will see a rise at some point next week, as cryptocurrency markets have consistently risen every year in mid-May year after year. News has been fairly positive as Wall Street seems to be embracing cryptocurrencies even more so these days as new indexes and funds have launched. However, crypto-proponents are still concerned about regulations as exchanges are still being raided in South Korea and other governments enforce new measures. Moreover, the infamous Mt Gox trustee has moved bitcoins once again, and many believe those coins are being liquidated for fiat. Top ten cryptocurrencies on Saturday, May 12, 2018, according to Satoshi Pulse. BCH Market Action\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) values have dipped considerably since our last markets update as BCH prices over the past seven days have lost 13.6 percent. Even though prices are down volumes have risen and the past 24-hours worth of trade volume is around $1.49Bn today. Right now the top five exchanges swapping the most BCH today are Okex, Upbit, Bitfinex, Bithumb, and Huobi. South Korean markets (KRW/BTC) have spiked considerably when it comes to BCH trades this weekend. BTC pairs with BCH have dropped but is still the most dominant pair as BTC encompasses 28.3 percent of BCH trades. This is followed by tether (USDT 26.4%), KRW (21%), USD (20.1%), and the euro (1.9%). BCH/USD Technical Indicators\nLooking at charts show some consolidation taking place and new positions being staked. The two Simple Moving Averages (SMA) show bulls could still take the game back to the upside, as the 100 SMA is still largely above the 200 SMA. MACd indicates some uncertainty at -42.17 which could show some improvement may take place in the near future. Relative Strength Index oscillator indicates the same sentiment, as it meanders around 42 at press time. Order books show bulls need to break resistance at $1,490 to move further ahead and from this vantage point, it still looks attainable. On the back side if bears try and short the market books indicate there are solid foundations between $1,360 and $1,250. BCH/USD Bitfinex May 12, 2018 BTC Market Action\nBitcoin Core (BTC) markets are down 14 percent over the past seven days and one BTC is priced at $8,473 per unit. BTC volumes are decent today with over $7Bn worth traded over the past 24-hours. The top five exchanges trading the most BTC today includes Binance, Bitfinex, Okex, Huobi, and Bitflyer. The Japanese yen is the dominant currency traded with BTC as the yen is capturing 52.9 percent of today’s trades. This is followed by the USD (21%), tether (USDT 16.7%), KRW (3.8%), and the euro (2.6%). The most popular swap today on May 12 on the peer-to-peer platform Shapeshift is BTC for BCH. BTC/USD Technical Indicators\nLooking at the 4-hour BTC/USD chart shows the two SMA trend lines are currently different than BCH markets. The short-term 100 SMA is below the long-term 200 SMA which indicates the path to resistance may be towards the downside. At press time bulls have attempted to cross above the $8,550-8,650 range, with little luck. MACd shows this action just took place but more improvements can happen within the coming hours. RSI levels are around 45.5 which indicates some consolidation and some upwards movements are still in the cards. BTC bulls have to eat through massive sell walls to get above $9K again and then more mountains above $9,600. On the backside there are stiff foundations around $8,150, and if that area breaks we will see another pitstop at $7,800. BTC/USD Coinbase May 12, 2018 The Verdict: Market Optimism Remains\nAs stated above, there are a lot of cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traders betting on a rise in digital asset markets in the near future. But this past dip seems to show a bit of consolidation before any type of break out takes place, as most currencies touched a three-week low this week. Even so, most people still seem optimistic for the coming weeks ahead.\nWhere do you see the price of BCH and other cryptocurrencies headed from here?
