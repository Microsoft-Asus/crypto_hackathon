According to Bloomberg, the exchange has been working with Signature Bank so as to provide the service for important clients in certain states in the US. We're excited to launch the first phase of US dollar (Fiat) trading for approved corporate customers, followed by all qualified customers as we roll out additional phases. See why it's kind of a big deal: https://t.co/a3KXXxgNFn This is a very important step for the cryptocurrency community . Banks have been reluctant to help some crypto exchanges to prosper and offer USD pairs. Additionally, banks feel threatened by virtual currencies. Bittrex CEO, Bill Shihara, said about that: “It’s been a long path. It’s not just about banks being able to trust Bittrex. It’s about banks being able to trust crypto in general. And I think it’s really showing that crypto is turning the corner in terms of mainstream acceptance.” Additionally, he commented that the banking industry wanted to make sure that the exchange had a strong AML and KYC policy and that it properly controls its finances, including background checks and security processes . The exchange will be ready to launch the new services on Thursday for Bitcoin , Tether and TrueUSD , but the pairings will be available for corporate users in the states of California, New York, Washington and Montana, but the list could be bigger in the future. Additionally, the exchange is planning to offer the same service to retail customers. Bittrex is the 18th cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume handling more than $95 million dollars in the last 24 hours. In addition to it, it offers more than 250 different trading pairs to its more than 3 million active users.

The hype surrounding last year’s hottest asset class have faded in 2018, with fewer online searches and more pressure for regulators, with technical analysts saying the decline replicates the pattern seen following the collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange four years ago.\n“The emotions are no different from the last time this happened, it’s just a different set of people going through it,” said Paul Day, a technical analyst and head of futures and options at Market Securities Dubai Ltd. “We could go down a long, long way.”\nBitcoin on Friday dropped below its average over the previous 252 days, roughly equal to the number of trading days in a year.

So far, consumers and corporations have shown a keen interest in cryptocurrency. It seems that situation may come to change fairly soon. Local sources indicate the government is confiscating any hardware related to cryptocurrency mining. The Bitcoin Situation in Venezuela\nOver the past few years, the financial turmoil in Venezuela has become more apparent. Its national currency is losing value fairly quickly. This has caused many different issues for both corporations and consumers alike. It seems even the issuance of the Petro cryptocurrency may not necessarily improve this situation anytime soon.\nDesperate times often call for desperate measures. In the case of Venezuela, citizens are flocking to cryptocurrency mining. Given the rising value of Bitcoin, mining this currency has become more popular. As a result of the country’s access to cheaper electricity, mining Bitcoins seemingly makes perfect sense.\nAt the same time, this type of activity has also received a lot of negative attention. The Venezuelan government officially subsidizes all electricity in the country. Anyone using this resource to mine Bitcoin has become a target for legal repercussions. Various mining operations have been shut down in the past. It now appears this situation will only grow worse as more time progresses. The Government Intervenes Yet Again\nAccording to local outlet Noticiero Digital , things are not evolving in a positive direction. In fact, the Venezuelan government is confiscating any shipments related to cryptocurrency mining. This applies specifically to hardware being imported from other parts of the world. It is another crackdown on Bitcoin mining, albeit a very aggressive countermeasure.\nCourier services have informed clients this measure has been implemented recently. As such, users are advised not to order any Bitcoin mining hardware outside of Venezuela. That creates a big problem, as buying or selling this equipment in the country itself is difficult, if not impossible.\nFor the time being, it remains to be seen what the reasoning behind this development is. Government spokespeople have not issued any official comment regarding this statement. As such, it remains unclear what the officials hope to achieve by taking this drastic approach. At this stage, it seems any cryptocurrency equipment will be confiscated. In the past, harsh action was taking against ASIC units. The new development puts GPUs, motherboards, and even power supplies at risk of confiscation as well. Featured image from Shutterstock.

On May 25, 2018, Johannesburg-based Sygnia investment firm has hinted it’s starting a blockchain-powered virtual currency exchange by the end of 2018. SygniaCoin\nPer BusinessTech, Sygnia CEO, Magda Wierzycka has revealed the firm’s interest in the nascent world of cryptocurrencies. Sygnia, which currently offers investors assets management services with over 600 institutional clients, is looking to launch their own crypto exchange in the third quarter of 2018.\n“We aim to launch SygniaCoin, a cryptocurrency exchange, in the third quarter of 2018. The cryptocurrency market is evolving at a rapid pace internationally and domestically, and is attracting both domestic and international flows,” said Wierzycka.\nThe highly reputable South African firm is poised to become a big whale in the African and global Fintech and cryptocurrency ecosystem shortly. Wierzycka added:\n“With its Fintech focus, Sygnia is well-positioned to become the first major financial services institution to embrace cryptocurrencies and to offer investors a secure trading and execution platform backed by an international infrastructure, well-designed custody and integration with standard savings products.” Positive Despite Regulatory Uncertainties\nAt a time when financial authorities all around the world are formulating amenable and regulations to govern their local digital currency industry, the South African Reserve Bank ( SARB ) has made it categorically clear that blockchain-based digital currencies are not to be called cryptocurrencies as they do not meet the criteria to be categorized as money.\n“We don’t use the term ‘Cryptocurrency’ because it doesn’t meet the requirements of money in the economic sense of the stable means of exchange, a unit of measure and a stable unit of value. We prefer to use the word ‘cyber-token,’” said the SARB deputy Governor, Francois Groepe.\nDespite the views of the apex bank, the Sygnia boss remains optimistic there will be “further regulatory frameworks to follow” and things will settle down soon. For now, however, the SygniaCoin cryptocurrency exchange will be tailored to operate based on the New York BitLicense law . In her words: “To ensure the highest levels of integrity and security for clients, we are basing our policies, protocols and processes on existing regulatory framework applicable to cryptocurrency exchanges registered in New York State, USA,” Wierzycka hinted.\n“We will also be able to offer investors the option of holding cryptocurrencies on Sygnia Alchemy administration portal, alongside their investments through the Sygnia LISP and in SURF.” The Bitcoin Price Slump Continues\nMany institutional investors have either expressed genuine interest in the crypto space or have already started offering bitcoin-related products to clients since 2017.\nHowever, it appears the entry of these firms into the digital currency space have only succeeded in triggering a massive crypto bloodbath, and if the predictions of reputable analysts like Willy woo is anything to go by, the bearish trend may not go away anytime soon. I think we are gonna go to $5500-5700 next, I can’t see $7000 holding. Most likely we’ll balance a bit, then we’ll slide through.

In that article – which boasts the tagline “Crypto assets may one day reduce demand for central bank money” – He argues that central banks may want to consider adopting some of the concepts in order to “forestall the competitive pressure crypto assets may exert on fiat currencies.”\nIt’s a notable statement and one that echoes past remarks from He as well as other IMF officials, including director Christine Lagarde. Indeed, Lagarde, back in March, said during an event that regulators should deploy some elements of the tech in order to “ fight fire with fire. “\nHe’s argument in the latest piece is based on the possibility that, should cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets see wider adoption, there is a chance that central banks will lose their ability to influence the economy through tactics such as interest rate changes.\nThe deputy director suggested that tightening regulation could provide a boost for central banks.\n“Second, government authorities should regulate the use of crypto assets to prevent regulatory arbitrage and any unfair competitive advantage crypto assets may derive from lighter regulation,” He wrote. “That means rigorously applying measures to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism, strengthening consumer protection, and effectively taxing crypto transactions.”\nHe also pointed to the idea of central banks creating their own digitized assets that could be exchanged in a peer-to-peer fashion\n“For example, they could make central bank money user-friendly in the digital world by issuing digital tokens of their own to supplement physical cash and bank reserves. Such central bank digital currency could be exchanged, peer to peer in a decentralized manner, much as crypto assets are,” the article went on to say.\nIt’s an idea that a number of central banks are researching, though opinions differ on the effectiveness of such proposals. Just this week, for example, an official for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (the region’s de facto central bank) said that it currently has no plans for a digital currency launch in spite of its research in the area.\nImage Credit: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

Speaking on Wednesday to CNBC’s Power Lunch, Garlinghouse declared that Bitcoin could be on the verge of experiencing an influence and price downfall in the cryptocurrency community as markets are gradually becoming aware of the different currencies and alternatives available to them.\nWhen Bitcoin was initially offered in 2008, it was a game changer. For the first time, people could initiate transactions, trade, and trust in a medium of exchange without having banks or governments behind it. And with Bitcoin being the initial, most known, and largest virtual currency by market capitalization other cryptocurrencies including XRP are highly interdependent to it even though they are independent open-sourced technologies.\nThat’s something Garlinghouse believes is going to change over time as more people become aware of the other cryptocurrencies available through media coverage.\nFirst, forward to 2018, Bitcoin , the almost a decade old currency, is not the default currency of choice in moving value. It is slowly evolving to be more of an asset than a currency; investors trade it like stocks or bonds, rather than as a medium of exchange of daily goods and services.\nIts transaction costs have reached $4.50 taking days to complete a transaction instead of a few minutes. Garlinghouse jokes,\n“How are you going to use Bitcoin to buy a cup of tea? By the time the transaction is complete, it’s going to be hours later, your tea’s gonna get cold”\nBe that as it may, Ripple, the San Francisco-based company, has developed a speedier financial payment system that enables cross-border transactions with XRP being the electronic coin financial institutions use on to transact swiftly.\nBarely a month passes without Ripple making huge inroads on Bitcoin’s influence. On Wednesday, Ripple signed a partnership deal with Kuwait’s largest bank (The Kuwait Finance House) adding the financial institution to its long list of partners such as MoneyGram and Visa that are now piloting XRP for cross-border transactions.\nAs some countries introduced new regulations and rules for using cryptocurrency early this year, Bitcoin, XRP , and other digital currencies took a beating in their market performance with the market capitalization falling by more than 50% . XRP was the worst performer shedding 70% of its value and Bitcoin losing about 50% in those few months. However, with large amounts of Ripple’s currency kept in their reserves, price fluctuations are kept to a minimum with the company controlling the currency’s value.\nLast month, South Korea introduced a raft of requirements including banning all anonymous trading Bitcoin allows on its platform in a bid to neutralize all possible criminal activities. Also, the Indian government refused to acknowledge cryptocurrency as a legal tender saying they were going to put measures in place that are going to phase out payments using the virtual money.\nRipple does not operate with the same level of anonymity that bitcoin does, making the virtual coin more favorable to investors and banks. With over 100 financial institutions around the world using the blockchain, Ripple ’s dominance seems to be on the rise challenging Bitcoin’s influence.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

There is a major bullish trend line forming with support at $7,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair looks set for more gains in the near term if it succeeds in breaking the $7,640 resistance.\nBitcoin price is moving nicely above $7,400 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD must clear the $7,600 and $7,640 resistances for an upside acceleration. Bitcoin Price Analysis\nAfter trading above the $7,500 level, bitcoin price faced sellers near the $7,550 level against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair started a downside correction and traded below the $7,400 and $7,350 levels. It also declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $7,050 low to $7,550 high. However, the downside move was protected by the $7,250 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nA fresh upside wave was initiated and the price jumped back above the $7,400 level. It also cleared the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $7,565 high to $7,262 low. It seems like the price may continue to move higher and it could accelerate above the $7,600 level. It has to break the 1.236 Fib extension level of the last drop from the $7,565 high to $7,262 low at $7,640 for more gains. On the downside, there is a major bullish trend line forming with support at $7,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.\nLooking at the chart , the price is clearly in a bullish zone above $7,400. A successful break and close above the $7,640 resistance may perhaps call for a push towards the $7,800 level.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is moving nicely in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is heading higher into the overbought levels.\nMajor Support Level – $7,400\nMajor Resistance Level – $7,640 Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Primed for Gains was last modified: May 31st, 2018 by Aayush Jindal ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T13:16:34.033+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b865ebef711d6f2dbaa0ad3dace4f69f5d491acc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_c_DusLa_zBlpBAxyMwSjanclmZl9yXyjNkY5XZO6ycXL_lQ2BgODvAjbaowYV8_9M._UeYql2TAm6lzWF9QiTn8FThUb73hW50upjbM3jSsNNFz0sjDW33y9hkHxl7CE-", "site_full": "www.btcmaker.org", "site": "btcmaker.org", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Walking War Robots [WWR] FURY TRIPLE ZEUS part 2 Gameplay | ADRIA - Earn Free Bitcoin", "title_full": "Walking War Robots [WWR] FURY TRIPLE ZEUS part 2 Gameplay | ADRIA - Earn Free Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "http://www.btcmaker.org/bitcoin/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hqdefault-300.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b865ebef711d6f2dbaa0ad3dace4f69f5d491acc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_c_DusLa_zBlpBAxyMwSjanclmZl9yXyjNkY5XZO6ycXL_lQ2BgODvAjbaowYV8_9M._UeYql2TAm6lzWF9QiTn8FThUb73hW50upjbM3jSsNNFz0sjDW33y9hkHxl7CE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Walking War Robots [WWR] FURY TRIPLE ZEUS part 2 Gameplay | ADRIA - Earn Free Bitcoin", "text": "Select Page Walking War Robots [WWR] FURY TRIPLE ZEUS part 2 Gameplay | ADRIA\nPart 2 demonstrating the use of the Fury triple Zeus. – Credits – Walking War Robots was developed by Pixonic.

May 31, 2018 Visit the original article *\nJust a couple of weeks ago, one of the most anticipated events of 2018, the Futurama Blockchain Innovators Summit , brought together about 300 leaders from the cryptocurrency industry. The largest concentration of entrepreneurs, top speakers, famous investors, and enthusiasts gathered in the incredibly futuristic, technologically advanced city of Dubai. Aside from the panel discussions, attendees enjoyed a dune bashing safari comprised of more than 50 Landcruisers, a desert rose party, hot air balloon rides with falcons and the 3-day event culminated with an exciting ride in Teslas to a star-studded party on a superyacht. Well, let’s remember how it was.\nDubai: A City of the Future\nThe venue and location were perfectly chosen as no other city could convey the atmosphere of high-tech luxury, underlined by the grandeur of the Arab world and a clear message that humanity is waiting for the great future that we are creating right now. This progressive city where new transformations occur before residents’ eyes- stirs up a storm of emotions in the soul of everyone who visits. Still, hovering high in the sky, you are watching the skyscrapers that delight in their greatness. The event organizers skillfully selected the Meydan Hotel as the venue for the conference and it was clear that every guest was impressed by the magnificence of the venue as they gushed with joy and realized that nearly everything about this amazing city was pushed to the limits of luxury and decadence. The highest level of service, Arab luxury, and, of course, the Eastern hospitality are the reasons that made this event truly special.\nNetworking with industry leaders\nThe conference was unique due to its special networking format. During the summit, it was possible to interact with crypto whales in a variety of informal atmospheres, from a joint trip on a jeep into the interior of the Arabian desert to a sunrise journey on air balloons with the falcons. These situations provided ideal opportunities for guests to not only get past their fears and reinvent themselves as a new legend, but to also have a dozen or more of pleasant and useful acquaintances.\nPerhaps, one of the brightest guests of the summit was Brock Pierce, who spoke about his vision of the new world being created in Puerto Rico:\n“The main goal is to build the city of the future. And the small cases – I’ve been looking for the place where we can do the material impact. In Puerto Rico there are a lot of issues. 20,000 young ambitious people excited to go and make the world different, they just need an opportunity. I hope you will find the time to come down and check it out. It’s a beautiful place.”\nThe entire audience gave a standing ovation after his speech, and Brock himself was delighted with Futurama:\n“It brought together wonderful people and put together the social activities. Cause that’s where the real bonds are formed”.\nBrock Pierce shared his insights on doing cryptocurrency business in Puerto Rico\nIn addition to Brock, Joshua Hong opened the official part of the conference and Miko Matsumura made all the guests seriously consider the role of AI in the decentralized world from an entirely new angle. Each panelist gave especially memorable for their speeches.\nAt the end of the summit, Miko said:\n“Futurama is an effort to kind of create the point of concentration where the future can be brought out from.”\nThis personal and corporate experience has been shared with the audience by Carlos Domingo, Pascal Weinberger, Simone Giacomelli, Danver Chandler, Henry Liu, Brittany Kaiser, Nicholas Merten, Michael Gu, Michael Suppo, Miguel Francis-Santiago, Evan Luthra and 30+ TOP speakers who captivated listeners with their brilliant thoughts, remarks, and proposals.\nJaw dropping projects\nOne of the brightest headliners of the event was the merchant-friendly cryptocurrency payment and business solution, GoByte . The project provides users with instant payments and confirms that they are using GPU. During his informative presentation, lead developer Akif Rabbani revealed the details of future plans the company has to deploy their own ATMs, POS Terminals, and Cards. The founders stated that their product is the number 1 Dash fork project and Bitcoin competitor, being more profitable than bitcoin mining and attracting much mining enthusiast. Their $21 profit given by masternodes is a good confirmation of the growing popularity and success.\nCommunity interest in the project is just beginning to evolve, at a rapid pace due to the masternode concept and the technical complexity for understanding the project advantages. In the spring, GBX was added to HitBTC, and according to developers, are expected to list on others soon. Other global powerhouses like Bithumb, Bitinko, and Coinsbank had representatives who presented and debated during the panel discussions.\nGoByte developer Akif Rabbani explaining GBX masternodes architecture\nAnother project presented was Kasko2Go , which made their mark with a colorful animated short video and a professional performance from the project’s founder, Genadi Man. He walked participants through his plans of providing motor insurance at a price that is 30-50% less than competitors have. With the help of this service, the driver can receive insurance immediately, and the entire procedure for processing the reimbursement of funds is reduced to no more than 15 minutes. Other pioneering startups such as 1LAW (the world’s first legal application on the blockchain), and Bubbletone (the first decentralized telecom environment which allows mobile operators, phone users, and service providers to interact directly), will certainly change our world for the better.\nGenadi Man introduced the technology revolutionizing the car insurance industry\nFuturama gave people the opportunity to learn about the most promising startups and get to know their endlessly talented creators: Vimana, DateCoin, BitNautic, Dakuce, Terra Virtua, International Auto Club, Mind.ai, StartsIn, Infa Tech Capital.\nDesert Rose Party\nThough blockchain gurus are famous for working day’n’night, they also need some rest. Organizers took care of this need by creating a meditating atmosphere where everyone could either informally communicate with investors and businessmen or just join the dancing crowd while almost falling into a trance. The Desert Rose Party definitely went well. Just imagine: you find yourself in the luxury of the Middle East, being met by live falcons at the venue entrance. Popular DJs are playing the hottest tracks as an incredible fire show takes place and Brock Pierce rocks out in the center of the dance floor with the other guests. As all this occurs, a full-size prototype of Vimana’s autonomous passenger drone that is designed to use urban airspace for transporting cargo and passengers suddenly appears from the fire! These guys know how to throw the performance!\nThe final surprise, like a cherry on a cake, was the unforgettable fireworks show that rivaled the most colorful and masterful that Dubai has seen, according to the words of Matthias Sh. Mende:\n“ Priceless moments and fun in the desert with legendary people whose aim is making this planet better with their incredible visions and know-how. I live in Dubai, I didn’t see such a show since ages. It was better than New Years”.\nA futuristic unmanned air taxi by Vimana was one of the debuts smartly revealed during the event.\nFuturistic Yacht and Air Balloons\nFuturama is more than just one day of intensive work and communication in a pleasant atmosphere. It’s been four days! Four days, which flew by in one breath thanks to a rich program and gathering of interesting people. The next evening after the fantastic Desert Rose Party, guests were in for another surprise. 30 Tesla’s delivered them to a giant yacht with a capacity for as many as 500 people! The party lasted 6 hours, spanned 3 floors, included 2 massive jacuzzis and a chic bar that also served delicious seafood… but the most pleasant thing was the opportunity to spend time communicating with project founders, guest speakers and the occasional word and selfie-taking time with Brock Pierce. In this relaxing environment, each guest could chat about their project to serious investors or just chill out in the jacuzzi while drinking whiskey with ice. How cool is that after a productive day? All of this was possible because of the unique networking format at Futurama.\n30 Tesla’s delivered guests to a giant yacht with a capacity of as many as 500 people\nPerhaps, the most symbolic of all the events was the dawn meeting in the vast Arabian desert. While enjoying the glittering sand in the rising sun, participants soared through the air in impressive air balloons. Hovering in the sky with the falcons, they rose higher and higher, opening new horizons and conquering bold boundaries.\nFuturama: Not Your Average Event Concept\nFuturama is an exclusive, 4-day immersive experience. This is the only summit that offers a special networking format with leading crypto-thinkers, and entrepreneurs in the fieдnsus of distributed and blockchain technologies. This conference gathers under one roof only the most breathtaking projects by pre-screening and personally communicating with each presenter because only in this way the highest quality of the event can be guaranteed.\nPeople already called Futurama the most mesmerizing conference of the year: “This event is a starting point which is gonna annually launch bright and vivid events.” said Evgeny Borisov, the Vimana founder.\nThe Futurama Blockchain Innovators Summit managed to gather an assortment of frontrunners in the world of blockchain, from Brock Pierce, Miko Matsumura, and James Glasscock, as well as major investment funds and arrogant family offices.\nWe have inside info! The date and venue of the next conferences have been announced. Don’t miss the chance to book your ticket to a get together of the best crypto experts as it seems there will only be a few tickets available.\nDate: 7-10th September Place: Barcelona – Monte Carlo – Ibiza Date: 10-12th September, 2018 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "teslas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T08:40:52.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1897a3773dda6c2ac6264c8f2828c4bcd39792c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54FiTPCygQmvG4eCLOkDFSRrLNFe_B7Je_SAxzEJsgG3tkXPxX6dq22eWGHKtPmNNrw--", "site_full": "bitcoinist.com", "site": "bitcoinist.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "4 Lies Your Economics Professor Will Tell You About Bitcoin - Bitcoinist.com", "title_full": "4 Lies Your Economics Professor Will Tell You About Bitcoin - Bitcoinist.com", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_738730771.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1897a3773dda6c2ac6264c8f2828c4bcd39792c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54FiTPCygQmvG4eCLOkDFSRrLNFe_B7Je_SAxzEJsgG3tkXPxX6dq22eWGHKtPmNNrw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Allen Scott", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "4 Lies Your Economics Professor Will Tell You About Bitcoin - Bitcoinist.com", "text": "4 Lies Your Economics Professor Will Tell You About Bitcoin Allen Scott · May 31, 2018 · 9:00 pm · Views: 1,252 Stop trying to reinvent the monetary wheel with Bitcoin, argues Robert Skidelsky, a member of the British House of Lords and professor emeritus of political economy at Warwick University.\n[Note: This is an op-ed] Old Man Yells at Bitcoin In an article published last week, Skidelsky draws similarities between gold and Bitcoin, concluding that it’s incorrect to perceive flaws in money itself as the cause of “sick” economies. In other words, boom and bust cycles are natural occurrences, and the incumbent financial system is the best humans can do, if only the sluggish economies could just get it together.\nSkidelsky argues: The fact is that human societies have discovered no better way to keep the value of money roughly constant than by relying on central banks to exercise control over its issue and to act directly or indirectly on the volume of credit created by the commercial banking system. But let’s leave the Keynes versus Hayek debate for another article. Instead, what stands out like a sore thumb is not only the complacency and the knee-jerk reaction to defend the status quo, but doing so through ignorance of Bitcoin’s fundamental properties. Amusingly, Skidelsky even acknowledges that “the technical details of the new cash-generation systems are difficult to grasp; their inspiration is not.” A person from the early 20th century might have also said that “the technical details of the airplane are difficult to grasp; their inspiration is not.” Hence, the mere attempt to improve money is rebuked because all previous attempts have failed to come up with anything better than the paper mill that is today’s financial system. Skidelsky dismisses Bitcoin as merely the latest attempt to use new technology “to stop money from going bad.” Let’s take a look at some examples of the erroneous statements made by the emeritus of political economy. Lie 1: It’s Created Out of Nothing Paradoxically, although it is created out of nothing, it will offer no possibility of money ‘creation.’ First, bitcoins aren’t created out of “nothing.” Second, since it’s already being accepted as a medium of exchange in many places online and across the globe for goods or services, then it’s de facto money. Furthermore, energy, coding skills, resources, and time spent on software and hardware development and production are just some of the components required to run and maintain the Bitcoin network. It is also underpinned by a globally distributed network of users who all agree to play by the rules of the network for their own benefit. The more users in this network, the greater the value of Bitcoin will become, according to Metcalfe’s law . Lie 2: No Elasticity Bitcoin will be ‘mined’ in diminishing quantities until it is exhausted in 2040, having delivered 21 million digital coins. In other words, there is no elasticity in the currency… [T]he currency will run into the same problem as the gold standard: not providing enough money to support a growing economy and population. First, Skidelsky is off by a century as the last bitcoin will be mined in 2140 , though most will enter the supply by 2030. Second, the problem was never with gold itself but the debasement of gold and thus the distortion of value. For example, most scholars believe it was the “clipping” of gold coins that was largely responsible for the fall of the Roman Empire . The publicly verifiable and immutable ledger of bitcoin ensures that this monetary network can’t be tampered with, unlike with fiat. Third, unlike gold, a bitcoin is merely the name of a digital unit (whose value is determined by the market). This makes it highly divisible. In fact, the smallest possible unit is one hundred millionth of a single bitcoin (0. 1 BTC) — called a ‘satoshi’— making it possible to send tiny fractions of a penny at current market prices. This can’t be done even with digital fiat today, let alone physical cash or metal coins. This, in fact, makes Bitcoin the most elastic form of money ever created as the 21 billion digital units equal to roughly 2,099,999,997,690,000 (over 2 quadrillion) satoshis according to the calculations presented here . What’s more, new layer-2 applications built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, such as the Lightning Network , will enable the ability to send even smaller amounts off-chain. Lie 3: Deflation Will Lead to ‘Hoarding’ This [lack of money supply] would be exacerbated by any tendency to hoard bitcoins. Hoarding is a pejorative term for saving. If there is no saving, then there is no capital. And there can be no capitalism without capital. The “deflationary death spiral” argument against sound money is an overblown theory perpetuated by Keynesian economists, which is refuted here . In fact, some argue that saving actually leads to greater consumption in the long-run. Saifedean Ammous explains this concept in his book, The Bitcoin Standard , stating: A society which constantly defers consumption will actually end up being a society that consumes more in the long-run than a low savings society, since the low time-preference society invests more, thus producing more income for its members. Even with a larger percentage of their income going to savings, the low time-preference societies will end up having higher levels of consumption in the long-run, as well as a larger capital stock.\nYou can also read more about the advantages of having a capped supply in a new report from BitMex Research here . Lie 4: Inflation Cryptocurrencies provide no security against inflation. Skidelsky doesn’t specify which inflation he’s actually referring to – monetary supply inflation vs. price inflation. Though the two are correlated, the latter is an integral feature of fiat currencies whose value is guaranteed to depreciate over time as more money is printed. Sooner or later, the incentive for governments and central banks to print more money becomes irresistible to the detriment of the population. Inflation is also sometimes referred to as a “hidden tax” that is much easier to impose on citizens as opposed to direct taxation.\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin’s monetary supply is not only controlled but is fully transparent and known to all. Even the gold supply cannot be as accurately predicted. Whereas the 21 million digital units that will ever exist are a key property of the Bitcoin protocol that cements its digital scarcity .\nPut differently, the millions of people around the world who use Bitcoin today know the supply is capped, which results in more accurate price discovery for goods and services. It is also important to note that people who use bitcoin are doing so voluntarily to store their wealth and move their money. Bitcoin Is a Revolutionary Idea\nWith the advent of cryptocurrencies, for the first time in history, humans now have the option to choose their money. This is nothing short of revolutionary since throughout history there was always some central authority, be it the state, the church, or a banking cartel, maintaining a monopoly over money by decree, and ultimately, by force.\nComparatively, it is fiat currencies that provide no security against inflation. In fact, fiat currency supply is specifically designed to grow indefinitely as emission rate is controlled by a handful of unelected bankers through the artificial setting of interest rates.\nRubber will meet the road as more people realize they can now opt out of this system by buying Bitcoin. The good news is that people now have a choice between trusting bankers or a voluntary decentralized monetary network with no one in charge.\nWhat other myths have you heard about Bitcoin?

Both organizations are seeking to develop a stronger, more organized system for allowing charities to accept virtual currency donations.\nBitGive previously made headlines in October 2017 when it launched its new GiveTrack platform, which uses blockchain technology to clarify and record digital asset donations to global charities. Individuals can trace their funds in real time, and see how their money is spent once an organization receives it. They are also informed of the charity’s project results, creating direct engagement between the donor and the receiver.\nBitGive’s founder Connie Gallippi explained in a statement:\n“It’s been incredibly rewarding to see our GiveTrack platform gain unabating momentum. Throughout this process, we’ve discovered numerous opportunities, as well as challenges and barriers, that have helped shape the development of our platform and define crypto-philanthropy. Using this knowledge, in tandem with the bright minds at the University of Edinburgh, BitGive will be delving into how to overcome the roadblocks to effective crypto-philanthropy and establish how cryptocurrency can best be used to uplift and revolutionize the charitable sector.”\nBitGive and the University of Edinburgh are seeking to uncover the challenges of using and converting cryptocurrencies in third-world countries. To do this, BitGive will analyze data collected from GiveTrack’s implementations in nations like Indonesia, Kenya and India to better understand these regions’ levels of cryptocurrency acceptance and feasibility.\nIn addition, both organizations are also hoping collected data will shed light on merchant adoption, regulation, and the effects of cryptocurrencies on local governments and cultures in each country.\nResearch partner at the University of Edinburgh Dr. Claudia Pagliari says:\n“Through their experience of planning and delivering projects using the GiveTrack platform, Connie and her team have gained important insights into how cryptocurrency can be effectively used to support humanitarian efforts in developing countries, as well as some of the challenges involved. Through our research collaboration with BitGive, and meeting key stakeholders, we aim to learn as much as we can about the technical and contextual factors that can ultimately influence the success of these approaches so that this knowledge can be used to inform future programs worldwide.” Open Mind Africa\nThis week, BitGive also launched its latest charitable project partnership with Open Mind Africa , aiming to raise funds to support a Summer Camp and Educator Summit in Ghana, where students will have “fantastic opportunities to develop essential social-emotional skills, multiple intelligences, build friendships and make memories that will last a lifetime.” Now in its second year, the camp is also inviting educators and facilitators from the U.S. and Australia, as well as Ghana.\nOpen Mind Africa was founded on a firm belief that there is a better future for Africa if we promote a quality education rooted in essential skills needed to succeed in school, career and life.\nPast projects that BitGive has successfully funded and supported in the past include the Maternal & Neonatal India Program , the Chandolo Primary School Water Project and the Shisango Girls School .\nOriginal Source: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-nonprofit-bitgive-announces-new-project-and-research-collaboration/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "connie gallippi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin nonprofit bitgive announces new project and research collaboration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin nonprofit bitgive announces new project and research collaboration - blockalerts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T05:23:58.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "98eadc59bdc70316b0dbdbafaf77227285f481bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8.W3OWbVkf9TITyl3GTFODplR8V0UdMq4KrV31TEdZKsn2URKOEIvmG_55sadFAojftFRVv3hodOzqBOBthPP7oPR6MUOopDeGe6LK2uDPgMQKrmLWXOzB.vgUEVMpR4-", "site_full": "ohiobitcoin.com", "site": "ohiobitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis: Consolidation Leans Toward a Strong Bitcoin Move", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Analysis: Consolidation Leans Toward a Strong Bitcoin Move", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.364, "main_image": "https://ohiobitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/YBYaQ8-1024x518.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "98eadc59bdc70316b0dbdbafaf77227285f481bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8.W3OWbVkf9TITyl3GTFODplR8V0UdMq4KrV31TEdZKsn2URKOEIvmG_55sadFAojftFRVv3hodOzqBOBthPP7oPR6MUOopDeGe6LK2uDPgMQKrmLWXOzB.vgUEVMpR4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Morning", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis: Consolidation Leans Toward a Strong Bitcoin Move", "text": "\nBitcoin Price Analysis: Consolidation Leans Toward a Strong Bitcoin Move\nAfter days of sudden, strong selling, bitcoin has managed to find a local bottom in the low $7000s where it has been drifting around aimlessly. As many traders on Twitter have noted, we have formed a large consolidation pattern called a symmetrical triangle (outlined in red):\nFigure 1: BTC USD, 1-Day Candles, Macro Symmetrical Triangle\nSymmetrical triangles are consolidation patterns that are typically agnostic regarding their breakout direction. However, one important thing to note about this consolidation pattern is it embodies some of the hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range (TR) — most notable is the volume profile:\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 12-Hour Candles, Volume Trend\nOverall, the entire volume profile of the symmetrical triangle is sloping downward — this is indicating consolidation in the market. If we look closer at the consolidating volume trend, we can see a few details that are worth noting: The red arrows are pointing out the decrease in volume off the peaks of the rallies. Typically decreasing volume off rally reactions indicates a diminishing pool of supply. Vice versa, the green arrows are pointing out the increasing volume on the rallies. Increasing volume on rallies shows us there is still a steady amount of demand in the market. Points 1 and 2 together also reveal something about the lows made at the lower boundary of the symmetrical triangle: as the market pushes and establishes its lows, we see climactic volume. Climactic volume leading into support is a great sign of supply absorption and hints toward further demand in the market.\nThere is a really strong case for the current symmetrical triangle being a reaccumulation TR that, in the grand scheme of things, is nothing more than a pitstop in an otherwise upward-trending market. A breakout to the top of the symmetrical triangle would have a price target in the $15,000s. However, as I mentioned at the beginning of this article, symmetrical triangles are directionally agnostic and can also break to the downside. If the triangle breaks down, the measured move for the breakout would have us testing the $2000–$3000 price range.\nFor now, the volume is content with continuing to consolidate, but the market is poised for a very strong move that will likely shape the landscape of the market for the next several months. It’s impossible to determine when a market will breakout, so all we can do is hedge our bets and wait. Summary: The market has been consolidating for months in the form of a symmetrical triangle and is tightly wound for a strong, sustained move. There is strong evidence of supply absorption in the market which would likely lead to an upward breakout. Symmetrical triangles are directionally agnostic and can oftentimes break to the downside.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

One can easily see the correlation. They are the same chart. Maybe GBTC leads the Dow in direction. If so, GBTC is going lower while the last Federal Reserve instigated rally only turned ugly today with a near 400-point selloff. Let’s review.\nAs I have been writing, America has been stripped of everything including a ‘market’ of stocks and the ability of investors to realize price discovery. The Fed is in charge of that. Forget Elliot Wave or fundamentals or anything else. That stuff only applies to real market behavior. Technical patterns only matter because the Fed manipulates them to keep us playing along.\nThe selloff today will no doubt be met by a strong ‘buying’ surge early Wednesday morning. Clearly the Fed will not tolerate another breach of their self imposed Dikembe Mutombo Line (DML - see past articles for explanation) of 24k on the Dow. So, downside from here is limited.\nReaders may wonder, how can I be so precise in predictions. I wrote a few months ago that the DML had been established. I followed with the assertion that the Fed’s next target would be Dow 25k as this would give them a ‘higher high’. This way the Fed could say, “Look, we have an uptrend forming.” So forget everything about ‘markets’. They don’t exist anymore in our current police state of complete control. Readers want to know where do we go from here.\nAs of this writing, the Dow is only 361 points above the DML. So, downside risk from here is limited. Next, the Fed has to push the Dow further than the now previous high of 25k. Looking at the charts, it looks like Mr. Powell’s nefarious band of NWO slavemasters would target Dow 25,400 or so. A thousand point rally is nothing for these people.\nYes, I know that the yield curve is currently less than 40 bps from inversion. I know that stock buybacks and Fed intervention account for all stock valuation gains. Yes, I know that the SEC has launched an investigation into rather curious activity in the options markets where it appears that someone (cough-Fed) has been manipulating the VIX by buying the most out-of-money contracts in large volumes. So what?\nWelcome to the new america. Nothing is real. Nothing is true. No one wants to know the truth. It’s all one big con game. Investors are the mark. They are easy. They don’t know anything. Everyone I talk to repeats the same refrain - ‘stock prices always seem to come back up’. Yes, they do don’t they. I wonder why?\nThat brings me to bitcoin. Many people believe bitcoin is a fraud. It has no value. Yet, these same people believe that the Dow is true and represents value. Look at the one-year chart below of the DJIA in gold and GBTC in black. They are essentially the same chart. How is it that one is pure speculation and gambling and the other is not. Charts don’t lie. Governments and banksters do.\nNotice one thing. Remember the slight Dow selloff in mid-April ’18. Remember the reason? Supposedly the 10-year US Treasury yield was spiking toward 3%. Then in May, the yield went over 3% and stocks rallied to the 25k mark on the Dow. Explanations are all BS. Explanations are given to keep investors, or suckers, playing along. As if, everything has to have a reason.\nAgain, the only reason the Dow even trades is the Federal Reserve Bank uses it as a puppeteer uses strings. So again, look at the chart below and decide which line is a fraud. Hint, both of them. Note that bitcoin has been falling ever since the CBOE began trading bitcoin futures in December 2017. I knew that would be the end of bitcoin. It will never be allowed to compete with the Fed’s fraud paper money.

News and research are not personal recommendations to deal. All investments can fall in value so you could get back less than you invest. Article originally published by Motley Fool.\nWho do you listen to when you’re making investment decisions? Warren Buffett is high on many people’s lists of gurus, and Neil Woodford has an impressive long-term record. But do you know who else I like to listen to? The proverbial man down the pub .\nBy that I mean anyone who has no real knowledge of investing, but who picks up on the latest fad and asks me about it. And twice in recent weeks, I’ve been asked about this bitcoin lark.\nThere are sound reasons to shun bitcoin. One is that it’s horribly unstable in value and it’s more akin to gambling than rational investing. Another is that it really doesn’t possess the characteristics needed to actually work properly as a currency (essentially due to that instability), while yet another is that it also doesn’t have what it takes to work as a gold substitute.\nBut putting those rational fears aside, the ultimate reason to see bitcoin as the latest South Sea bubble or tulip mania is possibly when the man down the pub starts talking about buying some.\nFads like bitcoin are often likened to the greater fool theory, in that when you invest in something at an inflated price, its only value lies in there being a greater fool to whom you can sell it on for even more. And when it’s got to the man down the pub , you’re reaching the end of the greater fools line.\nIt happened in the dotcom boom, it happened at the buy-to-let peak, and I see it happening to bitcoin. +0.31% FTSE 100 7701.77 +23.57\nI am surprised by the number of people who are quite happy to consider plonking a couple of hundred down on a dodgy get-rich-quick idea, but who throw their hands up in horror at the stock market and the risk they think they see of losing their shirts. Growth stocks\nEven FTSE 100 growth candidates, like Mediclinic International (LSE: MDC), are surely going to be a lot safer. Mediclinic International plc 3.40 (-0.56%) Prices delayed by at least 15 minutes.\nI reckon Mediclinic’s erratic earnings performance of the past few years has possibly scared away a number of growth investors. After a couple of years of falling EPS following an early spike, the owner of Switzerland’s largest private hospital group recorded a flat year in 2017.\nEconomic weakness in its home base of South Africa, coupled with Swiss regulatory issues, lie behind those few tough years, but the company has branched out into the Middle East with the acquisition of the Al Noor Hospital group.\nFor the year to 31 March, Mediclinic recorded an operating loss of £288m, though that was littered with one-offs and the firm claimed an adjusted operating profit of £370m (up 3%).\nWhile financials are tricky to make sense of in this transitional period, investors’ hopes will surely be focused in an easterly direction. Outgoing chief executive Danie Meintjes reported a “ strong second half performance in Abu Dhabi, ” and reckoned that, with “ continued strong delivery in Dubai and the exciting expansion opportunities ahead, ” there should be further growth in the Middle East in the years to come.\nAnalysts seem to think so too, with a modest EPS rise of 5% predicted for this year and a beefier 12% pencilled in for 2019.\nThat suggests a 2019 P/E of 17.7, which I don’t think is too demanding. Certainly better value than bitcoin, in my view.\nThis article was written by Alan Oscroft from The Motley Fool UK and was legally licensed through the NewsCred publisher network.

There is a new connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $965 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair has to stay above the $960 and $950 support levels to avoid a downside break in the near term.\nBitcoin cash price is holding an important support around $950 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD has to move past the $1,040 resistance to gain further. Bitcoin Cash Price Support\nAfter yesterday’s ride , bitcoin cash price faced sellers near the $1,030-1,040 resistances against the US Dollar. The price started a downside correction and declined below the $1,000 support. It also declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $971 low to $1,031 high. It opened the doors for a larger correction and the price dipped towards the $950 support area.\nThe $940-950 support area acted as a decent buy zone and protected further losses. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $971 low to $1,031 high also prevented declines. BCH price moved back above the $960 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. More importantly, there is a new connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $965 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair remains well supported on the downside around the $950 and $960 levels.\nLooking at the chart , the price is clearly facing a major hurdle on the upside near $1,040. A break and close above the stated $1,040 resistance is needed for buyers to take control. On the downside, a break and close below $950 will most likely push the price back in the bearish zone.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is slightly placed in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is currently flat near the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $950\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,040 Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Holding Important Support was last modified: May 31st, 2018 by Aayush Jindal ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T08:09:55.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "19abc1f6aceadcfbd69266a743fbbd9b7224326b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQnVeZMosZCt21Nlb0razqMnjoX11O4z205e1iDJXTO1ErtGZxgTwmKJinm.FMR_WHU3_.4we9ZbPeB3xxNlITQ_W4GvyKPGOA-", "site_full": "bitrazzi.com", "site": "bitrazzi.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Ripple CEO Blasts Bitcoin Twice, Compares It To Napster", "title_full": "Ripple CEO Blasts Bitcoin Twice, Compares It To Napster", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrazzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ripple-CEO.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "19abc1f6aceadcfbd69266a743fbbd9b7224326b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQnVeZMosZCt21Nlb0razqMnjoX11O4z205e1iDJXTO1ErtGZxgTwmKJinm.FMR_WHU3_.4we9ZbPeB3xxNlITQ_W4GvyKPGOA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ripple CEO Blasts Bitcoin Twice, Compares It To Napster", "text": "0 Share\nBrad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, talked about Bitcoin in an interview with CNBC and at the Recode’s Code Conference yesterday. However, his statements were focused at how Bitcoin will eventually stop being the basis of every crypto-related activity.\nGarlinghouse told CNBC, “There’s a very high correlation between the price of XRP and the price of bitcoin, but ultimately these are independent open-sourced technologies. It’s early, over time you’ll see a more rational market and behaviors that reflect that.”\nIn its first quarter, Ripple signed 20 production contracts with companies such as Kuwait bank and MoneyGram. However, XRP declined in value just like every other cryptocurrency. This is why, Garlinghouse called cryptocurrencies a “nascent industry” where trading is mostly dominated by speculation. He added, “I think it’s a matter of time until people better understand the different use cases.”\nConsidering there are more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies, he believes that 99% of them which don’t provide valuable services will be wiped out in the next decade.\nAt Recode’s Code Conference, Garlinghouse compared Bitcoin to Napster, which was a pioneer in online peer-to-peer file sharing service in the music industry. However, Napster announced bankruptcy and was acquired by another company within three years. “We may come to find that bitcoin is kind of the Napster of digital assets. This is transformative technology, but Spotify and iTunes and Pandora rule the day because they engaged with regulators to solve a real problem,” said Garlinghouse.\nHe also mentioned that buying coffee with Bitcoin is not as easy as people think. With a transaction time of 20 minutes, the cost of such an arrangement would ultimately be extremely expensive.\n“I don’t think blockchain is solving consumer problems yet … Blockchain has its own peanut butter problem. There are lots of industries that can be touched, but it starts with one,” concluded Garlinghouse.

In other words, boom and bust cycles are natural occurrences, and the incumbent financial system is the best humans can do, if only the sluggish economies could just get it together.\nSkidelsky argues: The fact is that human societies have discovered no better way to keep the value of money roughly constant than by relying on central banks to exercise control over its issue and to act directly or indirectly on the volume of credit created by the commercial banking system. But let’s leave the Keynes versus Hayek debate for another article. Instead, what stands out like a sore thumb is not only the complacency and the knee-jerk reaction to defend the status quo, but doing so through ignorance of Bitcoin’s fundamental properties. Amusingly, Skidelsky even acknowledges that “the technical details of the new cash-generation systems are difficult to grasp; their inspiration is not.” A person from the early 20th century might have also said that “the technical details of the airplane are difficult to grasp; their inspiration is not.” Hence, the mere attempt to improve money is rebuked because all previous attempts have failed to come up with anything better than the paper mill that is today’s financial system. Skidelsky dismisses Bitcoin as merely the latest attempt to use new technology “to stop money from going bad.” Let’s take a look at some examples of the erroneous statements made by the emeritus of political economy. Lie 1: It’s Created Out of Nothing Paradoxically, although it is created out of nothing, it will offer no possibility of money ‘creation.’ First, bitcoins aren’t created out of “nothing.” Second, since it’s already being accepted as a medium of exchange in many places online and across the globe for goods or services, then it’s de facto money. Furthermore, energy, coding skills, resources, and time spent on software and hardware development and production are just some of the components required to run and maintain the Bitcoin network. It is also underpinned by a globally distributed network of users who all agree to play by the rules of the network for their own benefit. The more users in this network, the greater the value of Bitcoin will become, according to Metcalfe’s law . Lie 2: No Elasticity Bitcoin will be ‘mined’ in diminishing quantities until it is exhausted in 2040, having delivered 21 million digital coins. In other words, there is no elasticity in the currency… [T]he currency will run into the same problem as the gold standard: not providing enough money to support a growing economy and population. First, Skidelsky is off by a century as the last bitcoin will be mined in 2140 , though most will enter the supply by 2030. Second, the problem was never with gold itself but the debasement of gold and thus the distortion of value. For example, most scholars believe it was the “clipping” of gold coins that was largely responsible for the fall of the Roman Empire . The publicly verifiable and immutable ledger of bitcoin ensures that this monetary network can’t be tampered with, unlike with fiat. Third, unlike gold, a bitcoin is merely the name of a digital unit (whose value is determined by the market). This makes it highly divisible. In fact, the smallest possible unit is one hundred millionth of a single bitcoin (0. 1 BTC) — called a ‘satoshi’— making it possible to send tiny fractions of a penny at current market prices. This can’t be done even with digital fiat today, let alone physical cash or metal coins. This, in fact, makes Bitcoin the most elastic form of money ever created as the 21 billion digital units equal to roughly 2,099,999,997,690,000 (over 2 quadrillion) satoshis according to the calculations presented here . What’s more, new layer-2 applications built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, such as the Lightning Network , will enable the ability to send even smaller amounts off-chain. Lie 3: Deflation Will Lead to ‘Hoarding’ This [lack of money supply] would be exacerbated by any tendency to hoard bitcoins. Hoarding is a pejorative term for saving. If there is no saving, then there is no capital. And there can be no capitalism without capital. The “deflationary death spiral” argument against sound money is an overblown theory perpetuated by Keynesian economists, which is refuted here . In fact, some argue that saving actually leads to greater consumption in the long-run. Saifedean Ammous explains this concept in his book, The Bitcoin Standard , stating: A society which constantly defers consumption will actually end up being a society that consumes more in the long-run than a low savings society, since the low time-preference society invests more, thus producing more income for its members. Even with a larger percentage of their income going to savings, the low time-preference societies will end up having higher levels of consumption in the long-run, as well as a larger capital stock.\nYou can also read more about the advantages of having a capped supply in a new report from BitMex Research here . Lie 4: Inflation Cryptocurrencies provide no security against inflation. Skidelsky doesn’t specify which inflation he’s actually referring to – monetary supply inflation vs. price inflation. Though the two are correlated, the latter is an integral feature of fiat currencies whose value is guaranteed to depreciate over time as more money is printed. Sooner or later, the incentive for governments and central banks to print more money becomes irresistible to the detriment of the population. Inflation is also sometimes referred to as a “hidden tax” that is much easier to impose on citizens as opposed to direct taxation.\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin’s monetary supply is not only controlled but is fully transparent and known to all. Even the gold supply cannot be as accurately predicted. Whereas the 21 million digital units that will ever exist are a key property of the Bitcoin protocol that cements its digital scarcity .\nPut differently, the millions of people around the world who use Bitcoin today know the supply is capped, which results in more accurate price discovery for goods and services. It is also important to note that people who use bitcoin are doing so voluntarily to store their wealth and move their money. Bitcoin Is a Revolutionary Idea\nWith the advent of cryptocurrencies, for the first time in history, humans now have the option to choose their money. This is nothing short of revolutionary since throughout history there was always some central authority, be it the state, the church, or a banking cartel, maintaining a monopoly over money by decree, and ultimately, by force.\nComparatively, it is fiat currencies that provide no security against inflation. In fact, fiat currency supply is specifically designed to grow indefinitely as emission rate is controlled by a handful of unelected bankers through the artificial setting of interest rates.\nRubber will meet the road as more people realize they can now opt out of this system by buying Bitcoin. The good news is that people now have a choice between trusting bankers or a voluntary decentralized monetary network with no one in charge.\nWhat other myths have you heard about Bitcoin?

Tchir States Reasons Why Bitcoin Prices Are Likely Being ‘Manipulated’ Advertisement\nTchir, whose LinkedIn profile lists him as the Head of Macro Strategy at Academy Securities, stated three main reasons that led him to believe that there is ongoing Bitcoin price manipulation: Supply Concentration . Tchir noted that there is, allegedly, a small number of people who hold a disproportionately large amount of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. These people have natural incentives to push prices higher. However, unlike the regulated stock market where large shareholders are subject to additional regulations and scrutiny, there are no such rules when it comes to cryptocurrencies.\n2. Miner Incentives . He also shared that miners, who may also hold significant positions, would also want prices to increase.\n3. Price Arbitrage . Here, Tchir drew a parallel to price manipulation in the regulated LIBOR and FX markets, which have resulted in legal action. Tchir speculated that traders who took the time to set up accounts on different exchanges to arbitrage price differences are rewarded.\nDespite his conviction from the mentioned reasonings, Tchir was careful to state that any manipulation of cryptocurrency prices may or may not meet the legal definition of manipulation. In closing, Tchir said that, as investigations proceed and expose more issues with cryptocurrencies, he expects their prices to continue to fall. Spoofing and Wash Trading: Two Illegal Practices the DOJ is Investigating\nWhile the DOJ’s probe is still private, sources familiar with the matter have reported to Bloomberg that authorities are focusing on two particular practices that traders may be using to manipulate prices: spoofing and wash trading. The DOJ is also collaborating with the CFTC in its investigation. A man with golden Bitcoin. Source: Shutterstock\nSpoofing is the practice of flooding the market with fake orders to influence other players into buying or selling. These orders create an illusion of interest in a particular commodity but are canceled before execution. In regular financial markets, spoofing is typically conducted using high-frequency trading algorithms.\nThe use of spoofing was linked with the 2010 flash crash of the stock market. So far, only one trader, Navinder Singh Sarao, has been charged. Notably, the charges came in 2015 — five years after the incident. He has since pleaded guilty to charges of spoofing and could face up to 30 years in prison.\nWash trading, on the other hand, is the practice of buying shares through one broker followed by immediately selling shares through another broker. Also known as round-trip trading, it is illegal under the Commodity Exchange Act, which was passed in 1936.\nWhile the DOJ investigation is still in its preliminary stages, it does represent a continuation of the U.S. authorities’ crackdown against illegal practices in cryptocurrencies. The SEC has stepped up its enforcement against fraudulent ICOs , having recently come down on Centra Tech and Titanium Blockchain.\nFollow us on Twitter | Telegram | Facebook Featured Image from Shutterstock.

Bitcoin Price Sets Sights on New Resistance cryptoBudha\nBitcoin (BTC) is working its way through the key supply zone above $7,500 and could test resistance at $7,870 in the next 24 hours, the technical charts indicate.\nThe cryptocurrency looked primed for a corrective rally yesterday, having created a bullish outside-day candle on Tuesday. However, the bulls had a tough time absorbing supply around 50-candle moving average (MA) on the 4-hour chart, located yesterday at $7,550.\nThe repeated failure to beat the moving average hurdle ended in a downside break of the diamond pattern. The subsequent sell-off ran out of steam at $7,270, and led to a convincing move above the 50-candle MA, seen today at $7,441.\nAs of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,535 on Bitfinex, up 0.6 percent over 24 hours, and looks set to test the falling trendline resistance located at $7,870. 4-hour chart\nThe recovery from $7,270 to $7,570 has established a higher low (bullish pattern), which adds credence to Tuesday’s bullish outside-day candle and bullish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence.\nHence, BTC could test supply around $7,870 – resistance of trendline sloping downwards from the May 6 high and May 21 high.\nIt also means the cryptocurrency will likely peep above the all-important 50-week MA , currently located at $7,711. However, only a weekly close (Sunday’s close as per UTC) above that level would signal bearish invalidation.\nWeekly chart\nAs seen in the chart above, the last weekly candle had closed below the 50-week MA for the first time since October 2015, in theory indicating the end of the long-term bull run.\nDespite the bullish set up, there is merit in being cautious as the major moving averages – 50, 100 and 200 – on the 4-hour chart are also biased to the bears, as is the 10-day MA. View Bitcoin will likely soon rise to $7,870 (descending trendline hurdle) in the next 24 hours. A high-volume break above that level would allow a re-test of the 50-day moving average, currently located at $8,522. Bearish scenario : The moving averages are maintaining a bearish bias, so a drop to $6,900 could be on the cards if the bulls fail to capitalize on the break above $7,500 and the price drops below $7,270 in the next 24 hours.\nArchery target image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. A prominent economist, author of “When Markets Collide,” and “The Only Game in Town” Mohamed El-Erian thinks cryptocurrency is the future and that it will be government-backed. We believe that most top digital currencies will survive this bear market and the traders should view the current fall as a buying opportunity instead of fearing it. Sygnia Asset Management, a major South African investment firm with $14.5 billion under management, is launching a cryptocurrency exchange in late 2018. It will also create a fund to invest in digital currencies on behalf of its clients. So, should we also start investing at the current levels or wait a little more? Let’s find out. BTC/USD We are clear that Bitcoin can be purchased on dips because it offers a great risk to reward ratio if purchased anywhere between $6,075 to $7,000. We believe that it is in consolidation, as long as it stays above $6,075. A break of this level will be negative and will attract further selling. We had recommended buying the leading cryptocurrency on a sharp fall below $7,000 in our previous analysis, but the bulls held on to the $7,100 levels on May 28 and May 29. The current rebound will face resistance at the downtrend line and above that at the 20-day EMA, which is at $7,963. The BTC/USD pair has given a tradeable bounce from close to the 30 levels on the RSI for the past year and a half. Until proven otherwise, we believe that this trend will continue. The next dip from the overhead resistances will offer us a buying opportunity. It is advisable to watch for a couple of days before initiating a long position. ETH/USD Ethereum broke below the support line of the descending channel on May 28, but the bears could not follow up on their selling at lower levels. As a result, the digital currency rebounded sharply on the very next day, erasing all the losses. The rebound will face selling at higher levels as the 20-day EMA has turned down and has completed a bearish crossover. The next dip will give us a better idea whether the decline has ended at $492.5 on May 28 or will it extend to $464.65 levels. Once we get a confirmation of a bottom, we shall recommend long positions on the ETH/USD pair. Currently, we don’t find any trade on it. XRP/USD Ripple has formed a large descending triangle pattern. It broke below the critical $0.56270 support on May 28 but rebounded on the next day. It is currently facing resistance at the 20-day EMA, which has turned down. If the next dip holds above $0.54, the traders can wait for a break out above the 20-day EMA to go long. The minimum upside target objective of such a trade is a move back to $0.8. We can expect a rally to $1.2 if the XRP/USD pair breaks out of the downtrend line of the descending triangle. If the $0.54 level breaks, a fall to $0.45 is likely. This is the last support, below which the digital currency can sink to $0.24. BCH/USD We believe that Bitcoin Cash is trading in a range whose resistance is at $1,600. The support of the range is still undecided. It can either be $750 or closer to $620. Currently, the cryptocurrency is struggling to sustain above the downtrend line. If the bears succeed in breaking below the May 28 lows of $878, a slide to $750 is probable. This should offer some support, but if this also breaks, the next support is at $620. If the $878 level holds, the BCH/USD pair can remain range bound for a few days. We don’t find any reliable buy setups at the current levels; hence, we are not recommending any trade on it. EOS/USD We had proposed a buy at $14.25 on EOS , but it turned down from $12.98 on May 28. The 20-day EMA is currently acting as strong resistance. The EOS/USD pair can remain range bound between $10.3384-$12.9870 for the next few days, before breaking out or breaking down from it. We don’t find any buy setup as long as prices remain inside the range. If the virtual currency breaks down of the range, it will become very negative, hence, we suggest waiting for the break out to close (UTC) above $12.98 to form any long positions. LTC/USD Litecoin has held the $107 support levels once again, but it is facing resistance at the downtrend line. Even if this level is crossed, it will face resistance at the 20-day EMA at $129. We shall consider a buy only after the LTC/USD pair sustains above $129 for a couple of days. On the downside, if the $107 level breaks, it will signal the completion of a descending triangle pattern. Though its pattern targets are way lower, the digital currency can slide to $84 and below that to $75. ADA/USD Cardano is showing buying at lower levels. It has broken out of the descending channel and is moving towards the overhead resistance at $0.23. If the bulls break out of this, the cryptocurrency will gain strength and pick up momentum on crossing above $0.3. We like the way the ADA/USD pair bounced from the oversold levels on the RSI. This shows that bulls are willing to enter at lower levels. We recommend a long position on a breakout and close (UTC) above $0.23 with the stops below $0.17. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency fails to break out of $0.23 and turns down, breaking below $0.17. XLM/USD The wedge pattern did not give us a clear breakout or a breakdown. Hence, we have removed it today. Stellar pulled back sharply from 0.2428 levels on May 29 but is facing selling close to $0.30 levels. If the bulls can scale above the $0.303 levels, it will indicate the start of a rally to $0.385. Therefore, traders should wait for the breakout and close (UTC) above $0.303 before initiating any long positions. If the XLM/USD pair fails to hold the current levels and breaks down to $0.24, it can slide to the next lower support at $0.184. IOTA/USD After a sharp pullback on May 29, IOTA has climbed to the ninth spot, that’s why it’s way back in our analysis. It continues to consolidate between $0.9150-$2.2117. Currently, the price is close to the overhead resistance at $1.63. The 20-day EMA is also just above it. We believe that the bulls will find it difficult to break out of these two resistances. We anticipate a retest of the recent lows of $1.33 in a couple of days. If the lows hold, the traders can buy a breakout and close above $1.63 with a target of $2.2. If the lows break, the IOTA/USD pair will decline to the bottom of the range at $1. Therefore, we suggest buying only after the lows are successfully held in the next retest.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

The biggest would be how healthy of a risk tolerance do you have. If Bitcoin (BTC), which is relatively the most stable crypto, can drop 40% in the span of 12 hours, how would you react. Personally, I would buy more.\nIf your first reaction would be to ask me, “Why is this happening, did I make a mistake?” then I would say that you probably shouldn’t have invested at all.\nThe majority of the population believes BTC to be way too risky for their tastes. However, altcoins (any coin that isn’t Bitcoin) can sometimes change value by more than 200% in a day. That type of volatility makes BTC look like a bank issued CD (Certificate of Deposit)!\nThat’s why I don’t recommend buying anything other than Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC) or Ethereum (ETH) until you’ve been doing this for a few months. If you’re shrugging your shoulders and thinking I’m still going for it then feel free to read on.\nThat’s why I don’t recommend buying anything other than Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC) or Ethereum (ETH) until you’ve been doing this for a few months. If you’re shrugging your shoulders and thinking I’m still going for it then feel free to read on.\nIn the crypto space every time we see a “crash in price” we often joke about being old enough to remember the last time this happened 3 weeks ago. If you’ve been around long enough you’re laughing because you know it’s true!\nWith over 1,500 coins to choose from, there’s something for every taste ranging from PotCoin to DimonCoin (a satirical response to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon) to TrumpCoin. While a lot of these are funny, most of them are nearly worthless because 1.) they aren’t mine-able , and 2.) they are only valuable within their specific application .\nHaving said all that, there are a few mine-able coins that I like quite a bit. I own and mine Dash (DASH), Zcash (ZEC) and Monero (XMR). All 3 of these have the potential to gain widespread acceptance.\nI know that Monero has a bad connotation due to people saying drug cartels use it. It’s one of the most anonymous cryptos and so while that may be true, the same can definitely be said for cold hard cash. When’s the last time someone told you they don’t use cash because drug dealers use it. I don’t often use cash, but it’s only because it’s not convenient. When many altcoins fade away into nonexistence, XMR is one coin that should still be standing.\nDash (also known as digital cash), as well as Zcash can emerge as day to day spending and payment currencies.\nFor these coins I recommend a great, secure mobile wallet named Jaxx. You’ll also have access to your own private keys which you’ll need for the next Bitcoin fork . Private keys are what allows you to claim your free Bitcoin Cash, Gold and Diamond.\nA more complicated wallet, but also more secure, is myetherwallet . It’s what you’ll typically need in order to participate in ICOs that use the popular ERC-20 tokens.\nI used to own Ripple (XRP) and it’s extremely popular. I really like what they’re doing in the banking industry but they might be the one coin that actually has more utilitarian value than a store of value. Many experts believe that XRP as a coin won’t succeed. If you decide to take the contrarian view, Bitstamp is a good wallet option for XRP.\nWith all these altcoins to choose from I realize there will be some big winners that emerge. That’s like picking the right penny stock. Sure, I’ll throw a small amount at some of them in the hopes of hitting a home run, but I’m definitely not mortgaging my house to do so.\nA couple of non mine-able coins that I own are Monaco (MCO) and 0x (ZRX).\nMonaco (MCO) is now issuing their multiple levels of crypto cash back Visa debit cards. If they could put a Visa card in everyone’s physical wallet that would go a long way to making crypto mainstream. If they become that bridge, I would expect to see a big jump in price.\n0x is an open protocol that facilitates the decentralized exchange of Ethereum-based tokens and assets. This 2nd generation of decentralized exchanges allow for more user control over their assets (at a fraction of the trading fees). Developers can also use 0x to build their own custom exchange apps. There’s a good chance that ZRX experiences growth similar to the way ETH did.\nIn order to buy altcoins you’ll have to do so via slightly more complicated methods. You can start by opening accounts with exchanges like Binance , Bittrex and Waves . If you’ve already opened your Coinbase account then you can transfer your coins to many other exchanges from there as well. Then you can use that coin to exchange it for another altcoin.\nIn the end, my belief is that there will be less than a dozen coins that will cement their legacy and wind up being household names. That means that 99.992% of the coins in circulation today will eventually be worthless.\nAs always, proceed with extreme caution.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like Bitcoin and other altcoins is highly speculative and comes with many risks.
