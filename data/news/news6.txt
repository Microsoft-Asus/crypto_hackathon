The company had allegedly duped 8,000 investors of Rs2,000 crore ($300 million), and now British businessman Raj Kundra and other Bollywood celebrities , too, have been dragged into the mess.\nIn the early days, as cryptocurrencies caught on in India, frauds were limited to phishing and hacking. Then, came multi-level marketing schemes. Now virtual money is even being demanded as ransom .\nPhishing and hacking: It is one of the oldest tricks in the book. An email is sent from a seemingly genuine address, asking users to click on a link and/or fill in details. These links usually contain malware that affects the systems and clones the investors’ data, robbing them of their funds. In other cases, a hacker may hold the important files on your system as ransom, until they are paid in cryptocurrencies.\nEarlier this year, a New Delhi-based investor approached the authorities after she lost bitcoin worth Rs6.5 lakh to hacking. She lost another Rs35 lakh to crooks who promised to help retrieve the earlier amount.\nFake apps and social media accounts: Fake apps have been flooding the app stores. In other cases, counterfeit websites and Twitter handles are used to dupe gullible investors. For instance, users of Zebpay , a cryptocurrency exchange in India, received messagesasking them to deposit a certain amount of money as part of a survey in exchange for bitcoins. These messages were sent out from a Twitter handle that looked very similar to Zebpay’s actual account.\nPonzi schemes: The golden rule of investing is that if something looks too good to be true, it probably is. In the case of GainBitcoin, Bharadwaj had promised investors a 10% monthly return on cryptocurrency investments for 18 months under multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes such as the Bitcoin Growth Fund . The MLM schemes are tiered marketing plans in which investors are rewarded for bringing more people into the fold. The old investors are paid off with the help of money ploughed in by the new customers, till the scheme falls flat.\nIn another case, investors in OneCoin, another company that launched a digital coin-led investment scheme, realised that the firm didn’t even have a registered office address or a bank account. Nearly 400 people were taken in by the promise of high returns.\nBlockchain consultant Pramod Emjay warns that any investment offer that promises to make you rich quickly should raise a red flag. “The types of scams that are being followed are not new at all. These are just old scams in new garbs. Therefore, the investor needs to follow the same rule of being very cautious.”\nExchanges under attack: In April, Coinsecure, a New Delhi-based cryptocurrency exchange, was robbed of 438 bitcoins worth Rs20 crore. The firm named an employee in a first information report filed later that month, while promising to refund money to its investors in due time . It’s the first time that an exchange came under attack in India. But, globally such cases are well known.\nOther crimes: The skyrocketing prices of cryptocurrencies have drawn investors and swindlers alike. Now, tech-savvy kidnappers in India have also been asking for bitcoin as ransom . In April, nine police officers in Gujarat were held for extorting 200 units of a digital currency from a businessman. Who is to blame?\nIndia’s digital currency ecosystem is currently unregulated. Therefore, investors don’t have a grievance redressal authority to approach during distress.\nHowever, cryptocurrency firms—already cornered by the central bank — argue that the entire ecosystem can’t be blamed. “Wherever there is money, there will be scams and there is nothing surprising about that,” said the head of a virtual currency exchange, requesting anonymity. “But that doesn’t mean that you can blame the whole system because investors are being stupid and jumping into these random money-making schemes or clicking on strange links to make a quick buck.” Most Popular", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://inc42.com/buzz/raj-kundras-questioning-by-ed-over-bitcoin-scam-brings-up-name-of-9-more-celebrities/", "https://inc42.com/buzz/who-is-amit-bhardwaj-the-real-story-behind-300-mn-bitcoin-ponzi-schemes/", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hackers-hit-traders-in-old-delhi-demand-bitcoin-as-ransom/story-6gnIKq4MaZb9MyZdgqwoAK.html", "https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/onecoin-online-fraud-case-investors-promised-massive-returns-on-rs-11900-investment-got-scammed-instead/643303/", "https://coinsecure.in/", "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/bitcoins-worth-rs-41l-stolen-from-womans-e-wallet-account/articleshow/63372882.cms", "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/bitcoins-worth-rs-20-crore-stolen-from-exchange-in-indias-biggest-crypto-theft/articleshow/63740771.cms", "https://blog.zebpay.com/your-complete-guide-to-bitcoin-related-scams-5113f8d02c26", "https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/bitcoin-gox/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "amit bhardwaj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raj kundra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T11:08:15.073+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f023afa3726cee3ce94feb4ffcf4c936d4557f24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYhr.7_6CWmgjkL8XZOqGZC.5fAAwq1n6HviaIky_FrICCNfXNm6wuRccGe0pzpPVUalL7NLdIYQIJb8AahkGsuszG1ho_S0Do-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "\"Good money serves rich and poor alike, bad money serves to tax the poor.

At the start of the year, the consensus was that the number one cryptocurrency would reach even greater heights. However, BTC prices have declined from its record-setting highs of $19,500 in mid-December 2017 to hovering around the $7,700 mark.\nBitcoin will Approach the $15,000 Mark by December 2018 Finder, a financial comparison platform, released a Bitcoin forecast that said BTC prices would cross the $30,000 mark by December 2018. Six months into the year, the platform seems to have revised its predictions with a new report released in June. According to the latest forecast figures, Bitcoin will end the year trading at $14,638. This new figure predicts an almost 100 percent increase in BTC price based on its current trading value.\nThe Finder cryptocurrency prediction panel consists of 10 members with experience in the digital currency and blockchain industry. The figures published by Finder are an extrapolation of the individual predictions of each panelist. Examining the figures published by Finder, the lowest end-of-year BTC price prediction was $5,778 while the highest was $25,000. Some of the members of the panel include James Lynch of Castlecoin, Aaron LePoidevin of Every Capital, and Kunal Patel of the Gerson Lehman Group.\nSpeaking to The Independent , David Hanson, CEO of Ultra, said that he expected Bitcoin to continue hovering between $6,500 and $8,500. According to Fundstrat analyst, Robert Sluymer , Bitcoin's bottom price is $7,000. Thus, with an influx of institutional investors, the price of BTC is expected to increase. Many experts and commentators share this notion that the entry of institutional investors into the market will drive up prices. In 2018, people like Tom Lee, also of Fundstrat, Dan Morehead (Pantera CEO), and Iqbal Gandham of eToro have expressed similar views.\nEOS to See the Highest Gains The Finder cryptocurrency prediction survey highlighted EOS as the cryptocurrency to watch. The results of the survey indicate a predicted price of $38.25 at the end of the year. Based on the current value of Eos tokens, this price estimate is a 200 percent increase. According to Hanson, EOS is generating a great deal of interest in the market, especially with the hype surrounding its mainnet launch. In a recent Weiss rating report , EOS was also identified as one of the best altcoins in the market.\nHow accurate do you think these predictions are?

Price is testing the top of the triangle and might be due for a move back to support. Technical indicators are suggesting that support might continue to hold and lead to another bounce to the top. Bitcoin price is consolidating inside an ascending triangle pattern and is testing the top.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the upside. This suggests that the rally is more likely to resume than to reverse or that support is more likely to hold than to break.\nHowever, the gap between the moving averages is narrowing to signal a potential downward crossover, indicating weakening bullish momentum. For now, both moving averages might keep holding as dynamic support just above the bottom of the triangle.\nRSI is heading lower but looks ready to move back up, reflecting a return in bullish pressure. Stochastic, on the other hand, continues to slide and signal that sellers still have the upper hand.\nA break below support could mean a move of the same height as the triangle, which spans $7,000 to $7,700. Similarly a break past the top could spur a rally of the same size.\nBTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin has been rejected at the $7,700 key area for a few times already, indicating that buyers are not quite confident enough to push price past that level yet. For now, there have been no major updates in the industry, although there have been some factors keeping the cryptocurrency supported.\nFor one, the ongoing crisis in Venezuela led to strong volumes in bitcoin versus the local currency, which is rapidly losing value to hyperinflation. Citizens are turning to bitcoin as an alternative financing or investment, which could keep activity supported while the crisis goes on.\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: New Triangle Pattern Forming appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T11:23:20.115+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "12410630388671966927bb0bfbd6a13e8739fd76", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa7HUJLybMtaNFRJLhHz6GBxTjNU3vSmdDA_p2oXavURfcT9MJWnhBTnAaQDr2C2Gq", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Bitcoin Cash vs. Bitcoin", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash vs. Bitcoin : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-06-08T10:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "12410630388671966927bb0bfbd6a13e8739fd76", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa7HUJLybMtaNFRJLhHz6GBxTjNU3vSmdDA_p2oXavURfcT9MJWnhBTnAaQDr2C2Gq", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jumpingcords", "published": "2018-06-08T10:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash vs. Bitcoin", "text": "submitted by /u/Jumpingcords\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2xZn2FZjDc"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T06:36:03.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c34f8c245ebc0614e16490277129c1f92078926f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWgTz7TtgU0kP.j20pnkQbU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Will Bitcoin remain dominant", "title_full": "Will Bitcoin remain dominant", "published": "2018-06-08T10:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c34f8c245ebc0614e16490277129c1f92078926f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWgTz7TtgU0kP.j20pnkQbU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cloak1", "published": "2018-06-08T10:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Will Bitcoin remain dominant", "text": "Definitely.

Just like most assets, there are some people who own the largest shares. Back in November last year, news went round the crypto space that someone transferred roughly 25,000 Bitcoins to an online exchange, which is worth around $159 million.\nBefore you know who owns the most Bitcoins, you need to know how many Bitcoins are there ; There are several Bitcoin large holders, known as whales. Their presence is a worry for most traders as they have the ability to send the price of Bitcoin plunging just by selling a portion of their holdings. Revealing all the top players in the Bitcoin space is a little tricky since most of them are unknown.\nWith 40 percent of Bitcoin being held by roughly 1,000 people, here are a few of the biggest known holders of Bitcoin.\nSatoshi Nakamoto\nThe first known and perhaps the largest holder of Bitcoin is the creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. According to some reports, Satoshi has roughly $7 billion worth of Bitcoins. This figure is just an estimation as it might be significantly higher or lower than that. We know little to prove who Satoshi is, the same way little is known about his or her Bitcoin holdings.\nThe Chinese Bitcoin Farms\nSome of the biggest Bitcoin players are the mining farms that mine Bitcoin and release them into circulation. The estimation is that roughly 81% of all the collective hashrate of Bitcoin is controlled by mining pools in China. Reports have suggested that one of the largest mining operations in the world, Antpool is responsible for mining approximately 20% of all Bitcoins mined in both 2016 and 2017.\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\nThis is a surprise name on the list as no one would have thought that a government agency would be one of the largest holders of Bitcoin. The security agency is estimated to own around 1.5% of all the Bitcoin currently in circulation.\nJust like the Chinese mining farms, the FBI runs similar mining operations, though it is relatively small compared to what the Chinese farms are running.\nSatoshi Dice\nThis was the first and one of the largest Bitcoin acquisition ever recorded. Back in 2013, Satoshi Dice purchased 126,315 Bitcoin, $858,942,000 in today’s markets.\nBarry Silbert\nHe is the founder and the Chief Executive Officer of Digital Currency Group. His company which is focused on rapidly developing the global financial system aim to achieve this by building and supporting Bitcoin and blockchain-related companies globally.\nDigital currency group has invested in nearly 100 Bitcoin-related companies and is considered one of the leading firms in the world in terms of Bitcoin and blockchain investment. Its acquisition of CoinDesk, one of the leading cryptocurrency news site has further engraved the company’s status as one the leading firms in the crypto space.\nDigital currency group is also the owner of Genesis, which is a trading firm that focuses on cryptocurrencies. Grayscale is another company owned by Silbert, and it is focused on cryptocurrency investments. Not stopping there, Silbert also founded the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks Bitcoin price.\nBlythe Masters\nShe is a former managing director at one of the leading banks in the U.S, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. She is currently the Chief Executive Officer of Digital Asset Holdings. This company has been manufacturing encryption-based processing tools which are designed to increase the efficiency, security, compliance and settlement speed of securities trading, especially those of Bitcoin.\nThe company is looking to apply the blockchain technology to most of the activities on the Wall Street. The company has a number of clients, with JP Morgan Chase one of them. They are helping financial institutions test the blockchain technology to see how it can settle transactions faster.\nAccording to most analysts and traders, Masters has given Bitcoin some level of legitimacy through her company, Digital Asset Holdings. It is a global company now that has offices on three continents.\nDan Morehead\nThe founder of Pantera Capital is one of the biggest Bitcoin holders in the world. The company is the first one in the world that was established to focus solely on cryptocurrencies investments. Pantera Capital launched its first crypto fund back in 2013, and it has now transformed to one of the biggest institutional owners of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nAside Bitcoin, the crypto fund has invested in nearly 50 cryptocurrencies since it was established and has invested in crypto-related companies like Polychain Capital. Augur, Bitstamp, and so many others.\nDan Morehead who was a former trader at Goldman Sachs also headed macro trading and was the CFO at Tiger management.\nTyler and Cameron Winklevoss\nPerhaps the most popular names in the crypto space after Satoshi, the Winklevoss twins are one of the biggest Bitcoin holders in the world. The duo earned millions after winning a lawsuit against Facebook and were the first billionaires after the surge in Bitcoin prices late last year.\nReports suggest that the Winklevoss twins hold roughly 1% of all the Bitcoin currently circulation. They stated that they have come up with elaborate ways to store the private keys for their crypto assets.\nThe twins are looking to make the crypto space more attractive to institutional investors and other day traders. To achieve that, they launched the first regulated crypto exchange platform in the world, Gemini.\nMichael Novogratz\nThis billionaire is reported to have invested roughly 30% of his wealth in cryptos. His first investment came in 2015. Two years later, he announced a $500 million crypto fund, with $150 million of those funds from his personal fortune.\nNovogratz has been a very vocal supporter of Bitcoin, with the investor forecasting that the Bitcoin price will hit $40,000 by the end of this year.\nConclusion\nThe Bitcoin space has evolved over the past few years, and more big players are boarding the train. It is expected that bigger institutions would come on board. There are other traders and investors who hold a significant amount of Bitcoin in their portfolio, but for the meantime, the above-listed individuals and bodies are the largest holders of Bitcoin in the world.

Price is testing the top of the triangle and might be due for a move back to support. Technical indicators are suggesting that support might continue to hold and lead to another bounce to the top.\nBitcoin price is consolidating inside an ascending triangle pattern and is testing the top.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the upside. This suggests that the rally is more likely to resume than to reverse or that support is more likely to hold than to break.\nHowever, the gap between the moving averages is narrowing to signal a potential downward crossover, indicating weakening bullish momentum. For now, both moving averages might keep holding as dynamic support just above the bottom of the triangle.\nRSI is heading lower but looks ready to move back up, reflecting a return in bullish pressure. Stochastic, on the other hand, continues to slide and signal that sellers still have the upper hand.\nA break below support could mean a move of the same height as the triangle, which spans $7,000 to $7,700. Similarly a break past the top could spur a rally of the same size. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin has been rejected at the $7,700 key area for a few times already, indicating that buyers are not quite confident enough to push price past that level yet. For now, there have been no major updates in the industry, although there have been some factors keeping the cryptocurrency supported.\nFor one, the ongoing crisis in Venezuela led to strong volumes in bitcoin versus the local currency, which is rapidly losing value to hyperinflation. Citizens are turning to bitcoin as an alternative financing or investment, which could keep activity supported while the crisis goes on.\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: New Triangle Pattern Forming appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T15:26:23.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "700831c2bd11be999d19762a7151b2297e32209d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSXNZjQwWkZu0J6.MofRjOIkbfQI9fq7LTYfU_F_Tiu0_28lua0cDLBREG2HNy9Wb_C95RFBVLDCe", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Van Eck CEO: We’re Closer Than Ever To Making a Bitcoin ETF", "title_full": "Van Eck CEO: We’re Closer Than Ever To Making a Bitcoin ETF", "published": "2018-06-08T10:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "700831c2bd11be999d19762a7151b2297e32209d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSXNZjQwWkZu0J6.MofRjOIkbfQI9fq7LTYfU_F_Tiu0_28lua0cDLBREG2HNy9Wb_C95RFBVLDCe", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-08T10:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Van Eck CEO: We’re Closer Than Ever To Making a Bitcoin ETF", "text": "Van Eck CEO: We're Closer Than Ever To Making a Bitcoin ETF\n/u/koocer\nsubmitted by /u/koocer\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "van eck", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T10:10:30.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4051c707deb2d00e7f95d6e6fa59b9bb51260b60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeBnUpJeAW31mcFoOJc9V.8egXqtIS8YKWL.WKyfeOpdNowaE2jIpGv22ni3T.UvbmBbo13r1cukTw--", "site_full": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin24on.blogspot.se/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "title": "Bitcoin Price Prediction: Expect Price to Double by the End of 2018", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Prediction: Expect Price to Double by the End of 2018", "published": "2018-06-08T10:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4051c707deb2d00e7f95d6e6fa59b9bb51260b60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeBnUpJeAW31mcFoOJc9V.8egXqtIS8YKWL.WKyfeOpdNowaE2jIpGv22ni3T.UvbmBbo13r1cukTw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin 24on (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-08T10:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Prediction: Expect Price to Double by the End of 2018", "text": "Home » bitcoin » bitcoinist » crypto » news » Bitcoin Price Prediction: Expect Price to Double by the End of 2018 Bitcoin Price Prediction: Expect Price to Double by the End of 2018 bitcoin , bitcoinist , crypto , news #bitcoin # invest #money\nWith the middle of 2018 almost upon us, it has become incumbent on experts and commentators to offer revised Bitcoin price predictions. At the start of the year, the consensus was that the number one cryptocurrency would reach even greater heights. However, BTC prices have declined from its record-setting highs of $19,500 in mid-December 2017 to hovering around the $7,700 mark. Bitcoin will Approach the $15,000 Mark by December 2018\nFinder, a financial comparison platform, released a Bitcoin forecast that said BTC prices would cross the $30,000 mark by December 2018. Six months into the year, the platform seems to have revised its predictions with a new report released in June. According to the latest forecast figures, Bitcoin will end the year trading at $14,638. This new figure predicts an almost 100 percent increase in BTC price based on its current trading value.\nThe Finder cryptocurrency prediction panel consists of 10 members with experience in the digital currency and blockchain industry. The figures published by Finder are an extrapolation of the individual predictions of each panelist. Examining the figures published by Finder, the lowest end-of-year BTC price prediction was $5,778 while the highest was $25,000. Some of the members of the panel include James Lynch of Castlecoin, Aaron LePoidevin of Every Capital, and Kunal Patel of the Gerson Lehman Group.\nSpeaking to The Independent , David Hanson, CEO of Ultra, said that he expected Bitcoin to continue hovering between $6,500 and $8,500. According to Fundstrat analyst, Robert Sluymer , Bitcoin’s bottom price is $7,000. Thus, with an influx of institutional investors, the price of BTC is expected to increase. Many experts and commentators share this notion that the entry of institutional investors into the market will drive up prices. In 2018, people like Tom Lee, also of Fundstrat, Dan Morehead (Pantera CEO), and Iqbal Gandham of eToro have expressed similar views. EOS to See the Highest Gains\nThe Finder cryptocurrency prediction survey highlighted EOS as the cryptocurrency to watch. The results of the survey indicate a predicted price of $38.25 at the end of the year. Based on the current value of Eos tokens, this price estimate is a 200 percent increase. According to Hanson, EOS is generating a great deal of interest in the market, especially with the hype surrounding its mainnet launch. In a recent Weiss rating report , EOS was also identified as one of the best altcoins in the market.\nHow accurate do you think these predictions are?

They just can’t touch it. Jun 08, 2018\nBy Lionel Laurent\n(Bloomberg Opinion) --The world of finance isn’t done yet with its effort to turn artistic masterpieces into tradeable securities. A decade ago it was hedge funds and bankers selling small shares in works by Andy Warhol and his ilk as investment opportunities. Today it's the cryptocurrency crowd.\nIf history’s a guide, the risk and cost of owning a tiny part of an illiquid, hard-to-value asset still outweighs the rewards. And all that without ever getting to hang the picture on your wall.\nThe new tilt at art trading is as much a throwback to pre-crisis financial engineering as it is about crypto-futurism. A British gallery is promising to sell up to 49 percent of Warhol’s 14 Small Electric Chairs in a blockchain-powered online auction. Buyers can pay in Bitcoin, Ether or other tokens. They’ll take cash too if you’re that way inclined.\nThese micro-stakes would then be traded on a marketplace. There may be a blockchain verifying transactions, and crypto-currencies changing hands, but we've seen art investment pools and art stock markets before. They don't always end well.\nDespite all the airy talk about democratizing art ownership and disrupting the gilded world of auction houses and dealers, this doesn’t really do that. Nobody owning a piece of the Warhol will take it home. It's locked up in a tax-free zone somewhere. What’s being traded is a stake in the special purpose vehicle that holds it.\nThis may be a wonderful way for the ultimate owner to make money from an artwork without taking it out of storage or ceding control, but it's hardly the Barnes Foundation.\nAs for the idea that this is a clever bet on the future value of a piece of art, these assets are as risky as any others. The art market is illiquid and can be volatile. Blue-chip artists are no protection against a market crash. Even Warhols were sold at a loss during the financial crisis. Do punters know the difference between this “Electric chairs” canvas, which the gallery says has been valued at 4.2 million pounds ($5.6 million), and others by the same artist?\nImagine what the combined volatility of cryptocurrency markets and the art market might create in times of stress. Liquidity would evaporate. That initial buy-in fee of 2 percent wouldn’t seem so cheap then.\nWarhol himself might have enjoyed the idea of trading and owning pieces of art that you've never seen. And there is at least one tangible thing on offer: The people running the auction say buyers can choose to receive a special scanned print of the work in question, which to the naked eye looks just as good as the original.

Hyland was a key figure in bringing the first oil and commodity ETFs to market when he was CFO of United States Commodity Funds. Now he’s hoping to use that expertise to bring some of the first U.S.-listed cryptocurrency ETFs to market with Bitwise, a firm that launched a private crypto index fund last year.\nWhile the Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve any bitcoin or cryptocurrency exchange-traded products, Hyland believes that could change relatively soon. Read on to find out when Hyland sees the first crypto ETF coming to market and what form it will take.\nETF.com: Is the ETF industry any closer to addressing the SEC’s concerns about cryptocurrency funds than it was several months ago?\nJohn Hyland: I do think we’re closer and there are four reasons why. The first has to do with custody. Right now, we custody our private fund's crypto assets with a small regulated custodian. The big five ETF custodians are looking, but not yet jumping into, offering the service.\nHowever, I spent half an hour last week talking to one of the three largest ETF custodians, and I think the way forward for them will be to hire existing regulated custodians, like ours, as \"subcustodians\" while they build up their own expertise. That solves one major issue for the SEC.\nOf course, an ETF that holds futures or swaps on the coins, and not the coins themselves, could already be custodied by any one of the ETF custodians that also handles futures-based commodity or currency ETFs.\nThe second reason has to do with enhanced regulated trading. A number of the major ETF market-making shops are setting up crypto trading desks. In addition, even some of the big stock exchanges are setting up regulated trading platforms. Thus, a crypto ETF, and its market makers, will be able to transact on platforms that have similar regulatory status to what they do with equities. This will all happen this year, or next year at the latest.\nReason No. 2 also means that reliable third-party pricing will be available for setting iNAVs and NAVs.\nFinally, one concern of the Division of Trading and Markets at the SEC is how crypto ETFs will behave in real life. Well, they already exist in Europe (four of them), on regulated exchanges (Nasdaq), in size ($600 million in AUM), and for several years now (since 2015).\nUnless these funds have some sort of major failure to function as ETPs, this will actually be the SEC's live experiment.\nETF.com: How likely is it that we’ll see a bitcoin or cryptocurrency ETF approved anytime soon?\nHyland: I think we get them sooner rather than later. But I also think that if we don't see any action by the SEC in the next two months, we’ll jump to 2019 and beyond. I don't see the SEC going from red light to green light anytime near the midterm election. It’ll make them gun-shy.\nI handicap the odds of a U.S. ETP in crypto as follows: 20% chance in 2018; 60% chance in 2019; and a 20% chance beyond 2019.\nETF.com: Where do you stand on the whole physical versus futures bitcoin ETF debate? Is one better than the other? Is one more likely than the other?\nHyland: There’s about $6 billion to $7 billion of actual bitcoin traded a day. There’s about $40 million to $50 million of bitcoin futures traded per day.\nFrom that standpoint, physical probably makes sense. It's a deeper, more liquid market. You don't have to deal with buying the futures and rolling them. You don't have to deal with backwardation and contango. Those issues go away, and those costs go away.\nIn theory, that should be the more logical way to do it. The reality from the standpoint of the regulators is there is an easier path forward for them to approve something tied to futures, because futures are regulated products in the U.S., and they’re trading on the Cboe.\nIf you can accept that the United States Oil Fund LP (USO) can hold CME/Nymex futures contracts on crude oil, then you should be able to, as a regulator, accept that a fund can hold [Cboe-listed bitcoin] futures trading in Chicago.\nFrom that standpoint, I can see them going ahead and permitting futures-based products. But in the long run, I believe owning the actual underliers is probably the long-term better design.\nETF.com: If and when the SEC does approve the first cryptocurrency ETF, do you think that's going to open the floodgates for many other crypto products to come to market?\nHyland: Yes, because from the regulatory standpoint, if you've accepted the argument that a futures-based bitcoin product can be declared effective, on what grounds do you then turn around and deny the next three or four issuers?\nEverybody who has the same outline of a product is going to probably be declared effective in roughly the same small time frame.\nThe only area where it could be different is leveraged products. For those, the depth of the market becomes a bigger issue. Price volatility multiplied by leverage becomes a bigger issue.\nETF.com: What types of cryptocurrency ETPs are you looking to bring to market, and how will you differentiate yourself from the many other ETF issuers that are also trying to bring crypto ETPs to market?\nHyland: Our core proposition for investors is offering diversified baskets of coins via a passive index. That’s what our existing private fund does. In each market that we file for public products (U.S., Europe, wherever), I anticipate the first product filed will be for an index basket.\nAt present, looking at what has been filed with the SEC, everybody else is trying to get a bitcoin and/or an inverse bitcoin product out the door, not a basket. That is the biggest point of distinction.\nThe only index we currently produce is a long-only, market-cap-weighted index of the 10 largest cryptocurrencies (\"HOLD 10\"). However, we’ll certainly go on to produce other indices as we move forward—maybe with more coins, or fewer, or selecting the best on some basis other than size and liquidity.\nWe’ll also file for products outside the U.S. I think we’re likely to file [in London] in the near future. Unlike the U.S., there are already bitcoin ETPs in Europe, so our first filing will likely be the index basket. Still, if the incremental cost of offering a single-coin ETP is low, we might as well go for it.\nEmail Sumit Roy at [email protected] or follow him on Twitter sumitroy2 Related ETFs", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/noaction/2018/cryptocurrency-011818.htm", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hyland", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitwise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john hyland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sumit roy john hyland", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitwise asset management", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T10:48:03.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aa113239408aae0012192fdd64fd4a626a613b8c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRrQMwA9kyMdNPdmB157RA8Z7wLewMsoPR_.P8.sj_.9128B.o3hhQrgSDcUWNHr084P8mwUiWYiAXdz0GMESjXSAeCCBnLC9Pv2og0FvWQMq22OJ_V_P0f", "site_full": "www.businessinsider.com", "site": "businessinsider.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.businessinsider.com.au/businessinsideraustralia\r", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Business Insider Australia", "title": "CRYPTO INSIDER: A new bitcoin ETF has experts laughing", "title_full": "CRYPTO INSIDER: A new bitcoin ETF has experts laughing", "published": "2018-06-08T09:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.businessinsider.com/image/5b1ab37d1ae6623d008b4bff-400.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 283, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aa113239408aae0012192fdd64fd4a626a613b8c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRrQMwA9kyMdNPdmB157RA8Z7wLewMsoPR_.P8.sj_.9128B.o3hhQrgSDcUWNHr084P8mwUiWYiAXdz0GMESjXSAeCCBnLC9Pv2og0FvWQMq22OJ_V_P0f", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Graham Rapier", "published": "2018-06-08T09:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "CRYPTO INSIDER: A new bitcoin ETF has experts laughing", "text": "CRYPTO INSIDER: A new bitcoin ETF has experts laughing Graham Rapier twitter Andrew Burton/Getty Images A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during the afternoon of December 4, 2015 in New York City.\nWelcome to Crypto Insider, Business Insider’s roundup of all the bitcoin and cryptocurrency news you need to know today.

The Thane crime branch of Mumbai police seized two expensive cars from Cryptocurrency businessman, Amit Lakhanpal’s residence in Airoli on Wednesday. The two seized cars are DC Avanti and a Mercedes-Benz vehicle. The seized DC Avanti gets Lamborghini badges on the rear and also the Lamborghini moniker, which got the cops to think that this was a Lamborghini.\nThe bright-orange coloured car was referred to as Lamborghini by the cops. A senior cop also mentioned that Amit Lakhanpal got the “Lamborghini” modified from a popular place and he spent lakhs to do the modifications.\nThe Thane crime branch officer said to Asian Age,\n“The Lamborghini is modified by a famous car designer and Pal has spent several lakhs on it, too. Both vehicles are worth around a crore. The source of funds for the vehicles and the papers of the vehicles will be scrutinized to ascertain the ownership.”\nWhile a new Lamborghini costs multiple crores in India, even a used Lamborghini carries a price tag of above Rs. 1 crore. The car shown in the picture is DC Avanti, which is dubbed as the first made-in-India sportscar. It carries a price tag of around Rs. 36 lakhs while many second-hand examples are available in the market that are priced much lower than a new one.\nThe orange coloured Avanti with the Lamborghini logo must have tricked the crime branch cops in this case. The DC Avanti is powered by a 2.0-litre EcoBoost engine from Ford. The turbocharged petrol engine produces a maximum of 240 Bhp and 366 Nm. Lamborghini does not have a straight-line engine in the line-up and all of the engines are naturally aspirated. The power output of the Lamborghini is much higher than the DC Avanti too.\nAmit Lakhanpal is currently in Dubai and the firm of the accused is said to be worth more than 500 crore. His wife told police that he loves luxury and fast cars. Mumbai cops have said that Amit Pal will be brought back to India and will be tried according to the Indian laws.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lamborghini", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "amit lakhanpal", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mercedes", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mercedes-benz", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "airoli", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T22:11:03.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db50755873b18c6eb8b3fc2b331096e7f8835d49", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTofO4X_4mDLB9VVh5uE.czbDJFkTaGbDtonAMweutKcEyeW9LT678kRaeiQMJBc7OabtLY7eh0_FMtCIDDbJ68", "site_full": "www.gensansale.com", "site": "gensansale.com", "site_section": "https://www.gensansale.com/forums/jobs-work.21/", "site_categories": ["auto_racing", "sports", "illegal_content"], "section_title": "Jobs / Work | General Santos City Classified Ads &amp; Online Community", "title": "Without Investment Bitcoins", "title_full": "Without Investment Bitcoins | General Santos City Classified Ads & Online Community", "published": "2018-06-08T09:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://www.gensansale.com//customized/nothumbgs.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "db50755873b18c6eb8b3fc2b331096e7f8835d49", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTofO4X_4mDLB9VVh5uE.czbDJFkTaGbDtonAMweutKcEyeW9LT678kRaeiQMJBc7OabtLY7eh0_FMtCIDDbJ68", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nizseidon", "published": "2018-06-08T09:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Without Investment Bitcoins", "text": "Guys freak out n ako grabi laki n ng kinita ko sa FREE BITCOINS minning na 2 you only need a Computer or Laptop at Google Chrome or even in Mozilla..

In a recent interview with CNBC, Jay Clayton, the Chairman of US Securities and Exchange Commission has clarified his views on Bitcoin by referring to it as “replacements for sovereign currencies.”\nControversial enough, Roger Ver stated that Bitcoin Cash meet-ups had a turn-out of more than 125 people, which is supposedly far lesser than the number of people turning up for BTC meet-ups. Mr. Ver went around giving away BCH t-shirts and assuring more and more people to support and learn about the community so that they can receive money in their Bitcoin Cash wallets at the speed of light.\nThis is not the first time Mr. Ver has attacked BTC in order to show support to the Bitcoin Cash community.\nRoger Ver stated:\n“I have been telling people about Bitcoin since 2011. It allows you to send and receive any amount of money with anyone and anywhere instantly basically for free, and there is nothing anybody can do to stop it. This speech is still 100% true about Bitcoin cash today but no longer true about BTC.”\nHe later goes about asking friends and merchants to provide their support towards accepting BCH. Investors were asked to visit ‘free.bitcoin.com’ to earn free Bitcoin Cash. Both Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash share the same genesis block.\nMemo.cash also provides zero manipulation when it comes to posting your opinions right into the blockchain and more people are going to support it because it is not centrally controlled. Ver believes that “destruction is the key to progress” while talking about regulatory bodies shutting down or disrupting the issue of digital currencies. Another website called Moneytoken.com has already started using BCH as a store of value with the advancements in its scaling technology.\nA Twitter enthusiast, Douglas Sloan, commented:\n“If you think it’s a scam, don’t put in $$$. Time will tell. I would love to know the motivations of those who spend time tearing down the hard work of brilliant folks trying to make a difference.”\nJoannes Vermorel, the CEO of Lokad has been working on developing the potential for the supply chains on Bitcoin cash with “faster than light transactions”.\nHe further stated:\n“I believe that the BCH community does not allow any incompetent people and are more driven. Bitcoin Cash is essentially a marketplace for competing companies that just do not cater to crypto-networks.”\nAnother Twitter enthusiast, and Bitcoin Core developer, Luke Dashjr argued saying:\n“Since Satoshi’s original scaling ideas were found to be impossible, Bitcoin has adopted a direction of using more advanced off-chain tech to accomplish the original goals. BCH, on the other hand, wants to do everything on-chain, and so far has just been ignoring the problems.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roger ver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rakan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay clayton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tokyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T09:42:14.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "10881ac5817887f980764aa171a840b8a08149f6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz_m_6BtV39TQn8gnbmb4qjo-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-08T09:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "10881ac5817887f980764aa171a840b8a08149f6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz_m_6BtV39TQn8gnbmb4qjo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-08T09:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ June 8, 2018 WEB Bitcoin Price Watch: Currency Spikes to $7700 CryptoYum At press time, bitcoin is trading at the $7,700 mark.

It is bought and sold as shares and can yield dividends.\nTypically, ETF’s are a way to diversify one’s investments. Many ETF’s, for example, allow an investor to have exposure to a wide number of companies through a single fund only. A popular type of ETF is what’s known as an index fund, where the ETF consists of an equal or weighted number of stocks from a particular set of companies such as the S&P 500 or all companies from a particular industry or field that are listed.\nA Bitcoin ETF, on the other hand, would be a fund that is traded in dollars and is valued based on the trading value of bitcoin. There are a number of reasons why this would be revolutionary for the investing world, so let’s go over some of those now. Giving Old Money Access to New Money\nOne major stumbling block for cryptocurrencies is that they are in many ways difficult to access for a large number of different types of investors. This is because bitcoin ownership requires a high degree of technical knowledge. Not only must you be able to buy it, but you also need to be able to keep it securely. Not many average investors understand the necessity of a hardware wallet , or for keeping cryptocurrencies in cold storage.\nFurther, your average investor is not likely to have a deep understanding of how bitcoin addresses or transaction fees work, or what the differences between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are.\nThe first Bitcoin ETF will be revolutionary because it will allow traditional investors and large institutional investors to suddenly get access to this exciting asset class. Not only that, but they can do so without the need for any technical knowledge or fear of losing private keys.\nAnother major benefit is investing in a Bitcoin ETF would make keeping track of taxes and capital gains infinitely easier. This is because the tax reporting requirements for owning ETFs are well understood by accountants and tax professionals. What’s different this time?\nThe next question we have to ask is why is this filing different than the previous two that failed. According to van Eck, the previous filings were all based on bitcoin futures, and not bitcoin itself. The new fund which exists through a partnership with SolidX will actually hold real bitcoin directly, and not a derivative of bitcoin. January, 2018 interview between Jan van Eck and CNBC’s Bob Pisani\nvan Eck said:\n“We’re going to keep knocking on the door until they let us through. Persistence is the game here. This is a very different filing than our other filings. The other filings were on bitcoin futures which came out in December of last year. And this one is actually they call it bitcoin physical itself, like GLD. So the trust would own bitcoin not a derivative of bitcoin.”\nWhat about keeping the bitcoin secure, or what if hackers are able to gain access to the fund’s Bitcoin?\nvan Eck replied: “The SolidX people have arranged for insurance over the loss of the private key which is kind of the best you get these days in terms of custody.”\nOne major reason for Bitcoin ETF’s being denied in the past is that the SEC was not able to verify the nature of the investment, or how to verify its price and value. With the new ETF slated to directly purchase and hold bitcoin, it should be much easier to justify the fund itself, as well as having a reasonable way to keep track of its price and consequent valuation.\nWhen CNBC report Bob Pisani who just yesterday interviewed Jay Clayton of the SEC yesterday to discuss cryptocurrency asked how confident he was about this third filing, van Eck told Pisani: “We hope so. And it is a dialogue and this is what’s different about bitcoin than other ETF’s that you can launch because the market is changing so much, the market infrastructure.” Good for Bitcoin?\nThe only point left to ponder is would a bitcoin ETF be good for bitcoin as a whole?\nGenerally speaking, that answer should be a solid yes. If the first Bitcoin ETF exists, then more cryptocurrency based ETF’s are bound to follow. These sorts of ETF’s will serve as a stabilizing force for the market because they will represent many millions of dollars of investor funds buying up an equal or larger amount of cryptocurrency from the market and holding it in a secure cold storage medium. This will effectively reduce the circulating supply of the currency, and thus could lead to increased prices over time.\nFurther, these sorts of funds will make Bitcoin accessible to a larger number of investors, and as a consequence, will increase the profile of cryptocurrencies as a whole, leading to a potential increase in adoption.\nFinally, having cryptocurrencies traded on major stock exchanges globally will inevitably lead to cryptocurrencies being seen as a more legitimate and trustworthy investment, and could encourage other major players like banks and investment firms to get involved in crypto. 12 shares", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "van eck", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "etf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T10:25:39.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5f9f0bc61bc9b893a8644f193fa89c5949f1292d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqamV7SlH1BbWqp9K4.7c4SK3n0HBnHnhKNI23SXBMv6FoNwNCMYuKYNX3R9VZHzDhL", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "A question about Bitcoin", "title_full": "A question about Bitcoin : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-06-08T09:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.278, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5f9f0bc61bc9b893a8644f193fa89c5949f1292d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqamV7SlH1BbWqp9K4.7c4SK3n0HBnHnhKNI23SXBMv6FoNwNCMYuKYNX3R9VZHzDhL", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "TheeDogma", "published": "2018-06-08T09:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "A question about Bitcoin", "text": "Hello.\nI today I got 4K in bitcoin because there was no other way I could obtain the money otherwise.\nI haven’t been watching the market but do understand it.

I have saved $ 5000 for a few months and want to buy btc. But the fact is that I plan to buy it and so it has increased in price as the money will need a little more in 2 months. Do you think btc will cost at least$10,000 in August-September?\nNo one can really give you a exact answer because its really hard to predict where is the price going to be around that time. All we can do is hope that it can bounce back and even hit 5 digits again this month. However, it looks very bleak because we are still struggling to even get to $8K. So its really up to you to decide, and don't take anyone's advise here because as I have said, the market is very volatile and unpredictable and everything is based on speculation here.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T04:25:08.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4f3125597ce7f0a1e5a449b0c15b01015289eb7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfXttdjve.x53XVgzLdtkls-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Is bitcoin the one coin to rule them all?", "title_full": "Is bitcoin the one coin to rule them all?", "published": "2018-06-08T09:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4f3125597ce7f0a1e5a449b0c15b01015289eb7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfXttdjve.x53XVgzLdtkls-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "DemiGodKaido", "published": "2018-06-08T09:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is bitcoin the one coin to rule them all?", "text": "There is no coin that rule others.

A decade ago it was hedge funds and bankers selling small shares in works by Andy Warhol and his ilk as investment opportunities. Today it&apos;s the cryptocurrency crowd.\nIf history’s a guide, the risk and cost of owning a tiny part of an illiquid, hard-to-value asset still outweighs the rewards. And all that without ever getting to hang the picture on your wall.\nThe new tilt at art trading is as much a throwback to pre-crisis financial engineering as it is about crypto-futurism. A British gallery is promising to sell up to 49 percent of Warhol’s 14 Small Electric Chairs in a blockchain-powered online auction. Buyers can pay in Bitcoin, Ether or other tokens. They’ll take cash too if you’re that way inclined.\nHow To Sell It Cryptocurrency prices have been hit by a speculative unraveling and a regulatory crackdown\nSource: Bloomberg\nThese micro-stakes would then be traded on a marketplace. There may be a blockchain verifying transactions, and crypto-currencies changing hands, but we&apos;ve seen art investment pools and art stock markets before. They don&apos;t always end well.\nDespite all the airy talk about democratizing art ownership and disrupting the gilded world of auction houses and dealers, this doesn’t really do that. Nobody owning a piece of the Warhol will take it home. It&apos;s locked up in a tax-free zone somewhere. What’s being traded is a stake in the special purpose vehicle that holds it.\nBank Canvas A ranking of the world&apos;s most valuable artworks, as of Nov. 17, 2017\nSource: World Economic Forum\nThis may be a wonderful way for the ultimate owner to make money from an artwork without taking it out of storage or ceding control, but it&apos;s hardly the Barnes Foundation.\nAs for the idea that this is a clever bet on the future value of a piece of art, these assets are as risky as any others. The art market is illiquid and can be volatile. Blue-chip artists are no protection against a market crash. Even Warhols were sold at a loss during the financial crisis. Do punters know the difference between this “Electric chairs” canvas, which the gallery says has been valued at 4.2 million pounds ($5.6 million), and others by the same artist?\nArtistic Temperament Global art market sales growth tends to fluctuate\nSource: UBS/Art Basel\nImagine what the combined volatility of cryptocurrency markets and the art market might create in times of stress. Liquidity would evaporate. That initial buy-in fee of 2 percent wouldn’t seem so cheap then.\nWarhol himself might have enjoyed the idea of trading and owning pieces of art that you&apos;ve never seen. And there is at least one tangible thing on offer: The people running the auction say buyers can choose to receive a special scanned print of the work in question, which to the naked eye looks just as good as the original. As David Bowie once sang in a song about Warhol: “Can&apos;t tell them apart at all.”\nIf people do manage to make money from this, then finance truly will have reached its post-modern apotheosis.\nLionel Laurent at llaurent2@bloomberg.net\nJames Boxell at jboxell@bloomberg.net\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bloom.bg/dg-ws-core-bcom-a1"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andy warhol", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "warhol", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "small electric chairs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T17:00:13.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9b6897f84ecf26e055dd75d01f91951efe2a2521", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQd7fFNkO3aZ39i_t10jmwXd9wA470lKOopC1ntfLjpd2oo_J0p4Fyb9k8y6QCS8sHr145zRsAGKNxSzVrwQQMXOJf8vuaJ1BjC1rtnNaKMy7GPY4dvRWnjzEHJTC_tv4I-", "site_full": "www.equitiesfocus.com", "site": "equitiesfocus.com", "site_section": "http://www.equitiesfocus.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Equities Focus", "title": "First Bitcoin Price Down 15.4% This Week (CRYPTO:BIT)", "title_full": "First Bitcoin Price Down 15.4% This Week (CRYPTO:BIT)", "published": "2018-06-08T08:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/1323.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9b6897f84ecf26e055dd75d01f91951efe2a2521", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQd7fFNkO3aZ39i_t10jmwXd9wA470lKOopC1ntfLjpd2oo_J0p4Fyb9k8y6QCS8sHr145zRsAGKNxSzVrwQQMXOJf8vuaJ1BjC1rtnNaKMy7GPY4dvRWnjzEHJTC_tv4I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "John Braxton", "published": "2018-06-08T08:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "First Bitcoin Price Down 15.4% This Week (CRYPTO:BIT)", "text": "Tweet\nFirst Bitcoin (CURRENCY:BIT) traded 3.2% lower against the dollar during the 24-hour period ending at 23:00 PM ET on May 31st.

I groaned. There goes my coffee money. I withdrew my bitcoin earnings and I'm glad I did.\nAbout 2 weeks ago I logged on to discover you can't withdrawn without completing a very stupid verification process.\nI've started using Earn.com about a year ago. Nothing fancy, just survey's etc. No verification needed etc.\nEvery week I'd check it during a work bread, spend 15 minutes mindlessly clicking and voila I'd have money for coffee or meal at the end of the month. In actual fact, I spent my earn.com earning on an annual magazine subscription. But you get the point.\nAfter Coinbase took over I withdrew all. I did some more surveys and logged in to do my monthly withdraw --- \"You need to be verified before withdrawing\" popped up.\nHere we go ... I thought, and way right.\n1 . Send in work email - easy or 2 . Link your LinkedIn account ... ? eh\nThere are also Facebook and Github link options but they are not for verification.\nI don't have a LinkedIn account (can't stand them). The first think I did was send them my verified work ID email . Click click. Done. But, it still said I needed to submit one. I suspected something was up.\nLots of small print later. It seems they manually review (yea right) and it's better to have both verified options complete.... Even though the email one still said I needed to input one.\nI set up a new LinkedIn account which I really hated. The spam has already started.\nI then tried to link it with Earn.com. I big old pop up came up and said \"Only LinkedIn accounts with 50 connections can be verified\" - you can see where this is going!\nFFS. Send an email to Earn.com. I've only had to do this once before when my withdraw didn't go through. Error on their end.\nThey came back this time with a copy/paste reply\nI reply back with same details.\nThey reply saying verified email please.\nI reply that I have.\nThey reply that's the best they can do .... ? WTF?\nI reply again, that I have given my work email!\nThey reply I need a LinkedIn account\nI basically repeat everything I've written here.\nThey reply, \"That's are only option, we are looking at other methods\"\nH\nSo here's what gets me.\nI never got an email to say they were changing their policy.\nI earned that bitcoin legitimately. They are withholding it . Let' me have my cash and I'll close the account.\nIf Earn.com simply said \"Hi, if you want to use earn.com to earn from now on, you'll now need to be verified.\" - and let you withdraw what you already had earned, then that's fine.\nBut, they didn't. They didn't say anything. They just seized my money. That's not good.\nToday if I were to sign up to Earn.com and these were the \"verification\" requirements, I simply wouldn't sign up. And that's fine, that's my choice. I don't use LinkedIn nor do I think it's a good way of verifying someone.\nAt the end of the day I can always head over to Fivver and pay for 50 LinkedIN connections. The remaining money I have in Earn.com just about covers that :) So, I wouldn't be too fussed. Unfortunately I think Earn.com probably would take the grudge and not verify anyway.\nI also think this is pure money grab by them. I know many people who just use it to earn beermoney or work in places where they don't or can't be verified overseas.\nSo in about 6 months there may or not be an email sent out by earn.com saying all these unverified accounts are dormant and will be closed. Cue, cash grab final act.\nSo let that this be a warning to anyone out there with an Earn.com account or thinking of signing up with them .\n submitted by /u/dtheme\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T04:18:54.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "195cda3e69af9a469e2aba4134dca9a7d29dd6f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSZUXd4nph2IfMPijuiRbXSEQWbTupqpXT6jEPNteE4doMZL843U6nrXRufxxVgWVGQ--", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin has gone 173 days without hitting an all-time high — its longest stretch in about 2 years", "title_full": "Bitcoin has gone 173 days without hitting an all-time high — its longest stretch in about 2 years", "published": "2018-06-08T08:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "195cda3e69af9a469e2aba4134dca9a7d29dd6f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSZUXd4nph2IfMPijuiRbXSEQWbTupqpXT6jEPNteE4doMZL843U6nrXRufxxVgWVGQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-08T08:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin has gone 173 days without hitting an all-time high — its longest stretch in about 2 years", "text": "Bitcoin has gone 173 days without hitting an all-time high — its longest stretch in about 2 years\nBitcoin has gone 173 days without hitting an all-time high — its longest stretch in about 2 years MarketWatch VanEck tries a third time for a bitcoin ETF CNBC Investment Firm VanEck Attempts New Bitcoin ETF Filing, Aims at Institutional Players Cointelegraph Bitcoin ETF Dreams Kept Alive With New SEC Filing Bloomberg Full coverage Google ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marketwatch vaneck", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec filing bloomberg full", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc investment firm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T08:48:07.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b58fde15e453880ff418b9d804ce5cd1e83787d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSS1J0W5MW9zduYo7oHuJ3UZ93O2VDVOH69etgIpC_bQc4BUMnkPVRI5gDAKoWmLr_IbSiefr7oB2", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Cheap power drew bitcoin miners to this small city.

Today, it’s increasingly becoming something that mainstream investors care about. Over the last few years, the value of a single bitcoin has increased by more 800% margin and the overall value of all cryptocurrencies has gone up by more than 1300%.\nDespite having shown a significant increase in value, the bitcoin market is very volatile and can result in huge loses if you don’t take care. That means investors have to know the best time to acquire bitcoins, to avoid making losses when the market fails. Keep in mind that the price can significantly drop at any time, causing huge losses to the investors. So, when is the right time to buy bitcoin?\nUnlike other forms of investments, no time is right when it comes to buying bitcoin. That’s because waiting for the right time will mean focusing on the short-term prices and viewing it as a way to make some quick returns. However, this kind of mentality is totally wrong when it comes to bitcoin and it can lead to loss of investment.\nLike any other serious cryptocurrency adopter, your main aim should be acquiring as many bitcoin as possible and avoid looking at the short-term profits. You should also seek a lot of advice before you go ahead and buy bitcoin . However, if anyone advises you to concentrate on a certain time frame to know when to make a purchase, then that is bad advice.\nGood Advice: Before you go ahead and exchange your fiat currency for a single Satoshi, you should adopt these three simple principles to avoid making losses when the market crashes. These incredible tips include: 1. Educate yourself\nAs we all know, buying bitcoin is not different from investing in any other asset available on the market. No one commits their hard earned cash on something that they don’t fully understand. That means you should commit to an extensive learning process, before making the decision to buy a single Satoshi. You should also avoid chasing parabolic price patterns and viewing it as a get-rich-quick scheme. 2. Buy the Dip\nBitcoins are highly volatile and largely unpredictable when it comes to the changes in price. This is why most investors know better than to try and predict when the prices have reached top or bottom. However, buying more when the prices are in a continuous downward trend is the best choice you might ever make. Keep in mind that for this strategy to work, you have to buy bitcoin and hold them on a long-term basis. Conclusion\nBitcoins have very fascinating trends and could change the way companies do business and influence people’s financial lives in profound ways. Since there is no guarantee that this could work as an investment option for you, it’s advisable to commit less than 5% of your portfolio. It’s also advisable to have other forms of investments, to cater emergencies and protect yourself against unforeseen risks that may render the bitcoin market unsalvageable.

The bitcoin billionaires doesn't seem to be planning more pumping movement, as time will come as we take more effort to gain good profit when patience is over before price will be achieved.\nThe bearish market is i think due to the manipulation of whales and they want bitcoin's value at this range.

Bitcoin is the digital currency which is created and held electronically and is the first successful digital coin that can be transferred over the web.\nThough Bitcoin doesn’t have any physical existence, it is safer, faster and easier than traditional money with advantages for both consumers and business owners. This cryptocurrency doesn’t rely on governments or central banks but is instead managed ideally via a network called blockchain. The blockchain is essentially an online ledger that keeps a secure record of every transaction made at one place so that every time anyone makes a transaction or exchange using Bitcoin, it is recorded safely and securely.\nBitcoin is a peer-to-peer payment network which in simple words means that it can be transferred from a person to another directly over the internet. This permits users to avoid using a middleman such as a credit agency or bank and it provides them more control over their funds digitally. This peer-to-peer system creates a new way of transacting and with Bitcoin at the forefront of the digital currency market; it is creating a new way to make online payments.\nBitcoin is one of the most common digital currencies that are changing ecommerce . How is it transforming ecommerce? Let’s talk about ecommerce and bitcoin. Improved Shopping experience with Bitcoin\nDigital currency can widely promote the overall shopping experience because all you need is to purchase the bitcoins from one of the many brokerages or online exchanges by transferring money from your regular bank account. Once you have bought the bitcoins, you assign them to a wallet, which is more or less like an online account. When you are shopping, all you need to do is open the mobile app of the wallet and hold the QR code reader up to the particular store’s device. The embedded secret password then unlocks the address of your bitcoin and informs the bitcoin computer network of the transfer that is happening to the shop’s address. What’s good about it is that the entire process only occurs within a few seconds. The confirmation of the whole process, unlike the traditional systems that take up to four days, this one takes less than 10 minutes.\nTalking about shopping when you are out of Bitcoins, you can also purchase more with the help of iTunes Gift cards How is Bitcoin Changing E-Commerce?\nDespite some risks, Bitcoin is a very dynamic and interesting technology that will surely change how e-commerce will be conducted in the near future. And here’s how Bitcoin can accomplish such a feat. Bitcoin is progressively infiltrating the E-commerce industry because it is an innovative, viable and best solution. More and more companies today understand this and are drawing many customers attention because of it. Instant Gratification\nIn today’s fast-paced world, we want everything done immediately – actually 10 minutes, but that’s still better than what we were used to. And bitcoin certainly fits that mold. Instead of waiting hours, days or even weeks for a payment transaction to go through, bitcoin is for the most part instant. This gives a person the piece of mind in knowing that a product or service has instantly gone through instead of it pending, waiting for approval or anxiously figuring out why your PayPal account is blocked. This will continue to be approved on so that transactions will literally be instant – which we’re almost at now.\nHowever, it could also speed up the transaction process. Again, since merchants are waiting days for a payment to clear, they could instantly ship out products. While Amazon, for example, is great at exhilarated shipping, just imagine how more efficient and quickly it could send out products because of direct and instant payments.

There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,160 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might dip a few points, but the overall bias is positive above the $1,100 support level. Bitcoin cash price remains in an uptrend above $1,100 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD has to move past $1,160 and $1,180 to gain upside momentum.\nBitcoin Cash Price Resistance There were mostly ranging moves above the $1,100 support area in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price traded towards the $1,170 level, but it failed to move further higher. A high was formed near $1,168 before the price started a downside correction. At the moment, it seems like there is a strong resistance area forming near $1,160, which may act as a pivot zone.\nA downward correction is underway, and the price recently broke the 23.6% fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,048 low to $1,168 high. However, the decline is finding bids near the $1,130 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Further below the 100 hourly SMA, there is a key support around the $1,100 level. Moreover, the 50% fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,048 low to $1,168 high is also around the stated support. On the upside, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,160 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair.\nLooking at the chart , the pair has to settle above the $1,160 resistance area to gain upside momentum. The next hurdles above $1,160 are seen near $1,180 and $1,200.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is slowly moving in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is currently just above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $1,100\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,160\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Eyeing Upside Break appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T07:53:29.062+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f85ac1fc0e8f777154056cee1d5349c63346d366", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmR_0UpMnODm6o9oeZoMOcVY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Bitcoin has now gone 173 days without a new high.", "title_full": "Bitcoin has now gone 173 days without a new high.", "published": "2018-06-08T07:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f85ac1fc0e8f777154056cee1d5349c63346d366", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmR_0UpMnODm6o9oeZoMOcVY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "DamCryp", "published": "2018-06-08T07:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin has now gone 173 days without a new high.", "text": "\"Bitcoin has now gone 173 days without a new high.

It’s not surprising. Every investor loves the zero-to-hero story, although most never realize that dream.\nThese kinds of “profit rockets” look much better in the headlines than they do in real life. For example, while bitcoin soared to amazing levels, within a few days half of its value was lost. This kind of volatility is expected in new investments like bitcoin.\nBut stocks still offer great returns and far less of a roller coaster ride. That’s why I found 10 stocks to buy instead of bitcoin. They will serve you well and keep your blood pressure at reasonable levels at the same time.\nYou don’t need drama to make money. As a matter of fact, just the opposite should be your goal. Good stocks that are on a solid growth path will help you remain cool while crypto investors are watching every uptick and downtick.\nSource: Shutterstock Stocks to Buy: Ligand Pharma\nLigand Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:LGND) is a new generation of biopharmaceutical company. It’s basically an R&D operation that helps biotech and pharmaceutical firms discover new drugs.\nWith the cost of getting a drug through FDA testing running around $2 billion, drug companies need to operate as lean as possible, so many are deciding to outsource their R&D labs. They get a company that will focus on the specific area they’re interested in, or LGND can pitch a company on a discovery they made.\nMost of the work is a split between a fee and licensing rights on any drug that goes to market. With the growing opportunities for pharmaceuticals in this tech-driven era, LGND is set to prosper. LGND stock is up almost 30% in the past 6 months.\nSource: Shutterstock\nWestlake Chemical Corporation (NYSE:WLK) is a leading chemical firm, supplying industries with vinyls, polymers, olefins and other materials.\nThis is a cyclical industry that has been slogging through the slow-growth economy. But starting in the last quarter, things are starting to look up.\nAs the economy expands, there’s more demand for WLK products across all the industries it supports. In the past 6 months, WLK stock is up 55%.\nWhat’s more, WLK is small enough – a $14 billion market cap – to be able to reflect this growth directly to its bottom line. And once this sector gets going, which it is, it’s a multi-year cycle.\nSource: Shutterstock Stocks to Buy: HollyFrontier (HFC)\nHollyFrontier Corporation (NYSE:HFC) is a relatively small independent refiner. It has a number of refineries around the Midwest and Southwest.\nWhile the US shale fields have been up and down in recent years, it finally looks like Saudi Arabia and OPEC are no longer interested in making life tough for US shale firms and have move on to other big clients like China.\nThat’s good news for US energy independence since it means prices will stay high enough for US producers to make money. That means refiners like HFC are also winners in this scenario.\nThat’s the main reason HFC stock is up 87% in the past 6 months. It has come off its bottom and is truly back in business. As the US and global economy expand, so will the coffers at HFC.\nSource: Shutterstock Stocks to Buy: Control4 Corp\nControl4 Corp (NASDAQ:CTRL) has a market cap of about $820 million and does about more than $210 million in annual revenue. It’s not a big company.\nBut that is what makes it so interesting. It’s in the smart home and business solutions sector. And this getting very hot now.\nThat’s why CTRL stock is up 187% in the past 12 months. Because it’s smaller company in a ground floor sector, growth is going to be outsized for a while. And because of its size and growing reputation in the space, it’s also becoming a very tempting takeover target for bigger firms looking to expand into the space or simply acquire its list of business.\nCTRL stock will likely have more volatility than other bigger stocks in this list, but the ride could be very rewarding.\nSource: Shutterstock Stocks to Buy: MiMedx Group (MDXG)\nMiMedx Group Inc (NASDAQ:MDXG) is a next-generation medical company that is in such a unique space, it’s difficult to define in any conventional way.\nIt makes surgical biologics. That means it uses donated placental tissue, amniotic fluid and collagen fiber to build bone, musculoskeletal tissue and wound care from biological materials.\nAnd it works.\nMDXG stock is up 76% in the past 12 months and the company has a respectable $1.5 billion market cap. This isn’t a company that is still crossing its fingers with pie-in-the-sky technology. There’s a lot of promise here.\nIt may be volatile, as many of these biotech companies are, but its future is very bright.\nLouis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

Crypto fluctuations are not believed to affect consumption either. Russian residents have controlled cryptocurrency worth between $7.5 and $14 billion in the first quarter of this year, according to estimates published in the report.\nAlso read: Russian Railways Eyes Crypto for Tickets, Blockchain for Cargo Coins Compared to Commodities, Less Volatile than Some\nThe volatility of cryptocurrency rates is comparable to the price dynamics of foods, considered some of the most volatile commodities. Prices of products like meat, milk, and sugar can actually be much more volatile, according to a new study quoted by Russian media. It concludes that cryptocurrencies are not a threat to Russia’s financial stability.\nCrypto volatility can affect the Russian economy much like the depreciation of the ruble, which leads to revaluation of the debt denominated in foreign currency, increased cost of borrowing, inflation expectations, and counterparty risks. The authors have calculated that crypto market fluctuations can increase the interest rate on domestic borrowings by about 1%, but that’s only if the share of virtual currencies in the structure of corporate debt reaches 4 trillion rubles, or at least 6% of the total.\nAccording to the Russian Analytical Credit Rating Agency (ACRA), the high volatility of cryptocurrencies can potentially create risks for the country’s financial stability, but these are balanced by the high concentration of ownership of the digital assets. ACRA estimates that the market value of the cryptocurrency attributable to the Russian economy or controlled by Russian residents has been between $7.5 and 14 billion in the first quarter of 2018. That’s only 1-2% of the M2 money supply in Russia. The global ratio is even lower at 0.5%. Comparison between the M2 money supply by countries and the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies, in trillion USD (Coin Dance, IMF, 2017)\nThe study is based on statistics measuring the Russian share of the global economy and money supply, as well as data about the structure of the turnover registered on crypto exchanges. The researchers note that it is still quite difficult to accurately estimate the share of cryptocurrencies against the money supply in the country, as the assessment is limited by the opacity of the cryptocurrency markets, the anonymity of crypto users and the use of cryptocurrency in cross-border settlements.\nThe authors point out that a number of factors can influence the volume of cryptocurrency owned by the residents of a given country. These include the level of development of financial markets and venture investing, the central bank’s policies, the stability of the national fiat currency, the inflation dynamics, and the rigidity of government regulations. They believe that the increase of market capitalization of cryptocurrencies, their acceptance as unit of account, the introduction of liberal regulations for ICOs and crypto payments can stimulate growth in the sector. Consumption Not Affected by Crypto Fluctuations\nThe experts at ACRA see very little chance of crypto volatility affecting consumption in Russia. They claim consumption will decrease only by about 1% if cryptocurrency price shocks cause a 6% drop in the volume of liquid savings. In current prices, this corresponds to approximately 1.5 trillion rubles. “However, due to the huge distortion in the distribution of crypto assets, their volatility is not reflected in consumer spending,” notes the report, quoted by Kommersant .\nThe analysts also say that if the use of cryptocurrency increases in Russia, the Central Bank can employ the same monetary policy instruments it currently applies in regards to foreign currencies. In case crypto markets remain opaque, digital currencies can be treated like foreign cash, and if the bank is successful in tracing crypto transactions, digital coins can be regarded as electronic foreign currency funds.\nThe Central Bank of Russia has previously opposed the legalization of cryptocurrencies as legal tender and unit of account. The legislation currently under review in Russia’s parliament can change that to a certain extent. It has been reported that some texts allow the use of tokens and coins in settlements, although, unlike the ruble, cryptos will not be considered a mandatory means of payment in the country.\nOf the three drafts approved on first reading by the State Duma, the bill “On Digital Rights” deals with crypto payments. The other two, “On Digital Financial Assets” and “On Attracting Investments Using Investment Platforms”, aim to regulate initial coin offerings (ICOs), crypto mining and taxation.

Episode 5 explained | Source: Netflix\nThe episode tags Bitcoin as ‘the beautiful anonymity of cash’, it explains how cryptocurrencies came into existence and what made Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies so popular. People like Jackson Palmer, inventor of Dogecoin have made an appearance in this episode. Palmer stated states how Dogecoin is now worth half a billion dollars in market cap. The episode also explains how ‘Diners Club’ being the first-ever credit card was a part of the ‘digital currency revolution’.\nAndy Bromberg, CEO of CoinList stated about cryptocurrency in the episode:\n”For the time, you have a distrubuted network to come to consensus about wat transction happened on the network. This allows for a trustless ledger where there isn’t a single central party maintaining it, but rather a network of people maintaining it. That’s an incredibly powerful concept.”\nIt also explains how 1000s of unknown people gained popularity and became rich with just investing in cryptocurrencies and treating it like the stock market.\nChristian Slater is the narrator for this episode of explained. He is an American actor and a producer. He has also been a narrator for the segment “There’s an Alligator Under My Bed”.\nNetflix also has an exclusive documentary called ‘Banking on Bitcoin’, which features interviews with enthusiasts and experts.\nJean Labourier, a musician/Record producer and a Twitter user commented:\n“@ ChristianSlater aka Mr Robot narrating a new Netflix episode on cryptocurrency is awesome.”\nT•GO, a Twitter user commented:\n“So I just watched that new Netflix episode about cryptocurrency and realized I’ve been sitting on a small pile of dogecoin that’s apparently worth something now, like a whole $5 wowzers.”\nSELIN, another Twitter user commented:\n“I came across an episode on #", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "palmer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackson palmer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy bromberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "netflix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vox", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "dogecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T09:42:18.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f3637bda1a58d5cd0bcfd105175a60dad51ccb76", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmej00v2NwoV4e_afaY6Hl9o-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=8.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Trading Discussion", "title": "Which one is a better investment Bitcoin Or Ethereum,", "title_full": "Which one is a better investment Bitcoin Or Ethereum,", "published": "2018-06-08T07:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.024, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f3637bda1a58d5cd0bcfd105175a60dad51ccb76", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmej00v2NwoV4e_afaY6Hl9o-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "simpleholmes", "published": "2018-06-08T07:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Which one is a better investment Bitcoin Or Ethereum,", "text": "if you are looking for a long term investment you should always search for projects that try to solve some kind of problems that are widely understood and if they have the working product.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T10:49:50.040+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d25e2e9b333f344f7f6b1ce502c34cf9c6738130", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1q26x5.b9qwhwmNvvW_oVZ.", "site_full": "nigeria.shafaqna.com", "site": "shafaqna.com", "site_section": "http://nigeria.shafaqna.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nigeria News (News Reader) |", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Eyeing Upside Break", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Eyeing Upside Break", "published": "2018-06-08T07:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5727, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d25e2e9b333f344f7f6b1ce502c34cf9c6738130", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1q26x5.b9qwhwmNvvW_oVZ.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-08T07:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Eyeing Upside Break", "text": "14 hours ago Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Eyeing Upside Break Key Points Bitcoin cash price is currently facing a strong resistance near $1,160 against the US Dollar.

Ashton Kutcher\nIt turns out that Ashton Kutcher is much more than a pretty face – in fact, he’s quite the tech investor! With previous investments in Skype, Spotify, Airbnb, Foursquare and Uber, it wasn’t too much of a surprise to those in-the-know that he went on to invest in BitPay. This was all made possible through Kutcher’s venture capital firm A-Grade Investments , though his interest has gone beyond just investing. He’d also gone on to speak at the TechCrunch Disrupt NY, asking the important, widely debated question around blockchain of “What can that decentralised technology really do?” Mike Tyson\nWhile Mike Tyson isn’t exactly known for a ‘clean’ record, his interest in Bitcoin thankfully isn’t bringing up questions about its legitimacy – something that could ultimately affect the Bitcoin price . Instead, people are listening, and with his new company Mike Tyson Bitcoin, he has gone on to offer a Bitcoin ATM and a wallet for storing and trading it. Whether this app will take off is another story entirely, but the support could benefit the currency regardless. Roseanne Barr\nKnown for her controversial and on-the-nose political comments, it was only a matter of time before Roseanne Barr spoke up about Bitcoin. While she hasn’t quite put her money into this cryptocurrency, a tweet stated ‘hey, all: let’s really understand #bitcoin it might be better than removing the federal reserve, and faster way 2 end satanic ritual rule’ – a dig at the government? Probably, but it also brought more public attention to a coin that was still very much rising at the time. Donald Glover\nAnother celebrity to back it and everything they have to offer is rapper Childish Gambino, also known by his real name Donald Glover. With appearances in Community , Atlanta and, of course, the new spin-off Star Wars film by the name of Solo , he has built quite the following and so his backing of the cryptocurrency could have quite the effect on Bitcoin popularity. He even claimed that cryptocurrency use “makes more sense”. Mel B\nWe all know Mel B from her time as ‘scary spice’ as part of the Spice Girls, but since her time dancing in platform boots and crop tops, she’s taken on a whole host of jobs including X Factor Judge and, you guessed it, Bitcoin backer! She was actually the first artist to start accepting payments for her music after a partnership with London-based business CloudHashing . This business allows users to mine bitcoins as part of their service, but it’s the ability to purchase music that truly opened up its use to the public – at least where her album was concerned.\nBitcoin still has a way to go before we can truly claim that it’s reached global adoption and the question of whether that will ever happen is still a hot topic in the industry.\nHowever, with celebrities starting to pick up on the trend, we could be seeing more and more of the public following in their footsteps.

There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,160 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might dip a few points, but the overall bias is positive above the $1,100 support level.\nBitcoin cash price remains in an uptrend above $1,100 against the US Dollar. BCH\\/USD has to move past $1,160 and $1,180 to gain upside momentum. Bitcoin Cash Price Resistance\nThere were mostly ranging moves above the $1,100 support area in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price traded towards the $1,170 level, but it failed to move further higher. A high was formed near $1,168 before the price started a downside correction. At the moment, it seems like there is a strong resistance area forming near $1,160, which may act as a pivot zone.\nA downward correction is underway, and the price recently broke the 23.6% fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,048 low to $1,168 high. However, the decline is finding bids near the $1,130 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Further below the 100 hourly SMA, there is a key support around the $1,100 level. Moreover, the 50% fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,048 low to $1,168 high is also around the stated support. On the upside, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,160 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair.\nLooking at the chart , the pair has to settle above the $1,160 resistance area to gain upside momentum. The next hurdles above $1,160 are seen near $1,180 and $1,200.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD \\u2013 The MACD for BCH\\/USD is slowly moving in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \\u2013 The RSI for BCH\\/USD is currently just above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level \\u2013 $1,100\nMajor Resistance Level \\u2013 $1,160\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH\\/USD Eyeing Upside Break appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T15:26:36.019+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 31608, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=600", "requestsLeft": 656}
