This cause to maximize the capital of Bitcoin. But how long Bitcoin will survive in this industry ? Because lot's of government try to manipulate and control the crypto currency industry via introducing new regulation. As a country some one can do vast harm to bitcoin. We saw some of in past. If Bitcoin fail in this industry it will be a biggest financial crisis in this century.\nHi there sujeewacrypto! How long? It will last forever. You are reading it right. Forever. Just like the gold which is use as a currency in the late BC. Romans then issue a gold coins, which is up until today is present. What even good about it is the current value of those coins is way much more higher than those early days. So if bitcoin follow those phenomenon, I bet bitcoin will last forever and even increase its value as time pass by.

But the future is now, and that means the phrase \"wine-backed cryptocurrency\" exists in reality.\nOpenVino is a new project from winemaker Mike Barrow of Costaflores Organic Vineyard in Mendoza that lets you buy the winery's Mike Tango Bravo 2018 red blend with MTB18 tokens—that would be the digital \"cryptocurrency\"—during its \"ICO\" (\"initial coin offering\") through May 20. For now, each token equals a little less than 5 bucks, which equals one bottle, but starting in July, the tokens can be traded, bitcoin-style, on crypto exchanges; however you acquire your wine-computer-coin, you can ultimately cash in three years from now once the wine is finished.\nIt's the latest of the technologies Barrow has implemented that sound more like TED-talk than wine-speak (\"blockchain,\" \"biodigital certification\"). Barrow told Unfiltered OpenVino was inspired by wine-biz problems like accurately determining a correct price for wines, and communicating the viticultural process to customers.\nTo the latter issue, Barrow has installed sensors, cameras and labor-tracking tools in the vineyard and winery (\"Internet of Vines\") his customers can access. “It is open-source, because anyone can reutilize, copy, comment upon, or criticize our practices in the vineyard, in the [winery] and in the business,” Barrow said. After 2nd-Place Finish at Derby, Vintner Barbara Banke's Horse Good Magic Saddles Up for Preakness\nJackson Family Wines chairman Barbara Banke 's thoroughbred Good Magic made a big splash at Churchill Downs earlier this month, finishing second in the Kentucky Derby. (To be fair, all 20 horses made a big splash, as the nearly 3 inches of rain recorded in Louisville, Ky., May 5 was a Derby Day record.) \"Our horse ran really well,\" Banke told Unfiltered in a follow-up chat this week. \"He did alright in the slop, which is good, because it could be equally as sloppy for the [Preakness]!\" Courtesy of Jackson Family Wines Barbara Banke (right) and daughter Julia Jackson are in the running for Hat of the Year.\n\"It was a tough race, with lots of good horses. It's tough to run a mile and a quarter with all those competitors—a 20-horse field,\" Banke said. \"Good Magic bounced back with very good energy, ate up all his food, he's doing all the things you like to see them do when they come out of a race well.\" And because of that, last year's Champion 2-Year-Old is headed to Baltimore, where he'll be running in the Preakness Stakes this weekend at Pimlico Race Course. Unfiltered readers will know that Good Magic was sired by Curlin , the two-time Horse of the Year that won the Preakness in 2007 . \"The track seems made for him, because Good Magic—actually more than Curlin—is a horse that can corner well, and the turns are a little tighter at Pimlico than they are at Churchill Downs, so you've got to be a fairly handy horse to make it around, and he is.\"\nBanke's Stonestreet Stables team is hoping to have more Kendall-Jackson Vintners Reserve Chardonnay and Stonestreet Estate Vineyards Cabernet on hand Saturday, but she'll be prepared for anything. \"Sometimes we end up drinking Maryland wines … You need something to go with crab cakes, so I'm sure it's going to be Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc for us.\" Together at Last: Cam and John Jordan Make Perfect Pairing\nWhen the NFL's New Orleans Saints beat the Carolina Panthers in the playoffs back in January, All-Pro defensive end Cameron Jordan sent a special parting gift to Panthers QB Cam Newton : A bottle of Jordan Cabernet Sauvignon Alexander Valley 2013 . Jordan winery owner and football fan John Jordan caught wind of the epic wine trolling dished out by the gridiron-based Jordan and invited the Saint out to Sonoma for a visit. Football Jordan still hasn't made it to Sonoma to visit Wine Jordan, but last week the two finally met (and compared wine-tasting notes) in New Orleans. Lisa Mattson / Jordan Winery Wine-country fashion and draft-day finest turn out to be remarkably similar; Cam (left) and John Jordan.\nOn Friday night, John Jordan hosted a reception and Jordan wine-pairing dinner at Restaurant R'evolution in the French Quarter's Royal Sonesta Hotel, where attendees were wowed by two very special guests of honor: an 18-liter Melchior of 2013 Jordan Cabernet, and the 6' 4\", 287-pound Cameron Jordan. In between signing autographs and entertaining the crowd, the two Jordans discovered they have a lot more than just football, wine and a surname in common. John has his pilot's license, and Cameron has logged more than 20 hours in the cockpit; both also love to fish.\nThe NFL star confirmed to Unfiltered that Jordan Cabernet is his favorite wine, just ahead of Caymus Special Selection and Trefethen HaLo, and gave us his exclusive notes on the night's wines: \"I enjoy smooth reds … The 2013 Jordan Cabernet out of Melchior was great, but my favorite wine of the night was the 2003 Jordan, which reminded me of my favorite Jordan vintage, the 2011. I discovered that I like the more Old World–style vintages.”\n“It was the perfect evening,\" John told Unfiltered. \"Got to talk football and fishing in the Gulf with my new friend Cam Jordan while enjoying some of the best food in New Orleans. What more can a man ask for?”\nChampagne Drappier's bottles are so nice, they want you to enjoy them twice. The sustainability-focused Champagne house recently launched a gift set featuring a bottle of Drappier, paired with a onetime bottle that's been upcycled into a candle. Courtesy of Drappier Liberté, egalité, sustainabilité!\nTo make the candles, empties are hand-cut and polished, then filled with soy wax, and a message from Charline Drappier is emblazoned on the also-recycled gift box. \"Drappier is the first [Champagne] house committed to a net zero-carbon footprint, and has a global vision of organic agriculture [and] sustainability,\" she told Unfiltered. \"Recycling is a natural part of our approach.\"\n'Tis the season for #RoséAllDay, and Wine Spectator Best of Award of Excellence winner City Winery New York has a new limited-edition pink charity wine on the market, in honor of National Foster Care Awareness Month. The New York Foundling Rosé with purpose.\nOn sale now through the end of May, the We Are IntertWined cuvée is a 2017 rosé of Syrah from California's North Coast, made in partnership with New York Foundling, a non-profit child-welfare agency. The We Are IntertWined 2017 rosé retails for $20 and 25 percent of sales will be donated to the Foundling.\nEnjoy Unfiltered?

I bought into the same mentality for a long time, but I'm changing my tune. In almost every industry, first generation leaders are replaced by competition. From Sears, Kmart, Nokia, Motorola, Yahoo, MySpace, etc. Although Bitcoin is the current crypto reserve currency, I think that its dominance is threatened by ALT coins with faster, cheaper transactions and greater scalability. What do you think? Is it smart to hold Bitcoin as a long-term investment, or are there better choices among the ALT coins like Ethereum or Litecoin?\nBitcoin is best for long term investment because Btc is less risky then other altcoins and the prices of Btc are also high, \"Invest more earn more\".\nBitcoin is the best long term holds if the people hold it for long time and it is not a long term if people do not hold for long time and hold the coin for a little time. The short term will give you less profit while the long term will give you huge profit. If Bitcoin used as a long term then the future profit will be huge and investor will get huge returns of his investment. So it is better to hold Bitcoin than the other cryptocurrencies for investments.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T03:18:07.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "590a8bb43064396e792d80d29209c09dd5d56427", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8v3BmVd24meuL1ei1Bo_4WHKzlXz9k4z80F4HFpY3YmZqwi3TWGDa.Xf22JtHgjHqic2k9nbIZETB9ocUfsMCfDvPOY0xc8_ilYooNB9VYsT7l8t44cDNe", "site_full": "www.businessinsider.com", "site": "businessinsider.com", "site_section": "http://www.businessinsider.in/rss_tag_section_feeds.cms?query=sai", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Business Insider India", "title": "Here's what you need to know about Zcash, a privacy-focused bitcoin competitor that just got a major boost", "title_full": "Here's what you need to know about Zcash, a privacy-focused bitcoin competitor that just got a major boost", "published": "2018-05-18T02:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/64212168/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-zcash-a-privacy-focused-bitcoin-competitor-that-just-got-a-major-boost.jpg?1057852", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 283, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 111, "comments": 0, "shares": 111}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "590a8bb43064396e792d80d29209c09dd5d56427", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8v3BmVd24meuL1ei1Bo_4WHKzlXz9k4z80F4HFpY3YmZqwi3TWGDa.Xf22JtHgjHqic2k9nbIZETB9ocUfsMCfDvPOY0xc8_ilYooNB9VYsT7l8t44cDNe", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-18T02:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Here's what you need to know about Zcash, a privacy-focused bitcoin competitor that just got a major boost", "text": "Here's what you need to know about Zcash, a privacy-focused bitcoin competitor that just got a major boost Becky Peterson May 17, 2018, 11.52 PM Sort By: Be the first one to comment.

Frederick M. Brown / Getty Images John Houck The founder of Draper Fisher Jurvetson predicts bitcoin's price to hit $250,000 by 2022.\nKeeping money in the bank could be a risk, according to billionaire Tim Draper . With banks “being hacked all the time,” the venture capitalist is slowly moving more and more money into bitcoin.\nDraper made his billions by investing in startups like Hotmail, Skype, and Tesla. Now, he is betting on cryptocurrencies , predicting virtual currency will be “the biggest change in the history of the world.”\n“I see [this shift] happening faster than anybody ever imagined,” Draper told Fox Business . “I think within four years, around 2022, bitcoin is going to hit $250,000.”\nAs the public becomes more aware of bitcoin and its potential for gain, a demand for a decentralized global currency will grow. He suggests everybody, even investors with little money, should be buying cryptocurrency.\n“I think it’s probably worth it to just take a small amount of money, something you can lose and just go and try because all of sudden you will start to see the future and see that this is where it’s going.”\nPer Bitcoinist, Draper told hosts on CNBC’s Closing Bell last week that traditional banking is consistently at risk from hackers. He prefers the security of bitcoin .\n“Right now, your banks are being attacked all the time. The hackers are poking holes in your banks and going after your fiat money, and the bankers are pounding away trying to keep the hacks away, but they’re getting hacked all the time. No one has ever hacked the bitcoin blockchain. It is the most secure place to put your money.”\nDraper also explained the substantial risk of government-issued currency. Citing the recent economic turmoil experienced in countries like Venezuela and Nigeria, Draper warned investors are likely to lose fortunes buying into those economies. However, by diversifying and putting some money into cryptocurrency, the risk is reduced.\nDraper expects technology will make traditional money obsolete within five years and governments will be using blockchain to perform most services within 10 years. He also points out that the fluctuations of politics do not influence bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Ali to ako sam ja sve to sam zaradio dobio preko airdropa? Istina, na taj način nisam dobio puno ali sam kasnije svojom sposobnoću trgovanja zaradio puno vie i onda to pretvorio u fiat te prebacio na devizni račun. Airdrop se ne moe smatrati drugim dohotkom jer nisam nita radio da bi dobio te coine/tokene (kao to je slučaj kod rudarenja ili raznih signature, Facebook, Twitter i sličnih kampanja) tako da mi ne mogu lupiti porez na drugi dohodak. S druge strane, nemam nikakav \"ulaz\" novca (mislim na kupnju neke kripto valute za fiat) da bi tu zaradu prikazao kao kaptialnu dobit.\nBit će zanimljivo vidjeti kako će se Porezna postaviti prema airdropovima. Moe se smatrati i donacijom, i dividendom, i drugim dohotkom - naime za drugi dohodak nije nuno da je riječ o tome da si neto radio pa zaradio, to je kategorija u koju mogu utrpati sve to ne spada u neto drugo.\nKako bilo da bilo, neki dan sam pogledao svoju ETH adresu u ethploreru. Vidim neki VIN i neki IMT za koje nikad nisam čuo. Ako Porezna misli da znam kad sam to dobio, i da je realno očekivati da će ljudi pratiti tokene po svim svojim ETH adresama i prijavljivati dohodak... postići će da im nitko nita ne prijavljuje da slučajno ne otkrije svoje ETH adrese i time ne plati ni porez na npr. rudarenje ili kapitalnu dobit koji bi inače htio platiti.\nPuno tu jo ima nejasnoća i nedoumica, no situacija je puno bolja nego prije 4-5 godina kada sam ja prvi put prijavljivao porez na zaradu na Internetu (tada jo ne od bitcoina).\nU poreznoj su se bili nali u čudu jer čak nisu imali ni posebnu kategoriju za internetsku zaradu, ni ifru u joopd ifrarniku, nita... potpuna nepoznanica.\nUopće nisu znali kako bi trebalo ispuniti joppd obrazac da bi to uopće prolo kroz sustav e porezne i bilo prihvaćeno.\nNa kraju su mi rekli da uzmem ifru koja se koristi za autorski honorar, samo da prijava nekako prođe u sustavu.\nSada već porezna daje prve sluben upute o prijavi zarade na bitcoinu, crypto valutama i to je zaista ogroman napredak u odnosu na ono to sam ja morao prolaziti\nDa, mnoge stvari su jo nedorečene ali i to će se s vremenom rjeavati, kako sve vie ljudi bude prijavljivalo zaradu po crypto valutama, i porezna neće imati izbora već da kroz vlastitu praksu dođe do opće prihvatljivog rjeenja za sve.\nBitno je da kada dođete u svoj lokalni ured porezne, svom poreznom referentu, ne odustajete i traite pojanjenja kako ispuniti joopd obrazac.\nAko ne zna on, traite da pita voditelja.\nAko ne zna voditelj, traite da pitaju dalje...\nSamo na taj način ćete prisiliti poreznu da pronađe rjeenje i da to postane općeprihvaćeni standard, koji će sve primjenjivati.\nI ne zaboravite svaki puta, kada dobijete neto slubeno od porezne, to objaviti ovdje\nTako ćete svima pomoći.\nVrati se u poreznu odakle si i izaa.\nMoja je osobna stvar gdje ću ''ulaziti'' ili ''izlaziti'' i da li ću i za to prijavljivati porez, kao to si i ti slobodan da ne prijavljuje porez i ne ide u poreznu.\nivimo u demokraciji i svatko je slobodan činiti i raditi to eli, u skladu sa svojom savjeću i odgovornosti.\nNema potrebe za vrijeđanjem.\nOva je tema za one koji ele platiti

that future just so happens to include shocking levels of energy consumption increasing at a jaw dropping rate.\nSo claims a new study published yesterday in Joule which, unfortunately for all the hodlers out there, paints a pretty dire picture. Specifically, one painted in ash. It says that by the end of this year Bitcoin electricity use could triple, approaching the consumption rates of the entire country of Austria.\nSEE ALSO: A Bitcoin mining company organized a fake protest at a major New York blockchain conference\nWhich, yeah. That's not good. The conclusion of the peer-reviewed paper, written by Alex de Vries, is brutal.\n\"These methods tell us that the Bitcoin network consumes at least 2.55 GW of electricity currently, and that it could reach a consumption of 7.67 GW in the future, making it comparable with countries such as Ireland (3.1 GW) and Austria (8.2 GW),\" he writes.\nAnd just in case you were thinking that, well, using only as much electricity as Ireland isn't too bad, Vries drops another hammer.\n\"Additionally, economic models tell us that Bitcoin's electricity consumption will gravitate toward the latter figure,\" he notes — with latter in this case being the 8.2 GW. \"A look at Bitcoin miner production estimates suggests that this figure could already be reached in 2018.\"\nThis is not the first time we've heard wild claims about Bitcoin's energy consumption . After all, it takes a lot of power to run all those mining rigs. However, Joule is a peer-reviewed publication, which adds weight to Vries's study.\nImportantly, it's not like things are great at this moment either. According to Vries, \"[the] Bitcoin network can be estimated to consume at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently.\"\nBut not everyone buys the doom and gloom. Will Martino, founder of the distributed digital ledger company Kadena , told Mashable that while Vries's estimates of present Bitcoin electricity consumption look \"at least somewhat accurate,\" and that \"it's out of control,\" he imagines a future that has addressed many of these issues.\n“Over time these things will stabilize,\" explained Martino. \"I doubt it is going to keep going at that rate.\"\nHe went on to add while we should expect Bitcoin energy use to continue to increase in the short term, over the next decade it should eventually come back down.\n\"[It's an] artifact of the stage that we’re at in crypto,” he noted. “[The] longer term is less of a concern because we’ll have greener energy in general.”\nIn other words, there's still hope that our distributed blockchain-enabled future won't be a pollution-filled one. And anyway, even if the optimists are wrong, there's always a survivalist bunker or two that the crypto super rich can hide out in.\nWATCH: This space heater mines bitcoin while keeping your house warm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://kadena.io/", "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/doomsday-prep-for-the-super-rich", "https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(18)30177-6"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T21:19:42.040+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4d75ffe62a8210367c75cb0cf92100d8bfbf4a8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZSR4lkStkTUfC724AW6BKjYSzCCZ60YXBL_SQ8VAIP4aqYua3pEox7_", "site_full": "www.merkle.press", "site": "merkle.press", "site_section": "https://www.merkle.press/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Merkle News", "title": "Bitcoin Price Too Volatile for Merchants, Claims PayPal CFO", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Too Volatile for Merchants, Claims PayPal CFO", "published": "2018-05-18T01:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4d75ffe62a8210367c75cb0cf92100d8bfbf4a8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZSR4lkStkTUfC724AW6BKjYSzCCZ60YXBL_SQ8VAIP4aqYua3pEox7_", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Satoshi (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-18T01:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Too Volatile for Merchants, Claims PayPal CFO", "text": "Advertisement Join our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nThe bitcoin price is too volatile to make it a useful payment tool for merchants, PayPal CFO John Rainey claimed in a recent interview.\nBitcoin Price Too Volatile for Merchants Rainey made this claim during a recent episode of “Mad Money,” explaining that merchant margins are too thin to make bitcoin a viable payment medium.\nYou have a “10 percent margin on a product that you sell and you accept bitcoin, for example, and the very next day it moves 15 percent, you’re now underwater on that transaction,” he said.\nAdmittedly, itcoin and cryptocurrency prices are a lot more volatile than their fiat counterparts. A 1% or 2% swing in forex is considered a major move, whereas a 15% bitcoin price movement is not extraordinary, although it has swung upwards just as quickly in recent years.\nRainey did go on to suggest that if merchant demand increased in the future, they would look at their bitcoin policy again.\nWhen talking about the possibility of accepting crypto in the future, Rainey went on to say:\n“You could have something that appeals to consumers, but if merchants don’t accept it, it’s of little value. Right now, we don’t see a lot of interest from our merchants. But if it’s something that stabilizes in the future and is a better currency, then we’ll certainly support that.”\nPayPal’s Cryptocurrency Plans PayPal CEO John Rainey says the bitcoin price is too volatile for merchants, but the company has won a patent for a cryptocurrency payment system. Despite Rainey’s comments, an increasing number of companies accept bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a payment method, primarily through third-party payment processors that convert the funds to local fiat currency at the point of sale to shelter merchants from price volatility.\nOverstock was the first major retailer to accept crypto, and it continues to do so today. Expedia enables users to pay for hotels and holidays with bitcoin, and some Subway locations also accept the largest cryptocurrency. Many smaller stores accept bitcoin, as well, and the number of outlets, both digital and real-world, accepting additional cryptocurrencies like litecoin and ethereum also continues to grow.\nSome PayPal founders and executives haven’t pulled their punches when talking about Bitcoin in the past. Founding CEO Bill Harris described Bitcoin as “the greatest scam in history” before claiming that it cost valuable natural resources, that almost nobody accepts it as a payment method, and that it has no intrinsic worth — arguments that the Bitcoin community have had to field for many years now.\nDespite the bearish outlook of some executives, the online payment processor filed a patent in March this year for a system that would enable cryptocurrency users to swap private keys off-chain, rather than having to send coins over the network. The company is clearly keeping a keen eye on the sector, as it develops.\nImages from Shutterstock\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john rainey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rainey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin price too volatile for merchants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paypal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T03:50:25.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bad76a942f10b2fdc4991ec2365cacf4f7ba9556", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZGmEuD_g8EcHxAofYbK9cBR2FjoqNuCzgy0K1XgdPAWVC.pU6I0rJI6XRVm.1UEYm7vIfXoWV_eRu_QjhEhcQn", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Jason Elliott: \"Would be great if Fiver incorporated Bitcoin Cash -- both for payments and withdrawals.

There was a post earlier here in r/bitcoin about Climb real estate and there was a sign underneath it saying that they accept bitcoin. Now most of us might be like, oh yeah right, probably they are not serious, and to be honest this is what I thought too!\nSo I have decided to contact them via chat , and right away they said that they will only accept US dollars. Was kinda disappointed at that point, but I thought it might be a robot who I was talking, so I decided to try via email.\nThey have responded to my email pretty fast, and they confirmed that they indeed accept BTC for payment.\nI asked about the following:\n- I'm curious of the procedure of a purchase in bitcoin. Could you please let me know in detail how it works?\n- It's very easy. I process up to $10M in Bitcoin into escrow account and close deals 7-10 days after. The process is like this. You choose a house that you like and want. I process your Bitcoin through BitPay by invoice within 24 hrs. That money goes directly into escrow account and we close 7-10 days after. And after that you are the owner of a beautiful home.\nNow some of you may think that this is not that big of a news, but let me tell you that it defiantly is a big news.\nA real estate agent accepting a cryptocurrency is the best thing that can ever happen to crypto.\nLets hope that this is one out of many that will (hopefully) follow.\nI'm currently not in a position to look for a house/property, but I know, that within the next few years, I will be, and my goal is to be able to buy my first house fully out of crypto.\nThank you for Climb real estate for helping adoption!\nsubmitted by /u/busa1\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T01:47:56.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b26fab97c1c76a356bfca48671b8b7ea9c7345e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS_7zgJLo.SVbrHiBI__Cyz6yVTZXYVd9DfdVeSi.i0nxFtNDAtfkNxeQz19wPQqWcRhN8pTE6Ghn2jndzg64y_OsrGiQvMCxwzVxqN_TYN75a_8PgEEoRIZiB_ouSd61LPW.vtBycCRQ--", "site_full": "22ticks.com", "site": "22ticks.com", "site_section": "https://22ticks.com/feed", "site_categories": ["mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "22TICKS LIFESTYLE BLOG", "title": "Bitcoin Breaks Resistance Line! – Cryptocurrency Market Hovers Around $460 Bil – Altcoin News", "title_full": "Bitcoin Breaks Resistance Line! – Cryptocurrency Market Hovers Around $460 Bil – Altcoin News", "published": "2018-05-18T01:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://22ticks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fXHzqi.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b26fab97c1c76a356bfca48671b8b7ea9c7345e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS_7zgJLo.SVbrHiBI__Cyz6yVTZXYVd9DfdVeSi.i0nxFtNDAtfkNxeQz19wPQqWcRhN8pTE6Ghn2jndzg64y_OsrGiQvMCxwzVxqN_TYN75a_8PgEEoRIZiB_ouSd61LPW.vtBycCRQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-18T01:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Breaks Resistance Line! – Cryptocurrency Market Hovers Around $460 Bil – Altcoin News", "text": "Bitcoin Breaks Resistance Line! – Cryptocurrency Market Hovers Around $460 Bil – Altcoin News\nThe price of Bitcoin is starting to recover as the Cryptocurrency market fluctuates.

There was a post earlier here in r/bitcoin about Climb real estate and there was a sign underneath it saying that they accept bitcoin. Now most of us might be like, oh yeah right, probably they are not serious, and to be honest this is what I thought too!\nSo I have decided to contact them via chat , and right away they said that they will only accept US dollars. Was kinda disappointed at that point, but I thought it might be a robot who I was talking, so I decided to try via email.\nThey have responded to my email pretty fast, and they confirmed that they indeed accept BTC for payment.\nI asked about the following:\n- I'm curious of the procedure of a purchase in bitcoin. Could you please let me know in detail how it works?\n- It's very easy. I process up to $10M in Bitcoin into escrow account and close deals 7-10 days after. The process is like this. You choose a house that you like and want. I process your Bitcoin through BitPay by invoice within 24 hrs. That money goes directly into escrow account and we close 7-10 days after. And after that you are the owner of a beautiful home.\nNow some of you may think that this is not that big of a news, but let me tell you that it defiantly is a big news.\nA real estate agent accepting a cryptocurrency is the best thing that can ever happen to crypto.\nLets hope that this is one out of many that will (hopefully) follow.\nI'm currently not in a position to look for a house/property, but I know, that within the next few years, I will be, and my goal is to be able to buy my first house fully out of crypto.\nThank you for Climb real estate for helping adoption!\nsubmitted by /u/busa1\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T01:43:40.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b45fc855a9045a1adce84b286da44e6256d7dde3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZSR4lkStkTUfMspWUnbE7TRWmhsQTYP.RN21PoUPFn4UR2LCl.yn6IP5kcbjdANGmo-", "site_full": "www.merkle.press", "site": "merkle.press", "site_section": "https://www.merkle.press/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Merkle News", "title": "Bitcoin Only Used for Money Laundering and Speculation: ‘Big Short’ Investor", "title_full": "Bitcoin Only Used for Money Laundering and Speculation: ‘Big Short’ Investor", "published": "2018-05-18T01:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b45fc855a9045a1adce84b286da44e6256d7dde3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZSR4lkStkTUfMspWUnbE7TRWmhsQTYP.RN21PoUPFn4UR2LCl.yn6IP5kcbjdANGmo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Satoshi (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-18T01:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Only Used for Money Laundering and Speculation: ‘Big Short’ Investor", "text": "Advertisement Join our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nWall Street veteran Steve Eisman rose to fame by shorting the sub-prime mortgage market ahead of last decade’s financial crisis. Now, he’s similarly-bearish on a new asset class: cryptocurrency.\nEisman, whose career is chronicled in The Big Short , told CNBC that he has yet to meet anyone who can persuasively argue that cryptocurrencies have social utility.\nHe said:\n“I’m not an expert on cryptocurrency, but I have my doubts about it. My doubts center on the fact that, ‘What’s the social utility of cryptocurrency?’ I’m not talking about blockchain. The technology, I think, has real value. But currency markets are the most liquid, most efficient markets, probably of any markets that exist.”\nWhile conceding that there are a few exceptions to this rule — Venezuela, for instance — the Neuberger Berman portfolio manager argued that in developed countries the only use cases for cryptocurrency are speculative investing and money laundering.\n“I think the social utility, at least in developed countries, is extremely small. The only thing I can really figure out the usage of it is that it’s good for speculation, and it’s good for money laundering.\nThe interview marked the second time in this week alone that Eisman had bashed bitcoin. As CCN reported, he said at an industry convention in Hong Kong that he believes the asset class has no legitimate purpose and that he won’t touch it.\nEven so, Eisman reiterated that he has no plans to make bitcoin his next “big short,” both because he does not specialize in currency trading and because he does not believe it is possible to assign bitcoin a fair market value.\n“It’s like arguing how many angels can dance on the head of a pin,” he said. “I have no idea how to value it, and I don’t think anybody else does either.”\nFeatured Image from YouTube\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve eisman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eisman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neuberger berman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T01:47:02.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e5b0383ad8796f7450f800c20ba7054fda5e1654", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_PiFE8RGgjV3hFh7FYoz6UlT2KQyCJ3aSpzoDs0hh5UDOKZEbXBfQTpOUGOU8Nm8sDQBCwdsjFng--", "site_full": "www.ibtimes.com.au", "site": "ibtimes.com.au", "site_section": "http://www.ibtimes.com.au/rss", "site_categories": ["travel", "australia_and_new_zealand"], "section_title": "International Business Times AU", "title": "What is the real value of a bitcoin?", "title_full": "What is the real value of a bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-18T01:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdnau.ibtimes.com/sites/au.ibtimes.com/files/styles/large/public/2018/04/18/bitcoin.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 50793, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e5b0383ad8796f7450f800c20ba7054fda5e1654", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_PiFE8RGgjV3hFh7FYoz6UlT2KQyCJ3aSpzoDs0hh5UDOKZEbXBfQTpOUGOU8Nm8sDQBCwdsjFng--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-18T01:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "What is the real value of a bitcoin?", "text": "0 A bitcoin logo is seen at a facility of the Youth and Sports Ministry in Caracas, Venezuela. REUTERS/Marco Bello\nOne of the hot questions regarding the bitcoin since the first ones were created in January 2009 is its real value. According to Warren Buffett, the most influential investor in the world, the answer to this question would be: not much .\nWe will try as well to answer to this question using two concepts in economics and finance: minimal (or residual) value and Ponzi schemes. The minimal value approach is a prudent approach. Under this approach we would like to know what value remains when everything goes wrong as in cases of market disruption or economic crisis.\nValue as a currency or value as an investment?\nBefore we try to value a bitcoin we would need to define it as a currency or as an investment. Its use as a means of payment with some merchants can lead us to see the bitcoin as a currency not tied to a country and without central bank.\nBitcoins are usually measured in terms of their exchange rate to the Japanese Yen and US dollar as these two currencies remain the main currencies for which bitcoins are exchanged .\nWe will now try to value bitcoins as a currency using the minimal-value approach.\nAll major currencies have a central bank that monitors the exchange rate of their currency respective to other currencies and mostly to the dollar. Contrary to most traded currencies, bitcoin does not have a central bank or an entity monitoring its exchange rate. Therefore, bitcoin exchange rate to the dollar or to the Japanese yen could theoretically go down to zero.\nAs some academics and practitioners would qualify it bitcoin cannot be considered as a currency but as an investment. In finance, we would measure an investment’s intrinsic value as the sum of future revenues it generates (with a discount to account for time ). Bitcoins do not generate any present or future revenues. Therefore, as an investment and using a minimal value approach bitcoins have a zero minimal value.\nIs the bitcoin the new gold?\nSome assets do not generate revenues, the best known unproductive asset being gold. Bitcoin has frequently been compared to gold given that it cannot be considered as a currency but like an investment that generates no revenues. Using our minimal-value approach, we can assume that gold has a minimal market value due to its industrial use . Indeed, the value as an industrial good of gold would become the minimal value even if it would have no value as a financial investment. Again, bitcoin at this stage does not have any industrial use and could not pretend to such minimal value.\nThat said, to avoid a totally biased view of the bitcoin, we could argue on one potential value for it as an investment – finance methods see a value in diversification. For asset managers with large investment portfolios, one value of bitcoin could therefore come from the fact that bitcoin is not fully correlated to financial markets.\nWarren Buffett, Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, in 2013. Fortune/Flickr , CC BY\nOr maybe a Ponzi scheme\nThen after all we have seen, why do bitcoins have a value on the market? As Warren Buffet puts it, “All you’re counting on is the next person is going to pay you more” . This answer corresponds to the definition of a Ponzi scheme.\nA Ponzi scheme can be defined as a dishonest investment scheme where older investors are paid by new entering investors. For the Ponzi scheme to work you need to have a continuous stream of new investors. In this type of system only one manager works at attracting new investors. In the case of bitcoin, the specificity relies on the fact that all owners become bitcoin managers in most cases without knowing it.\nPonzi schemes do not usually give solid grounds for an asset value. Again, assets valued through a Ponzi scheme end up having no value once the Ponzi scheme unravels or collapses. Ponzi schemes usually collapse in times of crisis, when it lacks new entrants or when people try to massively withdraw from it . If the bitcoin system proves to be a Ponzi scheme, the next economic downturn may soon unravel it and bring down bitcoin to its minimal value: not much.\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation .

Square started accepting Bitcoin in 2014, before nearly any other major credit card processing or payments platforms, and Dorsey has long been an outspoken advocate for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\nWhen @jack himself walked onstage to close out the Consensus conference in New York City, moderator Elizabeth Stark of Lightning Labs couldn't help but reference a famous crypto tweet about Jack Dorsey walking into a Bitcoin conference.\nJack Dorsey walking into the Bitcoin conference pic.twitter.com/ibQfgh3noa\n— Neeraj K. Agrawal (@NeerajKA) November 15, 2017\nDorsey touched on a host of different topics during his appearance: Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency landscape; the role both Square and Twitter might play in using and advancing blockchain technology; and why he thinks it's only a matter of time before we have a global digital currency. Here are some of the higlights.\nOn Square's decision to support Bitcoin in 2014 :\nDorsey: I didn't really understand the implications of it until three or four years ago when we had some Square engineers who wanted to build Bitcoin acceptance into our online store. I said yes, it took about three or four months, and they made it so any seller could accept Bitcoin without knowing they were taking Bitcoin at all.\nOn the backlash to supporting Bitcoin as a public company:\nDorsey: This was a pretty contentious move in the company. We have a lot of healthy skepticism in the company and a lot of people were skeptics of the technology. [Square] always takes the mindset that we can't wait for things to happen to us. If we want responsible, healthy uses of this technology that I believe is a fundamental shift in our world with so many positive outcomes, we need to make that happen.\nWe pushed through and it really tested us. Not just because we're a public company, but because there was more of a spotlight on us. There are a lot of unknowns, and we just ran toward them and tried to figure them out.\nRelated: Why Small Businesses Should Consider Bitcoin\nOn adding support to Square Cash in 2017:\nDorsey: With Square Cash Free at iTunes Store another opportunity came up back in January 2017. I saw all these conversations on Twitter about it, and the community was interesting. It felt like Usenet all over again.\nAt a hackathon that January I asked one of our engineers if we could work on Bitcoin, and the next day we committed to a goal to build a system where using my Cash card I could go across the street to Twitter HQ and buy a cappucino with a Bitcoin. We worked all week and started listening to other folks as well. We almost got there…we ran into a deployment issue and didn't actually hit the goal, but it felt electric. We decided to dedicate Mike [the engineer] to building Bitcoin within Square Cash.\"\nOn the inevitability of a global digital currency:\nDorsey: We want to continue to level the playing field and give people a chance to participate in the economy. I don't know whether it will be Bitcoin or something else, but I'm a huge fan and appreciate the technology and principles behind it.

Representation of the Ethereum virtual currency standing on the PC motherboard are seen in this illustration picture, February 3, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Files\nThe index was created and released by the China Center for Information Industry Development, part of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in Beijing. It evaluates the technological capability, usefulness of the application, and innovativeness of the project.\nBlockchain, the system powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet.\nEthereum, whose currency is called ether, garnered an overall score of 129.4. It has the become the foundation for many initial coin offerings, in which start-ups create their own digital currencies and sell them to investors to generate financing for their projects.\nBitcoin, founded nearly 10 years ago, had a rating of 88 and came in at No. 13.\nBlockchain projects Steem, Lisk, NEO and Komodo took second, third, fourth, and fifth place, respectively, with scores of 115.9, 104.8, 103.0 and 101.5.\nThe index, which has 28 blockchain projects with their corresponding cryptocurrencies, will be updated monthly.\nThe sector currently has more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies, with total market capitalization of nearly $380 billion, according to digital currency tracker coinmarketcap.com.\nBitcoin, the largest of the digital currencies, last traded at $8,153.39 BTC=BTSP on the BitStamp platform. Ethereum was down 1.4 percent at $689.62.\nChina in general sees blockchain technology as an active area of innovation and expects public blockchains and decentralized applications to become significant parts of the future economy. In the second half of last year, though, the Chinese government started to crack down on illegal initial coin offerings.\nChina was the most active filer of blockchain patent applications last year, according to data collated by Thomson Reuters’ Practical Law from the World Intellectual Property Organization database.

For example, in April 2018, cryptocurrency miners in South Korea were arrested for illicitly utilizing cheap electricity to produce cryptos. Chicken farm in South Korea\nIn South Korea, places such as chicken farms and factories in development restricted areas are provided with electricity at cheaper rates by the government to help struggling industries and support innovative technology-focused initiatives. The government is stricter with the usage of electricity in these areas and consistently monitors the inflow of energy into buildings, factories, farms, and houses near these specially approved districts.\nOn April 19, police in the Gyeong-ki province of South Korea, the second largest region behind Seoul, arrested operators of a mining center in Nam Yang city . An in-depth police investigation disclosed that five cryptocurrency miners, whose identities remain confidential as they are still in police custody, purposely rented out factories and chicken farms in the protected part of the city to receive electricity for substantially lower rates.\nBy disguising buildings as semi-conductor factories and several properties as chicken farms, the five individuals were able to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum with virtually no cost apart from the ASIC miners they acquired and installed. Image source: Northern Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency via Hani\nIn the Paju restricted development area, the five individuals rented out a 859 square meter building and applied to the government as a semi-conductor factory. For 8 months, the group utilized the space to mine cryptocurrencies with more than 1580 ASIC miners. In the later months of their illegal venture, the group recruited more than 40 individuals and rented out their ASIC miners to produce even more cryptocurrencies.\nThe group generated more than $300,000 by accepting ASIC miners from individuals within months but the actual sum of cryptocurrencies the group was able to produce throughout the 8-month period remains unclear.\nPreliminary investigations undertaken by the Gyeong-ki and Paju police has shown that the group produced at least 760 Ethereum, which is worth more than $500,000, and a large sum of Bitcoin. The local police is still investigating into the final sum of money the group generated throughout the past year. The police has also discovered that the group only paid 50 percent of the normal electricity rate and received significant discounts for renting out the farms and factories.\nCurrently South Korea has no laws or policies approved that can punish cryptocurrency miners in development restricted areas. Minor charges could be applied to the five individuals, for using the space intended to carry out other initiatives, but no major penalties can be imposed as of now. To prevent similar situations from occurring in the future, the local police has requested the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs to draft and approve laws that prohibit cryptocurrency miners from taking advantage of districts and areas with cheaper electricity rates. First mining ban in New York\nIn the US on March 18, local authorities in the state of New York requested a cryptocurrency mining facility to halt their mining initiative after residents of Plattsburg, a small lakeside town in upstate New York, filed an official complaint to the police for the excessive usage of low-cost electricity by local miners.\nThe city of Plattsburg did not impose a permanent ban on Bitcoin mining however. Instead, local authorities and residents released a moratorium which states that the city will not consider applications for commercial cryptocurrency mining for at least a year and a half. Bloomberg reported that the city can charge more than $1,000 per day if miners decide to use low-cost electricity of the city to mine. The authorities of Plattsburg said:\n“It is the purpose of this Local Law to facilitate the adoption of land use and zoning and/or municipal lighting department regulations to protect and enhance the City’s natural, historic, cultural and electrical resources.” Another cryptocurrency mining facility was confronted by local authorities and a telecommunication powerhouse T-Mobile on Feb. 15 after it was revealed that ASIC miners from a mining facility based in Brooklyn interfered with the 700 MHz band of T-Mobile. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said :\n“On November 30, 2017, in response to the complaint agents from the Enforcement Bureau’s New York Office confirmed by direction finding techniques that radio emissions in the 700 MHz band were emanating from your residence in Brooklyn, New York. When the interfering device was turned off the interference ceased. You identified the device as an Antminer s5 Bitcoin Miner. The device was generating spurious emissions on frequencies assigned to T-Mobile’s broadband network and causing harmful interference.”\nAt the time, the FCC gave the mining facility a 20-day notice to halt their operations and move elsewhere as the radio emissions released by the ASIC miners within the facility were negatively impacting local telecommunication networks. Not illegal\nBitcoin and cryptocurrency mining is legal in most countries, even in China which banned the trading of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum in Sep. 2017.\nCryptocurrency mining is legal in most regions because it is beneficial for electricity grid operators to provide excess energy that they can no longer supply to households and businesses. As such, although local governments have tried to ban cryptocurrency mining in the past as demonstrated in CNLedger’s report below, cryptocurrency mining remains unbanned in most countries. YiCai: Regulators are asking local departments to report the current status of bitcoin mining companies under administration, and “guide the mining firms to exit in an orderly manner” by taking various measures from the aspects of electricity, land, tax, environmental protection\n— cnLedger (@cnLedger) January 6, 2018\nIt is also not illegal to mine Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency using electricity that is low cost. However, it is illegal to disguise cryptocurrency mining initiatives as a protected business in a development restricted area to take advantage of cheap electricity that is only provided to approved organizations and institutions. This is why South Korean authorities are currently drafting regulations to prevent mining facilities from taking advantage of cities with cheaper electricity.

The currency was trading at a measly $8,200 during yesterday’s afternoon hours, but has since spiked by roughly $100 to trade at its current price of $8,300. It’s nothing huge, but it’s a step in the right direction. Bitcoin had previously started a journey that many of us originally thought would ease the currency closer towards recovery. A price bump had initially occurred after the start of the Coindesk Consensus Conference on Monday, and bitcoin was trading for as high as $8,500. With the Conference now over, bitcoin incurred another $300 spike to $8,800 about 48 hours ago, though it has since slumped by $500, suggesting that the hoopla surrounding the Conference and the prospects of learning about bitcoin may have been short-lived. As a three-day event, it was probably silly on our part to assume that any sort of craze or bitcoin boost would last beyond that point. One source discusses the Conference’s inability to push bitcoin any further. It states that the currency ultimately encountered hardcore resistance at $8,400, which it was unable to pass. It states that the coin has now entered a stalling period, and likely won’t incur growth in the immediate future. “After holding $9K support for several weeks, bitcoin finds itself under this widely watched support level,” explained Jani Ziedins of Cracked Markets. “As I warned readers two weeks ago, there comes a point where support turns into stalling. This is what happened here. I’m skeptical of BTC at these levels, and it needs to recover to $9K as soon as possible to prove me wrong. Otherwise, expect nervous selling to return and push us back under the $6K lows.” Bitcoin last graced $6,000 back in March before incurring a $1,200 rise in 48 hours to bring it up to the low $8,000 range. We’re also witnessing more bearish attitudes amongst analysts, like one who claims that Fundstrat’s method for understanding and predicting bitcoin’s price is completely outdated. Known as the “Labor Theory of Value,” it says that the price of a good or service is ultimately determined by the work required to produce it. Fundstrat allegedly uses the expected path of break-even bitcoin mining costs to forecast the price, which will reportedly stand at $36,000 by the end of 2019. Many sources and competing analysts cite this method of decision-making as popular amongst Marxist economists, and believe it is ineffective when one is truly trying to determine the coin’s future. These analysts are much more reliant on what they call “subjective valuation,” which states that the value of a good or service is whatever someone pays for it, regardless of the effort that went into it. In basic terminology, bitcoin will always be worth whatever the “other person” is willing to pay. If you’re able to find someone who will pay more for bitcoin, the price can rise. If traders begin purchasing bitcoin at lesser prices, the total value of the coin will fall, suggesting that the crypto market is probably more speculative than many of us would like to think. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T22:48:32.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "54b009bc5453f45330331630bf30590643e5cd70", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCj7an0hD0DzE2fvbJglNcaKM2JQb0xkyznXZLzDO521tM6gP12l66amskojIIWQX599NrWvIbXyo77hOuBeQ4_MyBQt8y.Ov1rZqQt.jMCZI-", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey: Bitcoin Should Be Native Currency of the Internet", "title_full": "Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey: Bitcoin Should Be Native Currency of the Internet", "published": "2018-05-18T00:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1526573299_80378297.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "54b009bc5453f45330331630bf30590643e5cd70", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCj7an0hD0DzE2fvbJglNcaKM2JQb0xkyznXZLzDO521tM6gP12l66amskojIIWQX599NrWvIbXyo77hOuBeQ4_MyBQt8y.Ov1rZqQt.jMCZI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-18T00:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey: Bitcoin Should Be Native Currency of the Internet", "text": "3 hours ago Crypto and Laws Bitcoinist 43 On Wednesday, Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and the Square payment company expressed his positive cryptocurrency sentiment as he stood on stage at the Consensus conference, saying that Bitcoin should be the cryptocurrency of the internet. Jack Dorsey: Cryptocurrency Evangelist Twitter has long been a platform that has been centric for cryptocurrency users and organizations. It quickly became a way in which crypto-related entities can convey announcements and talk about cryptocurrencies with members of the community. This may have been no accident as Twitter’s CEO, who also runs the mobile payment processor, Square , has come out in full support of cryptocurrencies at this year’s Consensus conference. While Jack Dorsey was on stage at Consensus, the CEO of Twitter and Square stated : The internet is going to have a native currency so let’s not wait for it to happen, let’s help it happen. I don’t know if it will be bitcoin but I hope it will be. Dorsey also added that he is a “huge fan” of the growing industry and supports the technologies which help to assist cryptocurrencies and related developments. Square CEO Jack Dorsey wants his company to be at the forefront of getting cryptocurrency accepted as legitimate means of global payment. https://t.co/xfIYMAgNak — CNBC (@CNBC) May 16, 2018 Tech Giants vs ICO Advertisements Despite the CEO’s positive outlook on the cryptocurrency space, Twitter has shown a negative attitude toward the release of cryptocurrency-related ads on their service, banning ICO and cryptocurrency crowd sale advertisements in March. A Twitter spokesperson gave CNBC a statement on the matter, saying: We are committed to ensuring the safety of the Twitter community. As such, we have added a new policy for Twitter Ads relating to cryptocurrency. Under this new policy, the advertisement of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales will be prohibited globally. This announcement came after similar announcements from Google and Facebook, who also banned ads related to cryptocurrency crowd sales from their respective platforms. Although it may be a bit late, Microsoft’s Bing platform has joined the ranks of those banning cryptocurrency advertisements, announcing that they would do the same just the other day. In direct contradiction of Twitter’s ban of ICO advertisements, Dorsey’s other venture, Square, has come out in full support of cryptocurrencies, launching Bitcoin trading on one of its apps in January. The launch of Bitcoin trading on their Cash platform was the first move which Square made into the cryptocurrency space. As of yet, Square has yet to accept cryptocurrencies as a way in which consumers can pay merchants for products, who have traditionally used high-fee credit cards. But it seems that Square does have plans to accept a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin in the future, as Dorsey noted: If we were able to use it (Bitcoin) as a currency today, we could release our apps in every app store around the world instead of the five we’re in. The possibility of an addition of cryptocurrencies to the Square platform may be promising for the industry as Square has been growing faster than Paypal’s subsidiary, Venmo, another upcoming payment processing platform. The aforementioned addition of cryptocurrency trading to Square’s Cash platform was an unbridled success, as millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin were quickly sold on the platform. At the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2018, Square reported that they had sold $34.1 million worth of Bitcoin in their first quarter, spending $33.9 million to acquire the same Bitcoin. Despite the success of the arrival of cryptocurrency trading on Square, it was still a controversial topic within the internal structure of the company. In Dorsey’s speech at Consensus, he mentioned, “We have a lot of healthy skepticism in the company and a lot of people were certainly skeptics of this technology.” He even mentioned how the debate over the addition of cryptocurrencies was prevalent “all the way at the board level.” Even with the presence of “healthy discussion” about cryptos at Square, with Jack Dorsey at the helm, it can be assured that Square will continue to make moves to become more accepting of cryptocurrencies in the near future. What do you think of Jack Dorsey’s statements? Do you like them, hate them, or are indifferent? What moves do you think Twitter and Square should make to become more accepting of cryptocurrencies and related technologies? We would love to know what you have to say, so let us know in the comments below.

Ltd, the Chinese company behind the Avalon lineup of hardware equipment which produces ASIC mining chips and rigs, has officially submitted a listing application to Asia’s third-largest equities market – the Hong Kong stock exchange. Also Read: HTC to Launch Its Own Cryptocurrency-Focused Smartphone, Exodus $1 Billion IPO Canaan posted a preliminary prospectus on Tuesday revealing it brought in a revenue of 1.3 billion yuan in 2017 and that its net income jumped over 600% to 361 million yuan. Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse Group AG and CMB International Capital Ltd. are named as joint sponsors of the proposed offering in the preliminary prospectus. The filing did not specify the amount Canaan will try to raise in the public offering but it is widely expected to be around $1 billion. The Chinese ASIC cryptocurrency hardware market grew to 7.3 billion yuan in 2017 from just 50 million yuan in 2013, Canaan revealed in the filing, and consultant Frost & Sullivan extrapolates, that it will reach 28.6 billion yuan by 2020. The exact target date for the stock listing Canaan has in mind was not made public, and might change along with other details as the matter is evolving, but a person with knowledge of the situation told Bloomberg the company aims to start trading as soon as July 2018, just about two months from now. Canaan to HK The Hong Kong market wasn’t the company’s only possible avenue for listing. Last year Canaan was known to be looking to list on China’s National Equities Exchange and Quotations, an over-the-counter market, and earlier this year it was reportedly examining its options for a US-based IPO. The company didn’t explain why it eventually picked Hong Kong but it is safe to assume that the less hostile regulatory approach on the island, compared to both mainland China and the US, played a part in the decision. Back in April, we reported that the company employs around 200 people in Beijing and Hangzhou, mostly in R&D, and is looking to hire more. Canaan might use its chip development know-how and capabilities to create an unexpected new lineup of products. These can include home appliances such as television sets that mine cryptocurrencies “while you sleep.” Other developments include chips to power artificial intelligence (AI) applications and of course new hardware for mining additional cryptocurrencies.

During the discussion, Srinivasan and Wilson were asked for their opinions on recent comments made by Warren Buffett, Nouriel Roubini and other notable bitcoin skeptics who have been quoted in the media recently. In their responses, the pair of tech investors (but mostly Wilson) pointed out the differences between Buffett’s approach to investing and how the crypto asset market works. It is these fundamental differences between crypto assets and traditional stocks that may explain why the “Oracle of Omaha” has a general distaste for bitcoin. For those who missed it, Buffett recently referred to bitcoin as “rat poison squared” at Berkshire Hathaway’s 2018 annual shareholder meeting. The Right Way to Look at Crypto Assets One of the key counterarguments to Buffett’s assessment of bitcoin made during the chat at Consensus 2018 was articulated by Wilson right after the topic was first brought up by Vigna. “Calling it rat poison, to me, suggests that they haven’t taken the time to really understand what’s going on here,” said Wilson. “If all you think of it as is some new asset class and some new thing that you can trade, then I think you’ll come to that conclusion. But if you really understand that this is a fundamental innovation in foundational technology for the internet that provides a bunch of new functionality that didn’t exist before this, then what I see it as is like the LAMP stack or something. This is an entirely new stack that we’re going to get to build new applications on top of, and the tokens are just the fuel that lights up that stack.” The LAMP stack referenced by Wilson is an open-source platform and set of tools (Linux, Apache, MySQL and Python or some other scripting language) that has been used to build dynamic websites and applications during the “Web 2.0” phase of the internet. Some view blockchain technology, of which bitcoin was the first implementation, as a key component of a new, decentralized internet, which has been dubbed “Web 3.0.” This Is Very Different From Buffett’s World Wilson would later add that his work in venture capital is quite different from Warren Buffett’s approach to the investment world. While Buffett searches for cash-producing assets that will grow in value over time, Wilson is making a large number of moonshot bets in anticipation that a handful of them will lead to hundredfold gains. Talking more specifically about the world of crypto assets, Wilson explained that this market is more about picking the networks that will win rather than the businesses built on top of them. “The value is going to ultimately, I think, accrue to the token, not necessarily to the operating business that you build on top of these networks,” said Wilson. In short, the ways in which the tokens native to these networks are valued are quite different from a normal business that Buffett would purchase. How to fundamentally value these crypto assets is still an open question, which adds even more difficulty and specialization to the emerging market. “There are some things about this sector that are unlike any other asset class we’ve ever seen,” Wilson would later add during a digression regarding forks in the crypto asset ecosystem. While Wilson admitted there are some crypto tokens that have inflated valuations right now, Srinivasan added that bitcoin and blockchain technology in general have already reached a point at which people like Buffett are frequently asked to comment on the topic, which points to a level of success that has already been achieved. Additionally, Srinivasan mentioned that other institutional figures, such as IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde and Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, have had more positive things to say about the future of crypto assets.

Echoes Of Weiss? The ratings , which rank an initial tranche of 28 assets by three criteria – technology, application and innovation – come courtesy of what Beijing referred to as “domestic experts” earlier this month. The project is under the control of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology’s China Electronic Information Industry Development department (CCID). Having only announced ratings plans at a Beijing conference May 11, the results have appeared in record time, but may be set to frustrate certain members of cryptocurrency industry as China’s experts ranked Bitcoin in thirteenth place. Even more curiously, below Ethereum at the number one spot, second came Steem, the crypto token used by the Steemit social network. These were followed by Lisk, NEO and Komodo respectively. NEM’s XEM token came in at twenty-eighth place. Ethereum ‘Typical’ Says Chinese Press “The results show that the typical representative of the second-generation blockchain technology is Ethereum’s technology assessment index with a smart contract function of 129.4, ranking first in the assessment list, and the evaluation index is ranked second to fifth,” local news outlet China Electronics News summarizes linked by social media resource CnLedger. 1/ Public blockchain ratings by China's ministry is out: #Ethereum ranks top of the 28 cryptos evaluated Source (in Chinese): https://t.co/9jStIiFKcc — cnLedger (@cnLedger) May 17, 2018 The unlikely underperformance of Bitcoin in the ratings echoes the results of the world’s first such endeavour from Weiss Ratings earlier this year. The agency’s findings caused a furore when they appeared in January, Bitcoin receiving an overall score of ‘C+’ (later upgraded to a B-) while Ethereum also topped its list with a ‘B.’ Other famous names also failed to impress China meanwhile, Litecoin attaining only twenty-first place, four places ahead of Bitcoin Cash. Ethereum Classic was sixteenth, Ripple seventeenth and Dash eighteenth, while Bytecoin achieved twentieth. What do you think about China’s cryptocurrency ratings?

Decentralized Tool to Enhance User Privacy Microsoft’s first notable announcement to create a decentralized digital identity came through a blog post released by the company on February 12, 2018. The blog post, titled “Decentralized Digital Identities and Blockchain – The Future as We See It,” announced that Microsoft had joined the ID2020 Initiative to bring the project to life. Applications and services on the platform are required to seek user permission before accessing any sensitive data explicitly. Instead of providing identity details to several applications, Microsoft reasoned that it would be much easier for the user to store all his data in a secure, decentralized hub. Users can then access and offer rights to this data as and when required. Decentralized Identity Hub Ankur Patel, Principal Program Manager at Microsoft Identity Division, said, “Each of us needs a digital identity we own, one which securely and privately stores all elements of our digital identity. This self-owned identity must be easy to use and give us complete control over how our identity data is accessed and used.” The launch of the decentralized third-party data repository was confirmed by Lead Microsoft Developer, Daniel Buchner, who tweeted , “I was introduced to Bitcoin in early 2011 by a good friend at Mozilla. That year I started working on a proposal called Firefox Handshake, a vision for decentralized apps/comms based on Bitcoin-anchored decentralized IDs. Now, in May 2018, we’re at the tipping point of inevitability.” Daniel Buchner also confirmed some technical details of the project. For instance, Microsoft will use Chainpoint to anchor to bitcoin. Chainpoint is an open standard for creating a timestamp proof of any data, file or process. It links a hash of the user data to either the bitcoin or ethereum blockchain and returns a timestamp proof. The technology giant has been participating in the Decentralized Identity Foundation ( DIF ) for developing Decentralized Identifiers, Identity Hubs, Universal DID Resolver , and Verifiable Credentials, of which are all critical components of the decentralized identity ecosystem. To make the DID accessible to everyone and so that it can manage a large number of transactions, the DID needs to use a second layer protocol like Chainpoint or the Lightning Network . The Significance of Microsoft Adopting Blockchain Technology The Bitcoin blockchain is widely expected to be the technological backbone of the decentralized identity platform since this network is the market leader regarding second layer protocol implementations. A generally held view is that bitcoin will gain significant traction when it finds a suitable application. Microsoft, in using the Bitcoin blockchain to develop a decentralized secure digital identity repository, could prove to be that critical step. Microsoft isn’t the only technology company announcing its blockchain plans at Consensus 2018. Amazon Web Services announced that it had entered into a partnership with Consensys to make enterprise blockchain easier and faster to deploy.

LedgerX , a well-known asset management platform, is the first to offer a Bitcoin savings account to the masses. This venture is fully regulated by the CFTC and will target consumers looking to buy and hold cryptocurrency in a safe and secure way. A Smart Decision by LedgerX Bitcoin companies have to come up with new and innovative ways to get consumers excited about cryptocurrencies. So far, this has been an ongoing battle, even though the momentum is shifting in favor of cryptocurrency, albeit ever so slowly. It is a painstaking process and one that will not necessarily become easier anytime soon. That is, not unless LedgerX has a say in it. This cryptocurrency asset management platform is heading in an interesting direction as of right now. While it has been clear for some time that the company wants to make cryptocurrencies more accessible, few people expected the firm to launch a Bitcoin savings account. Its new venture is not just a custodial service, but rather a CFTC-regulated savings account for consumers looking to buy Bitcoin and hold it long-term. What this means is that LedgerX now allows investors to earn interest on their Bitcoin holdings. Similar to how traditional savings accounts work, the new Bitcoin savings account service incorporates a call overwrite. It is a feature accessible to all users, although not a mandatory function by any means. Investors can deposit Bitcoin to LedgerX and sell a call option at a later date with a higher strike call option. It is a very popular service in the financial world today, and will seemingly gain traction in the cryptocurrency world as well. Although that is an ‘advanced’ feature, LedgerX is making it a lot more accessible in the form of a point-and-click function. Those who are bullish on Bitcoin long-term will reap the benefits of this method, as their existing portfolio will slowly appreciate in value and users selling the option will earn a premium amount. It is not a method which is useful to everyone by any means, although there seems to be interest in the venture already. Considering that the CFTC is seemingly cracking down on Bitcoin services, this new development offers some hope to the industry. A lot of unlicensed companies are providing cryptocurrency services, yet users are not protected if anything goes awry. LedgerX provides an additional layer of security to users, which can only be considered a positive development. It is also a clear indication that the cryptocurrency industry continues to mature. The bigger question is whether or not this will lead to more long-term Bitcoin holders in general. If it does, Bitcoin’s price may experience an uptrend in the future. The majority of its volatility is due to short-term trading, which is still the preferred method of trading for speculators. More mature investors are looking at the bigger picture, which indicates that holding Bitcoin for the long term still yields better results. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ledgerx", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T22:48:48.075+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fc8af82d0a499495287d58a91aa357a1d965681e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCxEYAJxrQMRV0DiDv1PxfB4B7CLaiOyZml1euM_q9bRW5kiwj5RrWmyOOTuUHDFGhwXGl4FmdiNibJtsyj7l_8mkN0r5A55XdXA4uqGrK.lBICPEeyvf1Ew--", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "Bears Beware!

The consensus change is one of the largest block size increases in blockchain history, and the upgrade also adds the great knowledge of understanding Satoshi’s OP_Codes – which could add the ability to code colored coins and binary contracts.\nThe wait is over as the Bitcoin Cash [BCH] network has upgraded its base block size from 8MB to 32MB. The implementation of the new consensus rules went into effect at block height 530356, and so far the transition has been smooth as the community awaits the next concession of blocks.\nMiners and other full BCH nodes had already upgraded their clients to the latest Bitcoin ABC 0.17.1 and other supported implementations like Bitcoin Unlimited, and XT over the past few weeks as the community prepared for the change. Among some minor updates, three notable changes have been enforced throughout the network which includes a 32MB block size upgrade, an increased default data-carrier-size to 220 bytes, and re-enabling previously disabled Satoshi OP_Codes.\nThe fourfold block size increase is the first and biggest change to the Bitcoin Cash consensus rules. Raising the block size to 32MB will allow vast amounts of transactions to pass through the network with consistent inexpensive transaction fees. There has been a steady increase in the amount of per day BCH transactions because the base block size has been increased by four times its original size.\nThe capability of this mechanism has been proven multiple times as there have been many BCH blocks between 2-8MB processed over the course of the past nine months. For example, about 16 days after the fork on August 1st, the mining pool Viabtc processed an 8MB BCH block which cleared over 37,000 transactions in one fell swoop.\nAnother notable Bitcoin Cash network change is the blockchain’s default data-carrier-size being raised from 80-bytes to 220-bytes. The above facilitates a robust OP_Return feature which is a relatively inexpensive way to embed data into the BCH chain. Essentially the OP_Return is a script code that is used to mark transactions as invalid but many cryptocurrency enthusiasts believe the OP_Return feature is meant to record a rich set of data and not just financial transactions.\nAt the start of 2014, the crypto world witnessed Bitcoin core developers believing in ‘storing arbitrary data in the blockchain is a bad idea’ and recommended users to store non-currency data elsewhere. OP_Return has been in the Bitcoin codebase since it was launched, and in February 2014, the 80-byte OP_Return was reduced to 40-bytes, but it was later increased and merged back to 80 bytes in 2015.\nTo sum it up, the developers at the time considered this type of blockchain usage as ‘spam’ that would end up bloating the network. However, even as developers warned that the use of OP_Return was a ‘bad idea,’ individuals and organizations continued to use it to embed arbitrary data.\nTwo prominent organizations were on the forefront namely, Omni layer and Counterparty which showed that using OP_Return for arbitrary data could be innovative towards building meta-protocols over a secure blockchain — although when blocks are full and the network is congested, these types of layered systems find the blockchain’s network fees unsustainable.\nThe Bitcoin Cash chain new upgrade to 32MB block size and increase in the default data-carrier-size to 220 bytes will help all kinds of innovations, like added creativity in applications such as Memo, Counterparty Cash, Blockpress, and many other platforms.\nThe final update that Bitcoin Cash hard fork offers is the re-enabling of disabled Satoshi OP_Codes — which are essentially codes that perform specific operations using an internal stack language called Script. Many people consider Script to be extremely similar to the programming language Forth — another stack-based language and software environment.\nThe creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, in his original Bitcoin client added OP_Codes to the software which can perform operations like simple math and string handling processes. Many people believe this language could bring new functionalities to the Bitcoin Cash network as most of the original OP_Codes were disabled in earlier clients.\nA large chunk of these OP_Codes will bring forth many innovative features such as multi-signature operations, colored coins or representative tokens, smart contract compilers, and 0-confirmation sending techniques, believe the BCH proponents.\nYesterday’s awaited upgrade is the first step towards many of these innovations and visions that BCH proponents have been talking about for months. There is a couple of other developments being discussed, such as double spend notifications — which notify nodes when a double spend takes place and a new Proof-of-Work [PoW] target called Bobtail.\nProgrammers are also looking for developments in the Graphene protocol and other concepts that could add a rich feature set to the BCH chain. Yesterday’s 32MB upgrade was a successful fork for the BCH community, and very likely there will be many more other upgrades in the future.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "utc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T02:18:27.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a8cbda0e1d9a64477dbbafb2b486383f4cd5c234", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYnYB6pWrRpKZgfx0sMkHY8-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why so many Bitcoin users have fear of governments?", "title_full": "Why so many Bitcoin users have fear of governments?", "published": "2018-05-18T00:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a8cbda0e1d9a64477dbbafb2b486383f4cd5c234", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYnYB6pWrRpKZgfx0sMkHY8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rachel Buffay", "published": "2018-05-18T00:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why so many Bitcoin users have fear of governments?", "text": "Maybe they own a huge amount of bitcoins and they are afraid that they will be questioned by the government.

Bitcoin Price Too Volatile for Merchants\nRainey made this claim during a recent episode of “ Mad Money ,” explaining that merchant margins are too thin to make bitcoin a viable payment medium.\nYou have a “10 percent margin on a product that you sell and you accept bitcoin, for example, and the very next day it moves 15 percent, you’re now underwater on that transaction,” he said.\nAdmittedly, itcoin and cryptocurrency prices are a lot more volatile than their fiat counterparts. A 1% or 2% swing in forex is considered a major move, whereas a 15% bitcoin price movement is not extraordinary, although it has swung upwards just as quickly in recent years.\nRainey did go on to suggest that if merchant demand increased in the future, they would look at their bitcoin policy again.\nWhen talking about the possibility of accepting crypto in the future, Rainey went on to say:\n“You could have something that appeals to consumers, but if merchants don’t accept it, it’s of little value. Right now, we don’t see a lot of interest from our merchants. But if it’s something that stabilizes in the future and is a better currency, then we’ll certainly support that.” PayPal’s Cryptocurrency Plans PayPal CEO John Rainey says the bitcoin price is too volatile for merchants, but the company has won a patent for a cryptocurrency payment system.\nDespite Rainey’s comments, an increasing number of companies accept bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a payment method, primarily through third-party payment processors that convert the funds to local fiat currency at the point of sale to shelter merchants from price volatility.\nOverstock was the first major retailer to accept crypto, and it continues to do so today. Expedia enables users to pay for hotels and holidays with bitcoin, and some Subway locations also accept the largest cryptocurrency. Many smaller stores accept bitcoin, as well, and the number of outlets, both digital and real-world, accepting additional cryptocurrencies like litecoin and ethereum also continues to grow.\nSome PayPal founders and executives haven’t pulled their punches when talking about Bitcoin in the past. Founding CEO Bill Harris described Bitcoin as “ the greatest scam in history ” before claiming that it cost valuable natural resources, that almost nobody accepts it as a payment method, and that it has no intrinsic worth — arguments that the Bitcoin community have had to field for many years now.\nDespite the bearish outlook of some executives, the online payment processor filed a patent in March this year for a system that would enable cryptocurrency users to swap private keys off-chain, rather than having to send coins over the network. The company is clearly keeping a keen eye on the sector, as it develops.\nImages from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/16/paypal-cfo-our-merchants-arent-interested-in-crypto-its-too-volatile.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john rainey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rainey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "paypal cfo bitcoin price too volatile for merchants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin price too volatile for merchants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paypal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T04:03:11.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c5c80942813d6c523d098d17bd30cc3be3107230", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdCo91dlhJvF2xAp54mYvcE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "if bitcoin becomes the country's currency", "title_full": "if bitcoin becomes the country's currency", "published": "2018-05-18T00:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.514, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c5c80942813d6c523d098d17bd30cc3be3107230", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdCo91dlhJvF2xAp54mYvcE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Wahyud11", "published": "2018-05-18T00:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "if bitcoin becomes the country's currency", "text": "Bitcoin that is not affiliated with a country in my opinion is very likely to be used as world currency for trading.

to believe it's. This was largely because of its usage on deep internet market areas frequented by offenders. However, Bitcoin is not anonymous. In reality, for most people the majority of the time, it might be less private than traditional payment methods like bank debit cards or charge cards. Everything that you do on the Bitcoin system: each payment you receive or send, is listed on a public database which anyone can see whenever they need. When you employ a classic electronic payment system that the firm who supplies it can see whatever you are doing, and they might provide that information to government agencies and other people, based on their policies along with your specified preferences. However, all of your personal financial information is concealed from the perspective of the public. Obviously you do not have to supply personal details to utilize a Bitcoin wallet which you've downloaded to your computer. But even this amount of privacy is just superficial; if you're a frequent user of this network it's not especially hard for malicious adversaries, from thieves and hackers to government or company spies, to connect your Bitcoin addresses along with your real world identity then have the ability to see just how much wealth you've got and exactly what it is you are doing it. Without going into too complex technical particulars, mixers operate by mixing your payment up with tons of different obligations from different users. This makes it rather hard if not impossible for any viewer to have the ability to work out that is sending cash to whom. An observer who understands your speeches will therefore continue to have the ability to realize that you've received or sent a particular sum of money. However, if you're using a mixer afterward they won't be able to tell who you've made a payment on. It can be possible to get coins via a mixer, however quirks levied by can popular services like dying addresses or the necessity to send exact sums to the addresses supplied can make this hard. Nonetheless, it's also true that so as to acquire the very best possible solitude many mixers are going to want to send multiple payments to different speeches -- and if you're sending money to someone else which may also make things awkward. In this circumstance it might be simpler to combine your coins ahead and then ship a standard payment. Actually with a bitcoin laundry isn't so difficult, but may be intimidating for new users that do not understand where to go and do not understand language.

Shortly before Christmas, it was trading at over $19,000; today, it is just $8,299. Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin investors have been predicting meteoritic rises will recommence any day now. But Bitcoin has so far refused to cooperate, staying stubbornly stuck below $10,000 for the last two months. How can we know when - or if - it will rise again?\nPARIS, FRANCE - MAY 16: In this photo illustration, a visual representation of the Bitcoin Digital Cryptocurrency is displayed on May 16, 2018 in Paris, France. Bitcoin is an electronic currency that has seen an incredible increase in 2017, its price has risen up to 20,000 euros but since the beginning of 2018, a sharp decline has seen it lose more than half of its value. (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images)\nCryptocurrency analysts Fundstrat think they have found a way of predicting the future price of Bitcoin. They used the expected path of breakeven Bitcoin mining costs to forecast that Bitcoin will reach $36,000 by the end of 2019:\nFundstrat on Twitter Fundstrat Executive Summary\nBut this method has come in for considerable criticism from the Bitcoin community. On Twitter, Samson Mow, chief strategy officer of Blockstream , claimed that Fundstrat's forecast relied on a controversial economic theory:\nTwitter Samson Mow on Twitter\nThe “labor theory of value” essentially says that the price of a good or service is determined by the work required to produce it. It is popular with Marxist economists, but most other schools of economics have abandoned it in favour of “subjective valuation” which says that the value of a good or service is whatever someone will pay for it, regardless of the effort that went into producing it. Mow’s argument is that subjective valuation is the right way to understand Bitcoin’s price dynamics, not the labor theory of value.\nOf course, if the producer values the effort that goes into producing the good or service more highly than the market will pay, they will stop producing it. When prices fall, therefore, marginal producers tend to drop out, reducing the supply and hence raising the price. Producers who have inventories to run down and/or sufficient reserves to enable them to run at a loss may continue production for some time. But as time goes by, more and more producers drop out until prices rise enough for the market to clear.\nSimilarly, when Bitcoin’s price falls, marginal miners drop out, as the cost of mining bitcoins starts to exceed the rewards. However, this creates a security risk. As the mining pool shrinks, predatory attempts to seize control of the pool (a 51% attack) become more attractive. Bitcoin therefore has an automatic adjustment mechanism to discourage miners from dropping out of the pool when the price falls. The algorithmic puzzles that miners have to solve become more difficult when Bitcoin’s price rises, and less difficult when the price falls. This keeps the rate of bitcoin production steady, at 1 block approximately every 10 minutes, while allowing the hashrate (the computing power needed to solve the puzzles) to fluctuate with the Bitcoin price.\nAs the hashrate is effectively a measure of electricity usage, which is the main component of mining cost, miners’ breakeven costs tend to track the Bitcoin price. Fundstrat’s chart (also from Twitter) shows this clearly:\nFundstrat Fundstrat\nSince the price floor set by the difficulty adjustment ties breakeven cost and price together, the breakeven cost trend is a reasonable predictor of the future price of Bitcoin. Samson Mow's criticism is therefore a trifle unfair. Fundstrat hasn't relied on the labor theory of value, though its summary does somewhat misleadingly imply that the mining cost rather than the difficulty adjustment supports the price.\nOf course, the support is asymmetric: Bitcoin’s price is supported on the downside, but not capped on the upside. This is because there is no need to defend against 51% attacks when the mining pool is expanding. However, it doesn’t seem to have occurred to anyone that massively rising breakeven costs create enormous barriers to entry which result in mining pool concentration . There may not be a 51% attack, but if the mining market becomes dominated by a small number of large players, the effect is much the same. Especially if those players cooperate .\nAnd there is a second problem, too. Bitcoin trades much like a commodity . Over the long-term, the market price of commodities tends towards their marginal cost of production. Putting this another way, mining profits eventually fall to zero. As I noted earlier, when profits fall to zero, producers eventually stop producing.\nBut whereas commodities would still be traded if mining ceased, Bitcoin would instantly die. This is because the real job of miners is not bitcoin production, but transaction verification. Without transaction verification, bitcoins can’t be bought, can’t be sold, can’t be spent, can’t be earned. If mining ceased, existing bitcoins would become immovable - and an immovable asset is worthless. Thus, unlike a commodity, if mining profits fell to zero, so would the value of all existing bitcoins.\nThe difficulty adjustment artificially preserves the profit margins of miners to ensure that enough of them continue to mine. This protects Bitcoin from attacks, but it has serious implications for the financial sustainability of Bitcoin as a transaction system.\nAt present, new bitcoins are part of mining rewards. But the new bitcoin component of mining reward halves every few years. Eventually it will reach zero. As the difficulty adjustment forces mining profits to stay positive, falling profit margins – whether due to price falls or halving – must be offset by rising transaction fees. The users of the system will have to pay miners increasing amounts of bitcoin to keep them mining honestly.\nIn my view this means that viewing Bitcoin as a commodity is wrong. Miners provide a service – transaction verification – upon which the users of Bitcoin critically depend. Without that service, Bitcoin would die. But miners also depend for their profits on the willingness of users to transact. If the fees rose too high, users would stop using Bitcoin for transactions, and Bitcoin would die. The equilibrium transaction fee would be the point at which there are sufficient users to provide a reasonable volume of transactions for verification, and sufficient miners to perform verification honestly.\nUltimately, what determines the value of Bitcoin is whether people are willing to transact using it. That includes buying and selling bitcoins, of course, since trading is transacting. But will the Bitcoin price continue to rise steeply enough for users to remain willing to pay ever-higher transaction fees? Or will there eventually be a “death spiral” triggered by falling prices as users leave the system en masse, followed by miners giving up as collapsing transaction volumes force fees down to zero?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.bitcoinprice.com/predictions/", "https://blockchain.info/pools", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-isnt-a-currency-its-a-commodityprice-it-that-way-1515041387", "https://blockstream.com/", "https://hackernoon.com/why-mining-pool-concentration-is-the-achilles-heel-of-bitcoin-ce91089ce1f"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T19:37:14.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cc488f9334c71973432d576e3aa5f044e30b2180", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWhUhHhw7Ty57ZzJuRYLoF4-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Can FUD destroy bitcoin?", "title_full": "Can FUD destroy bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-18T00:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cc488f9334c71973432d576e3aa5f044e30b2180", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWhUhHhw7Ty57ZzJuRYLoF4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gabteb", "published": "2018-05-18T00:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can FUD destroy bitcoin?", "text": "Maybe years ago it could but now and in future no ,i dont think,it would, people more and more informed so its coming dificult for FUD ers have any success.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T13:44:22.109+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a18f663cb00e594252240e7d9d21df0a4f8b9ac4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRhAWZsiiMdTyvTrmn2evTs-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=28.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Italiano (Italian)", "title": "[INFO] CARTE PREPAGATE -

JPMorgan Trader", "text": "Advertisement Join our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nThe bitcoin price entered another bearish trend this week after failing to pierce $10,000 earlier in the month. The flagship cryptocurrency now sits more than 58 percent below the all-time high it set in December, but one former JPMorgan trader remains confident that it will trade above $20,000 before the year is out.\nDanny Masters, who now serves as chairman of investment firm CoinShares, told CNBC that, despite last year’s parabolic run-up, the cryptocurrency is still largely bereft of the tools that institutional investors need to operate effectively in the nascent markets.\n“We need to see this structure continue to build,” Masters said of the cryptocurrency industry, adding:\n“We need to see the custody solutions come and be provided. We need indices and we need performance measures where we can actually start to understand what we’re talking about and measure our performance.”\nThat’s been a common refrain from investment professionals who operate in institutional circles, and it wasn’t Masters’ only complaint.\n“We need to do more mature work around the ICOs, so that post ICO we have a token life cycle,” he continued. “And just give investors more clarity, better expectations, more transparency.”\n“We’re not even at the part yet where I’d say institutional investors even started in commodities. Because these things — indexation, custody and so on — aren’t there to bring in those bigger people just yet,” he said.\nHowever, the industry — which to date has largely been comprised of retail investors — is gradually building out its institutional infrastructure.\nAs CCN reported, retail brokerage giant Coinbase this week unveiled a robust line of institutional products, ranging from trading tools to custodial services. Meanwhile, Japanese holding company Nomura partnered with cryptocurrency wallet manufacturer Ledger to launch a cryptocurrency consortium that will develop products and services for institutions.\nOther mainstream firms are preparing to dip their toes into the ecosystem as well. Goldman Sachs will offer its clients a type of bitcoin futures product, while Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) — the owner of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) — is holding serious discussions about opening a bitcoin exchange.\nThese developments, Masters predicted, will propel the bitcoin price to a new all-time high in 2018.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "danny masters", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "coinshares", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jpmorgan", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T01:47:02.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3be0d0925f80a4d6e4ffbd4e08b78e76e26aceec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTRRboFdfE014ccHwWApx7U-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin will silence its haters...", "title_full": "Bitcoin will silence its haters...", "published": "2018-05-18T00:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.793, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3be0d0925f80a4d6e4ffbd4e08b78e76e26aceec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTRRboFdfE014ccHwWApx7U-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "3kpk3", "published": "2018-05-18T00:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin will silence its haters...", "text": "Quote: from: Kotone on May 16, 2018, 03:54:03 PM Quote: from: uchiha_madara on April 02, 2018, 11:05:57 PM we know that many people do not like the presence of Bitcoin,\nAre you sure in the future people who hate Bitcoin will be silent and regret because of Bitcoin triumphs...\nWith the rise of bitcoin it is inevitable that bitcoin would have its fair share of doubters and haters and I think that just means that it is still continuing to grow. However one positive trait of this cryptocurrency or even the whole of the market in some extent is that it is still always looking for a chance to grow and evolve and to innovate itself and that has been the downfall of its haters and doubters as it still continues to thrive and be able to be profitable.\nI agree with you. Popularity will obviously attract different kinds of people from around the world which includes positive minded people willing to show their support and negative minded trolls who will continuously spread hate and FUD for their own reasons. Bitcoin's rise in popularity obviously attracted people from different corners of the world and expanded their interest in this anonymous beauty, but there will always be haters.

For example, in April 2018, cryptocurrency miners in South Korea were arrested for illicitly utilizing cheap electricity to produce cryptos.\nChicken farm in South Korea In South Korea, places such as chicken farms and factories in development restricted areas are provided with electricity at cheaper rates by the government to help struggling industries and support innovative technology-focused initiatives. The government is stricter with the usage of electricity in these areas and consistently monitors the inflow of energy into buildings, factories, farms, and houses near these specially approved districts.\nOn April 19, police in the Gyeong-ki province of South Korea, the second largest region behind Seoul, arrested operators of a mining center in Nam Yang city. An in-depth police investigation disclosed that five cryptocurrency miners, whose identities remain confidential as they are still in police custody, purposely rented out factories and chicken farms in the protected part of the city to receive electricity for substantially lower rates.\nBy disguising buildings as semi-conductor factories and several properties as chicken farms, the five individuals were able to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum with virtually no cost apart from the ASIC miners they acquired and installed.\nImage source: Northern Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency via Hani\nIn the Paju restricted development area, the five individuals rented out a 859 square meter building and applied to the government as a semi-conductor factory. For 8 months, the group utilized the space to mine cryptocurrencies with more than 1580 ASIC miners. In the later months of their illegal venture, the group recruited more than 40 individuals and rented out their ASIC miners to produce even more cryptocurrencies.\nThe group generated more than $300,000 by accepting ASIC miners from individuals within months but the actual sum of cryptocurrencies the group was able to produce throughout the 8-month period remains unclear.\nPreliminary investigations undertaken by the Gyeong-ki and Paju police has shown that the group produced at least 760 Ethereum, which is worth more than $500,000, and a large sum of Bitcoin. The local police is still investigating into the final sum of money the group generated throughout the past year. The police has also discovered that the group only paid 50 percent of the normal electricity rate and received significant discounts for renting out the farms and factories.\nCurrently South Korea has no laws or policies approved that can punish cryptocurrency miners in development restricted areas. Minor charges could be applied to the five individuals, for using the space intended to carry out other initiatives, but no major penalties can be imposed as of now. To prevent similar situations from occurring in the future, the local police has requested the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs to draft and approve laws that prohibit cryptocurrency miners from taking advantage of districts and areas with cheaper electricity rates.\nFirst mining ban in New York In the US on March 18, local authorities in the state of New York requested a cryptocurrency mining facility to halt their mining initiative after residents of Plattsburg, a small lakeside town in upstate New York, filed an official complaint to the police for the excessive usage of low-cost electricity by local miners.\nThe city of Plattsburg did not impose a permanent ban on Bitcoin mining however. Instead, local authorities and residents released a moratorium which states that the city will not consider applications for commercial cryptocurrency mining for at least a year and a half. Bloomberg reported that the city can charge more than $1,000 per day if miners decide to use low-cost electricity of the city to mine. The authorities of Plattsburg said:\n“It is the purpose of this Local Law to facilitate the adoption of land use and zoning and/or municipal lighting department regulations to protect and enhance the City’s natural, historic, cultural and electrical resources.”\nAnother cryptocurrency mining facility was confronted by local authorities and a telecommunication powerhouse T-Mobile on Feb. 15 after it was revealed that ASIC miners from a mining facility based in Brooklyn interfered with the 700 MHz band of T-Mobile. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said:\n“On November 30, 2017, in response to the complaint agents from the Enforcement Bureau’s New York Office confirmed by direction finding techniques that radio emissions in the 700 MHz band were emanating from your residence in Brooklyn, New York. When the interfering device was turned off the interference ceased. You identified the device as an Antminer s5 Bitcoin Miner. The device was generating spurious emissions on frequencies assigned to T-Mobile’s broadband network and causing harmful interference.”\nAt the time, the FCC gave the mining facility a 20-day notice to halt their operations and move elsewhere as the radio emissions released by the ASIC miners within the facility were negatively impacting local telecommunication networks.\nNot illegal Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining is legal in most countries, even in China which banned the trading of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum in Sep. 2017.\nCryptocurrency mining is legal in most regions because it is beneficial for electricity grid operators to provide excess energy that they can no longer supply to households and businesses. As such, although local governments have tried to ban cryptocurrency mining in the past as demonstrated in CNLedger’s report below, cryptocurrency mining remains unbanned in most countries.\nYiCai: Regulators are asking local departments to report the current status of bitcoin mining companies under administration, and \"guide the mining firms to exit in an orderly manner\" by taking various measures from the aspects of electricity, land, tax, environmental protection\n— cnLedger (@cnLedger) January 6, 2018 It is also not illegal to mine Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency using electricity that is low cost. However, it is illegal to disguise cryptocurrency mining initiatives as a protected business in a development restricted area to take advantage of cheap electricity that is only provided to approved organizations and institutions. This is why South Korean authorities are currently drafting regulations to prevent mining facilities from taking advantage of cities with cheaper electricity.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "new york  cryptocurrency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nam yang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T03:11:26.045+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "459413ad117f7bbd23c3711adcfcb0af6911900f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFQaQKZpmG2gglpt.1t6DJHxV57.vmUMhApUBq7iriR8dCQJAIUGbhsA8SlPBBzZkVsrOBHY8i.oxA--", "site_full": "forextv.com", "site": "forextv.com", "site_section": "http://forextv.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "retirement_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "ForexTV", "title": "Bloomberg Markets: The Buisness of Bitcoin Arbitrage", "title_full": "Bloomberg Markets: The Buisness of Bitcoin Arbitrage", "published": "2018-05-18T00:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "459413ad117f7bbd23c3711adcfcb0af6911900f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFQaQKZpmG2gglpt.1t6DJHxV57.vmUMhApUBq7iriR8dCQJAIUGbhsA8SlPBBzZkVsrOBHY8i.oxA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin News Editor", "published": "2018-05-18T00:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bloomberg Markets: The Buisness of Bitcoin Arbitrage", "text": "Webmaster Tools Risk Disclaimer - By using this web site you agree to its terms and conditions.

But the future is now, and that means the phrase “wine-backed cryptocurrency” exists in reality.\nOpenVino is a new project from winemaker Mike Barrow of Costaflores Organic Vineyard in Mendoza that lets you buy the winery’s Mike Tango Bravo 2018 red blend with MTB18 tokens—that would be the digital “cryptocurrency”—during its “ICO” (“initial coin offering”) through May 20. For now, each token equals a little less than 5 bucks, which equals one bottle, but starting in July, the tokens can be traded, bitcoin-style, on crypto exchanges; however you acquire your wine-computer-coin, you can ultimately cash in three years from now once the wine is finished.\nIt’s the latest of the technologies Barrow has implemented that sound more like TED-talk than wine-speak (“blockchain,”“biodigital certification”). Barrow told Unfiltered OpenVino was inspired by wine-biz problems like accurately determining a correct price for wines, and communicating the viticultural process to customers.\nTo the latter issue, Barrow has installed sensors, cameras and labor-tracking tools in the vineyard and winery (“Internet of Vines”) his customers can access. “It is open-source, because anyone can reutilize, copy, comment upon, or criticize our practices in the vineyard, in the [winery] and in the business,” Barrow said. After 2nd-Place Finish at Derby, Vintner Barbara Banke’s Horse Good Magic Saddles Up for Preakness\nJackson Family Wines chairman Barbara Banke ‘s thoroughbred Good Magic made a big splash at Churchill Downs earlier this month, finishing second in the Kentucky Derby. (To be fair, all 20 horses made a big splash, as the nearly 3 inches of rain recorded in Louisville, Ky., May 5 was a Derby Day record.) “Our horse ran really well,” Banke told Unfiltered in a follow-up chat this week. “He did alright in the slop, which is good, because it could be equally as sloppy for the [Preakness]!”\nCourtesy of Jackson Family Wines\nBarbara Banke (right) and daughter Julia Jackson are in the running for Hat of the Year.\n“It was a tough race, with lots of good horses. It’s tough to run a mile and a quarter with all those competitors—a 20-horse field,” Banke said. “Good Magic bounced back with very good energy, ate up all his food, he’s doing all the things you like to see them do when they come out of a race well.” And because of that, last year’s Champion 2-Year-Old is headed to Baltimore, where he’ll be running in the Preakness Stakes this weekend at Pimlico Race Course. Unfiltered readers will know that Good Magic was sired by Curlin , the two-time Horse of the Year that won the Preakness in 2007 . “The track seems made for him, because Good Magic—actually more than Curlin—is a horse that can corner well, and the turns are a little tighter at Pimlico than they are at Churchill Downs, so you’ve got to be a fairly handy horse to make it around, and he is.”\nBanke’s Stonestreet Stables team is hoping to have more Kendall-Jackson Vintners Reserve Chardonnay and Stonestreet Estate Vineyards Cabernet on hand Saturday, but she’ll be prepared for anything. “Sometimes we end up drinking Maryland wines … You need something to go with crab cakes, so I’m sure it’s going to be Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc for us.” Together at Last: Cam and John Jordan Make Perfect Pairing\nWhen the NFL’s New Orleans Saints beat the Carolina Panthers in the playoffs back in January, All-Pro defensive end Cameron Jordan sent a special parting gift to Panthers QB Cam Newton : A bottle of Jordan Cabernet Sauvignon Alexander Valley 2013 . Jordan winery owner and football fan John Jordan caught wind of the epic wine trolling dished out by the gridiron-based Jordan and invited the Saint out to Sonoma for a visit. Football Jordan still hasn’t made it to Sonoma to visit Wine Jordan, but last week the two finally met (and compared wine-tasting notes) in New Orleans.\nLisa Mattson / Jordan Winery\nWine-country fashion and draft-day finest turn out to be remarkably similar; Cam (left) and John Jordan.\nOn Friday night, John Jordan hosted a reception and Jordan wine-pairing dinner at Restaurant R’evolution in the French Quarter’s Royal Sonesta Hotel, where attendees were wowed by two very special guests of honor: an 18-liter Melchior of 2013 Jordan Cabernet, and the 6′ 4″, 287-pound Cameron Jordan. In between signing autographs and entertaining the crowd, the two Jordans discovered they have a lot more than just football, wine and a surname in common. John has his pilot’s license, and Cameron has logged more than 20 hours in the cockpit; both also love to fish.\nThe NFL star confirmed to Unfiltered that Jordan Cabernet is his favorite wine, just ahead of Caymus Special Selection and Trefethen HaLo, and gave us his exclusive notes on the night’s wines: “I enjoy smooth reds … The 2013 Jordan Cabernet out of Melchior was great, but my favorite wine of the night was the 2003 Jordan, which reminded me of my favorite Jordan vintage, the 2011. I discovered that I like the more Old World–style vintages.”\n“It was the perfect evening,” John told Unfiltered. “Got to talk football and fishing in the Gulf with my new friend Cam Jordan while enjoying some of the best food in New Orleans. What more can a man ask for?”\nChampagne Drappier’s bottles are so nice, they want you to enjoy them twice. The sustainability-focused Champagne house recently launched a gift set featuring a bottle of Drappier, paired with a onetime bottle that’s been upcycled into a candle.\nCourtesy of Drappier\nLiberté, egalité, sustainabilité!\nTo make the candles, empties are hand-cut and polished, then filled with soy wax, and a message from Charline Drappier is emblazoned on the also-recycled gift box. “Drappier is the first [Champagne] house committed to a net zero-carbon footprint, and has a global vision of organic agriculture [and] sustainability,” she told Unfiltered. “Recycling is a natural part of our approach.”\n‘Tis the season for #RoséAllDay, and Wine Spectator Best of Award of Excellence winner City Winery New York has a new limited-edition pink charity wine on the market, in honor of National Foster Care Awareness Month.\nThe New York Foundling\nRosé with purpose.\nOn sale now through the end of May, the We Are IntertWined cuvée is a 2017 rosé of Syrah from California’s North Coast, made in partnership with New York Foundling, a non-profit child-welfare agency.

The price even traded below the $1,240 support level and almost tested the $1,200 support. A low was formed near $1,220 before the price started an upside recovery. It moved above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,490 high to $1,220 low. \\n\nIt also succeeded in clearing the $1,300 resistance, but there are many barriers on the upside. There is also a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,340 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,490 high to $1,220 low is placed near the $1,360 level to act as a crucial resistance. In short, it seems like there is a major barrier forming near $1,340 and $1,350 resistance levels . A break and close above $1,350 may well push the price towards the 100 hourly simple moving average, which is the next resistance before $1,400. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the price is showing positive signs above $1,240. However, a break and close above $1,350, $1,380 and $1,400 won\\u2019t be easy. On the downside, supports are seen at $1,300 and $1,240. \\n\nLooking at the technical indicators: \\n\nHourly MACD \\u2013 The MACD for BCH\\/USD is slowly moving in the bullish zone. \\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \\u2013 The RSI for BCH\\/USD is now above the 50 level. \\n\nMajor Support Level \\u2013 $1,240 \\n\nMajor Resistance Level \\u2013 $1,350 \\n\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH\\/USD Facing Uphill Task appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T15:57:26.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b2dc2e8cb8e025707d21606807507806fd6ac776", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUtSf_Ar24.Yjuicx7PauqgaPXQSz9pMUM2agFWkuTaSUujhSPSB7jcoWjoy8.x9EZLe3f3eEMVbwcpDf1B5ZX4Y5NIdIGEewh0NTFeMFzUdVahoQPgpgB.axFgaeZLVmc-", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/cryptocurrency-news", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency News - Barchart.com", "title": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights \\n \\n Bitcoin price", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights \\n \\n Bitcoin price", "published": "2018-05-17T23:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.246, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b2dc2e8cb8e025707d21606807507806fd6ac776", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUtSf_Ar24.Yjuicx7PauqgaPXQSz9pMUM2agFWkuTaSUujhSPSB7jcoWjoy8.x9EZLe3f3eEMVbwcpDf1B5ZX4Y5NIdIGEewh0NTFeMFzUdVahoQPgpgB.axFgaeZLVmc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sarah Jenn", "published": "2018-05-17T23:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights \\n \\n Bitcoin price", "text": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights \\n \\n Bitcoin price could pause from its drop as a double bottom formation can be seen on the 1-hour chart. \\n Price has quite a way to go before testing the neckline at $8,800. \\n An upside break could lead to an uptrend of the same height as the double bottom formation. \\n \\n\nBitcoin price formed a double bottom pattern on its 1-hour time frame and needs to break past the neckline to confirm the climb. \\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals \\n\nThe 100 SMA is still below the longer-term 200 SMA to indicate that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This means that the downtrend is more likely to resume than to reverse. In addition, the 200 SMA lines up with the pattern’s neckline to add to its strength as a ceiling. If it holds, another bottom could be formed. \\n\nRSI is on the move up to indicate that buyers have enough energy to push for more gains, but the oscillator is also nearing overbought levels to reflect exhaustion. Stochastic is also heading north but could be due to turn back down form overbought levels soon, so bitcoin price might follow suit. \\n BTCUSD Chart from TradingView \\n\nMarket Factors \\n\nInvestors continue to hold out for positive updates in the industry but until those come out, caution has prevailed after bitcoin price was rejected at one resistance level after another. Traders are also keeping close tabs on the investigation into South Korea’s largest crypto exchange as this revives issues on regulation and security. \\n\nIn contrast, the dollar has been firmly supported by stronger rate hike hopes, particularly for the Fed meeting in June. Although some data points have fallen short of estimates, traders are paying closer attention to positive figures on inflation and shrugging off downbeat remarks from FOMC members. \\n\nLooking ahead, it could be all about market sentiment from here as a week without industry developments could draw more sellers in. \\n\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: Eyes on This Classic Reversal Pattern appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T15:58:00.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b8dc1358a5b61d8cabe321a8d1ad3d6db792ff76", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUDcXZCDLH5FUFhrFF.dmRHRYuOT2RxFNI.VkyX_hL.hQS4b_ey9bure14VoDPYpv6NtqlL9Q4jd6J0X7MWrIX9", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/daily-forex", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Daily Forex - Barchart.com", "title": "BTC\\/USD \\n\\n The bitcoin markets were choppy duri", "title_full": "BTC\\/USD \\n\\n The bitcoin markets were choppy duri", "published": "2018-05-17T23:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b8dc1358a5b61d8cabe321a8d1ad3d6db792ff76", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUDcXZCDLH5FUFhrFF.dmRHRYuOT2RxFNI.VkyX_hL.hQS4b_ey9bure14VoDPYpv6NtqlL9Q4jd6J0X7MWrIX9", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Christopher Lewis", "published": "2018-05-17T23:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "BTC\\/USD \\n\\n The bitcoin markets were choppy duri", "text": "BTC\\/USD \\n\\n\nThe bitcoin markets were choppy during trading on Wednesday, breaking below the $8400 level, reaching down to the $8100 level after that, bouncing again towards $8400, and then breaking back down before bouncing at the end of the day. The market looks likely to continue to see a lot of noise, but with the recent move lower I think we are going to continue to see a bit of a grind to the downside. The $8000 level underneath is the longer-term support, and I think it’s the target in the short term. If we do rally from here, I feel it’s only a matter time before the sellers get back involved, as the $9000 level of course has been massive resistance. It’s not until we break above there that I think it shows any real strength. When you look at the chart, you can clearly see that we have been going from the upper left to the lower right. \\n\\n\n\\n\\n BTC\\/JPY \\n\\n\nBitcoin has fallen against the Japanese yen initially during the day on Wednesday as well, but has also turned around to rally, fall again, and then bounce again. It looks as if the ¥900,000 level is going to be support, and you can see that it has been more than once. I believe that if we break down below the ¥900,000 level, the market is likely to break down below the level to the ¥800,000 level. We rally from here, it’s very likely that the ¥940,000 level continues to be resistance in the short term, followed by the ¥960,000 level, and of course the ¥1 million level as it is a large come around, psychologically significant number. I don’t have any interest in trying to buy this market currently, because we have seen so much in the way of softness. However, if we can break above the ¥1 million level, that’s a very strong sign and we would probably go looking towards ¥1.1 million level. \\n\\n\n\\n\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T15:57:07.003+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32209, "moreResultsAvailable": 9009, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=23200", "requestsLeft": 430}
