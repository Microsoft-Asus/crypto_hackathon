He said a segment about buying Ripple's XRP epitomized the \"peak nonsense\" of the bitcoin mania that swept financial media and markets.\nMike Novogratz, the famed hedge funder turned crypto-enthusiast, poked a little fun at a segment on financial news network CNBC when describing to rival Bloomberg News the crypto hype that marked the very start of 2018.\n\" CNBC, not to pick on CNBC, but I think I can since I am here, they literally had a show where they were one by one walking people through how to buy the Ripple, the XRP coin, literally when it was trading at $3.20 having moved from $0.20 8 weeks earlier,\" Novogratz said speaking to Bloomberg's Erik Schatzker .\nNovogratz said that was \"peak nonsense.\"\nRipple's XRP, a bitcoin rival, was technically trading above $2.57 when CNBC broke down how to buy it on exchange operator Poloniex on January 5 . Still, the crypto market was red-hot then, with the entire market racing towards an all-time high market capitalization above $830 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. XRP ultimately fell to $0.49 on April 5.\nTo be sure, many publications created walk-throughs for readers and viewers on how to purchase crypto-assets during the run-up. Business Insider published \"Ripple's XRP is the hot new cryptocurrency - here's how you buy it\" in January when Ripple was trading at approximately $2 a token. Advertisement\nThe second-half of 2017 also saw the rise of initial coin offerings, a quick way to raise funds using cryptocurrency. Many of these fundraisers were promoted by celebrities such as Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather.\nNovogratz said this phenomenon might be the reason regulators started to clamp down in 2018. But it is something Novogratz, who is building out a crypto merchant bank, thinks is a positive sign for the market.\n\"So we are going to knock out some of the crap from the system,\" he said. \"It is healthy.\"\nNotably, the Securities and Exchange Commission hit a number of cryptocurrency company with subpoenas . It also recently promoted V alerie Szczepanik to lead its new cryptocurrency enforcement unit. The New York Attorney General's office earlier this year launched an inquiry into cryptocurrency exchanges.\nThe question now hanging over the space is whether regulators will deem crypto assets as securities, which would require entities that facilitate crypto trading to subscribe to a whole range of regulations.\n\"I bet dimes to donuts [regulators] will say 'ethereum probably was a security but it is not anymore,'\" Novogratz said.\nNovogratz said there are about 200 tokens in regulatory \"no-man's land.\"\nJay Clayton, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, didn't provide additional clarity during an interview Wednesday with CNBC.\n\" I’m not going to comment on specific crypto assets and whether they are a security or are not a security,\" Clayton told CNBC's Bob Pisani.\nCNBC declined to comment.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/01/05/crypto-class-how-to-buy-ripple.html", "http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2018-06-05/novogratz-says-regulators-caught-flat-footed-on-cryptocurrencies-video"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mike novogratz", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erik schatzker", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T08:10:09.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "13f4ddb21dae9e1621661cbdb0ad367a0a18c4cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQBt.zJBM7pyvSTszPcs8dh6peDMMON1iKOJG3BZKVfyH6CUfqut5eSIomvR20LeEPakkA8vS0aIw--", "site_full": "forums.moneysavingexpert.com", "site": "moneysavingexpert.com", "site_section": "https://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/forumdisplay.php?f=11", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Credit Cards - MoneySavingExpert.com Forums", "title": "Verifed paypal account USD100+ Sell Only O.OO4 Bitcoin BTCnGame.com", "title_full": "Verifed paypal account USD100+ Sell Only O.OO4 Bitcoin BTCnGame.com - MoneySavingExpert.com Forums", "published": "2018-06-07T07:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.346, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2270, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "13f4ddb21dae9e1621661cbdb0ad367a0a18c4cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQBt.zJBM7pyvSTszPcs8dh6peDMMON1iKOJG3BZKVfyH6CUfqut5eSIomvR20LeEPakkA8vS0aIw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "btcngamecom11", "published": "2018-06-07T07:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Verifed paypal account USD100+ Sell Only O.OO4 Bitcoin BTCnGame.com", "text": "Verifed paypal account USD100+ Sell Only O.OO4 Bitcoin BTCnGame.com 100% Trusted and delivery promise in 10 minutes\n!!!65288;Verifed paypal account USD200+ Only 0.008bitcoin!!!65289;\n!!!65288;Verifed paypal account USD1000+ Only 0.045bitcoin!!!65289;\n!!!65288;Verifed paypal account USD2000+ Only 0.12bitcoin!!!65289;\nBTCnGame.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T07:37:58.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e51a76611df3fb65f8aaa08439f96f7d6f8d6406", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisaGDq2UlHqrZpCpXL61UWvvcjFgSjAr1C2NsCvlotPnSCRJ.bG4KE0o-", "site_full": "www.forexfactory.com", "site": "forexfactory.com", "site_section": "http://rss.forexfactory.net/forums/all.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FF All Forums", "title": "LaVoltage replies to: Testing Bitcoin Cryptocurrency on Dynamic Market Profile", "title_full": "LaVoltage replies to: Testing Bitcoin Cryptocurrency on Dynamic Market Profile", "published": "2018-06-07T07:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn-assets.forexfactory.net/images/misc/ff_fb_logo.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2596, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e51a76611df3fb65f8aaa08439f96f7d6f8d6406", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisaGDq2UlHqrZpCpXL61UWvvcjFgSjAr1C2NsCvlotPnSCRJ.bG4KE0o-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-07T07:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "LaVoltage replies to: Testing Bitcoin Cryptocurrency on Dynamic Market Profile", "text": "| Joined Mar 2018 | Status: Member | 175 Posts These taken from other threads.

So you should be aware that if you lose your money, nobody will answer\nBitcoin is a high-risk investment: people should know that the level of risk is very high, due to volatility and inability to predict its price. \"\nDo not get into debt to buy cryptocurrencies: this really should not be done with this or with another investment, if you are going to work your money with extra money you got.\nDo not invest more than you are willing to lose: \"it is recommended that you do not invest your savings in this currency; on the contrary, invest 1% of your assets, something that you are really willing to lose\".\nUse reliable pages: use safe sites to navigate and also only use reliable devices such as your cell phone, your computer and your home's wireless network. Never use public networks neither to make investments nor for any type of financial consultation.\nBitcoin has been around for almost a decade now and have gone through numerous controversies in its existence. Many praised it and some mocked it for countless of times. The facts stated above are basic facts which are already known by many of us.

Novogratz said that was \"peak nonsense.\"Ripple's XRP, a bitcoin rival, was technically trading above $2.57 when CNBC broke down how to buy it on exchange operator Poloniex on January 5. Still, the crypto market was red-hot then, with the entire market racing towards an all-time high market capitalization above $830 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. XRP ultimately fell to $0.49 on April 5.To be sure, many publications created walk-throughs for readers and viewers on how to purchase crypto-assets during the run-up. Business Insider published \"Ripple's XRP is the hot new cryptocurrency - here's how you buy it\" in January when Ripple was trading at approximately $2 a token.The second-half of 2017 also saw the rise of initial coin offerings, a quick way to raise funds using cryptocurrency. Many of these fundraisers were promoted by celebrities such as Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather.Novogratz said this phenomenon might be the reason regulators started to clamp down in 2018. But it is something Novogratz, who is building out a crypto merchant bank, thinks is a positive sign for the market.\"So we are going to knock out some of the crap from the system,\" he said. \"It is healthy.\"Notably, the Securities and Exchange Commission hit a number of cryptocurrency company with subpoenas. It also recently promoted Valerie Szczepanik to lead its newcryptocurrency enforcement unit.The New York Attorney General's office earlier this year launched an inquiry into cryptocurrency exchanges. The question now hanging over the space is whether regulators will deem crypto assets as securities, which would require entities that facilitate crypto trading to subscribe to a whole range of regulations.\"I bet dimes to donuts [regulators] will say 'ethereum probably was a security but it is not anymore,'\" Novogratz said.Novogratz said there are about 200 tokens in regulatory \"no-man's land.\"Jay Clayton, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, didn't provide additional clarity during an interview Wednesday with CNBC.\"Im not going to comment on specific crypto assets and whether they are a security or are not a security,\" Clayton told CNBC's Bob Pisani.CNBC declined to comment.Join the conversation about this storyNOW WATCH: BlackRock's $1.8 trillion bond chief shares an epiphany he had that reshaped his entire economic outlook", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-rival-cnbc-segment-shows-regulators-clamping-down-crypto-novogratz-2018-6"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mike novogratz", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erik schatzker", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T11:44:38.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "18c1086f101b7d2269a59834f456744342634e65", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9mEfmTr4kCaN1lxvdM0H35iPJB1Kw0h1awOzSwsRrHMYzv60Eu5eb9", "site_full": "www.latestnigeriannews.com", "site": "latestnigeriannews.com", "site_section": "http://www.latestnigeriannews.com/feed//rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Latest Nigerian News Headlines", "title": "Fintech could be bigger than ATMs, PayPal, and Bitcoin combined", "title_full": "Fintech could be bigger than ATMs, PayPal, and Bitcoin combined", "published": "2018-06-07T07:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 36301, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "18c1086f101b7d2269a59834f456744342634e65", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9mEfmTr4kCaN1lxvdM0H35iPJB1Kw0h1awOzSwsRrHMYzv60Eu5eb9", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-07T07:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "Fintech could be bigger than ATMs, PayPal, and Bitcoin combined", "text": "Fintech could be bigger than ATMs, PayPal, and Bitcoin combined Published by Business Insider on Thu, 07 Jun 2018 This is a preview of a research report from Business Insider Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service. To learn more about Business Insider Intelligence,click here.Fintech broke onto the scene as a disruptive force following the 2008 crisis, but theindustry's influence on the broader financial services system is changing.The fintech industry no longer stands clearly apart from financial services proper,and is increasingly growing embedded in mainstream finance. We're now seeing the initial stages of this transformation.For instance, funding is growing more internationally distributed, and startups are making necessary adjustments to prove sustainability and secure a seat at the table. Most fintech segments in the ascendant a year ago have continued to rise and grow more valuable to the broader financial system.Meanwhile, several fintech categories have had to make adjustments to stay on top. New subsegments are also appearing on the scene ' such as digital identity verification fintechs ' as new opportunities for innovation are discovered.Significantly, incumbents are responding more proactively to the rising influence of fintech by making updates to their consumer-facing channels, back-end systems, and overall business operations.Most are realizing that the best way to adapt is to work alongside the fintechs that are transforming the financial services environment, either by partnering with them or acquiring the startups entirely. As fintech's power grows, incumbents will have no choice but to change in order to stay relevant and competitive. All around,fintech is becoming embedded in mainstream finance.Business Insider Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has written the definitive Fintech Ecosystem report that looks at the shifts in the broader environment that fintechs operate in, including funding patterns and regulatory trends; examines the adaptations that some of fintech's biggest subsegments have had to make to secure a foothold in the financial services system; and discusses how the continued rise of the fintech industry is pressuring incumbents to make fundamental changes to their business models and roles. It ends by assessing what a global economy increasingly influenced by innovative fintechs will look like.Here are some key takeaways from the report:The fintech industry is far more than a group of digitally native, consumer-centric startups, although they are, in many ways, becoming the new face of financial services. It's increasingly clear that fintech no longer stands apart from financial services proper, and is morphing into an integral part of the financial system.To secure their position in the mainstream economy, some of the main fintech subsegments have had to adjust their business models. These include neobanks, robo-advisors, and alt lenders. Other fintech categories, meanwhile, have instead found that current conditions are well suited to their original models, and are seeing largely smooth sailing, like regtechs, insurtechs, and payments fintechs. Innovation and dynamism is still alive in fintech too, with new categories still emerging.The rising influence of fintechs is having a dramatic effect on incumbents, from banks to insurers to wealth managers, pushing them to respond proactively to stay relevant.Incumbents are reacting to changes wrought by fintechs on three key fronts: the front end, the back end, and in their core business operations. As such, incumbents and fintechs are converging on a digital middle ground.As this happens, the fintech industry is on the cusp of becoming an integral component of the broader financial services ecosystem. But it will likely first have to go through a complete credit cycle, and survive an economic downturn like the one that set the stage for its arrival in 2008, for this to happen.In full, the report:Looks athow the environment in which the fintech industry operates is changing, and what that means for the digitization of financial services.Gives an overview of the main subsegments within the global fintech industry, and discusses which categories have had to adapt to survive, which have reaped benefits from their original game plans, and which new segments have come to the fore in the past twelve months.Outlines the adaptations that incumbent financial institutions have begun making to adjust to an economy that's inevitably shifting to digital, and in which tech-savvy fintechs are increasingly setting the standards.Discusses what the future of financial services will look like as fintech embeds itself into the financial mainstream.

However, it’s totally forgivable if you can’t really figure out the mining part. There are tons of Bitcoin owners who do not even know or understand jack about Bitcoin mining.\nThis is why we have decided to cover the basics in this article as simply as we can.\nSo, first…\nWhat is Bitcoin Mining?\nIn the real world, the Central Bank mints and distributes the money we use, right? Now, the process of Bitcoin mining is kinda similar to what the Central Bank does. Bitcoin mining is one of the main ways to earn Bitcoin at the current moment, as opposed to trading the cryptocurrency on Bitcoin exchange websites, that you can easily find on a site like Btxchange\nSo, we have people called miners who verify Bitcoin transactions and use a special kind of software to complete some difficult math problems. Only when this problem is solved can the transaction be deemed verified and added to the blockchain.\nIt’s actually a sort of competition and anyone who comes out tops gets rewarded with Bitcoin tokens. This is how new Bitcoins are introduced to the market.\nSo, as you can see from our definition, Bitcoin mining helps us achieve two basic things:\nIt avoids double spending by verifying past transactions.\nIt introduces new coins to the market.\nWho Can Mine Bitcoins?\nIn our normal everyday world, you cannot go ahead and mint money yourself except if you’re looking for trouble. However, the world of cryptocurrencies is somewhat different.\nIf you’ve got the necessary hardware and software, you can mine. You don’t need a permit. However, it is risky.\nFirst, it will leave a considerable dent in your electricity consumption. You’d also need excellent cooling systems, as well as fantastic network connection. And yet with all of these, no one’s to say that you’d necessarily be rewarded. So, obviously it’s a big risk.\nTo manage this, however, some people choose to mine as a “pool” rather than individually, in order to reduce collateral damage. Of course, the rewards aren’t as high as when done individually, but then again, the chances of even getting rewarded at all are much higher as a pool.\nBitcoin mining basics\nMiners verify and compete to complete a math problem.\nWinner gets rewarded with Bitcoin tokens.\nVerified transactions are added to the blockchain.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://webmastersjury.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "josh wardini", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "central bank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T09:55:21.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ebad212e606443ab2c3043511fa1e8da2ed5f19a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY.PpQtPvnnaVDIswshsUpIqNssni1fWdDYNsE2boaHev2JKRAW.bZlVrzlqz37QQEQ--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Latin American NGOs Embark Upon Tour to Promote Bitcoin in Argentina", "title_full": "Latin American NGOs Embark Upon Tour to Promote Bitcoin in Argentina", "published": "2018-06-07T07:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ebad212e606443ab2c3043511fa1e8da2ed5f19a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY.PpQtPvnnaVDIswshsUpIqNssni1fWdDYNsE2boaHev2JKRAW.bZlVrzlqz37QQEQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-07T07:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Latin American NGOs Embark Upon Tour to Promote Bitcoin in Argentina", "text": "\"Bitcoineta\", a cryptocurrency awareness program conceived by non-profit organizations, Bitcoin Argentina, and Bitcoin Americana has commenced. The campaign will comprise a minivan boldly donning the bitcoin logo embarking on a road trip across Argentina and Latin America with the goal of spreading knowledge and fostering bitcoin adoption.\nAlso Read: Cryptocurrency Exchanges Are Drowning in Tokens\nLatin American NGOs Team Up to Launch Bitcoin Awareness Campaign Non-government organizations Bitcoin Argentina and Bitcoin Americana have begun ' Bitcoineta ' – a minivan tour across Argentina designed to bolster bitcoin awareness and adoption.\nThe tour will see the van visit numerous Argentine villages and small cities, with the tour seeking to emphasize the use-cases for bitcoin at a grassroots level. After traveling across Argentina, Bitcoineta then hopes to embark on an awareness campaign across Latin America.\nThe project seeks to target disparate social demographics that can benefit from greater cryptocurrency adoption. Gabriel Kurman, one of the founders of the Bitcoineta project, stated, \"It's a dream to bring bitcoin and blockchain technology to Latin America to those people who do not have access to knowledge. The [goal] of Bitcoineta is to reach every small town and city in Argentina, and then the rest of America, teaching people how they can benefit from this technology.\"\nThe two organizations purchased the minivan together, and equipped the vehicle with necessary amenities, and installed a projector that will be used to screen educational films.\nSowing the Seeds of Bitcoin Adoption The Bitcoineta van began its journey on June 1st. The first destination for the campaign is Chascomús, a small city located 123 kilometers (approximately 76.4 miles) south of Argentina's capital of Buenos Aires. After Chascomús, Bitcoineta is then scheduled to visit Las Toninas, Tandil, Necochea, Tres Arrollos, Villa Ventana, Bahía Blanca, Pergamino, Junín, Chacabuco and Chivilcoy in Buenos Aires, and various destinations in the provinces of La Pampa, Santa Fe, and Córdoba.\nJulian Drangosch, a university professor from the National Technological University of Argentina, offered praise to the Bitcoineta project, stating, \"The first times you hear about these technologies, it is difficult to understand all the implications that you have today and in the future, and to start sowing this blockchain seed in the different communities will allow us to collect the fruits in a few years.\"\nDo you think that bitcoin will see widespread adoption across Latin America in coming years?

Jun 7, 2018\nRoger Keith Ver, one of the members of Bitcoin Foundation, has released a YouTube video on the channel “Bitcoin.com-Official Channel”. A lot of people online are going around claiming that Dogecoin is bigger than Bitcoin Cash.\nIn the recently released video, Roger starts off saying that the talking point, Dogecoin being more popular than Bitcoin Cash, appears over and over again on social media. These people are Bitcoin Core supporters, or maybe paid trolls on the internet, both of which are “oftentimes one and the same”.\nHis intention is to prove these peoples’ claims as false. He uses Satoshi Pulse for all his stats. Satoshi Pulse is a Cryptocurrency Market Capitalization Aggregator. It was launched by the Bitcoin.com, a popular Bitcoin and cryptocurrency news site. Satoshi Pulse works very similar to CoinMarket Cap.\nHe compares Dogecoin and Bitcoin Cash side by side. The market cap certainly does matter, he asserts, pointing out that Dogecoin had a market cap of $400 million, while Bitcoin Cash had a cap closer to $17.8 billion. That’s around 40 times more than Dogecoin’s.\nEven more interesting is the trade volume over the past 24 hours. This is more significant, Roger says. Dogecoin sits at $5 million traded, while Bitcoin Cash had over half a billion dollars, close to $565 million. That means Bitcoin Cash is over a hundred times more popular than Dogecoin when it comes to how much volume is actually traded across exchanges or, Roger declares with evident passion.\nComparing graphs of the number of transactions occurring on Dogecoin and Bitcoin Cash, for most of the time the graphs go together, but the amount of actual commerce happening, Bitcoin Cash is indisputably ahead.\nRoger is irked by all these claims online. “Its an absolute bunch of nonsense”, he states unequivocally. He shows a graph for the actual number of USD sent on the network, pointing out the Bitcoin Cash network sees far more USD.\n“By every metric there, way more people use Bitcoin Cash than Dogecoin. Dogecoin is ‘fun’, but is a fun joke”, citing there is no supply limit and a lot of Dogecoin being pumped out as reasons for his claim.\nYouTube user Unseen Mystery commented:\n“Roger, stop giving these trolls your time. Seriously, Dogecoin more popular than Bitcoin Cash? lol these trolls have reached a new low.”\nAnother user, DB, commented on the video:\n“Roger Ver is the Martin Shkreli of crypto, and he’s as petty as Donald Trump!”\nKaptn Kook sums up the issue with his comment:\n“I don’t always try to convince people that BTC is the best coin, but when I do, I do so by comparing BCH with DOGE.”\nDuring an interview with CNBC in December 2017, Roger Ver expressed his opinion:\n“I think insider trading is a non-crime”.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roger ver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger keith ve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi pulse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dogecoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin core", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin foundation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T11:40:30.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eb64234523ae29504e4155f8115ce88b1e064344", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSODvtrVUTIPGx23Amui8_eU28NCEGWUiDxPnG_i8XplGB_UaLGjgmzPIEB8rRgGFE-", "site_full": "www.dukascopy.com", "site": "dukascopy.com", "site_section": "https://www.dukascopy.com/fxspider/en/rss", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "FXSpider RSS Feed", "title": "SolidX, Van Eck plan to launch bitcoin-linked ETF", "title_full": "SolidX, Van Eck plan to launch bitcoin-linked ETF", "published": "2018-06-07T06:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CH", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 29767, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb64234523ae29504e4155f8115ce88b1e064344", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSODvtrVUTIPGx23Amui8_eU28NCEGWUiDxPnG_i8XplGB_UaLGjgmzPIEB8rRgGFE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-07T06:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "SolidX, Van Eck plan to launch bitcoin-linked ETF", "text": "SolidX, Van Eck plan to launch bitcoin-linked ETF Blockchain firm SolidX Partners and manager of assets Van Eck Securities announced plans to launch an investment product linked to bitcoin that would be traded as a stock.

Also Read: Twitch Streamers Can Now Tip With Four Cryptocurrencies A Large Group of Developers at the BCH Geek Event Build Unique Applications Using the BCH Chain There are a lot of applications being created for the Bitcoin Cash network and one hackathon, in particular, took place in Hangzhou, China to build more BCH-centric platforms. The BCH Geek event was held on June 1-3 and firms like Bitmain Technologies, Viabtc, and BTC.top were in attendance. According to local reports and BCH-focused forums , the hackathon featured 100+ programmers who produced solid research, prototypes, and applications built using the BCH blockchain. The BCH Geek event was initiated by the blockchain video portal Chongqing TED.CC, and other members of the BCH community. BCH-Based Browser Plugins, an Authenticator, and a Quiz App There were more than 11 teams who consisted of developers from firms like Viabtc, and students from Chongqing University. This week on Reddit, a BCH Geek attendee stated the hackathon resulted in a “satisfactory way,” while detailing the platforms created by a few of the top teams who participated in the event. Three teams mentioned in particular were the groups Mempool, Viabtc, and Gon. According to the report, Mempool created a URL-paying browser plug-in based on bitcoin cash which integrates with the HTTP and Status Code 402 protocol. Image credits: Cindy Daily Viabtc developers designed a BCH-based authenticator that can store data and synchronize across multiple devices. The application does not require a server and authentication data can be restored easily. Another team called Gon designed an application called Token Dice which is a decentralized on-chain 1v1 quiz application based on BCH. The Token Dice programmers used the OP_Code , ‘ OP_DATASIGNVERIFY,’ to build the quiz platform. Another application featured was called ‘ IF Password’ a password management software (ifpass.cash) that is tethered to the BCH blockchain. Image credits: Cindy Daily New BCH Apps to Appear in the Wild Soon Attendees also heard from speakers such as Edward Liu, the co-founder of Bitkan, and Jiang Zhuoer, the founder of BTC.top, who talked about the innovation being built on top of the Bitcoin Cash network right now. The industry luminaries also spoke about currently built platforms like Memo , Blockpress , and Cointext that are providing the on-chain ‘killer apps’ once heralded a few years ago. The BCH Geek event ended with great success and it’s safe to say quite a few bitcoin cash-infused platforms demonstrated at the event in Hangzhou will be released into the wild shortly.

They’re proposing a physically backed bitcoin ETF, the Van Eck Solid X Bitcoin Trust , and it just might be poised to break the losing streak of mainstreaming BTC on Wall Street. This time, they’re aiming at institutional investors by pricing it at $200,000 per share. Also read: Russian Farming Village: Local Crypto, Bitcoin Reserves, No Govt Money Van Eck and Solid X Team for Bitcoin ETF Priced at $200,000 Van Eck CEO Jan van Eck cheered, “I believe that bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of ‘digital gold’ that may make sense for investors’ portfolios. The Solid X team has in-depth experience with bitcoin, cryptography, and capital markets. We’re pleased to join with them in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market.” The Van Eck Solid X Bitcoin Trust will also offer itself as being insured against bitcoin lost or stolen. The Wall Street Journal reports, “The firms also set a relatively high per-share price: $200,000. The price tag is designed to aim the product at institutional rather than retail investors.” And in “determining a marketing partner,” Solid X CEO Daniel H. Gallancy underscored, they “looked for a firm with a clear understanding of the potential of bitcoin and the role it can play in an investment portfolio. Van Eck is deeply involved in this space, understands its potential, and has a long track record of successfully opening new avenues for investors to access unique and compelling investment opportunities.” The two have in common being New York-based and the dubious honor of having been shot down by the SEC when they attempted individually to list a bitcoin ETF. The present filing, as of 6 June 2018, will be watched closely by the ecosystem. Jan van Eck expressed optimism at their latest tactic, “We believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process. A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin.” Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) and its BZX Equities Exchange is believed to be where such a fund, pending approval, would ultimately be listed. The Cboe market maker was the first to list Bitcoin Futures back in December of last year. Results have been decidedly mixed after ecosystem enthusiasm almost promised BTC would moon in response. Now, some have taken to blaming exchanges such as Cboe and its crosstown rival CME for retarding the BTC spot price, for essentially being Crypto Winter’s catalyst as it were. Could be the Right Combination at the Right Time “It is important to communicate with investors about the risks as well as the opportunities, especially for new investment areas, and we have been committed to this effort,” the Van Eck CEO stressed. Indeed, earlier this year, these pages reported how in a “ Staff Letter: Engaging on Fund Innovation and Cryptocurrency-related Holdings of 18 January, signed by newly appointed Director Dalia Blass from the Division of Investment Management, the SEC wrote to the Investment Company Institute and Asset Management Group Securities Industry & Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) about the prospects of bitcoin ETFs.” It was a letter filled with admonitions and warnings and potential confusions. One thing was glaringly clear: any bitcoin ETF going forward must contend with its concerns. Two months ago to almost the day, however, hopeful signs appeared to emerge. Presumably in response to a Cboe open letter plea for action from President and COO Chris Concannon, the SEC seemed to be moving along further than it had previously while it considered two fund candidates from Pro Shares. Comment portion of the process has just wrapped. The Journal quotes Mr. Gallancy of Solid X as reminding they “never had any intention of giving up.” Neither has the broader crypto investment community, showing how it is not content to just sit back and wait for permission. “Huobi, the Singapore-headquartered cryptocurrency exchange, has decided to create its own ETF style instrument based on its recently launched index of ten digital assets,” News.Bitcoin.com explained. In further anticipation, “Okex, the Chinese-run cryptocurrency exchange based in Hong Kong, has joined the recent trend of trading platforms creating their own ETF-like investment tools for their users. It launched its first exchange traded tracker (ETT) on June 5, which was fully sold out within just three minutes,” we explained recently. Are Wall Street bitcoin ETFs around the corner?

Colas adds that growth in new cryptocurrency wallets have only increased by 3.7% this year, as opposed to 7.6% during the last quarter of 2017. Bitcoin Beats ‘Beyonce’ and Sometimes ‘Trump’ When it comes down to it, mainstream media sources like to cast doubt on Bitcoin despite the natural tendency for searches to correlate with price. Though this is certainly a “chicken or the egg” argument. Regardless, Bitcoin is still the king of cryptocurrencies and is even proving to be a top contender when it comes to pop culture. In the past month, searches for ‘Bitcoin’ have been greater than ‘Beyonce’, and are only a few points below ‘Trump’, who is arguably the most recognizable person in the world today. When we incorporate a few more popular search terms, we see that Bitcoin is more popular than Taylor Swift and even Kim Kardashian. Most notably, it even surpasses the World Cup for most of the year. So despite all the fear, uncertainty and doubt being spread about waning interest in Bitcoin, the data clearly indicates that the world’s most popular cryptocurrency does not need a new narrative, and actually has captured global attention. In fact, it was the second most popular Google search term in 2017. Although the 2018 search data indicates a waning interest in Bitcoin for the time being, it also isn’t the first time searches have dropped or that the crypto market isn’t growing. Over $9b has been raised from initial coin offerings this year, which is $5b more than all of last year. Meanwhile, new Bitcoin-based financial instruments with growing interest from traditional finance and Wall Street have been in the headlines all year. So despite the current downtrend in Bitcoin searches , cryptocurrencies are definitely not going away anytime soon. Why do you think Bitcoin searches are down?

Electronic Bitcoin OTC Trading Jump Trading’s new platform is a significant upgrade on the usual OTC bitcoin trading paradigm. Usually, firms conduct such transactions with their counter-parties over the phone or via secure messaging services. This method is an auditing nightmare what with having to scrape telephone and messaging records. The new platform built by Jump Trading allows the firm to conduct electronic trades with its clients. The firm created a GUI, which makes it possible for its parties to interact with the OTC desk via a desktop platform. The connection is secured, and users will not be able to connect with external exchange platforms. OTC trading is popular with large bitcoin traders who don’t want to deposit a large amount of funds to online cryptocurrency exchanges. Also, such large volume trades might upset the balance of the market as the presence of a massive buy/sell order could send the wrong signals to retail investors. There is also the problem of slippage , i.e. significant price changes between order placement and execution that can affect the profitability of such large transactions. Bitcoin is Maturing as an Asset The new Jump Trading bitcoin OTC trading platform is yet another indication that the cryptocurrency is rapidly maturing. According to forex trader, John Spallanzani, a portfolio manager at Miller Value Partners, bitcoin’s growth closely mirrors that of the multi-trillion-dollar forex market. In the early 90s, long before the advent of desktop and mobile FX platforms, brokers would call multiple banks at once for spot FX prices. These days, everything is done in front of a computer or smartphone screen, and now it appears bitcoin is on the same trajectory. Since 2017, bitcoin has emerged as a viable investment asset with dozens of investment funds and OTC trading desks . There are over 360 different bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments funds in the market, operating in various places around the world. In 2018 alone, more than 60 new bitcoin funds have been established. Many commentators also attest to the fact that institutional investments in the cryptocurrency will help to increase its price to new all-time highs. Will Jump Trading’s electronic OTC platform improve the speed and efficiency of large bitcoin trades? Keep the conversation going in the comment section below.

The views capitalize on growing faith both within and beyond the cryptocurrency industry that Bitcoin will return to its recent former glories, this time with additional regulatory and mainstream investment support. Milne picked out Bitcoin as being “still pre-mainstream” as a key factor which could propel it to beat 2017’s figures. In addition, he noted, last December’s all-time price highs came about with “almost no institutional money” present. Additional regulation, the plethora of “bubble” claims made about Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency’s “tiny” maximum market cap formed the remainder of the evidence. Reasons 2017 might have been just a warm up for Bitcoin vs the next 18-24 months: – still pre-mainstream – almost no institutional money invested in 2017 – new (regulated) gateways to crypto opening – $300bil is tiny – everyone was screaming bubble the entire time — Alistair Milne (@alistairmilne) June 6, 2018 A Slow Return To Top Form Despite BTC/USD losing in excess of 70% versus its all-time highs in 2018, preparations appear to be well underway for traditional finance to integrate cryptocurrency to a greater or lesser extent. Having previous panned Bitcoin as a niche phenomenon, heavyweights such as Goldman Sachs are now actively pursuing offering Bitcoin futures trading , just six months after the first contracts launched to mixed success. As Bitcoinist reported this week, other, more sympathetic players are catching up, with Susquehanna revealing it would begin operating not only futures but direct trading of Bitcoin and a selection of altcoins. Financial firms meanwhile are undecided as to what extent such entries into the market will push up prices. A survey by pro-Bitcoin Fundstrat Global Advisors in April saw the majority of respondents claim BTC/USD would finish 2018 not significantly higher than current levels – between $10,000 and $20,000.

This is a $100 spike from yesterday’s dreary $7,400, which bitcoin had previously fallen to from $7,600. It appears the currency is experiencing solid resistance at this mark, and how long it will stay there is difficult to predict. The price drop may have been caused by recent news regarding popular cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. The platform suffered a DDoS attack during the early morning hours of Tuesday June 5, and was forced to temporarily halt its trading services so executives could examine the damage and perform necessary maintenance. At press time, the operation appears to be back to normal and users’ account balances appear unaffected. However, the price of bitcoin did drop by roughly two percent following the attack. The currency was trading for as low as $7,300 during Tuesday’s evening hours, though bitcoin has managed to recover somewhat since then. It’s not the first time Bitfinex was the subject of malicious activity. The trading platform incurred a nasty flash crash in December 2017 when cryptocurrency was at its peak and hundreds of thousands of new customers were flocking to crypto exchanges to get in on the action. Several users demanded answers and refunds as they were left in the dark. In addition, Bitfinex was hacked roughly two years ago and was forced to suspend its operations in August of 2016 after hackers made off with approximately 120,000 bitcoins. Long-term sentiment towards bitcoin seems to be relatively mixed. Trefis Research, for example, which originally predicted a year -end bitcoin price of roughly $15,000, is now retracting this statement and saying that bitcoin will probably finish 2018 at around $12,000 only. Data analysts say trading, buying and selling is likely to increase in the coming months, but that growth will not be as steady as expected. “The global cryptocurrency industry has seen a flurry of new developments since December,” representatives of the firm explained. “Many of these developments had a negative impact on the growth prospects of cryptocurrencies, like restrictions by banks on the use of credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies and calls by financial regulators across the world for caution while investing in digital currencies.” On the other hand, trader Jeff Kilburg is much more bullish in his sentiment, and he expects bitcoin to experience a significant boost in the coming months. As the CEO of KKM Financial, the analyst and entrepreneur explained: “All these people who want access and want allocation to cryptocurrency – it takes time to get those accounts open, so that’s happening, but right now, yes… There are cryptocurrency folks still driving around in New York in their Lamborghinis waiting for the price to go back above $8,000. I think it is coming; it has been a slow-moving ship, but there has been a quiet period, and we haven’t had a boost yet. We haven’t had somebody come out and really support it – if it’s someone saying something positive – we just haven’t seen that in a while. I think the news cycle, which really drives bitcoin, is due for a pop.” - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitfinex", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T04:30:14.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f2aaee8e85ac0b747cef9aed854ccbc55b19aa3f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0uZhqNRnCmi98YiZXKIMEY1dIh3lULOLw9P1rwyr4r1peHdTVdrl7Ac.X3gK2h5QTsJFBivdXjQ--", "site_full": "stockaholics.net", "site": "stockaholics.net", "site_section": "https://stockaholics.net/forums/-/index.rss", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Stockaholics", "title": "BTC - Bitcoin Futures", "title_full": "BTC - Bitcoin Futures", "published": "2018-06-07T06:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://stockaholics.net/data/avatars/m/0/3.jpg?1514686606", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f2aaee8e85ac0b747cef9aed854ccbc55b19aa3f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0uZhqNRnCmi98YiZXKIMEY1dIh3lULOLw9P1rwyr4r1peHdTVdrl7Ac.X3gK2h5QTsJFBivdXjQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bigbear0083 (invalid@example.com)", "published": "2018-06-07T06:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "BTC - Bitcoin Futures", "text": "2,955 Bitcoin debuts on the world's largest futures exchange, and prices fall The launch of the CME bitcoin futures contract comes a week after the first bitcoin futures launched on an established exchange, the Cboe Futures Exchange. Bitcoin CME futures went negative in early trading, a stark contrast from the 19 percent surge in CBOE bitcoin futures on their first day of trading a week ago. As of 7 p.m. New York time, the futures were slightly higher by about 75 points. To monitor both types of bitcoin futures on CNBC.com, type \"bitcoin futures\" into the ticker search box at the top of the page. CME , the world's largest futures exchange, launched its own bitcoin futures contract Sunday under the ticker \"BTC.\" The futures fell 3.8 percent to $18,760 about four hours after opening at $20,650 and rising slightly. The move lower was a stark contrast from the 19 percent surge in CBOE bitcoin futures during their first day of trading a week ago. The Cboe bitcoin futures, traded under the ticker \"XBT,\" rose 3 percent to $18,660 Sunday evening, ET. Because of the initial gains in the Cboe bitcoin futures, \"I think today people were anticipating a similar type of event,\" said Joe Van Hecke, founder and managing parter at Chicago-based trading firm Grace Hall. \"The aggressiveness of the bids did take me by surprise.\" Van Hecke, who said he was one of the first to trade both the Cboe and CME bitcoin futures, noted that it appears more institutional-level investors are trading the CME contract. A key difference between the Cboe and CME futures is that the Cboe contract represents one bitcoin, while a CME contract represents five bitcoins. The Cboe also settles its futures against a daily price auction from Gemini, while the CME uses its own bitcoin reference rate which tracks several cryptocurrency exchanges. To monitor both types of bitcoin futures on CNBC.com, type \"Bitcoin futures\" into the ticker search box at the top of the page. Bitcoin itself fell about 4 percent at $18,334, according to the CoinDesk bitcoin price index. CoinDesk tracks prices from digital currency exchanges Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Bitfinex. Bobby Cho, head trader at major bitcoin trading company Cumberland, a subsidiary of DRW, pointed out that the CME futures were trading closer to the actual price of bitcoin than the Cboe contract had at launch last Sunday.\"There's more people who are involved in the CME launch than there were at Cboe's,\" Cho said. \"The spot market still dictates where futures are trading, just because of the sheer volume.\" Leading U.S. exchanges have raced to offer derivatives contracts for bitcoin , which has surged more than 1,600 percent this year on growing investor interest. CME had made its announcement on Dec. 1 for bitcoin futures. But two days later Cboe Global Markets said it was launching its own futures contract on Dec. 10, a week before CME. Nasdaq and Cantor Fitzgerald are also planning their own bitcoin derivatives contracts. Cboe's bitcoin futures contract had a relatively smooth first week of trading, although volume was on the light side. The most popular contract, which expires in January, gained 17.1 percent in the first week of trading to settle Friday at $18,105. About 20 firms participated, including Interactive Brokers and Wedbush Futures. TD Ameritrade announced late Friday afternoon it would allow certain clients to begin trading the Cboe bitcoin futures, but not the CME futures, on Monday.\"They've gone about the launch of these products with their guard up a bit,\" Van Hecke said. \"I can obviously see how somebody could game the system with a bit of capital.\" Many see the launch of bitcoin futures as a step towards establishing the digital currency as a legitimate asset class.

The campaign will comprise a minivan boldly donning the bitcoin logo embarking on a road trip across Argentina and Latin America with the goal of spreading knowledge and fostering bitcoin adoption.\nAlso Read: Cryptocurrency Exchanges Are Drowning in Tokens Latin American NGOs Team Up to Launch Bitcoin Awareness Campaign\nNon-government organizations Bitcoin Argentina and Bitcoin Americana have begun ‘ Bitcoineta ‘– a minivan tour across Argentina designed to bolster bitcoin awareness and adoption.\nThe tour will see the van visit numerous Argentine villages and small cities, with the tour seeking to emphasize the use-cases for bitcoin at a grassroots level. After traveling across Argentina, Bitcoineta then hopes to embark on an awareness campaign across Latin America.\nThe project seeks to target disparate social demographics that can benefit from greater cryptocurrency adoption. Gabriel Kurman, one of the founders of the Bitcoineta project, stated, “It’s a dream to bring bitcoin and blockchain technology to Latin America to those people who do not have access to knowledge. The [goal] of ​​Bitcoineta is to reach every small town and city in Argentina, and then the rest of America, teaching people how they can benefit from this technology.”\nThe two organizations purchased the minivan together, and equipped the vehicle with necessary amenities, and installed a projector that will be used to screen educational films. Sowing the Seeds of Bitcoin Adoption\nThe Bitcoineta van began its journey on June 1st. The first destination for the campaign is Chascomús, a small city located 123 kilometers (approximately 76.4 miles) south of Argentina’s capital of Buenos Aires. After Chascomús, Bitcoineta is then scheduled to visit Las Toninas, Tandil, Necochea, Tres Arrollos, Villa Ventana, Bahía Blanca, Pergamino, Junín, Chacabuco and Chivilcoy in Buenos Aires, and various destinations in the provinces of La Pampa, Santa Fe, and Córdoba.\nJulian Drangosch, a university professor from the National Technological University of Argentina, offered praise to the Bitcoineta project, stating, “The first times you hear about these technologies, it is difficult to understand all the implications that you have today and in the future, and to start sowing this blockchain seed in the different communities will allow us to collect the fruits in a few years.”\nDo you think that bitcoin will see widespread adoption across Latin America in coming years?

He believes blockchain will be primarily integrated in energy, healthcare, logistics, education, and creative industry. But a serious work on the cyber protection of such blockchain solutions should come first.\nArtificial intelligence on blockchain\nA report on open source artificial intelligence based on blockchain was presented by one of 50 most inspiring Scandinavian women engaged in high tech (according to the pan-European program Inspiring Fifty) Anita Schjøll Brede.

In most cases real estate investments are made with the very long term in mind, and by long term I mean at least 5-10 years.

I like capital that goes in relatively quick and comes out in a similar fashion, which I then repeat to keep for the best possible time to profit ratios.

Smarter Analyst provides coverage of equities research, unique analyst insights, and outstanding articles from knowledgeable contributors, in addition to the latest stock market news, all hand-picked by our editors. VanEck Partners with SolidX to Develop Physically-Backed Bitcoin ETF S.A. Team - June 6, 2018, 10:30 PM EDT SHARE ON:\nVanEck today announced that it will partner with SolidX to list a physically-backed bitcoin ETF that will be insured against loss or theft of bitcoin. SolidX will act as the sponsor of the ETF and VanEck will provide marketing services. The two firms will work jointly with regulators. VanEck was the first to file for a bitcoin ETF registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 in August 2017, while SolidX in March 2016 was among the first to file under the Securities Act of 1933 for a physically-backed bitcoin ETF that would reflect the performance of the price of bitcoin.\n“I believe that bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of ‘digital gold’ that may make sense for investors’ portfolios,” said Jan van Eck, Chief Executive Officer of VanEck. “The SolidX team has in-depth experience with bitcoin, cryptography, and capital markets. We’re pleased to join with them in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market.”\n“We believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process,” continued van Eck. “A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin.”\n“It is important to communicate with investors about the risks as well as the opportunities, especially for new investment areas, and we have been committed to this effort,” added van Eck.\nVanEck has a history of supporting innovative investment products, from the first gold-focused mutual fund and gold miners ETF, to more recent strategies, including emerging markets debt as well as a series of guided allocation approaches. VanEck has also, through its MVIS subsidiary, created several comprehensive digital asset indices designed to provide a measurement of both individual digital assets and various baskets of digital asset exposures. The SolidX team has been involved with the bitcoin ecosystem since 2011 and was one of the first sponsors to file a registration statement for a bitcoin-based ETF. SolidX has been working on bringing a bitcoin ETF to market since 2015.\n“In determining a marketing partner, we looked for a firm with a clear understanding of the potential of bitcoin and the role it can play in an investment portfolio,” said Daniel H. Gallancy, Chief Executive Officer of SolidX. “VanEck is deeply involved in this space, understands its potential, and has a long track record of successfully opening new avenues for investors to access unique and compelling investment opportunities. We’re excited to work with the team at VanEck.”\nThe ETF is expected to list on the Cboe BZX Equities Exchange.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vaneck", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vaneck partners", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "develop physically-backed bitcoin etf s.a. team", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T06:07:18.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ba91f2991b6e65bb9869b16565408c80a3ed771a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiVpUFnkaI5VeurWXlEeNZk8VjX.PedKtx8bhJyH.R8XRet5oFdrJBD1jQbnRaNPWXQ--", "site_full": "www.free-nulled.eu", "site": "free-nulled.eu", "site_section": "https://www.free-nulled.eu/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Nulled Themes", "title": "Download 205 Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Icons Free Nulled", "title_full": "Download 205 Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Icons Free Nulled", "published": "2018-06-07T05:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ba91f2991b6e65bb9869b16565408c80a3ed771a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiVpUFnkaI5VeurWXlEeNZk8VjX.PedKtx8bhJyH.R8XRet5oFdrJBD1jQbnRaNPWXQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-07T05:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Download 205 Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Icons Free Nulled", "text": "Buy this item\nThe newest inventions and cryptocurrency is the most dynamic invention of all time and this is why we are bringing 205 bitcoin and cryptocurrency icons.

As a result, more nodes are appearing online every day, a growing number of users are opening channels with one another, and some merchants even started to accept Lightning payments.\nBut of course, these are still the very early days of the Lightning Network . While the main implementations are usable and some wallets and other applications are available, Bitcoin\\u2019s overlay payment network is projected to improve over the next few years in areas ranging from network architecture to security and usability, and more.\nThese are some of the more important Lightning projects currently in development.\nDual-Funded Channels The Lightning Network consists of a series of payment channels. Each payment channel exists between two users, allowing funds to be sent back and forth between them.\nHowever, in this early stage of development, payment channels can only be funded by one of the two parties. The funding party must first make a transaction to his counterparty; only then can that counterparty return a payment within the same payment channel.\nThe Lightning Network white paper , however, proposed dual-funded channels, for which a specification proposal has now also been made by ACINQ , the company behind eclair . As the name suggests, dual-funded channels will let both users partly fund a payment channel by each depositing some bitcoin. This should bring more flexibility to the Lightning user experience, as users can immediately send as well as receive payment after having opened a channel.\nSubmarine Swaps In order to make a Lightning payment, users must deposit funds in a Lightning channel. Once in a channel, these funds cannot be sent to regular (on-chain) Bitcoin addresses (unless the channel is first closed). This means that bitcoin in a Lightning channel is somewhat separated from bitcoin in a regular wallet, not unlike how money in a checking account is somewhat separated from money in a savings account.\nBut there are solutions to make switching between Lightning and on-chain payments more seamless.\nOne solution is Submarine Swaps . Developed by Alex Bosworth (but conceptualized by Lightning Labs CTO Olaoluwa Osuntokun even before that ), Submarine Swaps essentially let users send Lightning payments to a middleman on the Lightning Network; that middleman will send a corresponding amount of bitcoin to a regular (on-chain) Bitcoin address. It also works the other way around: users can send regular on-chain payments to the middleman; that middleman will then send a corresponding amount of bitcoin to a receiving Lightning node on the Lightning Network.\nImportantly, with Submarine Swaps, this conversion is done \\u201catomically.\\u201d Using a trick that is already embedded in the Lightning Network, the Lightning payment and the on-chain payment can effectively be linked to each other. This makes it impossible for the middleman to steal funds by not forwarding the payment. (In agreement with the users, he could charge a small fee for his service.)\nSplicing Another solution to make the Lightning user experience more seamless is called \\u201csplicing.\\u201d In essence, splicing would let a user \\u201ctop up\\u201d funds in an existing Lightning channel, or \\u201cdrain\\u201d funds from it, potentially while keeping the channel open.\nThe idea is simple. Any Lightning channel starts with an opening transaction, which ensures that both users consent to moving the funds in the channel. The rest of the Lightning channel consists of a series of subsequent transactions exchanged between the users, which aren\\u2019t usually broadcast to the Bitcoin network. The funds in the opening transaction don\\u2019t move until the channel is closed.\nWhen \\u201csplicing in,\\u201d users take the opening transaction to instead send funds to a replacement opening transaction, which includes more bitcoin, from one or both users. Once this new opening transaction confirms on the blockchain, the channel is topped up. Until the new opening transaction is confirmed, the two users can simply update both the old and the new channel at the same time to avoid any \\u201cchannel downtime.\\u201d\nConversely, when they \\u201csplice out,\\u201d users take the opening transaction to send funds to a regular (on-chain) address, and potentially keep some of it in the channel using the same trick. This way, users can make on-chain transactions straight out of a Lightning channel.\nEltoo Each time a new payment is made, Lightning channels between users are updated to reflect their mutual balances. The trick used to accomplish this currently includes a penalty for users who try to cheat by broadcasting an older balance (presumably because that older balance would pay them more). Cheating users can lose all the funds they have in a channel.\nThe problem is that the broadcasting of old balances is not always a cheating attempt. There are a number of scenarios in which users can accidentally broadcast an older balance; for example, because of a software bug or a backup gone wrong. In such scenarios, a complete loss of channel funds is quite a heavy punishment.\nFirst published on April 30, 2018, eltoo is the newest proposal featured in this article. \\u00a0Developed by Blockstream\\u2019s c-lightning development team \\u2014 Dr. Christian Decker and Rusty Russell \\u2014 and Lightning Labs\\u2019 Osuntokun, eltoo updates a channel by building a chain of time-locked transactions, where each transaction spends funds from the previous one to reflect the latest channel balance.\nIf one user broadcasts an older transaction (representing an older channel balance), her counterparty has some time to broadcast the latest transaction (representing the latest channel balance).\nA solution like this could work today, but it isn\\u2019t practical in cases of failure. It would require that the entire chain of transactions be broadcast and recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, more or less defeating the purpose of the Lightning Network. Decker therefore proposed a soft-fork change to the Bitcoin protocol to introduce a type of hierarchy in these types of transactions: any newer transaction can override any older transaction without requiring that all transactions in the entire chain be broadcast.\nIf this soft fork is adopted and activated on the Bitcoin network, Lightning users could create channels in both the current style and by using eltoo, depending on what they prefer.\nCompact Client-Side Block Filtering While the Lightning Network is a second-layer protocol, the Bitcoin blockchain itself is still relevant for Lightning users for security purposes. Specifically, Lightning users must keep an eye on the blockchain to see if specific transactions are included. This can be resource intensive, in particular for mobile users.\nA solution for this is called Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) and was described in the Bitcoin white paper. Current SPV wallets use a trick called \\u201c Bloom filters \\u201d to find out whether any relevant transactions happened.\nUnfortunately, Bloom filters are rather privacy-unfriendly, as wallets essentially reveal all of their addresses to nodes on the Bitcoin network. They also have some scaling and usability issues, as each individual SPV wallet takes up resources from at least one full Bitcoin node.\nTo tackle these issues, Lightning Labs\\u2019 Osuntokun and Alex Akselrod, along with Coinbase developer Jim Posen, designed a new solution called \\u201ccompact client-side block filtering,\\u201d which they are implementing in the Neutrino wallet.\nCompact client-side block filtering essentially inverts the trick that current SPV wallets use. Instead of wallets requesting transactions relevant to them by creating and sending out a Bloom filter to full nodes, full nodes create a filter for all Neutrino wallets. The Neutrino wallet then uses this filter to establish that the relevant transaction did not happen \\u2014 which is really all that users need to know to be sure they are not being cheated. (If the filter produces a match, Neutrino fetches the relevant block to see if the match really concerns the exact transaction instead of a false positive.)\nInterestingly, while this trick was designed with the Lightning experience in mind, it could be utilized to benefit regular light wallets as well.\nWatchtowers To avoid being cheated, Lightning users must keep track of potential on-chain transactions that could be relevant to them.\nWhile compact client-side block filtering should make things much easier, users do need to \\u201ccheck in\\u201d once in a while to make sure they\\u2019re not being cheated. If they forget to check, it creates a security risk.\n\\u201cWatchtowers\\u201d are a potential solution that can be traced back to the Lightning Network white paper and has since been improved by Lightning Network white paper co-author and lit developer Tadge Dryja and others. As the name suggests, Watchtowers could let users outsource blockchain monitoring to third parties.\nCurrent Watchtower designs are not set in stone but would roughly work like this. Whenever users update a channel, they send a small data package to a Watchtower. The first part of this package is a \\u201chint\\u201d of a transaction they should look out for, as if it were a piece of a puzzle. This hint alone doesn\\u2019t reveal anything about the content of the transaction that the Watchtower must look out for; users don\\u2019t give up any privacy in this sense.\nHowever, if the relevant transaction shows up in the Bitcoin blockchain, the Watchtower can use the hint to recognize it. Then, with the transaction data on the blockchain itself, the Watchtower can use the second part of the package they\\u2019ve received to reconstruct the penalty transaction. This penalty transaction sends all funds in the channel to the user that is being cheated. (Or in the case of eltoo, it just broadcasts the correct channel balance.) The penalty transaction can also be designed to let the Watchtower claim part of the funds as a reward, as an incentive to do its job.\nUsers can outsource channel monitoring to multiple Watchtowers. Even if one fails, another might not, limiting the risk for Lightning users to the point where it\\u2019s arguably negligible.\nAtomic Multi-Path Payments What makes the Lightning Network a network is that the payment channels between users are interconnected. Users can pay across payment channels, through peers on the network that act as \\u201cmiddlemen,\\u201d to users they don\\u2019t have a direct channel open with.\nHowever, right now a single payment must be routed over a single route. If one user wants to pay 5 mBTC to another, not only must he have 5 mBTC in a single channel, all the middlemen on the route must also have 5 mBTC ready in a channel to forward. The bigger a payment is, the smaller the odds of this being the case.\nAtomic Multi-Path Payments (AMPs) could go a long way of solving this limitation. First proposed by Lightning Labs\\u2019 Osuntokun and Conner Fromknecht, the idea is simple: Larger payments can be \\u201ccut up\\u201d into smaller pieces, all of which have their own route from the payer to the payee, through different middlemen.\nA challenge to realize this solution is that Lightning payments can fail, which would in this case mean that a payment is made partially. Partial payments can easily be a bigger problem than no payment at all, however: a merchant won\\u2019t be satisfied with a partial payment, while a customer won\\u2019t be happy spending any money for nothing.\nThe solution to this problem is that AMPs use an extension to the hash time-locked contracts , which are already used along Lightning routes and involve passing secret data along a network. Using a trick similar to the one used by deterministic wallets (which generate multiple Bitcoin addresses from a single seed), the smaller pieces of a larger payment can only be redeemed by the payee if all of them are: if some secret data doesn\\u2019t make it through the route whole, the entire payment fails.\nAtomic Swaps The Lightning Network is designed as a scaling layer for Bitcoin. But since many altcoins are software forks of Bitcoin\\u2019s codebase(s), it\\u2019s often not difficult to create similar scaling layers for these altcoins. Already, a small Litecoin Lightning Network exists, and more Lightning Networks are likely to follow.\nInterestingly, these networks don\\u2019t need to remain separated in the future.\nUsing a fundamental building block of the Lightning Network called \\u201catomic swaps\\u201d (first proposed by Tier Nolan and realized on Lightning by Lightning Labs\\u2019 Fromknecht), payment channels can be linked across different blockchains. In other words, a user can send bitcoin, and as long as a node on the network is willing to make the exchange, another user can receive the payment as litecoin.\nOf course, this also means that users can send such payments to themselves: they can send bitcoin and receive litecoin. In effect, the Lightning Network could establish a network of trustless cryptocurrency exchanges.\nFor more information on this topic, see: \\u201c Atomic Swaps: How the Lightning Network Extends to Altcoins .\\u201d\nChannel Factories The main benefit of the Lightning Network is arguably its potential to vastly increase the upper limit of bitcoin transactions without burdening the Bitcoin network. As long as two users both have funds in their channel, they can pay each other a virtually unlimited number of times, while only requiring two on-chain transactions: one to open a payment channel and one to close it.\nStill, two transactions per payment channel could add up if Bitcoin and the Lightning Network gain more adoption over time.\nA proposal by ETH Zurich researchers Christian Decker (also of Blockstream), Roger Wattenhofer and Conrad Burchert called \\u201cChannel Factories\\u201d could further decrease the average number of on-chain transactions required per payment channel, perhaps significantly.\nLoosely based on an earlier Lightning-like proposal by Decker and Wattenhofer from 2015, Channel Factories are a type of payment channel that can exist among many users. Meanwhile, like any payment channel, a Channel Factory only ever requires two on-chain transactions. (If Schnorr signatures are implemented on Bitcoin, these transactions could be quite compact, even if it involves many users.)\nThe Channel Factories can, in turn, act sort of like \\u201csub-channels\\u201d for the Lightning Network. Participants within a Channel Factory can open and close a virtually unlimited number of Lightning channels with each other, without requiring any additional on-chain transactions. By doing so, they could, in theory, bring the number of required on-chain transactions for the Lightning Network down by a magnitude.\nFor more information on this topic, see: \\u201c This New Scaling Layer Could Make Payment Channels Ten Times More Effective \\u201d.\nThanks to Blockstream developer Christian Decker, Lightning Labs developer Conner Fromknecht, ACINQ CEO Pierre-Marie Padiou and others for information and feedback.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\nBitcoin Magazine ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "aaron van wirdum", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lightning network", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T05:22:18.034+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8db7447a3d79205584b543fd6d8aacc8cce507f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0VzwiGyp.ZW7Gm8j8BDPwPL7s-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-07T05:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8db7447a3d79205584b543fd6d8aacc8cce507f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0VzwiGyp.ZW7Gm8j8BDPwPL7s-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-07T05:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ June 7, 2018 WEB Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Investment Summit to showcase up and 100.7 KFM-BFM The Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Investment Summit is dedicated to educating guests about safe and strategic cryptocurrency investing.

They also have some scaling and usability issues, as each individual SPV wallet takes up resources from at least one full Bitcoin node.\nTo tackle these issues, Lightning Labs\\u2019 Osuntokun and Alex Akselrod, along with Coinbase developer Jim Posen, designed a new solution called \\u201ccompact client-side block filtering,\\u201d which they are implementing in the Neutrino wallet.\nCompact client-side block filtering essentially inverts the trick that current SPV wallets use. Instead of wallets requesting transactions relevant to them by creating and sending out a Bloom filter to full nodes, full nodes create a filter for all Neutrino wallets. The Neutrino wallet then uses this filter to establish that the relevant transaction did not happen \\u2014 which is really all that users need to know to be sure they are not being cheated. (If the filter produces a match, Neutrino fetches the relevant block to see if the match really concerns the exact transaction instead of a false positive.)\nInterestingly, while this trick was designed with the Lightning experience in mind, it could be utilized to benefit regular light wallets as well.\nWatchtowers To avoid being cheated, Lightning users must keep track of potential on-chain transactions that could be relevant to them.\nWhile compact client-side block filtering should make things much easier, users do need to \\u201ccheck in\\u201d once in a while to make sure they\\u2019re not being cheated. If they forget to check, it creates a security risk.\n\\u201cWatchtowers\\u201d are a potential solution that can be traced back to the Lightning Network white paper and has since been improved by Lightning Network white paper co-author and lit developer Tadge Dryja and others. As the name suggests, Watchtowers could let users outsource blockchain monitoring to third parties.\nCurrent Watchtower designs are not set in stone but would roughly work like this. Whenever users update a channel, they send a small data package to a Watchtower. The first part of this package is a \\u201chint\\u201d of a transaction they should look out for, as if it were a piece of a puzzle. This hint alone doesn\\u2019t reveal anything about the content of the transaction that the Watchtower must look out for; users don\\u2019t give up any privacy in this sense.\nHowever, if the relevant transaction shows up in the Bitcoin blockchain, the Watchtower can use the hint to recognize it. Then, with the transaction data on the blockchain itself, the Watchtower can use the second part of the package they\\u2019ve received to reconstruct the penalty transaction. This penalty transaction sends all funds in the channel to the user that is being cheated. (Or in the case of eltoo, it just broadcasts the correct channel balance.) The penalty transaction can also be designed to let the Watchtower claim part of the funds as a reward, as an incentive to do its job.\nUsers can outsource channel monitoring to multiple Watchtowers. Even if one fails, another might not, limiting the risk for Lightning users to the point where it\\u2019s arguably negligible.\nAtomic Multi-Path Payments What makes the Lightning Network a network is that the payment channels between users are interconnected. Users can pay across payment channels, through peers on the network that act as \\u201cmiddlemen,\\u201d to users they don\\u2019t have a direct channel open with.\nHowever, right now a single payment must be routed over a single route. If one user wants to pay 5 mBTC to another, not only must he have 5 mBTC in a single channel, all the middlemen on the route must also have 5 mBTC ready in a channel to forward. The bigger a payment is, the smaller the odds of this being the case.\nAtomic Multi-Path Payments (AMPs) could go a long way of solving this limitation. First proposed by Lightning Labs\\u2019 Osuntokun and Conner Fromknecht, the idea is simple: Larger payments can be \\u201ccut up\\u201d into smaller pieces, all of which have their own route from the payer to the payee, through different middlemen.\nA challenge to realize this solution is that Lightning payments can fail, which would in this case mean that a payment is made partially. Partial payments can easily be a bigger problem than no payment at all, however: a merchant won\\u2019t be satisfied with a partial payment, while a customer won\\u2019t be happy spending any money for nothing.\nThe solution to this problem is that AMPs use an extension to the hash time-locked contracts , which are already used along Lightning routes and involve passing secret data along a network. Using a trick similar to the one used by deterministic wallets (which generate multiple Bitcoin addresses from a single seed), the smaller pieces of a larger payment can only be redeemed by the payee if all of them are: if some secret data doesn\\u2019t make it through the route whole, the entire payment fails.\nAtomic Swaps The Lightning Network is designed as a scaling layer for Bitcoin. But since many altcoins are software forks of Bitcoin\\u2019s codebase(s), it\\u2019s often not difficult to create similar scaling layers for these altcoins. Already, a small Litecoin Lightning Network exists, and more Lightning Networks are likely to follow.\nInterestingly, these networks don\\u2019t need to remain separated in the future.\nUsing a fundamental building block of the Lightning Network called \\u201catomic swaps\\u201d (first proposed by Tier Nolan and realized on Lightning by Lightning Labs\\u2019 Fromknecht), payment channels can be linked across different blockchains. In other words, a user can send bitcoin, and as long as a node on the network is willing to make the exchange, another user can receive the payment as litecoin.\nOf course, this also means that users can send such payments to themselves: they can send bitcoin and receive litecoin. In effect, the Lightning Network could establish a network of trustless cryptocurrency exchanges.\nFor more information on this topic, see: \\u201c Atomic Swaps: How the Lightning Network Extends to Altcoins .\\u201d\nChannel Factories The main benefit of the Lightning Network is arguably its potential to vastly increase the upper limit of bitcoin transactions without burdening the Bitcoin network. As long as two users both have funds in their channel, they can pay each other a virtually unlimited number of times, while only requiring two on-chain transactions: one to open a payment channel and one to close it.\nStill, two transactions per payment channel could add up if Bitcoin and the Lightning Network gain more adoption over time.\nA proposal by ETH Zurich researchers Christian Decker (also of Blockstream), Roger Wattenhofer and Conrad Burchert called \\u201cChannel Factories\\u201d could further decrease the average number of on-chain transactions required per payment channel, perhaps significantly.\nLoosely based on an earlier Lightning-like proposal by Decker and Wattenhofer from 2015, Channel Factories are a type of payment channel that can exist among many users. Meanwhile, like any payment channel, a Channel Factory only ever requires two on-chain transactions. (If Schnorr signatures are implemented on Bitcoin, these transactions could be quite compact, even if it involves many users.)\nThe Channel Factories can, in turn, act sort of like \\u201csub-channels\\u201d for the Lightning Network. Participants within a Channel Factory can open and close a virtually unlimited number of Lightning channels with each other, without requiring any additional on-chain transactions. By doing so, they could, in theory, bring the number of required on-chain transactions for the Lightning Network down by a magnitude.\nFor more information on this topic, see: \\u201c This New Scaling Layer Could Make Payment Channels Ten Times More Effective \\u201d.\nThanks to Blockstream developer Christian Decker, Lightning Labs developer Conner Fromknecht, ACINQ CEO Pierre-Marie Padiou and others for information and feedback.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "lightning network", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T05:12:17.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b464a52ad84878a0e14c3ec3cc80f655d645cc46", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS6L7nbyxruQ8NKSeASMy8w-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "title_full": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "published": "2018-06-07T05:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.509, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b464a52ad84878a0e14c3ec3cc80f655d645cc46", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS6L7nbyxruQ8NKSeASMy8w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JayJuanGee", "published": "2018-06-07T05:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "text": "Quote: from: fabiorem on June 05, 2018, 01:24:55 PM Quote: from: infofront on June 05, 2018, 01:44:16 AM Bitcoin, Futures, and the Ghost of Gold A forecast for bitcoin if it follows the post-futures cycle of gold.\n+1WOmerit.

The attack was in the middle of May and lasted three days. One important change that addresses this issue is a change in their Proof of Work [PoW] algorithm.\nIn addressing the topic of attacks, the BTG team said, on June 4th, that they will be using a newer version of the algorithm, called Equihash-BTG for the time being. The team also announced that most of the necessary components for the Network Upgrade had been coded, but needed more thorough testing. Sponsored Links\nThey are still working on improving the mining software so that people can begin mining again, but this has to wait until the Network Upgrade is done. The progress on the update was going good, the team has told the readers to expect an announcement in the next three days.\nOther coins have been hit by similar attacks too, like Verge [XVG] and ZenCash [ZEN].\nThe team is also working on other safety features, like monitoring systems for the blockchain, mining network, and using established channels to rapidly communicate any risks to the exchanges. They are also co-operating with other coin development teams, both to share what they had learnt from the attacks as well as to work together for the safety of the crypto space.\nBitcoin Gold had chosen the Equihash as their algorithm. In early May, there was news that the dominant specialty crypto mining hardware maker, Bitmain, has released an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit [ASIC] miner for Equihash, which would allow it to mine BTG rapidly.\nASICs are cost-effective custom hardware built specifically for ‘mining’. This goes against the entire idea behind bringing about Equihash, a decentralized mining algorithm. The problem with traditional mining, like what occurs with Bitcoin, is that the mining is centralized. People with specialty hardware are the ones who can engage in mining, and specialty hardware requires investment.\nSo, the equihash algorithm was born, the brainchild of Prof. Alex Biryukov. Their intention was to remove mining from being localized to just a few members of the blockchain located in geographically small pockets. It is based on a computer science and cryptography concept called the Generalized Birthday Problem.\nOne way of bringing ‘mining’ back to non-specialized PCs was to return mining power back to GPUs, inbuilt in most of the PCs that roll out today. The PoW algorithm and its implementation could be changed so that an exorbitantly large amount of investment is required to efficiently mine said a coin. Equihash, for example, requires a certain ‘minimum’ amount of memory from hardware to run, but it needs several times more memory for efficiency.\nPaul, a Twitter user comments:\n“Great. It’d be even better if everyone was able to get their BTG and YOU were more committed to making that happen.”\nAnother Twitterati says:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitcoinschannel.com/category/bitcoin/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin gold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T05:17:50.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b3ca6d98ad4c01dffb3bb9eb71ab8158859a5b80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmerQ8FGssxngEhpA4FZtdrA-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Bitcoin can drop again 7K zone.", "title_full": "Bitcoin can drop again 7K zone.", "published": "2018-06-07T04:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.008, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b3ca6d98ad4c01dffb3bb9eb71ab8158859a5b80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmerQ8FGssxngEhpA4FZtdrA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "qumatru", "published": "2018-06-07T04:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin can drop again 7K zone.", "text": "Quote: from: steveabrahams on May 25, 2018, 12:26:38 PM Quote: from: ArIMy11 on May 25, 2018, 12:16:07 PM Quote: from: Coolcryptovator on May 11, 2018, 02:18:22 PM Bitcoin can drop 7K zone for short time.

Kripto paraların en değerlisi Bitcoin (BTC)in değer kaybetmesi domino etkisiyle, piyasalarda fiyat düşüşüne sebep oluyor. Yazım sırasında Bitcoin, 7.597 dolar seviyesinden işlem görürken en yüksek değerine ulaştığı Aralık ayından bu yana %60 oranından fazla değer kaybetti.\nWall Street analisti Tom Lee: Bitcoin aramalarındaki düşüş bir şey ifade etmiyor.\nFast Money sunucusu Melissa, Googleda Bitcoin aramalarında %75 düşüş olduğunu ve piyasa hacmininde buna benzer bir şekilde düşerek Bitcoinin 10.000 dolar seviyelerini geçemediğini söyledi. Her şey Bitcoin aleyhine gözükse de Wall Street analisti Tom Lee, Google aramalarının Bitcoin için öncü gösterge olmadığını küçük bir rastlantı olduğunu söyledi. Kripto para piyasası işlem hacminin Aralık ayı sonlarından bu yana yaklaşık yüzde 80 düştüğünü itiraf ederken Tom Lee, yatırımcıların Aralık ayının Bitcoin için parabolik patlama potansiyeline sahip olduğunu unutmaması gerektiği konusunuda vurguladı.\nTom Leeye göre, Bitcoin ve kripto para birimleri, kısa süre içindeki piyasa hacim değişiklikleri ile benzeri görülmemiş bir ticaret faaliyeti dönemi yaşıyor. Ticaret hacmini böyle çılgınca bir zamana göre ölçmek, kripto hareketinin son bir yılda ne kadar ilerlediğini doğru bir şekilde göstermiyor. Geçen yılın sadece ikinci yarısına kıyasla, Bitcoin miktarları yüzde 40 arttı. Ve bir yıl öncesine göre, aynı döneme bakılacak olursa, Bitcoin hacmi yüzde dokuz oranında artmış görünüyor.\nMadencilik maliyetleri Bitcoin fiyat tabanını oluşturuyor.\nTom Lee ayrıca, Fast Money programında, Bitcoin madencilik maliyetlerinin BTCnin fiyatında ana unsur olarak kabul edilmesini gerektiğini söyleyerek gerekçelerini şöyle açıkladı:\nBitcoin fiyat tabanını belirlenmek için madencilik maliyetlerine bakmak gerekir. Aralık 2013ten Ocak 2015e kadar, ayı piyasasında bulunan Bitcoin için madencilik maliyetleri düşüktü. Fundstrat Global analisti Sam Doctor tarafından yapılan araştırmada, Bitcoin madenciliği maliyet hesaplamasına bakacak olursak, bir Bitcoinin toplam maliyeti 6.000 ABD doları civarında. Maliyet teorisini uygularsak 6.000 doların Bitcoin için taban fiyat olması gerekir.\nhttps://kriptoparahaber.com/wall-street-analisti-tom-lee-bitcoin-fiyati-cikabilir-ama-dusmez.html", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://kriptoparahaber.com/wall-street-analisti-tom-lee-bitcoin-fiyati-cikabilir-ama-dusmez.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T16:10:22.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c8c2865e2236afdf6c83db100ee61d9936ea949b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6e2kLV2St9s1AE_ls3rACNcRX2QVgHMER196Cjixc0iLcd_M0dLPYX2qFGp1Z44XNg9eTlvBLhP5urYN3a9OP6huk_BAHep_R5XnBjTvMurR5zaZPsm0O", "site_full": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://ca.news.yahoo.com/?format=rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Yahoo News Canada - Latest News & Headlines", "title": "Van Eck, SolidX seek to launch bitcoin-linked ETF", "title_full": "Van Eck, SolidX seek to launch bitcoin-linked ETF", "published": "2018-06-07T04:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kHO79vQSxG8Cfjt11jKjIA--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2018-06-06T164342Z_1_LYNXNPEE551JG-OCATC_RTROPTP_2_CTECH-US-BITCOIN-ETF.JPG", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c8c2865e2236afdf6c83db100ee61d9936ea949b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6e2kLV2St9s1AE_ls3rACNcRX2QVgHMER196Cjixc0iLcd_M0dLPYX2qFGp1Z44XNg9eTlvBLhP5urYN3a9OP6huk_BAHep_R5XnBjTvMurR5zaZPsm0O", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-07T04:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Van Eck, SolidX seek to launch bitcoin-linked ETF", "text": "(Reuters) - Asset manager Van Eck Securities Corp and blockchain company SolidX Partners Inc plan to launch a bitcoin-linked investment product that could be traded as easily as a stock, the two companies said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday.

A quick glance at his Twitter account also shows him to be a Bitcoin Cash evangelist.\nThat’s right, he’s all about what Bitcoin Cash supporters (and practically no one else — even Amazon’s ) insist is the “real bitcoin.”\nYou may have caught video of the chase on social media.

The AP also reports that Yabut was tweeting before the incident.\n“tryna explain to my gf why i support bitcoin cash (the holiest chain)”\n“Hours before the vehicle drove off the base, an account confirmed by the Guard as Yabut’s tweeted a Wikipedia entry about the M113 armored personnel carrier, which is similar to the M577 vehicle police chased, and a screenshot of a map around the area where the vehicle eventually stopped,” notes the AP report. “He wrote a series of odd tweets Tuesday, including: ‘where is this damn water buffalo’‘all i wanna do is get an anime wife’ and ‘wow I think I just discovered a large illegal spy operation in the us government.'”\nLet’s take a look at what appears to be his Twitter account.\nAnd just so you know we’re not trying to pin these hijinks on an innocent BCH fan, here are a bunch of the tweets the AP says were confirmed by the National Guard to have come from his account. all i wanna do is get an anime wife\n— Joshua [BCH] (@movrcx) June 5, 2018 where is this damn water buffalo\n— Joshua [BCH] (@movrcx) June 5, 2018\nA quick glance through the account shows that Yabut had more on his mind than anime wives.

While a lot of his Bitcoin Cash-specific tweets were from late 2017, he still has “BCH” — the abbreviation for Bitcoin Cash — in his Twitter name.\nThankfully, no one was reported injured in the roughly two-hour chase, and Yabut was safely taken into custody.\nHis legal fate, however, remains unclear — much like the long-term prospects for his beloved BCH.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://gadgetrio.us/category/tech-news/", "https://news.bitcoin.com/12-reasons-bitcoin-cash-real-bitcoin/", "http://www.wibw.com/content/news/Police-Man-steals-armored-vehicle-from-National-Guard-base-484691921.html", "https://twitter.com/movrcx/status/953849391869321221?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/EYfhFux1dk", "https://gadgetrio.us/author/admin/", "https://gadgetrio.us/bitcoin-cash-evangelist-accused-of-joyriding-stolen-tank/#respond", "http://rdf.data-vocabulary.org/#", "https://twitter.com/movrcx/status/1004068439328206850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/movrcx/status/941518264504672256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/movrcx/status/1004144460140294150?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/ParkerSlay89/status/1004175909702823936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/movrcx/status/946447597807562754?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "parker slaybaugh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national guard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "broad street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fort pickett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T04:51:49.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "560ab57ea083009ebbd2cd81d8793aa21a963a87", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTCV6nS1w2FZFFIeqCtPlkAF98udxKC3VxH1Jp.7B2DurXiTIV6acq1RWDhdQXOd63MC4OH4Bnz.baFGgYfDtzYbB.C2AMNR.zSido_YBEABRFNKkCUsaY3xEqvsyxbKOg-", "site_full": "ledgergazette.com", "site": "ledgergazette.com", "site_section": "http://ledgergazette.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "The Ledger Gazette", "title": "First Bitcoin Capital (CRYPTO:BITCF) Price Tops $0.10 on Exchanges", "title_full": "First Bitcoin Capital (CRYPTO:BITCF) Price Tops $0.10 on Exchanges", "published": "2018-06-07T04:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/1871.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "560ab57ea083009ebbd2cd81d8793aa21a963a87", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTCV6nS1w2FZFFIeqCtPlkAF98udxKC3VxH1Jp.7B2DurXiTIV6acq1RWDhdQXOd63MC4OH4Bnz.baFGgYfDtzYbB.C2AMNR.zSido_YBEABRFNKkCUsaY3xEqvsyxbKOg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sebastian Weber", "published": "2018-06-07T04:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "First Bitcoin Capital (CRYPTO:BITCF) Price Tops $0.10 on Exchanges", "text": "Posted by Sebastian Weber on Jun 6th, 2018 // No Comments\nFirst Bitcoin Capital (CURRENCY:BITCF) traded down 1.9% against the dollar during the 24 hour period ending at 15:00 PM ET on May 30th.

Commission (SEC) did not respond immediately to Wednesday’s new request to create a Bitcoin ETF. Now, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at about $7,500 press time, remaining within the price range of recent months.\nEach share of the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust is set to cost a hefty $200,000, according to a filing with the SEC.\nIt is not clear whether the structure of the ETF or the relative stability of bitcoin will recently help the fund obtain approval. Several companies, including VanEck, have unsuccessfully attempted to launch bitcoin ETFs in the United States.\nIn January, VanEck withdrew the submission of an ETF based on bitcoin futures, after filing an application for a similar ETF in September. In this third attempt, the company is partnering with SolidX and basing the fund on real rather than future bitcoins. Bitcoin ETF Attempts’ History\nVanEck first applied for an ETF based on bitcoin futures in August but withdrew the application in September at the request of the SEC, as futures did not yet exist. The company and several other companies re-launched their accounts when the CME and Cboe bitcoin futures were launched in December. But they had to withdraw those applications again in January at the request of the SEC.\nIn one letter the Commission raised concerns such as the extreme volatility of prices and the ability of customers to withdraw funds easily.\nSolidX has also had difficulty launching a bitcoin ETF. In March 2017, the SEC rejected the company’s application for a publicly traded product based on physical bitcoins. At the same time, the committee also rejected, and then said it would review, the Winklevoss twins’ proposal for a similar bitcoin fund. Meanwhile…\nVanEck will help market the new ETF bitcoin, SolidX will sponsor or create the underlying index and Bank of New York Mellon will be the custodian, the archive said. If approved, the ETF is slated to trade under the symbol XBTC on Cboe BZX Exchange.

As a result, more nodes are appearing online every day, a growing number of users are opening channels with one another, and some merchants even started to accept Lightning payments.\nBut of course, these are still the very early days of the Lightning Network . While the main implementations are usable and some wallets and other applications are available, Bitcoin\\u2019s overlay payment network is projected to improve over the next few years in areas ranging from network architecture to security and usability, and more.\nThese are some of the more important Lightning projects currently in development. Dual-Funded Channels\nThe Lightning Network consists of a series of payment channels. Each payment channel exists between two users, allowing funds to be sent back and forth between them.\nHowever, in this early stage of development, payment channels can only be funded by one of the two parties. The funding party must first make a transaction to his counterparty; only then can that counterparty return a payment within the same payment channel.\nThe Lightning Network white paper , however, proposed dual-funded channels, for which a specification proposal has now also been made by ACINQ , the company behind eclair . As the name suggests, dual-funded channels will let both users partly fund a payment channel by each depositing some bitcoin. This should bring more flexibility to the Lightning user experience, as users can immediately send as well as receive payment after having opened a channel. Submarine Swaps\nIn order to make a Lightning payment, users must deposit funds in a Lightning channel. Once in a channel, these funds cannot be sent to regular (on-chain) Bitcoin addresses (unless the channel is first closed). This means that bitcoin in a Lightning channel is somewhat separated from bitcoin in a regular wallet, not unlike how money in a checking account is somewhat separated from money in a savings account.\nBut there are solutions to make switching between Lightning and on-chain payments more seamless.\nOne solution is Submarine Swaps . Developed by Alex Bosworth (but conceptualized by Lightning Labs CTO Olaoluwa Osuntokun even before that ), Submarine Swaps essentially let users send Lightning payments to a middleman on the Lightning Network; that middleman will send a corresponding amount of bitcoin to a regular (on-chain) Bitcoin address. It also works the other way around: users can send regular on-chain payments to the middleman; that middleman will then send a corresponding amount of bitcoin to a receiving Lightning node on the Lightning Network.\nImportantly, with Submarine Swaps, this conversion is done \\u201catomically.\\u201d Using a trick that is already embedded in the Lightning Network, the Lightning payment and the on-chain payment can effectively be linked to each other. This makes it impossible for the middleman to steal funds by not forwarding the payment. (In agreement with the users, he could charge a small fee for his service.) Splicing\nAnother solution to make the Lightning user experience more seamless is called \\u201csplicing.\\u201d In essence, splicing would let a user \\u201ctop up\\u201d funds in an existing Lightning channel, or \\u201cdrain\\u201d funds from it, potentially while keeping the channel open.\nThe idea is simple. Any Lightning channel starts with an opening transaction, which ensures that both users consent to moving the funds in the channel. The rest of the Lightning channel consists of a series of subsequent transactions exchanged between the users, which aren\\u2019t usually broadcast to the Bitcoin network. The funds in the opening transaction don\\u2019t move until the channel is closed.\nWhen \\u201csplicing in,\\u201d users take the opening transaction to instead send funds to a replacement opening transaction, which includes more bitcoin, from one or both users. Once this new opening transaction confirms on the blockchain, the channel is topped up. Until the new opening transaction is confirmed, the two users can simply update both the old and the new channel at the same time to avoid any \\u201cchannel downtime.\\u201d\nConversely, when they \\u201csplice out,\\u201d users take the opening transaction to send funds to a regular (on-chain) address, and potentially keep some of it in the channel using the same trick. This way, users can make on-chain transactions straight out of a Lightning channel. Eltoo\nEach time a new payment is made, Lightning channels between users are updated to reflect their mutual balances. The trick used to accomplish this currently includes a penalty for users who try to cheat by broadcasting an older balance (presumably because that older balance would pay them more). Cheating users can lose all the funds they have in a channel.\nThe problem is that the broadcasting of old balances is not always a cheating attempt. There are a number of scenarios in which users can accidentally broadcast an older balance; for example, because of a software bug or a backup gone wrong. In such scenarios, a complete loss of channel funds is quite a heavy punishment.\nFirst published on April 30, 2018, eltoo is the newest proposal featured in this article. \\u00a0Developed by Blockstream\\u2019s c-lightning development team \\u2014 Dr. Christian Decker and Rusty Russell \\u2014 and Lightning Labs\\u2019 Osuntokun, eltoo updates a channel by building a chain of time-locked transactions, where each transaction spends funds from the previous one to reflect the latest channel balance.\nIf one user broadcasts an older transaction (representing an older channel balance), her counterparty has some time to broadcast the latest transaction (representing the latest channel balance).\nA solution like this could work today, but it isn\\u2019t practical in cases of failure. It would require that the entire chain of transactions be broadcast and recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, more or less defeating the purpose of the Lightning Network. Decker therefore proposed a soft-fork change to the Bitcoin protocol to introduce a type of hierarchy in these types of transactions: any newer transaction can override any older transaction without requiring that all transactions in the entire chain be broadcast.\nIf this soft fork is adopted and activated on the Bitcoin network, Lightning users could create channels in both the current style and by using eltoo, depending on what they prefer. Compact Client-Side Block Filtering\nWhile the Lightning Network is a second-layer protocol, the Bitcoin blockchain itself is still relevant for Lightning users for security purposes. Specifically, Lightning users must keep an eye on the blockchain to see if specific transactions are included. This can be resource intensive, in particular for mobile users.\nA solution for this is called Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) and was described in the Bitcoin white paper. Current SPV wallets use a trick called \\u201c Bloom filters \\u201d to find out whether any relevant transactions happened.\nUnfortunately, Bloom filters are rather privacy-unfriendly, as wallets essentially reveal all of their addresses to nodes on the Bitcoin network. They also have some scaling and usability issues, as each individual SPV wallet takes up resources from at least one full Bitcoin node.\nTo tackle these issues, Lightning Labs\\u2019 Osuntokun and Alex Akselrod, along with Coinbase developer Jim Posen, designed a new solution called \\u201ccompact client-side block filtering,\\u201d which they are implementing in the Neutrino wallet.\nCompact client-side block filtering essentially inverts the trick that current SPV wallets use. Instead of wallets requesting transactions relevant to them by creating and sending out a Bloom filter to full nodes, full nodes create a filter for all Neutrino wallets. The Neutrino wallet then uses this filter to establish that the relevant transaction did not happen \\u2014 which is really all that users need to know to be sure they are not being cheated. (If the filter produces a match, Neutrino fetches the relevant block to see if the match really concerns the exact transaction instead of a false positive.)\nInterestingly, while this trick was designed with the Lightning experience in mind, it could be utilized to benefit regular light wallets as well. Watchtowers\nTo avoid being cheated, Lightning users must keep track of potential on-chain transactions that could be relevant to them.\nWhile compact client-side block filtering should make things much easier, users do need to \\u201ccheck in\\u201d once in a while to make sure they\\u2019re not being cheated. If they forget to check, it creates a security risk.\n\\u201cWatchtowers\\u201d are a potential solution that can be traced back to the Lightning Network white paper and has since been improved by Lightning Network white paper co-author and lit developer Tadge Dryja and others. As the name suggests, Watchtowers could let users outsource blockchain monitoring to third parties.\nCurrent Watchtower designs are not set in stone but would roughly work like this. Whenever users update a channel, they send a small data package to a Watchtower. The first part of this package is a \\u201chint\\u201d of a transaction they should look out for, as if it were a piece of a puzzle. This hint alone doesn\\u2019t reveal anything about the content of the transaction that the Watchtower must look out for; users don\\u2019t give up any privacy in this sense.\nHowever, if the relevant transaction shows up in the Bitcoin blockchain, the Watchtower can use the hint to recognize it. Then, with the transaction data on the blockchain itself, the Watchtower can use the second part of the package they\\u2019ve received to reconstruct the penalty transaction. This penalty transaction sends all funds in the channel to the user that is being cheated. (Or in the case of eltoo, it just broadcasts the correct channel balance.) The penalty transaction can also be designed to let the Watchtower claim part of the funds as a reward, as an incentive to do its job.\nUsers can outsource channel monitoring to multiple Watchtowers. Even if one fails, another might not, limiting the risk for Lightning users to the point where it\\u2019s arguably negligible. Atomic Multi-Path Payments\nWhat makes the Lightning Network a network is that the payment channels between users are interconnected. Users can pay across payment channels, through peers on the network that act as \\u201cmiddlemen,\\u201d to users they don\\u2019t have a direct channel open with.\nHowever, right now a single payment must be routed over a single route. If one user wants to pay 5 mBTC to another, not only must he have 5 mBTC in a single channel, all the middlemen on the route must also have 5 mBTC ready in a channel to forward. The bigger a payment is, the smaller the odds of this being the case.\nAtomic Multi-Path Payments (AMPs) could go a long way of solving this limitation. First proposed by Lightning Labs\\u2019 Osuntokun and Conner Fromknecht, the idea is simple: Larger payments can be \\u201ccut up\\u201d into smaller pieces, all of which have their own route from the payer to the payee, through different middlemen.\nA challenge to realize this solution is that Lightning payments can fail, which would in this case mean that a payment is made partially. Partial payments can easily be a bigger problem than no payment at all, however: a merchant won\\u2019t be satisfied with a partial payment, while a customer won\\u2019t be happy spending any money for nothing.\nThe solution to this problem is that AMPs use an extension to the hash time-locked contracts , which are already used along Lightning routes and involve passing secret data along a network. Using a trick similar to the one used by deterministic wallets (which generate multiple Bitcoin addresses from a single seed), the smaller pieces of a larger payment can only be redeemed by the payee if all of them are: if some secret data doesn\\u2019t make it through the route whole, the entire payment fails. Atomic Swaps\nThe Lightning Network is designed as a scaling layer for Bitcoin. But since many altcoins are software forks of Bitcoin\\u2019s codebase(s), it\\u2019s often not difficult to create similar scaling layers for these altcoins. Already, a small Litecoin Lightning Network exists, and more Lightning Networks are likely to follow.\nInterestingly, these networks don\\u2019t need to remain separated in the future.\nUsing a fundamental building block of the Lightning Network called \\u201catomic swaps\\u201d (first proposed by Tier Nolan and realized on Lightning by Lightning Labs\\u2019 Fromknecht), payment channels can be linked across different blockchains. In other words, a user can send bitcoin, and as long as a node on the network is willing to make the exchange, another user can receive the payment as litecoin.\nOf course, this also means that users can send such payments to themselves: they can send bitcoin and receive litecoin. In effect, the Lightning Network could establish a network of trustless cryptocurrency exchanges.\nFor more information on this topic, see: \\u201c Atomic Swaps: How the Lightning Network Extends to Altcoins .\\u201d Channel Factories\nThe main benefit of the Lightning Network is arguably its potential to vastly increase the upper limit of bitcoin transactions without burdening the Bitcoin network. As long as two users both have funds in their channel, they can pay each other a virtually unlimited number of times, while only requiring two on-chain transactions: one to open a payment channel and one to close it.\nStill, two transactions per payment channel could add up if Bitcoin and the Lightning Network gain more adoption over time.\nA proposal by ETH Zurich researchers Christian Decker (also of Blockstream), Roger Wattenhofer and Conrad Burchert called \\u201cChannel Factories\\u201d could further decrease the average number of on-chain transactions required per payment channel, perhaps significantly.\nLoosely based on an earlier Lightning-like proposal by Decker and Wattenhofer from 2015, Channel Factories are a type of payment channel that can exist among many users. Meanwhile, like any payment channel, a Channel Factory only ever requires two on-chain transactions. (If Schnorr signatures are implemented on Bitcoin, these transactions could be quite compact, even if it involves many users.)\nThe Channel Factories can, in turn, act sort of like \\u201csub-channels\\u201d for the Lightning Network. Participants within a Channel Factory can open and close a virtually unlimited number of Lightning channels with each other, without requiring any additional on-chain transactions. By doing so, they could, in theory, bring the number of required on-chain transactions for the Lightning Network down by a magnitude.

However, the price managed to close slightly up from its open. It is now just an hour into June 7th UTC. CoinDesk analysis A CoinDesk article posted at 11:10 UTC this morning claims that bitcoin's price is still operating in bearish territory. According to technical charts only a move above $7,780 would bring the bulls back into play. As the article was posted, the BTC price on Bitfinex was $7,591. Bitcoin was on the defensive Tuesday and looked as if it would test the recent low of $7,040. However, this did not happen as the decline stopped at $7,372 and the price began to increase rising above the $7,600 level on Asian markets this morning, The bear movement appears to have exhausted itself. The article finds no clear reason why it should do so but it fits a historical pattern in that on the sixth of each month the BTC price appears to change direction in favor of the weaker side. If this pattern is followed the BTC price could rise today. A fear on the part of the bears that they could get trapped on the wrong side of market movement might also have kept them on the sidelines in spite of the fact that the price is still in bearish territory as shown on the four-hour chart. The BTC price appears to be treading water in bearish territory and is trading within a narrow range. The 4-hour chart rising-wedge breakdown remains in play as long as the price trades below $7,780 the June 3 high. This means there could still be a downside break and this could accelerate if the support level of $7,372 is breached. The 50-candle moving average (MA) is now rising and this favors the bulls. The 100-candle moving average is now flatlined and has also shed its bearish bias so this means the odds of breaking through the $7,372 support level are low, The CoinDesk outlook Based on its analysis CoinDesk predicts: \"A high volume break above $7,780 would add credence to the quirky \"6th of the month\" pattern and signal a bullish trend reversal. In this case, prices will likely rise to the 10-week MA, currently located at $8,310 .A break below $7,372 would put the focus back on the rising-wedge breakdown and allow a drop to $7,040. The present situation BTC opened the day at $7,616,54 and reached a high during the day of $7,693.16. The low was $7,494.54. The low did not even reach $7,372 nor did the high even reach $7,780. However the closing price of $7,655.98 was about 40 dollars above the open. Just one hour in to June 7 UTC the BTC price was $7,717,36 so the price has breached the $7,700 level early in the day. It remains to be seen if this trend can continue.

Opinions seem to be quite divided, although that is only natural as the market keeps moving side-ways. Boring as hell. What about technology? What’s new? In terms of new and exciting developments happening on the bitcoin community, there are a few different ones I would like to discuss today. Again, I’m not focusing in other projects like Iota or Eos, as their product is either in testnet, training wheels or was just released. What’s more important, to discuss how amazing new ideas will solve scalability, like PoS, DPoS and DAG’s, or to focus on what is being done at the bitcoin core development? Both! Yes, I agree there are many different projects worth mentioning and I will write an article discussing the ones I consider to be the most promising, their advantages and problems. But for now, let’s focus on Bitcoin. Not because of price, but due to adoption: no other cryptocurrency has as many users, developers and infrastructure support. Maybe Ethereum, which is closing in, but still Bitcoin is the most widely spread cryptocurrency and the base layer for the entire market. Today I will be discussing ways bitcoin is being improved and infrastructure changes happening in the near future, that can potentially help by lowering fees, by improving ease-of-use, by creating off-chain payments solutions or simply by adding more transactions to each block. There are ways of implementing each solution separately, but some core technology must be widely adopted, like Segregated Witnessing (SegWit) . There will be three main topics I will approach today: batching, schnorr signatures and atomic swaps. I’ve been discussing the Lightning Network too much and I want to check different potential solutions, less prone to centralization. Speaking of the devil , that’s definitely one of the features I believe we should be trying to avoid. Bitcoin’s purpose is to be fully decentralized, so any action, update or improvement that won’t go in that direction should be disregarded. Ready for what’s coming? Batching Although this is obvious for techies, it doesn’t mean it’s an easy solution to implement on a massive scale. First we need to understand how bitcoin works. Each transaction is based on one input and multiple outputs. Meaning, with a single transaction you can transfer money to multiple people, for example. What’s really interesting is how data flows in the blockchain and what we can do with that information. Let’s say I create a transaction which weight is equal to 40 bytes and that said transaction only contains one input and one output. With batching you can aggregate transactions and literally save up space, so when I add an extra output, instead of the total weight of the transaction = 80 bytes (doubling down), it only adds, for example, 20 bytes more. This means that instead of creating single transactions, you can do one with a series of different outputs. Plus, each additional output does not double down the total transaction weight, meaning there’s economies of scale at play. These are very good news, as this feature can also be a way to help improving scaling. It won’t increase the number of transactions, but allows for a higher number of outputs per input. This is what batching is: aggregating many different transactions into a single transaction, by adding multiple outputs per input. Would you like a more visual representation of the savings? As you can see the number of bytes significantly reduces each time another payment (output) is added in a single transaction (for each input). It’s really cool if you’re a business or someone who makes recurring transfers, like sending money abroad.With batching there’s considerably more space in the block for more transactions with more outputs. Exchanges do this, of course; hopefully there will be tools available soon, so that single customers can easily select transaction outputs they would like to batch together on the same payment. How can this be used in real-life? Imagine you have a company and you do cryptocurrency payments. Instead of doing 5 different transactions in order to pay salaries or suppliers, you could chose to batch all payments in the same transaction (input) and set 5 different outputs, which would allow you to pay way less fees and make the overall block smaller. You already got it, right? This is a very straightforward example, but it actually works pretty well. You still need to do it from a command terminal (I think), as there is no way to do it with most wallet apps or exchanges’ wallets (blockchain.info, coinbase, etc). Still, learning how to do it might be worth the effort if you send money to many different addresses. Schnorr Signatures This subject might be a bit complex for the average non-technical reader and again, I’m not an expert. If you really want to get acquainted with the math behind it, check this video from a lead developer working on Schnorr Signatures. It’s still quite technical but, nevertheless, it’s the best explanation I’ve found so far. I’ll try to make this introduction as simple as possible, so you don’t run away. What are Schnorr Signatures? How can Schnorr Signatures improve scalability? Right, first things first; This is the model you usually see to explain how transactions work, correct? Bitcoin’s blockchain registers unspent transaction outputs; that’s all it does.When you send some bitcoin, you’re basically sending a message with an input which can be distributed between many outputs (as we’ve seen in batching). This is called the simple UTXO model. Now, there’s small features you can add, like allowing for different signatures to approve a transaction, for example. Multi-signature (or multisig) transactions require the participation (signature) of multiple participants. Each multisig transaction can only be posted if, and only if, the require signatures are present. This means that in order for any of the outputs to be used, they need to be unlocked. The really cool feature introduced by Schnorr Signatures is that it aggregates the signatures needed into only one signature (or signature hash, to be more precise) which can be used as proof to unlock the transaction outputs. Using Schnorr Signatures, the unlocking script would simply have 1 signature representing an aggregate of each participant’s signature. You can guess what happens: On-chain transaction size is reduced Faster validation for each transaction Improved privacy for participants of a Multi-Signature wallet There are, of course, attack vectors that could potentially compromise a one signature scheme. I’m not going into details but you can check some more information here . Atomic swaps I absolutely love the concept of atomic swaps . To better explain it, we can use the usual example: Luke and Vader want to trade Rebel and Imperial tokens. As Luke is in Tatooine and Vader on the Death Star, it is difficult to do it physically, plus, Luke’s pretty sure he would be chased by Imperials enforcers, so he kind of wants to avoid that. Luke could send the Rebel token and hope Vader would send the Imperial token, or it could go the other way around. This means the option would be for Luke and Vader to trust each other. That’s also not happening as Luke can’t turn Vader to the Light side and Vader can’t turn Luke to the dark side. They’re basically at a cross-road. What to do, what to do? The third option is to get an escrow, so someone both trust or an agency which holds the tokens. Only after both approve, the escrow sends tokens to Luke and Vader, which were previously locked. The problem is that escrows are expensive and the trust problem does not get solved. Centralized exchanges, like Bittrex, Binance, etc are also escrows as they keep tokens in their own personal wallets. How can we fix it this problem? Atomic Swaps simply allow for some cryptocurrencies (based on the language SCRIPT, such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Vertcoin, etc) to be automatically exchanged between one another. Using the example above, Luke locks Rebels tokens in a digital box which only Vader can open with his digital signature, and Vader does the same thing. Immediately after Vader opens the box Luke will be able to open Vader’s box and get his Imperial tokens. This works because opening one lockbox effectively gives the other party the ability to open the other lockbox. Because each lockbox requires both the key and the signature, both lockboxes are essentially secure.In case something goes wrong or one party backs out in the middle of the process, the lockboxes are constructed in a way as to refund respectively both agents, if nobody opened the lockboxes in 48 and 24 hours respectively. Atomic swaps reduce on-chain privacy, as users transactions can be linked cross-chain. But this technology can also be used with off-chain protocols, like the Lightning Network, which can also help protecting privacy. Better yet, imagine this technology working with bitcoin to privacy coins. You could, potentially, use those coins privacy to mask your bitcoin transactions. If you’re worried none of these improvements matter until we “fix” transaction throughput you might want to look at the problem from a different angle. I understand the current hype is more about “ how many transactions per second does your blockchain do, bro?! ”. Security, apparently, is not the main concern anymore. WHY?!?! Do you really think it’s easier to start-over and create a USD 11 billion dollar project like EOS, than fixing problems with the most used and adopted cryptocurrency out there? I’m not saying other projects shouldn’t be given a chance, especially considering they use different technology, have a different purpose and economic incentives. But man, bluntly believing coin X or Y will fix everything because some smart dude said so, doesn’t seem a very productive use of your time. I hope most projects succeed as I have been investing full force in many of them, as well. The question here is not about system performance (how many transactions per second). What we should be worrying about is network performance. How many people do we need to secure the entire network? How many people use this cryptocurrency on a daily basis? What’s the network reach? How can incentives be aligned with consensus in a long-term perspective? Do you really think any project that claims to do a gazillion transactions per second won’t have security issues? I’m pretty sure they will.\nIf you want to understand how serious you should be worried about security instead of performance, check this out . It shows how cheap it is to actually perform a 51% double spend attack on some blockchains by using Nice-hash, a cloud mining pool. My goal here is not to trash other projects, as I’m definitely not a bitcoin maximalist. I want to share as much information as possible so that you too can critique and question other ideas.

The idea of a cashless country, destroying their monetary unit is not what a country's government wants. The government will be at ease if the users are responsible enough and understanding enough to know the limits of a cryptocurrency in every country. From there, probably more countries will see potential and credit in bitcoin. Government is there to control and secure their citizens (especially from unstable currencies ...and probably scams and hacking) that's their job.\nIt is very unlikely that we are going to see bitcoin collapsing the banking system, banks will have a lot of time to do a lot of things, they could try to pass laws against bitcoin and the governments may agree on that on the grounds that bitcoin is a threat to the current economic system and the well being of their citizens or they may choose to adapt to this new circumstances and keep doing business as usual, after all banks do not have any ideology they only care about the money.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T18:53:41.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "664198b9a51d0ad8186950025401f060cfa34a80", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSaMU5e985FKloqYuGazzexM6XEMoqVA3e4.QXuz1CeWbBhi7.fqU1zm3RNRPZNpSZ_.d19kxqKj2F8QBNsDtPq1g1nJSTXKLaXmtP1ym_pu1MUxCF98yahg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "r/CryptoMarkets", "title": "Bitcoin is the worlds ONLY liquid asset whos supply cannot be increased as demand rises.

Bitcoin Price Rebound to $7,800 Could Confirm Short-Term Rally", "text": "The bitcoin price has increased from $7,300 to $7,600 over the past 24 hours, sparking optimism regarding the short-term growth of bitcoin. A break to $7,800 could confirm a short-term rally for bitcoin while a drop below the $7,500 mark could lead it back to the $7,300 region, making $6,000 a possibility, yet again. Low Volume The price trend of bitcoin and predictions of analysts are conditional as of current due to the low volume of BTC. While BTC has prevented a further drop to the $6,000 region as it rebounded from $7,300 to to $7,600, the volume remains nearly identical to yesterday. Although the valuation of the cryptocurrency market has improved, the state of the market remains the same. A break to $7,800 would effectively exceed the descending one-month trend line extending from May 5 to June 5, signifying a potential rally for BTC in both the short to mid-term. The corrective rally of BTC from the $7,040 has ended at $7,500, but based on the daily candle chart of BTC, and given the stability of BTC over the past seven days, it is possible that BTC gains momentum in the upcoming days and re-enter the $8,000 region. On March 20, BTC broke a descending trendline from March 4, with a strong spike in volume and price. Within five days, the price of BTC increased from $7,800 to $9,200. However, in a period of 15 days, the price of BTC dropped from $9,200 to $6,500, even though the corrective rally was supported with strong volume. If BTC can record a gradual increase in volume and value throughout June and establish a strong foundation for a potential mid-term rally, it is possible that BTC returns to its previous levels by the end of 2018, possibly back to $20,000. But, if BTC cannot sustain its momentum and falls below the $7,000 mark once again, a drop to the lower end of $6,000 is still a possibility. Mid-Term Optimism This week, Nathaniel Popper from The New York Times reported that Susquehanna International Group, one of the biggest investment firms in the world, has already started to facilitate bitcoin trades. “We believe that this technology and this asset class is going to change some facet of financial services, and we think it is going to exist forever,” Bart Smith, the head of digital assets at Susquehanna, said. The firm, which first experimented with BTC in 2014, has started to process the settlement of bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash futures, enabling institutional investors and large-scale traders to invest in the cryptocurrency market. The entrance of firms like Susquehanna into the cryptocurrency sector could lead to a domino effect in Wall Street and the global financial sector. While investors are uncertain about the short-term future of the market, the majority of traders are bullish on the long-term growth of bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market.

Unfortunately, I’ve ruined it for you by telling you who wins, but there is more chance of me riding a seahorse than someone from India reading this, begging the question, “What am I writing about it for?”\nMmm…\nOne thing that Lovgren said she adored was the feeling that she was involved in a sport because of the team concept, a point the co-founder, Amit Burman made in the press release when he said his mission was to raise the prominence of poker in India to the same level as the other top sports in the country.\nDSports came into being in February 2017. Available sports include cricket, football and esports.\nRaj Kundra in the News Again For All The Wrong Reasons\nWhat is it they say about Polar Bear shit and Polar Bears?\nWherever you find one you’ll see the other?\nLook, I have never met Raj Kundra , nor do I think I ever will. I am sure he is a lovely chap and all of that, but man does his name get connected with a lot of bad news in the Indian media. Either he is a rotten egg, the press is out to get him, or he is the unluckiest entrepreneur in his country.\nThe tale of woe this time revolves around India’s most significant cryptocurrency scam to date. In April of this year, authorities in India arrested Amit Bhardwaj, the founder of a bitcoin firm called GainBitcoin, in connection with a Ponzi scheme that robbed 100,000 investors of cash looking to get into the cryptocurrency hype.\nOnce the authorities began sniffing around, Bhardwaj closed his company and fled to Dubai and Bangkok before being arrested trying to reenter customs in Delhi.\nKundra’s involvement is unclear, as there is no word from the authorities, but Kundra himself has come forward to clear his name. The Match Indian Poker League founder released a statement clearing himself of any wrongdoing, suggesting the only reason the Enforcement Directorate (ED) called him in for questioning is that Bhardwaj tried to buy a Match IPL franchise in Bitcoin , but Kundra turned him down.\nThe other person who has ties with bad boy Bhardwaj is Kundra’s wife, Shilpa Shetty, who, according to Quartz , provided GainBitcoin with her endorsement.\nThe Match IPL concluded Season 2 in March, and as you would expect, it was under suspicious circumstances as matches were played using a deck of cards and not mobile devices as we have grown accustomed to with the Match IPL product.

They are much cheaper than Bitcoin for now. It is so hard to decide which to buy . Some are in good promos, to buy or invest to it while it is cheaper and sell when the price Will getting high. Is it a good idea to buy while we can not afford yet Bitcoin?\nYes, we can earn on bitcoin, and can also on cheap and profitable tokens or coins. It all depends on your desires. Probably it will be better to invest a bit in bitcoin and a little bit of altcoyin. If the crypto-currency market goes up, it will rise after bitcoin. After him, all the altcoys will be drawn. Therefore in bitcoin while you can invest and it should still bring a good profit. However, investing in it is already a little risky. The altcoyins have their own risk, especially in the little-known cheap tokens. However, they can bring even greater profits than bitcoin. Diversification of the portfolio in each case must be calculated independently, depending on the specific circumstances.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T02:46:53.014+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 30508, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=1700", "requestsLeft": 645}
