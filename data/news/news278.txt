health service’s website that may have seen private patient data accessed by the hackers.\nChairperson Sue Carrick, and CEO Ann Brassil wrote to the clients today saying the Anzac Day cyberattack “may have compromised our online databases”.\nThe databases held information from clients who contacted the organisation seeking appointments or leaving feedback via its website in the past two-and-a-half years.\nThe pair apologised to the clients involved, adding that they have “no evidence that this information has been used by the cyber attackers”.\nCarrick said Family Planning was “one of several agencies targeted by these cyber criminals on Anzac Day” seeking a bitcoin ransom, and their website was secured by 10am the following day.\n“More sensitive medical records held internally were never under threat,” they said.\nThe service’s website is currently down for “a security update” and a review of its information security is currently underway.\nFamily Planning NSW informed the Australian Federal Police of the attack and says it is now working to standards set by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner in an effort to ensure its data is secure.\nBusiness Insider has contacted the Department of Home Affairs about the other agencies targeted in the attack but has not received a response.\nWe’ll update you if we hear back from them.

Until this year, there was only one way to celebrate this unofficial holiday: order a pizza, pay with Bitcoin, and enjoy. This year, however, we will also see Bitcoin Cash Pizza Day. It is a bit more difficult to find merchants accepting BCH, but that is where the BCHPizza website will prove to be a valuable resource. BCHPizza is an Interesting Project\nEven though people all over the world have celebrated Bitcoin Pizza Day for many years now, it is not necessarily easy to find merchants that accept Bitcoin payments these days. The world’s leading cryptocurrency has lost a fair amount of appeal in this regard, but it is still possible to use websites such as Takeaway.com for this purpose.\nFor cryptocurrency enthusiasts who wish to celebrate Bitcoin Pizza Day with Bitcoin Cash, the situation becomes a bit more complicated. Thankfully, a dedicated directory has been created to keep track of places accepting Bitcoin Cash payments in exchange for pizza.\nThere is also an incentive offered by the platform . Anyone can post a Bitcoin Cash bounty to get a certain pizza shop in a particular city to accept BCH as payment. As soon as the location officially enables BCH payments, the individual responsible can claim the bounty. Getting such businesses to stick with Bitcoin Cash will be rather challenging, as Bitcoin has seen similar struggles in this regard. Even so, it is an interesting initiative which will certainly be appreciated by community members.\nSo far, the website lists various locations throughout the US, Canada, Europe, Central and South America, and elsewhere. It is evident that a lot of businesses are rather interested in supporting Bitcoin Cash payments, although those locations are rather spread out, especially in Europe. There is a surprising number of businesses in Venezuela, Mexico, and Israel which will sell you pizza in exchange for Bitcoin Cash.\nAll of this goes to show that acceptance of Bitcoin Cash is growing steadily. Although buying pizzas with BCH is not necessarily the use case that will make this altcoin go mainstream anytime soon, it indicates that things are evolving in the right direction. There is still a lot of work to be done before Bitcoin Cash can rival Bitcoin, but at least users will be able to celebrate Bitcoin Pizza Day with their preferred version of Bitcoin.\nWhile no one will deny that Bitcoin Cash is a very successful and popular altcoin, there is still plenty of work to be done. Celebrating Bitcoin Cash Pizza Day may become a trend in the near future, which can only be considered a good thing. Bringing cryptocurrency enthusiasts together during events like these is what crypto is all about. About The Author Jdebunt\nJP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

We live our lives staring at our devices rather than talking to each other or watching where we are going.\nIt’s not good for us and, according to Pew Research, is responsible for more and more suicides, particularly amongst the young. Pew analysis found that the generation of teens they call the “iGen” – those born after 1995 – is much more likely to experience mental health issues than their millennial predecessors.\nSecond is privacy. Facebook and other internet giants are abusing our privacy rights in order to generate ad revenues, as demonstrated by Cambridge Analytica, but they’re not the only one.\nGoogle, Alibaba, Tencent, Amazon and more are all making bucks from analyzing our digital footprints and we let them because we’re enjoying it, as I blogged about recently .\nThird is that the power of these firms is too much. When six firms – Google (Alphabet), Amazon, Facebook, Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu – have almost all the information on all the citizens of the world held digitally, it creates a backlash and a fear. I’ve thought about this much and believe that it will drive a new decentralized internet, which is something that Tim Berners-Lee and other internet founders are working actively to create right now.\nFinally, there is the influence that these internet giants have over news and beliefs. How do you know the truth anymore?\nIn fact, technology is now so good that almost any dead person can come back to life. This was illustrated for me by the advert for Galaxy Chocolate with Audrey Hepburn. I was amazed at how good the lookalike for her was only to find out recently that it is her . Superimposed over a lookalike model is Audrey Hepburn’s face.\nThe ability to trick us into believing things today that are not true is incredible, so watch out.\nIs it any wonder that technology firms are under the microscope when they are the least regulated industry in the world? According to Bank of America , technology is the least regulated industry sector with just 27,000 regulations, versus 215,000 for manufacturing and 128,000 for the financial sector. As technology matures, so will its oversight.\nAnd that’s why the most feared person in Silicon Valley is Margrethe Vestager , Europe’s Antitrust Enforcer and a celebrity regulator who inspired the lead character in a Danish TV series .\nSomeone needs to watch our backs in these days of data as an asset, and she is the person doing it. “We’re really making an effort to understand the different laws of data — how it works as an asset, how it influences the marketplace,” she said in a recent interview. Too right.\nData is the new money and if regulators haven’t recognised this, then they’re sleeping on the job. And the USA is doing a poor job on this, as demonstrated by those Bank of America regulatory stats. This will change as America has also woken up to the addiction, abuse of privacy, power and influence these tech firms have. In particular, as these firms are moving into adjacent areas of finance like payments and credit, they will be increasingly regulated like banks. In the meantime, watch your data, as no one else will.

But the broad outlines emerged on stage.\nLubin bet Song \"any amount of bitcoin\" that five years in the future, the blockchain space will include some number of applications - perhaps five - that have earned a yet-to-be-defined number of users.\nBitcoin maximalist Song took the bet.\nTo explain how things came to a head, it's necessary to back up about 20 minutes. Amber Baldet, former blockchain program lead at JPMorgan, had unveiled her new project Clovyr, a decentralized app (or dapp) store that gives users access to projects tied to both public and permissioned, more enterprise-focused blockchain networks.\nShe then brought Song and Lubin onstage for a conversation that immediately caught fire, with Baldet asking what Song thought about Clovyr.\nHis reaction was brutal: \"I didn't see anything other than buzzwords.\"\nThe reason, he argued, was an insurmountable disconnect between centralized enterprises and supposedly decentralized applications, which Song dismissed as \"magical blockchain dust.\"\nA back-and-forth among Baldet, Lubin and Song ensued. Lubin sarcastically predicted that the next five years of cryptocurrency innovation would see nothing but \"bitcoin 1.0.\" Song doubled down, saying \"I don't really see much of this stuff gaining much traction,\" he said. Bitcoin, he argued, is \"the real innovation here.\"\nSo, Lubin issued a challenge: \"I'll bet you any amount of bitcoin that you're wrong.\"\nFor now, the number of bitcoin is unknown, as are other terms of the bet. But Song accepted the wager, and Lubin tweeted at Song shortly afterward: Well that was fun.

So the New York-based startup goTenna , founded in 2012 by Brazilian siblings Daniela and Jorge Perdomo, is partnering with Samourai Wallet to launch an Android app this summer that allows users to send bitcoin payments without an internet connection.\nAnnounced Monday, the txTenna app will enable users to sync up their mobile with a goTenna device, which costs $179 per pair, then toggle the wallet app's settings to transact offline and send the bitcoin.\n\"You need to be able to spend your bitcoin even in disaster areas,\" goTenna engineer Richard Myers told CoinDesk, citing the Perdomo siblings' recent work in Puerto Rico, where goTenna devices helped people reconnect after Hurricane Maria. \"As long as you have a way to charge your phone, you can be up and meshed and communicating.\"\nThe signal needs to be within roughly a mile of another goTenna device to relay the message across the mesh network, a decades-old system for using the internet without wifi or a landline. So far, goTenna has sold more than 100,000 devices that let users tap into the mesh network.\nIf the offline bitcoin user is within a mile of another active device, the transaction could bounce across the mesh until it reaches a user with an internet connection.\n\"It offers an alternative that is more censorship-resistant,\" Myers said, adding:\n\"It's going to obscure who you are and where you're at when making these transactions. So that's a big privacy advantage there.\"\nThis system uses a free, unlicensed radio frequency, and it isn't the first partnership to explore such potential for cryptocurrency networks. It takes a village\nStepping back, a variety of projects since the Cold War have used relatively cheap and mobile radio setups to broadcast across firewalls and oceans.\nLast year, renowned cryptographer Nick Szabo and blockchain engineer Elaine Ou published a proposal detailing how weak-signal radio transmissions could help boost security and the diversity of connections across the bitcoin network.\nThen, in December, after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission repealed \"net neutrality,\" fans of ethereum, the world's second most popular blockchain network, started flocking to mesh network technology meetups.\nWhen net neutrality rules expire next month, internet service providers will no longer be barred from favoring or blocking specific websites and communities. It's an opportune moment for censorship-resistant tools for bitcoin transactions.\nPerhaps the most important aspect of txTenna is that the cryptocurrency wallet will be an open source project.\nIndeed, it was Samourai Wallet's open source communication tools on Github that first inspired goTenna's team to reach out to the bitcoin startup. The same txTenna code could theoretically be applied to iOS wallet applications as well.\nAs Myers explained:\n\"It absolutely could work with any software wallet and they [Samourai Wallet developers] are not writing it specifically for the Samourai wallet anyway. It will be something any wallet provider could send transactions through.\"\nImage of Daniela and Jorge Perdomo with goTenna devices via goTenna The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

If anything, the State Bank has barred commercial banks and financial firms from dealing in cryptocurrency which, of course, makes life harder for local exchanges. Individual traders, however, are finding alternative ways to acquire or sell cryptocurrencies, defying the warnings and the prohibitions.\nAlso read: India’s Supreme Court Keeps Ban on Banks’ Crypto Services, For Now Central Bank Can’t Ban Cryptocurrency in Pakistan\nPakistan’s experience with cryptocurrencies offers another example of how ineffective financial authorities can be when trying to fill a legal vacuum with prohibitive administrative measures. Central banks often forget they are neither parliaments, nor governments, and their regulatory overreach cannot legitimately substitute the normal legal process. The recent decision of the State Bank of Pakistan to ban crypto-related activities proves that observation.\nIn early April, the SBP issued a circular on the “prohibition of dealing in virtual currencies”, right after a similar measure by the Reserve Bank of India, the regional rival. Unlike their Indian colleagues, who gave banks and traders three months to comply, Pakistani central bankers imposed the ban with immediate effect. SBP said virtual currencies and tokens were not legal tender and reminded it had not authorized any individual or entity to issue, sell, purchase, or exchange any such coins in Pakistan. All banks, microfinance entities, payment system operators and service providers were “advised to refrain” from dealing in cryptocurrencies.\nThe local market is by no means comparable to India’s booming crypto sector. According to Danyal Manzar, CEO of Pakistan’s first bitcoin exchange Urdubit, about 100 different digital coins were being traded daily across all mediums before the ban. His trading platform decided to close down permanently following the prohibition. “The decision was made in haste. Ample time should always be provided for a proper shutdown. But we respect the SBP’s decision,” he told The Express Tribune .\nImmediately after the ban, Urdubit warned its clients to withdraw both their fiat and their crypto funds. A month later, however, some of its users still have bitcoins in their accounts on the platform. Manzar believes that those who want to trade will continue to do so because “alternative ways still exist that will continue to be tapped no matter how risky they are.” He thinks that cryptocurrencies would only disrupt the stock market, and not the entire monetary system. “About 80 to 85% of the traders from stock exchanges came to try their luck in virtual currency,” he said. Localbitcoins PKR Trade Spikes After Ban\nRecently, Pakistani crypto traders told Asia Times that the central bank’s move initially caused a dip in the crypto market but the volume of trading has gradually picked up after alternative trading methods were discovered. “Traders realized that the SBP hasn’t, and can’t ban cryptocurrency in Pakistan,” Lahore-based trader Majid Ali commented. “What the State Bank has done is ban banks from entertaining crypto, so if you’re not dealing via banks, you [still] can own and trade virtual currency in Pakistan, which comes under the IT ministry,” he explained.\nIndeed, as the chart of the weekly Localbitcoins volume from Coin Dance shows, trading has spiked after the release of the circular. It peaked in the week of April 28 to more than 163 million Pakistani Rupee (>1.4 million USD), almost reaching December-January all-time highs.\nThe price of Pakistan’s first and only cryptocurrency, Pakcoin, which was explicitly mentioned in the SBP’s prohibition, has also jumped – by over 60% since the ban. Pakcoin founder Abu Shaheer says that the central bank’s measure has actually worked in favor of his crypto by “serving to expose Pakcoin’s name [and] more people got interested in it.” The digital token is already used for mobile phone credit top-ups. Islamabad to Prohibit “All Forms of Virtual Currency” After All\nSources from Pakistan’s Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication have told Asia Times that the government in Islamabad does plan to formally declare cryptocurrencies illegal in the country. “We have forwarded our recommendation for a ban on all forms of virtual currency trading, and proper legislation is being worked on,” a government official said.\nAccording to crypto trader Majid Ali, however, while the legislation is likely to hit trading, there are alternatives for dealing with cryptocurrencies. “The government of Pakistan can’t stop the trade in an international commodity that is accepted in other countries,” he said. Majid also warned that the ban actually opens transfer channels that can be used for illegal purposes.\nDo you think that bans imposed by central banks can really stop cryptocurrency trade?

The company has so far allowed lending and borrowing of loans in Bitcoin.\nThe company is now using Bitcoin to facilitate international transfer of fiat loans as well, Reuters reports .\nThe loaned amount will be transferred to the borrower using the Bitcoin’s blockchain, only to be converted back to their country’s currency as soon as the transaction is processed.\nUsing Bitcoin to transfer the loans will purportedly make the transfer of loan quicker and cheaper in comparison to the existing transfer means.\nCurrently, most of the world’s banking institutions rely on the SWIFT network to facilitate international transactions, but that comes with several shortcomings.\nUsers end up paying several fees for each transaction they make through the network. These include transaction fees levied by the correspondent and recipient banks, and currency exchange rates charged by the banks.\nIt is also worth noting that SWIFT doesn’t actually enable the transfer of money, but only allows secure communication about payment orders between the banks.\nAt the time of its launch, SWIFT had revolutionized international transactions with its Bank Identified Codes (BICs), now popularly called ‘SWIFT codes’, which made transactions a lot securer and faster.\nWith blockchain technology, there’s a promise to make this process further efficient.\nIn fact, the Ripple Transaction Protocol associated with the world’s third largest cryptocurrency Ripple, was developed as a blockchain-based alternative to SWIFT — however researchers have cast doubts on the long-term efficacy of its protocol.\nTransactions with cryptocurrencies can be made in a manner of seconds without huge transaction fees involved. There’s only one intermediary that needs to be paid, which are the miners confirming the transaction.\nBitbond’s development of a marketplace that relies on Bitcoin to transfer loans in fiat is interesting, but even Bitcoin currently suffers from high transaction fees and longer time span for processing the transactions.\nThe successful implementation of Lightening Network can change this, or other cryptocurrencies can be explored as a means for facilitating the transactions.

Bitcoin can be said to be a particular application of Blockchain, the technology upon which the cryptocurrency sits upon. To break it down, blockchain is a ‘data structure’, and by data structure it is meant that it is an encapsulation of data and methods to operate on that data. The nearest known data structure analogised to Blockchain could be a Linked List. Each node in a linked list points to the next node. In a blockchain, each block points to the previous block. Each block contains transactions , and each transaction is an exchange of a digital asset. In case of Bitcoin, that digital asset is a coin having a monetary value. Now, when A sends money to B , the record of this transaction (this exchange of value) is added to the block for anyone in future to check the validity of B being the true owner of that value. When a certain number of transactions are added to a block, it gets linked to the blockchain. The number of blocks keep adding to its length. Photo by Andre Francois on Unsplash You might ask, how is it different from fiat currency? Money isn’t exactly real. It is something societies agree to assign value to. Something each person agrees to have a particular value, including the government. Fiat currency is money backed by the government. Government owns it. Government regulates it. Two people exchanging a ₹10 note, (1) Promise to pay the bearer the sum (as it is written on the note) and (2) This very promise is signed by the Government (the Governor of RBI). Now imagine you had the responsibility of creating a digital money system. You’d replace this Government entity with someother regulating entity that would still operate on norms set by the government but the transactions would be digital. You won’t be giving a printed note, you’d be sending a transaction in the form of bits through the Internet. You’d probably have two problems to solve: How to prevent double spending ( A gives ₹10 to B , A gives the same ₹10 to B ) How to secure it from hackers Double spending can be prevented by issuing serial numbers to each token/coin/note (which you see on a printed note as well). Security could be employed to the place that is issuing these serial numbers. So you come up with a solution, a central authority that issues serial numbers, signs each transaction and keeps a record of all the transactions ever made. You get a single break point for the system. Break the server, break the system. One could track all the transactions made by a single person by tracking the serial numbers This isn’t cash, but this isn’t anonymous either. Blind Signature David Chaum proposed in 1983 a system called Blind Signature which successfully de-linked from a central server and yet allowed a central authority to prevent double spending. The goal achieved was an anonymous system that prevented double spending. A few years (1998) after Chaum’s publication of Digital Cash, Chaum in collaboration with two other cryptographers, Fiat and Naor proposed an improvement upon the previous protocol with an introduction to offline electronic cash system . The focus shifted from prevention of double spending to detection of it. At a high level what the system achieved was this: every digital coin issued encodes the owner’s identity but in such a way that no one except the owner himself can decode it. Every time you spend your coin, the recipient will require the sender to decode a random subset of the decoding and they will keep a record of this. This decoding isn’t enough to allow them to determine your identity. But if the coin is ever double spent, both recipients will go to the bank to redeem their notes eventually, and then there is a high probability that the bank can decipher the original identity by putting the two subsets together. Moving away from centralization Blind Signatures, although was a genius idea, still incorporated centralization. You get a single break point even if it is anonymous. Decentralization meant, no single authority assigning serial numbers yet a method to prevent double spending and a system that is completely secure. To prevent double spending without a central authority you’d need a record of transactions. If we have 3 transactions, lets say T1, T2 and T3 that occured in that very order, every node in the network should be able to verify that T1 occurred in the past of T2 and T3 occurred in the future of T2. This might be a trivial problem to solve for documents created by hand, but in the digital realm, there is no concept of time. Time-Stamping Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta in 1991 proposed a method of determining the creation history of a particular document. The method certified when a particular document was first created or last modified. In lay-man terms, time-stamping is a little something added to the document which proves that the document has been issued before or after a certain time. In the scheme proposed, there is a time-stamping service, to which clients send their documents to be time-stamped. The server receives the document, signs it with the current time and links it to the previous document, and issues a certificate with this information. The term ‘blockchain’ An efficiency improvement was proposed to the previous time-stamping scheme ( paper ). Linking every single document presented a scaling issue when the number of documents increased. Instead of linking documents individually, a number of documents were collected in blocks, which were further linked. Within each block documents were further linked in a tree structure. (The term ‘blockchain’ was proposed in this paper) This decreased the amount of checking needed to verify that a particular document appears at a particular point in the history of the system. How to mint and regulate? The solution presented by Haber and Stornetta solved the double spending problem in a decentralized system. Which means a central authority preventing double-spending was not required anymore. But who would provide serial numbers to the coins? Or, how would the coins be minted, and how would they be regulated? Proof of Work Dwork and Naor in 1992 (a similar idea was proposed by Adam Back in 1997) proposed a potential solution to email-spam, broken down as follows: The sender solves a computational puzzle each time before sending an email the recipient’s email program simply ignores the email if it does not have a solution to the puzzle attached The assumptions being: Computationally costly for a spammer generating hundreds of email at a given moment Checking of the puzzle should not involve solving the puzzle, meaning, the receiver should be easily able to check the solution Each puzzle being completely independent of other puzzles The difficulty level should be adjustable by the recipients These properties were achieved by making use of a cryptographic hash functions to generate the puzzles. Minting and Regulation The functions of the central authority could now be decentralized: Double Spending — TimeStamping (a trusted third party is still required here) Minting and Regulation of coins — Proof of Work Earlier (before Bitcoin) proposals that employed the above two methods to propose a completely decentralized system of exchange of money were: B-money (Wei-Dai, 1998) and Bitgold (Nick Szabo, 2005) Characteristics were as follows: Anyone can mint money (making use of a hashcash like system) There exists a peer-to-peer network Each node maintains a personal ledger (no global ledger is maintained) Each node has its own record of what it perceives everybody’s balance to be. Rely on timestamping services, that sign off on the creation or transfer of money It is worth mentioning that B-money and Bitgold were informal proposals, latter published as a blog post while the former in a mailing list. The proposals were nevertheless important because they served as setting the stage for Bitgoin by glossing over the issues which were eventually solved by the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, Satoshi Nakamoto (2008) ( paper ) Satoshi Nakamoto not only proposed a robust system, he (there is no known gender for Satoshi Nakamoto) gave a working model for it. Bitcoin (1) Prevented double spending, (2) Didn’t require a trusted third party and (3) Was strong enough for users to trust. The system can be broken down as follows: The digital asset is the coin that is transferable between nodes An electronic coin is dened as a chain of electronic signatures — sending a coin/digital asset to another person basically means sending a signed hash of all the previous transactions with the public key of the next owner. Each transaction is publicly announced for any node to check the validity of any transaction. To accomplish this, without a TTP (Trusted Third Party), A timestamp server is proposed, which hashes a set of documents to be timestamped and widely publishes the hash. To implement a timestamp server without having to widely publish the hash with each timestamp, proof of work is employed as proposed by Adam Back in HashCash. PoW (Proof of Work) is implemented by adding a ‘Nonce’ to the block header which is to be incremented until a certain specied hash value is reached. Once the required nonce is generated (by expending CPU effort) it cannot be changed and is chained to the previous blocks. Since each block is chained to the previous block, to change a transaction is any block would require to recalculate the hash value of not only that block but all the blocks that follow it. Once the block is published, other nodes express their acceptance by working on generating the nonce for the next block in the chain. As a general rule, the longer chain is accepted as the true chain. So, that in a nutshell is how Bitcoin came into being. Employing the technologies that existed before to create a system that the world had no idea it needed. More than the cryptocurrency, the technology that it sits upon, namely, the Blockchain promises a disruptive future in the era of Web 3.0.

Can this young upstart money challenge the global monetary order? Economist Saifedean Ammous traces the history of the technologies of money to seashells, limestones, cattle, salt, beads, metals, and government debt, explaining what gave these technologies their monetary role, what makes for sound money, and the benefits of a sound monetary regime to economic growth, innovation, culture, trade, individual freedom, and international peace.\nThe monetary and historical analysis sets the stage for understanding the mechanics of the operation of Bitcoin, the reasons for its initial success, and the role it could play in an information economy. Rather than serving as a currency and network for consumer purchases, the author argues Bitcoin is better suited as a store of value and network for settlement between large financial institutions. With an automated and perfectly predictable monetary policy, and the ability to perform final settlement of large sums across the world in a matter of minutes, Bitcoin's true importance may just lie in providing a decentralized, neutral, free-market alternative to national central banks.\nAZW3\nCode: https://rg.to/file/9933bc72ede8ea9a0...3861.azw3.html EPUB\nCode: https://rg.to/file/2661d294e1c40d004...3861.epub.html PDF\nCode: https://rg.to/file/9b739dd8d42ffa92e...ndard.pdf.html", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://rg.to/file/9b739dd8d42ffa92ef9840102cd43c54/The_Bitcoin_Standard.pdf.html", "https://rg.to/file/2661d294e1c40d004f66c290ab4a1312/1119473861.epub.html", "https://rg.to/file/9933bc72ede8ea9a0fcf08b047b9624a/1119473861.azw3.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T00:33:21.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "16297e68f055622715b742c60f47a62d58fca288", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoYasFL09R_zkrDIsin4hbUOo.apy1gkjrzePAO0UuxxKRgXte0xHWmURdt1HGb738UewdP7UvvlS6ZqoogJ7Y8LY5EnjPqjpH_Qi3pQXmRtH2R0Y.OKvZ_ClbvsGGzDn0zlA5Bc46ADA--", "site_full": "bitcoinblog.tk", "site": "bitcoinblog.tk", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Swap Online Release Details of Their Decentralized Exchange of Bitcoin-To-Altcoins – The Bitcoin Blog", "title_full": "Swap Online Release Details of Their Decentralized Exchange of Bitcoin-To-Altcoins – The Bitcoin Blog", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "TK", "spam_score": 0.685, "main_image": "https://i0.wp.com/bitcoinblog.tk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/swap.png?fit=560%2C315", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "16297e68f055622715b742c60f47a62d58fca288", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoYasFL09R_zkrDIsin4hbUOo.apy1gkjrzePAO0UuxxKRgXte0xHWmURdt1HGb738UewdP7UvvlS6ZqoogJ7Y8LY5EnjPqjpH_Qi3pQXmRtH2R0Y.OKvZ_ClbvsGGzDn0zlA5Bc46ADA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Swap Online Release Details of Their Decentralized Exchange of Bitcoin-To-Altcoins – The Bitcoin Blog", "text": "Swap Online Release Details of Their Decentralized Exchange of Bitcoin-To-Altcoins Swap Online Release Details of Their Decentralized Exchange of Bitcoin-To-Altcoins Posted on May 13, 2018 This is a paid-for submitted press release.

CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the press release.\nBitcoin Press Release: Decentralised token swap site Swap.Online release details of their upcoming protocol.\n11th May 2018, Tallinn, Estonia – Decentralization is the basis for blockchain technologies. Decentralization ensures the security, transparency and integrity of all transactions in the network. But are the popular cryptocurrency exchanges really decentralized, and safe? Most DEX’s are not able to accept BTC without using an unreliable gateway between the two blockchains.\nExploring the Token Swap Ecosystem\nThere are several different types of DEX (Decentralised Exchange) such as pseudo-decentralized, working in the Ethereum network only, for example projects that link blockchains to each other using their own tokens, and decentralized exchanges that use “Hashed Timelock Contracts”.\nEarlier, it was common knowledge that a crypto exchange that did not store user keys, and was decentralized and therefore safe. However, most of these exchanges are built on a single blockchain, which makes them vulnerable – in order to get funds from the Bitcoin network to such a crypto exchange for example, one needs to use a gateway, which takes bitcoin and produces a “holding” kind of bitcoins in another network in return. A similar principle lies with Ethereum-based exchanges, for example, EtherDelta.\nSecurity: Paramount\nDevotees of centralization believe that storing private keys on a secure server is safer than storing encrypted keys in the user’s browser. However, if a central server is hacked, everything will be stolen (as it was with a million bitcoins), and paranoids can remove signing of transactions from the browser into the application on the computer and encrypt it.\nSince all code is executed in the user’s browser, the greatest risk is the intrusion of extraneous scripts into the code. It is likely to be made by the extensions the user installed in the browser, or by a hosting provider.\nTo prevent such attacks, Swap.Online will use cloudflare.com together with Workers, a solution that, in response to any request to the domain, sends a “Content Security Policy” header with the hash of the JS code allowed for execution in the user’s browser. Thus, server hacking and most attacks based on the introduction of malicious code will be eliminated. To understand how this works, see the video of the system operation below, or try to make an exchange yourself at https://alpha.swap.online .\nThe Swap Online Platform\nBy using Bitcoin.js, web3.js, and the libp2p library in IPFS, Swap.Online created a cross-blockchain swap system directly in the browser. The full details of the system can be found below: The solution operates on an average 2 to 10 times faster than the existing stock exchanges (taking into account the time to deposit and withdraw funds). On average, the exchange takes 2 to 3 minutes. Swap Online does not store secret user keys. Moreover, even messages between users do not pass through our servers (we use IPFS ). The exchange works right in the browser – users do not need to download or install anything. The platform already works between the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, with Tether, and Lightning Network planned. Theoretically, Swap Online is able to work with most cryptocurrencies, except for those where there is no scripting language. Even for currencies like Monero, solutions will be created over time.\nThe source code of the exchange is published in GitHub , and the protocol is distributed as Open Source. The AirDrop is scheduled for June 30th.\nThe Swap.Online team is also engaged in commercial implementation and release of related products: For the B2C market (swap.online) : Exchange solution for BTC -> ERC20 (with an orderbook and a reputation system) For the B2B market (b2b.swap.online) : Widget in the form of html code, which allows accepting any cryptocurrencies directly in the wallet of the site owner by sending tokens in return. The solution has a confirmed demand both from projects in the crowdfunding stage and from those who are already making a real product. For large holders of cryptocurrencies: Ability to safely exchange cryptocurrency without bringing it to centralized exchanges (by replenishing the account only during the exchange). As part of research, the possibility of using the solution as a bridge for the sidechains is being studied.

Whether actual Bitcoin millionaires or hired marketeers, the drivers added to the cacophony and stoked hype for what the city’s calling Blockchain Week.\nThe price of the digital token also got a boost. Bitcoin jumped as much as 3.95 percent to $8,713 in early trading, rebounding from a more than three-week low reached earlier Monday.\nConsensus is expected to draw more 8,500, or twice as many people as last year, when one Bitcoin would have cost you about $2,500. Now the top digital token is worth almost four times as much, though that still pales in comparison to the $20,000 price tag it flirted with late last year. The conference could cause Bitcoin to rally, Thomas Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, predicted last week.\nConsensus, hosted by media and research company CoinDesk Inc., has already featured Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard and FedEx Corp.

Rather than grant broad consent to countless apps and services, and have their identity data spread across numerous providers, individuals need a secure encrypted digital hub where they can store their identity data and easily control access to it.”\nPatel made the case for decentralized identity in order to own and control one’s identity in a system where privacy is by design and built in from the ground up. Microsoft’s project wants trust to be earned by individuals and built by the community, unlike traditional identity systems which are mostly geared toward authentication and access management.\nThe company has been participating in the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) to set up a decentralized identity ecosystem built on standard, open source technologies, protocols, and reference implementations. Patel said his team is collaboratively developing Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Identity Hubs, Universal DID Resolver, and Verifiable Credentials.\nDevelopers Hint They Will Build with Bitcoin Lightning Network\nPatel said the team needs the underlying technology to be capable of scale and performance on par with traditional systems, but some blockchain communities have increased on-chain transaction capacity, which degrades the decentralized state of the network and fails to reach the millions of transactions per second the system would generate at world-scale.\nTo overcome these technical barriers, Microsoft is ‘collaborating on decentralized Layer 2 protocols that run atop these public blockchains to achieve global scale while preserving the attributes of a world-class DID system.’ With this statement, the Bitcoin community on Reddit suspects that Microsoft will build the identity system with Bitcoin Lightning Network.\nDaniel Buchner, the lead developer of Decentralized Identity at Microsoft, wrote two tweets that back the community’s suspicions.

Goldman Goes All In\nFollowing a slew of inquiries from hedge funds, foundations, and endowments benefiting from Bitcoin millionaires, Goldman Sachs has become the first regulated financial institution to afford clients the ability to trade Bitcoin futures via one of its New York desks, according to Forbes .\nWhat this means is that the Wall Street titan will essentially help shepherd the herd of institutional investors into the trading of Bitcoin.\nGoldman Sachs will not actually trade Bitcoin, of course. Rather, the bank will trade Bitcoin futures contracts for clients using its own funds, in addition to non-deliverable forward futures.\nSuch a glowing endorsement from the most profitable securities firm in history should undoubtedly signal confidence in not only Bitcoin but the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Fashionably Late\nThe injection of investment funds into the cryptocurrency market comes after eToro senior analyst Mati Greenspan predicted a wave of Wall Street investment entering the space. Specifically, he explained that institutional investors were interested in catching Bitcoin at the bottom after missing the boat last year.\nGreenspan explained :\nSo they were trying hard to catch that bull run, and it seems they did miss the party. November was a very interesting time […] I imagine that the clients in the Wall Street banks also wanted to get in on that party.\nGoldman Sachs is now chauffeuring clients to said party, but it remains unclear which direction these futures traders will push the market.\n“Whether they’re going to go full-on bull or full-on bear we don’t know, but the important thing is that they’re ready to take on and ready to inject new liquidity into this market — which at least should even things out and stabilize the price,” explained Greenspan. Beaten by BitMEX\nGoldman Sachs official entrance into the Bitcoin futures market comes after BitMEX, a cryptocurrency derivative exchange, has already been offering derivative products to retail investors.\nAs noted by Forbes , the exchange has a daily trading volume upwards of $3 million and posted a revenue of $83 million in 2017.\nIn fact, BitMEX posted $21 million in revenue in January alone, when the market experienced a significant correction. Arthur Hayes, the company’s CEO said:\nThis is the best thing you could ever have. We make more money when the market goes down. We love this volatility.\nWhat do you think about Goldman Sachs entrance into the Bitcoin futures market? Which direction do you think institutions will push the market with their investment funds?

He Tweeted, “Coinbase remains the most successful and important company in the crypto industry.” Arguably, that is very much the case. The San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange with its barebone menu of offerings, combined with its easy user-interface and relatively smooth onboarding (almost no upfront deposit needed), provide an envious business model. That’s not to write the company is without faults, as it has many. It might not even be the future of retail crypto access, and perhaps it shouldn’t.\nAlso read: Zimbabwe Bans All Cryptocurrency Activity, Businesses Have 2 Month Grace Period Coinbase is Easy, Light, Feisty\n“Today is Coinbase’s sixth anniversary,” wrote COO Asiff Hirji. “We’re celebrating six incredible years working toward our mission to help create a more open financial system for the world! […] We are in the early days of our mission and there is still so much to do […] Have to know when to follow the rules, when to bend them and when to push to change them. Breaking them is neither ethical nor sustainable.”\nIt’s probably less of an exchange proper and more of a conservative cryptocurrency bank. It might be fair to simply label it a broker (without bids, asks, limit orders, margin trading, etc). Coinbase, founded six years ago this week, is arguably the most important company, regardless of its technical classification, within the space. It alone is responsible for introducing millions and millions of Americans to the wild phenomenon that is decentralized currency speculation.\nOffering bitcoin core (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH), and litecoin (LTC), its sparse choices work to underwhelm those new to speculating on cryptocurrency. The format is light and only requires a linked bank account. Without the bother of having to hold and maintain decentralized currency, users can simply use the Coinbase client and trade for fractions, sometimes as low as $2.00. Fees, of course, apply.\nAt the time of available statistics, the Northern California broker had something like 13 million users (Altana Digital Currency Fund), some days back in 2017 clocking them at 100,000 new sign ups every twenty four hours. For a little while there, Coinbase was a top ten downloaded application in the Apple Store. Its yearly revenue eclipsed venerable legacy houses such as Charles Schwab. Embarrassment of Riches\nIt continues to nab top professional financial sector talent such as Asiff Hirji from TD Ameritrade; to that end, it poached Facebook Messenger’s David Marcus to join its Board, and the two are exploring ways to exploit the social media platform’s giant user base in terms of blockchain technology (probably a proprietary token is in the works, but that’s a guess). Heck, even its alumni go on to do big things: Charlie Lee of Litecoin fame was a former director of engineering.\nMerchants Dell and Expedia use it as a point of sale processor. For trading professionals, its Coinbase Exchange was rebranded to Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX), becoming one of the earliest to offer ether to financial pros. Brian Armstrong\nFor better or worse, Coinbase is the most prominent version of mainstreaming the crypto revolution. It’s young (CEO, Brian Armstrong, is barely in his mid 30s), feisty, ambitious, cocky, and sporting for market share. Its flounders are largely an embarrassment of riches: demand so great the company’s system crashed a few times during the runups of 2017, and its customer inquiries languished at times in ten day backlogs. Mr. Armstrong fired back, “There’s so many people rushing into the space, if it’s a bit of speculation, I’m O.K. with that. But we can’t guarantee the website’s going to be up exactly when you need it. Everyone needs to take a deep breath.”\nThat particular hiccup hasn’t been put away altogether just yet, as in January of this year alone formal complaints to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rocketed by more than 100%. Almost half were filed regarding “money not available when promised,” which is no small matter. Perils of Centralization\nIn the scaling debate, Mr. Armstrong came firmly down on the side of big blockers, and, according to various sources, holds most of his crypto wealth in ether. Under his leadership, the company embraced economic reality, choosing when to fight on principle and where to give-in. For example, it was one of the notable in its class to snag a controversial Bitlicense from New York. Howls of sell out and capitulation could be heard far and wide. But this move signaled to potential investors and the broader financial community the company was less strident and more pragmatic in the all-important ‘business sense.’\nIt would regain some of its punkier credibility, at least for a time, when the United States’ taxman came calling. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) evidently can read eye-popping price headlines. As market leaders such as BTC rose exponentially, so did United States citizens’ tax obligations. Yet nearly no one was complying. History will show the company did fight back, but history will also show it lost, having to hand over customer information for those who moved more than $20K in crypto (small percentage of its users).\nThen again, when New York’s top cop poked and prodded at exchanges, asking they account for this and that, Coinbase jumped as high as asked, issuing a very detailed letter. Kraken, on the other hand, went sideways at the presumption and hubris of such an invasion. The contrast could not be starker, and the more principled in the community noticed … as it did when it shut off access for Wikileaks, a seemingly purposeful separation from crypto’s anarchic roots. Such are the perils of centralization in the sense there are doors to kickdown, masters to please other than market demand.\nFor the more cypherpunk among us, it is critical to acknowledge the truth. Coinbase is good people, but Coinbase is also in bed with the same folks who prompted crypto’s birth. That won’t do, and won’t do by a lot. If censorship resistance and decentralization are fundamental pillars, then we should look for exchanges in those images. Leave traditional banking schemes itching to please governments to their future: slow death.\nIs Coinbase an overall positive or negative in the crypto community?

Along the way, we have also seen a rise in the number of cryptocurrency crimes. From kidnappings to money laundering and many more types of crime, police and governments around the globe are looking to coordinate efforts in order to stop crypto criminals. In this article, we’ll take a look at some example cases and how law enforcement is handling them. ICO Scams\nICO scams are one of the most common types of cryptocurrency crimes. Oftentimes, project teams are completely fictitious. As during any ICO, investors send ETH, BTC, USD, and/or other currencies to the wallets of the project. The only difference is that fake projects keep the funds and give no tokens whatsoever in return. Most often, these scams involve fake project team profiles, which sometimes even include big-name entrepreneurs like Richard Branson .\nOne ICO for a project called Miroskii used a photo of actor Ryan Gosling for a profile of a fake graphic designer named “Kevin Belanger”. While it might appear evident to some or even most people that this was a fake profile, this fraudulent ICO actually claimed to have raised $830,000. Little is known about the consequences of such a scam since there is currently no info online about any charges against the project. Even the project website is still running ; however, you won’t find the profile for “Kevin Belanger” or anyone else on the team any more.\nThe ICO scam issue is so bad that the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will be discussing this as part of its workshop in Chicago on June 25, 2018 at DePaul University . One of the biggest problems with ICO scams is the overall lack of regulatory framework in place for public fundraising at a national level. In the US, for instance, states like Texas have been the most proactive in banning certain cryptocurrency projects and ICOs that are deemed to be fraudulent . Robbery\nIt’s bad enough when someone loses money due to a cryptocurrency exchange hack or an ICO scam but there are even worse ways to get funds stolen. There have been quite a few incidents of robbery and kidnappings involving cryptocurrency. During one such incident in Dubai , a gang of ten individuals pretended to be in charge of issuing mandated trade licenses for cryptocurrency. Two brothers who were looking to purchase trade licenses were carrying around $1.9 million in cash. The gang impersonating the trade license issuers stole the cash from the two brothers and also assaulted them. Since that time, the ten suspects have been apprehended and referred to public prosecutors.\nIn another incident, Louis Meza, a man from New Jersey, even kidnapped his friend and stole $1.8 million in cryptocurrency . Meza lured his friend into a minivan and a gunman pointed a pistol at the friend, demanding his 24-word passphrase to access the victim’s Ledger Nano S wallet. Meza also looted the victim’s apartment, stealing a ledger and other information. While a lot of cryptocurrencies are designed to make the transfer funds untraceable or at least rather difficult to track, Meza made two key mistakes.\nFirst, there was surveillance video showing him enter the victim’s apartment. Second, he used a popular cryptocurrency exchange to transfer stolen funds from ETH to BTC. The account’s public address included his own name, which gave a lot of evidence linking Meza to the crime. Meza pleaded not guilty to grand larceny, kidnapping, robbery and related counts at his arraignment in the Manhattan Supreme Court in December 2017. The judge ordered $1 million bond or $500,000 cash bail. Money Laundering\nThere have already been a few large-scale cases for money laundering via cryptocurrency. Thomas Mario Costanzo allegedly used cryptocurrencies to launder proceeds for drug dealers . Costanzo was arrested during a USDHS-coordinated raid in April 2017. Evidence also shows that Costanzo used crypto to buy drugs and offered an online cryptocurrency exchange service for other people to purchase drugs without adding the required KYC authentication process.\nThe possible sentence for such crimes is rather hefty. The five charges placed on Costanzo can bring a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine, or a combination of the two. In addition, any cryptocurrencies used in these crimes could be taken away by the U.S. Justice Department. The sentencing will take place on June 11, 2018.\nThere have even been some cases requiring international law enforcement cooperation. One recent example involved authorities from Finland, Spain, the United States, and Europol. In this case, 137 individuals were investigated and 11 were ultimately arrested in April 2018 . Originally, criminals laundered drug money from Spain to Colombia using credit cards.\nThe group realized quickly switched to cryptocurrencies after realizing the easy traceability of traditional bank accounts. Nonetheless, law enforcement officials from Europol were able to track down criminals by monitoring crypto-to-fiat exchange transactions (Colombian pesos). Europol has stated that it is committed to giving additional cryptocurrency crime detection training to its officers. It will also continue to coordinate to stop such crimes both within the EU and beyond. The Future of Crypto Crimes\nUndoubtedly, crimes related to cryptocurrency will continue to rise as the popularity of cryptocurrency in general rises. Even though there are many good aspects of a crypto-based economy (i.e. greater transaction privacy, users control over funds, and freedom of capital flow), these same benefits do bring new potential challenges to stopping crimes of the present and future. In some instances, criminals might still leave behind evidence that can be tracked.\nHowever, it is also likely that cryptocurrency crimes will become more intricate and potentially even more difficult to stop than traditional crimes attached to fiat currency. As criminals become smarter, it is clear that law enforcement agencies will have to remain on top of changes in emerging technologies as they relate to criminal activity.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ico scams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eth", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T00:26:00.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aa70dfbc8c6d381426eaa6ea171131b88e425cd2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwArJPfvOFTD6RAa7QJL_D4-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "title_full": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aa70dfbc8c6d381426eaa6ea171131b88e425cd2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwArJPfvOFTD6RAa7QJL_D4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInvest your time and effort inviting new users and you will guarantee a high passive income for yourself for a long time.

Genesis, as many of you reading this might know, is the world’s largest cloud bitcoin mining company, with over 2 million customers worldwide. It calls Iceland home, whose cool climate and affordable green energy are ideal for mining newly minted virgin cryptocurrencies. Last year, Genesis helped connect the blockchain sector and traditional capital markets by partnering with HIVE Blockchain Technologies, the first publicly traded digital currency mining firm.\nThis week, Marco will be one of the panelists at the Consensus 2018 blockchain technology summit in New York, which I will also be attending. Below are highlights from our conversation.\nTell us how you got started in this industry.\nI’ve always had a passion for mathematics, science, physics. I wanted to understand how nature works. I used to spend days and nights in the library, and I was actually on my way to becoming a math professor.\nBut then blockchain and bitcoin came along, and that changed everything. At the time, the community was very small, but the ideas and visions were very big. No one fully realized then how fast it would all grow or just how revolutionary it could end up being. I watched as new marketplaces began to emerge, businesses began to bet on bitcoin and people started adopting it. More and more exchanges popped up. All of this happened within a year of me first reading about blockchain and bitcoin—it progressed that quickly.\nIt was clear that something big was happening. The world was changing, and I needed to be part of it.\nHow would you describe bitcoin to someone who knew nothing about it?\nWith bitcoin, you can send money anywhere in the world to anywhere else without worrying about boundaries or having the transaction controlled or stopped by a third party. It’s a completely independent, decentralized, peer-to-peer system. This is what makes it so revolutionary.

Blockshipping says its solution – which is called the Global Shared Container Platform (GSCP for short) – has what it takes to address staggering inefficiencies in the marketplace, bringing significant savings for businesses throughout the supply chain and dramatically reducing the industry’s toll on the environment. Sponsored Links Despite being a “hugely valuable” sector, Blockshipping says the industry has been plagued for years by security threats, overcapacity and ever-tightening environmental policies – adding that some issues have gone unresolved for decades. Within a three to four-year period, the Scandinavian company aspires to have 60 percent market coverage – equating to 16 million shipping containers – and hopes its utility token will become the standard currency for transactions between firms operating in the industry. Crunching the numbers Blockshipping believes firms will be incentivized to adopt its technology by estimates which suggest the industry could enjoy annual savings of $5.7 billion if the Global Shared Container Platform goes mainstream. This would be achieved through the “smarter handling” that the GSCP would enable – making it easier for deficit and surplus containers to be matched. Blockshipping’s white paper cites research which indicates that carriers could reduce the size of their container fleets by up to 20 percent by installing real-time tracking sensors and gaining accurate location data. The company also claims that, at any given time, one in five containers worldwide (the equivalent of 5 mln units) is unaccounted for. To compound the problem, it can be difficult to gather information about whether containers are empty or loaded, meaning that, all too frequently, trains and trucks are wasting time and fuel transporting empty metal boxes. Needless to say, this means that the environmental advantages of the GSCP could prove quite significant. According to analysis from Opsiana, a consultancy also based in Scandinavia, the platform could see global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions fall by 4.6 million tons per annum – with nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission cut by 4,900 tons. Important partnership announcements In the weeks to come Blockshipping expects to announce 3-4 collaboration agreements with different technology partners who will assist Blockshipping in developing the GSCP platform.\nBlockshipping has announced a partnership with MakerDAO, creators of the Dai stablecoin. The partnership specifically focus on the internal clearing and settlement token in the GSCP platform called CPT – Container Platform Token – that needs to be stable at all time. The partnership is expected to accelerate development and availability of the Blockshipping GSCP platform by leveraging Maker DAO’s proven Dai Stablecoin System to power the GSCP platform.\nRune Christensen, CEO of MakerDAO, sees a lot of possible benefits to Blockshipping by using the Dai Stability System to power the GSCP platform. In a joint press release he says:\n“We look forward to a partnership with Blockshipping in developing the best possible solution for transforming the container shipping space, where the Blockshipping solutions on the longer term can be “powered by Dai.” We are eager to show that our stablecoin system is perfectly designed for supply chain projects like Blockshipping’s GSCP platform.” “Huge industry interest” Blockshipping says that its first customers will be able to start using the portal from the first quarter of 2019. This year, the platform is being designed and populated with data, paving the way for smart contracts to be developed and testing to take place. The company is going to be offering two types of tokens. The first, known as the container platform token (CPT,) would be pegged to the US dollar and used for clearing and settling transactions. Meanwhile, the container crypto coin (CCC) is going to be issued on the global Ethereum Blockchain for its initial coin offering. Examples of when CPT would be used include fees associated with the land transport of containers, and costs linked to repairing and servicing units. Blockshipping says its GSCP platform has been initially funded by the Danish Maritime Foundation as well as private angels, but an ICO is being performed to “further accelerate the development and adoption” of the ecosystem. The company’s chief executive, Peter Ludvigsen, told Cointelegraph: “Traditionally, the shipping industry has a reputation for being rather conservative, but what I have experienced since the announcement of our GSCP project is anything but the traditional pushback on new business ideas. It has been like one unbroken series of positive dialogues with key players of all areas in the container shipping industry. “I am extremely proud to say that a few days ago Blockshipping obtained confirmation from a global container carrier that they will join our GSCP platform as our first customer. This is a carrier in the 10-20 global ranking who has also confirmed that they will join our Customer advisory board.” Blockshipping’s public sale will be commencing on May 14.\nDisclaimer.

A security guard in a suit, talking into his sleeve, eventually gives a small group the go-ahead to ride up to the second floor where another line awaits.\nIt feels like we’re trying, and failing, to get into New York’s hottest nightclub.\n“This is like the Coachella of Bitcoin,” a passerby whispers to her companion as they breeze by.\nYou can taste the excitement.\nImage: jack morse/mashable\nAnd indeed, while it lacks Beyonce and the questionable wardrobe choices of the Southern California music festival, the Coindesk organized Consensus more than makes up for it in its sheer opulence and buffoonery — a fact made obvious before you even walk through the conference doors.\nParked outside the hotel were three Lamborghinis — an inside joke within the cryptocurrency community — and, opposite them, a man claiming that the developers of NEM screwed him out of over $1.5 million USD worth of cryptocurrency.\nAcross the street was an entirely different type of show: specifically, a fake protest. Chanting “hey hey, ho ho, Bitcoin has got to go,” the group of self-described bankers and CEOs (one man told me he got his suit out of a dumpster) carried signs reading “paper checks use less electricity” and “we thought this was a bubble.”\nAccording to a rambling statement on the group’s website , the Genesis Mining -backed demonstrators were actually protesting aspects of the financial industry, but either way, they generated enough of a scene to draw a crowd and put conference attendees in what can only be described as an appropriately absurdist frame of mind.\nBecause as soon as those who came to hear the blockchain gospel made it past the aforementioned escalator bouncer and the formidable registration line, they were met with what can only be described as a hodler’s paradise.\nWant 18-karat gold crypto-jewelry to commemorate your ride-or-die status as a Bitcoin maximalist? Consensus 2018 is the place for you.\nBut can you verify ownership on the blockchain?\nImage: Jack Morse/mashable\nI’ll take two, please.\nImage: Jack Morse/mashable\nAnd sure, you may know about beer, but have you heard of crypto beer?\nIf that’s not your thing, don’t fret, just make you way over to the cypto-puppy (yes, this dog was described to me as a “crypto-puppy”) named after Margaret Thatcher chilling on the fourth floor.\nStill recovering from the Mt. Gox hack.\nImage: jack morse/mashable\nBut just like the SEC trying to shit all over the decentralized parade, the real world did poke its annoying head into the immutable bubble of joy. That’s right, someone ticketed the Lambos.\nSad times.\nImage: jack morse/mashable\nWhat’s more, in what definitely isn’t a metaphor for the entire industry, it turned out that the fancy cars weren’t even the fruit of early Bitcoin adoption. They were just a promotional stunt .\nBut push that all to the back on your head, fellow believer. Because if there’s one thing “the Coachella of Bitcoin” makes clear, it’s that these are serious people with serious ideas — even if, as one major player in the cryptocurrency space told me on background, 80 percent of people in the scene are likely scammers.\nBecause scammer or no, at the 2018 Consensus conference we’re all heading to the moon.

And, there's even a bank ready to serve Iran when it comes knocking: according to Reuters, German Radoslav Albrecht has founded an online bank that allows clients to transfer loans anywhere in the world using Bitcoin.\nThat's right: bitcoin's money-laundering, capital-controls evading capabilities - the reason why we said it's going much, much higher back in September 2015 when it was just above $200 - are finally going mainstream. And not only that, but in one move it is disintermediating the multi-trillion industry behind private money creation known as \"banking.\"\nIt's therefore hardly a surprise that the company's motto is \"see no bank, hear no bank, speak no bank.\"\nAlbrecht's Bitbond uses Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to completely bypass the Swift international transfer system which has a monopoly and ultimate veto power on who is in - and isn't - in the global petrodollar club, to lend money across the globe rapidly and at low cost.\n“Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,” Albrecht told Reuters TV in his office in Berlin’s fashionable neighborhood Prenzlauer Berg. “With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.”\nBut what about the risk of intermediary price fluctuations?\nThat, too, has been factored in as clients hold the loans in their choice cryptocurrency for only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitbond's novelty is that while bitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, it never served as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally. And judging by the company's rapid growth, there is more than enough demand for its services: Albrecht’s service, which has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013, employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month.\nMost clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don’t exceed 50,000 dollars. However, those amount are set to grow: in 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since. More importantly, not a single regulator has reached out to Albrecht to tell him to shut down his service, and for good reason: according to Bitnodes, adoption of bitcoin has been rapid in Germany, only trailing the U.S., based on the location of all the bitcoin nodes that transmit data about new transactions.

Bitbond uses cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to bypass the Swift international transfer system to lend money across the globe rapidly and at low cost. “Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,” Albrecht told Reuters TV in his office in Berlin’s fashionable neighborhood Prenzlauer Berg. “With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.” Clients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates. Bitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally. Albrecht’s service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013. His office employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month. Most clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don’t exceed 50,000 dollars. In 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since. Adoption of Bitcoin has been rapid in Germany. It trails only the U.S., according to Bitnodes, which tracks the location of all the Bitcoin nodes that transmit data about new transactions. - Reuters ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "radoslav albrecht", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "prenzlauer berg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reuters tv", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T13:56:59.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6b3de503fdc99b5be2a3b734308028da72fee314", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtfcycYqfsuDcdXJOTcGCDAa.j95z1Rfd0OV.uOzMRgf2tH_TIqVnkCJD.d2hVC2wcfqM2JWVosr_gXrLLIENRZkDpnoNgxquiiCpXabqVrnB", "site_full": "reviewcoin.me", "site": "reviewcoin.me", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Best New - 'Not all tokens can be defined as securities' » Brave New Coin - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "title_full": "Best New - 'Not all tokens can be defined as securities' » Brave New Coin - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "ME", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://reviewcoin.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/brave-new-coin-sec-calls-for-less-regulatory-oversight-banner.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6b3de503fdc99b5be2a3b734308028da72fee314", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtfcycYqfsuDcdXJOTcGCDAa.j95z1Rfd0OV.uOzMRgf2tH_TIqVnkCJD.d2hVC2wcfqM2JWVosr_gXrLLIENRZkDpnoNgxquiiCpXabqVrnB", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Best New - 'Not all tokens can be defined as securities' » Brave New Coin - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "text": "/ Best New –‘Not all tokens can be defined as securities’ » Brave New Coin Best New –‘Not all tokens can be defined as securities’ » Brave New Coin Best New Cryptocurrency By root / May 14, 2018 Rarely do we hear sanguine comments from the SEC in regards to cryptocurrencies, so to hear a commissioner say “I am wary of any blanket designation for all ICOs” as securities is something of a revelation. “There are, for example, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. These function perhaps like money… They may be currency, commodities, or something else, but it is unlikely that, on their own, they’re actually securities,” said Security and Exchange Commision (SEC) commissioner Hester Peirce, addressing a fintech conference where she espoused a more relaxed approach to regulation of financial technology in its early stages. As opposed to a startup being confined within a sandbox of regulatory oversight she preferred the analogy of it being given the length and breadth of a beach to freely stretch itself creatively.\nWhat most troubled her about the controlled environment of a sandbox is that the regulator sits inside it with the entrepreneurs looking over their shoulder in a parental role that can stifle the creative process: “They seem to be working very well for some regulators. That said, I am mindful of the fact that a regulator’s mere presence can change the tenor of a fruitful conversation. Hence, the beach, not the sandbox, is my preferred approach.”\nThe commissioner advocated regulators taking the role of the student, for the meantime, rather than the lecturer when approaching the industry, conceding that she and her team are on a steep learning curve. Pitfalls regulators must try to avoid Peirce mentioned three bias pitfalls that regulators are prone to falling into: The Howey test: is the framework in place since the 1930s to define whether an asset is a security or not. However, you must first fully understand what that asset is and how it works, to proceed with the rest of the assessment – and with a weak understanding of cryptocurrencies the rest of the process is skewed. Fear of the unfamiliar: Lack of familiarity can breed a climate of fear and anxiety and there is a risk that when something truly innovative comes along the incumbents focus on the negative rather than positives of that technology. Stifling innovation: Even if the regulator side-steps the above it may insert itself inappropriately into the creative process by micromanaging the innovation environment. “The law deserves respect, but technological progress should not be bound by the limits of the regulator’s lawyerly imagination”, Peirce said.\nConstructive criticism The commissioner regretted that most of the SEC’s communication around ICOs and tokens has come from the Division of Enforcement, which, as the name suggests, is a sort of police force for the SEC that collects evidence of possible securities law violations and recommends prosecution. She acknowledged there is a dearth of understanding about the technology in that department and effort is needed to learn more about it.\nIn place of regulating with scrutiny, the commissioner suggested approaching ICOs and tokens with curiosity and recommends the SEC establish a crypto industry FAQ web page devoted to questions and comments, just like the Japanese financial regulator has done .\nShe closed her speech on an almost romantic note: “As we sit atop our lifeguard’s stand and survey the beach, however, let’s not lose sight of the benefits new technology can provide in the area of capital formation, market efficiency, economic growth, and overall societal well-being.”\nIn a sweltering climate where the letters SEC and CFTC strike fear into hearts of digital investors, this kind of open-mindedness from a top official will be a sea breeze to cool the nerves.

BTC was poised to top $10,000 before sliding to around its current $8,670. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is also down to around $1,480, losing around 14% of its value in the past 24 hours. However, the markets are starting to climb back up and some are predicting that BCH could soon be among the top three cryptocurrencies.\nDespite a decrease in value, Bitcoin Cash has remained relatively stable. BCH currently has a market cap of $25 billion and a circulating supply of more than 17 million. Its decline was only the second least decline among the top 15 cryptocurrencies, all of which saw a 20% or greater drop except BTC and Ethereum (ETH).\nCash Consortium (C2), a technical group seeking to bolster open standard development to bolster BCH growth, described the cryptocurrency as “the soundest money the world has ever known. It has scarcity, fungibility, divisibility, durability, and transferability.” The C2 uses open standards that allow developers to identify bugs and glitches inside the blockchain’s software.\n“Bitcoin Cash and Blockchain technology enable financial sovereignty in a way which is unique in history. One of C2’s primary goals is to make these benefits available to all people, whatever their age, gender, nationality or financial status,” according to the C2 website .\nThe second network upgrade , happening on May 15, is expected to have a major impact on the cryptocurrency’s value. The upgrade is designed to drive down even more the already low transaction fees, as well as speed up the network. Through this event, the block size will be increased to 32MB and certain functionality through OP_Codes that was previously rejected will be introduced. The OP_Codes should supply the greatest amount of strength to BCH’s value, as they will allow smart contract and tokenization capability on the blockchain.\nSmart contract capability has been a highlight of Ethereum; through it, thousands of blockchain projects, additional cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings were initiated. The implementation of smart contracts will put BCH on the same level as ETH. Jimmy Nguyen, CEO of the nChain Group, said, “The restoring of certain OP_Codes in the Bitcoin scripting language will bring advanced technical functionality to the Bitcoin Cash network. In computing, operating codes are the section of automated language which dictates what operation must be performed. The restored OP_Codes will enable tokenization and smart contracts to be executed on the BCH blockchain. More advanced functions will be possible with future upgrades to the Bitcoin Cash network.” Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (segwit) Chain are Referred to as BTC coins. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is today the only Bitcoin implementation that follows Satoshi Nakamoto’s original whitepaper for Peer to Peer Electronic Cash. Bitcoin BCH is the only major public blockchain that maintains the original vision for Bitcoin as fast, frictionless, electronic cash.

Where there are payments to process or data to secure, blockchain technology can be extremely useful.\nAnother exciting aspect is how it can empower the underbanked and unbanked populations of the world. Put simply, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are for everyone .\nThese aspects are most apparent when they are evidenced by real-world people, businesses, and use cases. I recently heard about a Chicagoland orthopedic practice beginning to accept Bitcoin as a payment method and reached out to them. The practice was started and operated by Dr. Chadwick Prodromos, and he was kind enough to take time out of his busy schedule to talk to me about integrating Bitcoin into his practice. Dr. Prodromos\nDoctor Prodromos, how long have you practiced medicine and how long has your practice been open?\nI have been in the practice of orthopedic surgery for 32 years, and heavily involved in stem cell and regenerative medicine for 7 years.\nWhen was the first time you heard about Bitcoin, and what convinced you to add it as a payment method for your patients?\nI heard about it several years ago and read Paul Vigna and Michael Casey’s The Age of Cryptocurrency. I believed it would be particularly useful for international patients. The book used Argentinians as a specific group, for example. And I liked the idea of disintermediated payment in general and wanted to do my part to foster it.\nActually, intermediaries in medicine – insurance companies, hospital systems, et cetera – are responsible for most of the excess cost in medicine. Medicine – healthcare – used to be much less costly and much more about the doctor and the patient without other administrative intrusions. Allowing cryptocurrency payments is a small step toward trying to restore that paradigm. And in general, I believe in the ideals of the blockchain community and wanted to be a functioning part of it.\nWhat was the greatest challenge in accepting bitcoin as a payment method? Greatest benefit?\nI am fortunate that my daughter Lexy works in the blockchain industry for Bloq and the Chicago Blockchain Center . She set up our system for me. However, it is relatively simple for anyone to set up. As far as benefit, this would accrue to any patient who wished to use this form of payment. As we treat more and more patients from afar, including overseas, with stem cell treatments, I think the benefit to them will be more apparent.\nHow many patients have paid in Bitcoin thus far? How do they like it? Do you actively let your patients know it is an option?\nWe had our first patient formally pay with Bitcoin last week. We have it as a payment option on our website. I intend, however, to actively promote it as a payment option for my practice going forward.\nHow do your staff and colleagues feel about Bitcoin and accepting Bitcoin?\nMost had heard of it, but only vaguely. All were fine with using it.\nWhat are your opinions about blockchain technology as a method to secure health records and identifying information? Is your practice exploring that side of blockchain technology as well?\nActually, medical records are already heavily protected with digital, encrypted, but non-blockchain technology. So there is no real need there from that perspective. However, there is interest in using blockchain technology to help keep provider directories up to date – a problem that is hugely expensive to the health care system. The current lack of transparency involved in that process would be greatly alleviated by having a blockchain [based] distributed database instead of the current centralized ones.\nWhat predictions do you have about other medical professionals accepting cryptocurrencies?\nI think it will grow slowly over time. There is still hesitation as to the use of cryptocurrency in a world where generally third party intermediaries are trusted in the United States. Some aspects of accepting cryptocurrency as well can be quite risky – for example, if a loss of private keys occurs or if there is a threat of an exchange hacking – so I can see the reluctance other service providers might have in using it. However, I am confident that as the technology becomes more sophisticated and user-friendly, user adoption will continue to grow.\nOutside of Bitcoin, what is your favorite cryptocurrency?\nLitecoin seems to have potential; I like the fact that the transactions process very quickly and it seems scalable. Also, I just read that Telegram, in a departure from their core business, will be introducing a new token that they think will be able to viably compete with Visa and Mastercard. Easier said than done, but I will be watching for more information going forward.\nShould our readers wish to learn more about your practice, where should they look?\nThe best source of information is our website. The URL is ismoc.net . I am a knee and shoulder surgeon, fellowship trained at Harvard/MGH in sports medicine, and editor of the textbook for orthopedic surgeons on the ACL. I am also heavily involved in stem cell and PRP (platelet rich plasma) regenerative medicine injections. We have a prospective study of more than 2,600 such injections as an alternative to joint replacement and other surgery that is one of the largest by an orthopedic surgeon in the United States with an overall success rate of about 80%. I try to use surgery only as a last resort, and the advances in regenerative medicine have made this increasingly possible. Our phone number is 847-699-6810 for any questions. We are located in the Chicago suburbs but evaluate patients remotely from all over the country, and beyond, at no charge. *\nDr. Prodromos and his practice are a great example of how cryptocurrencies can be used for daily necessities such as healthcare. I want to take a moment to thank Dr. Prodromos again for taking time out of his busy schedule to speak with me and to share his cryptocurrency story with our readers.

However, it remains perched at position three in the liquidity list. Even though the future prospects of this coin is wonderful, short term selling with targets at 45 cents can be a good trading strategy. From the News\nWinter is coming for cryptocurrencies in general. Facebook is all about being social and according to reports we are all receiving, they are planning to launch their own cryptocurrencies in a bid to improve lives even in the remotest part of the world. In their master plan, a cross border system that builds on the power of Marcus lead blockchain Research wing of Facebook shall surely eliminate the sufferings of the Diaspora. Now, if every one of their 1 billion users decides to utilize the coin once it goes live, we expect an immediate lift off and of course a shift of capital to Facebook coin.\nEven if that’s the future, Ripple is already hard on work and demonstrating how useful their technology is. There are plans of Cobalt and while Codius is now live-minus concrete development at GitHub-we can shift our attention to xRapid and xVia. Both are novel technologies that aid in rapid cross border payment as we saw last week. Then it was shown that by using xRapid, payment providers can save up-to 70 percent in costs. That is besides the time benefit that the end user gets to enjoy.\nWhile we dip in to a freeze, China, known for their shifting stands on cryptocurrencies and especially Bitcoin, are now the official rating “company”. Yes, we have Weiss Ratings but China snatching this role through their department, the China Electronic Information Industry Development (CCID) . Consequently, they shall publish a report in the next couple of days and if Ripple would react or not, the charts would show us. Ripple (XRPUSD) Technical Analysis Ripple Weekly Chart by Trading View\nTechnically, week ending April 22 still defines the current prices. There after we have a month’s long period of accumulation all happening with a stochastic buy signal in this time frame. While statistics indicates that Ripple is down 20 percent in the last seven days, we shall hang on to a long term bullish skew but short in the lower time frames.\nI expect bears to build on to that bearish engulfing pattern at around $1 . Because of this predisposition, immediate targets would be at 45 cents. This way, price action would be actively trying to correct that over-valuation on January 2018. That’s besides towing with the general bearish sentiment in the monthly chart. Daily Chart Ripple Daily Chart by Trading View\nThere is a little bit of under-valuation in the daily chart following May 12 close below the lower BB. The thing, prices are somehow over-extended after dipping 30 cents right from our resistance line at $1. We are net bearish but temporarily, prices might recover and test 85 cents in the coming days.\nIf not, any break below 60 cents would be inviting for seller meaning a bear candlestick would print. This way, we shall have bear candlesticks aligning along the lower BB signaling strong bear momentum. And anyway, despite the under-valuation, stochastics are bearish and diverging.

Christian Fringhian, partner at the Swiss firm, explains his goals to finews.asia.\nChristian Fringhian was a long-standing Barclays and J.P. Morgan investment banker when he joined Swiss boutique private bank Reyl in 2013. Five years on, he has expanded a fledgling team of corporate advisors including a prominent hire from Goldman Sachs , and wants to recruit more.\nThe former fixed income banker is targeting entrepreneurs at mid-sized firms, but also building relationships with yield-starved institutional investors such as pension funds and hedge funds.\nChristian Fringhian, why should a private bank set out to become a boutique corporate adviser.\nMost of our clients, or prospects, are enterpreneurs. An entrepreneur makes little between the management of wealth and the management of the tool of value creation – the company.\n«All Reyl’s partners come from large investment banks like J.P. Morgan or Credit Suisse»\nA client wants to make sure that he or she is talking to a partner who understands that a financial decision has ripple effects through his whole construct: family, personal wealth, company, and so on.\nAren’t they two fundamentally different businesses?\nAll of the partners at Reyl & Cie have experience with large investment banks like Barclays, J.P. Morgan, BNPP and Credit Suisse. We all witnessed the challenges of integrating corporate finance with wealth management, essentially due to cultural differences. As ex-investment bankers, it was natural for us to consider investment banking products and services to our clients.\nSo what makes you different?\nWe focus on how our clients can benefit from having access to a wider and integrated range of financial services. Wealth management relationship managers understand how this strengthens the bond they build with their clients.\nHow can corporate advisory be profitable for private bankers?\nWe do have a simple internal mechanism which recognizes and rewards each participant who helps us create value.\n«It’s not a fake currency»\nDo you underpin it with bonus incentives, for example?\nThis system is fair and transparent which means it is to everyone's benefit.\nWhat is the advantage versus a large institution?\nWe apply key principles of wealth management expected by our client – bespoke attention, confidentiality, partnership – to investment banking. In a smaller team like ours, fewer people are involved on each transaction, thus further guaranteeing confidentiality and commitment.\nHow much of Reyl’s profits does the corporate advisory arm now account for?\nWe now represent 10 to 15 percent of revenue of the bank.\nWhat are your growth targets for corporate advisory?\nWe have ambitious plans for corporate advisory: we’re building teams and adding new skills to the team, but I would think we’re at 25 percent of revenue within a very short timeframe.\nWhat does that mean in terms of your hiring plans?\nI wouldn’t be surprised if our team of eight people is between 10 and 12 people by year-end, between Geneva and London.\nWhat size deals?\nWe can look at smaller transactions that usually fall below the threshold for big investment banks. We are positioning ourselves in the less than $500 million segment – although this is not a rule – given that large investment banks are less motivated to look at smaller size transactions.\n«For the moment, I don’t think we have a lot of competition in our segment»\nHow many deals a year?\nIn a normal year, we execute three to five transactions.\nWho are you directly competing with?\nAll of our peers in tbe the wealth management industry have enterpreneurial clients. It’s how their needs are being addressed that makes the difference. We have identified a few institutions which are developing similar corporate finance services for their clients.\nSurely boutique investment banks and M&A specialists would disagree?\nThe pool of corporate finance expertise we gathered as an integrated part of a private bank the size of Reyl is unique, I believe. Entrepreneurs never sit still as they constantly look for capital or leverage, or looking to sell or buy a company. Our relationship managers imbed our corporate advisory services in their commercial push as it helps to clearly differentiate our value proposition.\n«We allow high net worth individuals to borrow money against the art pieces they own»\nWhat corporate advisory services can you pitch to wealth management clients?\nOur main areas of focus are M&A advisorsy and execution, restructurings, private debt issuances, and structured finance. We also bring targeted private equity and private debt investment opportunities to our client base.

Tim Draper, Renowned Investor: It’s Safer Than Fiat | Sharp Credit - Finance News, Credit Help, Cryptocurrency exchange", "text": "Monero(XMR) 212.316 NEM(XEM) 0.365223\nYou may have asked the question: is Bitcoin safe? on multiple occasions. Should you really think to put your money into Bitcoin? Well, Tim Draper is an investor with renowned opinions about the cryptomarket. He is an avid believer in the positivities of crypto and his bullish position has earned him many followers and detractors. On multiple occasions, his predicted forecasts have proved successful despite adverse scenarios, and this is something to take into consideration.\nA few years ago, Draper predicted that Bitcoin would increase by more than 10k, a figure that only a few believed possible at the time. His prediction was met in about one year.\nA month ago, Mr. Draper also predicted that Bitcoin would cost 250k by 2022. Quite a controversial and yet not impossible figure compared to Bitcoin’s previous performance over time.\nThis Thursday, in an interview for CNBC, Tim Draper spoke about the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over the traditional FIAT system. For the well-known investor, one of the most important aspects is that of security. If his opinion is to be considered once again, then it would seem that Bitcoin is safer than traditional fiat currency:\n“Right now, your banks are being attacked all the time. The hackers are poking holes in your banks and going after your fiat money. And the bankers are pounding away trying to keep the hacks away, but they are getting hacked all the time. No-one has ever hacked the Bitcoin blockchain. It is the most secure place to put your money. And so, as a store of value, it is a great place to be. And if you’re in Argentina or Venezuela or Nigeria, you know that your currency is going to fall 30 percent every year, because, I mean, those countries tend to implode about every year. And people lose their fortune. Well, if part of your fortune is put into bitcoin, you’re not going to lose your fortune.” Is Bitcoin Safe?\nThis statement is true, Bitcoin has never been successfully hacked but this still doesn’t make it infallible. Is Bitcoin Safe? Perhaps there could be the use of exchanges as trusted third parties to convert digital resources into cash — just like banks? However, there have been significant hackings into large exchanges resulting in multi-million dollar losses for investors, but this risk is equally there for standard banks. Hacking though in general, is caused by faults in the internal system of the exchanges, as well as by a security failure in the banks. Can it be really be considered a flaw in the actual economic system?\nFor this reason, it is always recommended to store cryptocurrency in a wallet (preferably a cold one) to avoid security breaches inherent in the use of third-party platforms. Mobilizing accounts to exchanges is only recommended for trading, and once finished relocating the crypto to a personal wallet is always recommended. So with that added element – an outside wallet holding your bitcoin, Its fair to say that that makes Bitcoin safer, whether or not more than fiat lies on several factors.\nYou can’t ask “is Bitcoin safe?” without considering another vital aspect that provides security to users; the decentralized nature of crypto. This characteristic means it is out of the control of third parties such as governments or economic influencers.\n“If you are in Argentina or Venezuela or Nigeria, you know that your currency is going to fall 30% every year because those countries tend to implode about every year, and people lose their fortune. Well, if part of your fortune is put into Bitcoin, you’re not going to lose your fortune.”\nThis statement is critical because in these countries inflation exceeds the Bitcoin’s price volatility. Taking Argentina as an example, the country is so incapable of paying its debt that it had to issue 100-year bonds to try to alleviate the current crisis.

Appleton, who goes by the name Crypto Crow on YouTube, will air his 13-episode Crypto Crow Show on CBS, the CW, and Roku, with estimates suggesting an audience of more than 47 million households.\nThe Crypto Crow Show will initially air in selected markets to test whether it can generate enough viewer interest. Should it prove successful, it will go national under a deal Appleton has signed with CBS Television Networks.\nThe official announcement reads:\n“This will be the first time a cryptocurrency Youtuber has launched their own television series fully paid for by Bitcoin. All promotional sponsors, features and the like are paid by Bitcoin.”\nThe first season will premiere on June 25, reaching audiences in New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Detroit, Atlanta, and Tampa Bay. Additionally, it will be available to some 30 million households through the Roku streaming service.\n“Each episode will feature educational information focused on helping newcomers to the crypto space such as researching, investing and how to stay secure in their efforts while featuring ICO and cryptocurrency companies and how they affect the industry,” the statement added.\nThe episodes are carefully planned and will touch on issues such as the nature of digital currencies, exchange trading, initial coin offerings, cryptocurrency security, swing trading, bot trading for profits, crypto market predictions, crypto cycles and crashes, virtual currency mining versus investing, and the future of digital assets.\nAppleton gained popularity and established himself as a major online influencer when he launched his Crypto Show on Youtube in November 2017. His subscriber base exceeded 70,000 in just three months. Crypto TV for the masses\nWe recently reported on another TV venture looking to keep investors and the general public informed about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.

With 43 percent of homebuyers starting their home search online and 92 percent of them using the internet is some way, agents must find a way to compete on a high level.\nReal estate agents aren’t typically technology people, and their lack of website development knowledge can often be detrimental to their success.\nSearch engine optimization (SEO) is equally important. An agent may have the most impressive website out there, but if there is minimal traffic being driven to the site it really doesn’t matter. It’s like having an amazing sports car that stays parked in the garage. Agents also need to consider the challenge of competing with national websites that spend millions on online marketing.\nA lot of these agents that can’t compete are simply lacking resources. This includes an adequate budget, or the knowledge of where to turn to get the best advice and technology.\nNational brokerages have one main goal in mind to brand their company name. A lot of realtors that do lack resources feel almost forced to work under a national company to compete in the website and SEO race.\nThere are pros and cons to being independent or working with a national company. There may be literally hundreds of agents representing that same company which makes it difficult for the agent to establish their own brand and identity.\nThe question is if the benefits of working with a national company outweigh the franchise fees that can range from six to ten percent. There is no getting away from that expense and as the agency grows that percentage continues to eat away at profits. Imagine having more technology at the local brokerage level, without spending the 100k per site to build a technology-based solution from the ground up. The national sites come with franchise fees, but the decadent nature of mega-brokerages keeps them from advancing on the cutting edge of individual market web presence.\nThe ultimate solution for an agent would be to keep their independence while still having the technology support and lead generation. Deedcoin and Boon Tech are incorporating high tech platforms backing local websites to decentralize the entire industry. The Boon platform provides access to the developers needed to bring the online real estate presence to the 21 st century. Advertisement advertisement\nDeedcoin will provide a website with advanced platform capabilities for their brokers that allow for the application of advanced technology to help generate customers. Boon Tech will provide the developments through full stack, data gathering, AI programming, webmasters, and integrations with to customize the website tools for each agent to fulfill their needs. Deedcoin will pay up to half of the cost to implement those developers based on the Deedcoin redeemed from customers in their area.\nThe website, again, is the sports car, but Deedcoin and Boon Tech get it out on the open road with the constant upgrades required to win the race individually in 600 markets.\nOne of the most important roles in a real estate relationship is the Comparative Market Analysis (CMA). Performing a CMA provides the information needed on other homes selling in the area to determine an asking price. Using developers from the Boon platform to program data gathering tools and algorithms will find relevant properties at a faster, more accurate rate to allow agents to make more specific recommendations to customers. The webmaster services provided through Boon Tech will also incorporate AI. It will collect local event info, syndicate real estate news and post content to maximize SEO capability.\nThere is also a feature that allows the agent to email local leads that are generated through the content campaigns and localize customer tools. It enables the agent to improve response time to clients and utilizes chat bots. The AI has schedule management capability for the agent. There is a feature that eliminates language barriers with AI technology that allows live translations in real time.\nFor advanced clients that the agent services, the technology identifies articles that target investment opportunities and has a feed of new listings based on the client’s specs for buying.\nReal Estate is a very competitive industry. Agents across the country are continually trying to gain any advantage they can to be successful. The Boon Tech and Deedcoin partnership allows agents to compete will any sized brokerage while providing the best service that modern online technology technology can provide.\nDisclaimer: BTCManager does not endorse any content or product on this page.

A piece of gold today will have the exact same properties in 1000 years that it has today. This gives it predictability.\nCryptocurrency is not this. Cryptocurrency is mutable. IT'S SOFTWARE. That means the properties of the asset change whenever the software changes. The bitcoins that I bought in 2012 no longer exist. They have morphed into Bitcoin Core with Segwit, Bitcoin Cash (soon with opcodes), Bitcoin Gold and Diamond and Candy and God knows what else.\nBut the coins with the 2012 characteristics are no more. This is very different from gold. It means the asset can \"morph out from underneath you\". You thought you were buying a digital gold token, you wake up to discover its blockchain has been replatformed for music delivery - or as a back-end for a social media platform - through a series of code changes and community reorganizations.\nWhether this is \"good\" or \"bad\" is irrelevant.

For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem.

Late in the week, the price fell below $9,000, accompanied by negative news out of Asia. The rest of the crypto space also plunged reflexively, with most major coins declining twice or even three times as much as Bitcoin.\nSouth Korean prosecutors conducted a raid of the country’s largest Bitcoin exchange, UpBit. Hard drives and ledgers were seized as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent practices. UpBit is suspected of selling crypto to phantom clients.\nThe trustee handling the Mt. Gox bankruptcy case has sold a further 8,000 bitcoins this week, in 4 batches of 2,000 coins. Previous liquidations by this trustee, seemingly conducted without regard for market effects, have also exerted downward price pressure.\nChina’s Huawei corporation placed the BTC.com Bitcoin wallet in its application store. As the Google Play Store and portions of the iTunes store are banned in China, Huawei’s AppGallery is likely to become a popular download destination for Chinese users seeking a mobile wallet.\nFinally, Dandelion – a prototype code for a new privacy-enhancing feature for Bitcoin was released . Dandelion prevents the linkage of IP addresses with new transactions. It works by routing a new transaction through a random series of nodes before broadcasting the transaction to the entire network.\nThat’s what happened this week in Bitcoin. See you next week.

The BTC/USD pair broke an ascending channel with support at $8,450 on the hourly chart (data feed from Kraken). The pair must stay above the $8,300 support level to avoid any further declines in the short term.\nBitcoin price recovered from $8,220 against the US Dollar. However, BTC/USD is finding it difficult to break the $8,800-9,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Analysis\nThis past week, we saw a downside reaction from well above $9,000 in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The price broke many support levels such as $9,000, $8,500 and $8,400 to trade close to $8,200. A low was formed at $8,226 before the price started an upside correction. It moved above the $8,400 resistance and even cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $9,391 high to $9,225 swing low.\nHowever, the upside move was capped by the $8,800 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It was rejected from the 100 hourly SMA and declined back below $8,600. The BTC/USD pair broke an ascending channel with support at $8,450 on the hourly chart. The recent downside break indicates that the pair was rejected from the $8,800 resistance zone. It is currently trading below the $8,500 support with a bearish angle . However, there is a major support forming near $8,300. As long as the price is above the stated $8,300 support, it is likely to move higher in the near term.\nLooking at the chart , the price seems to be consolidating above $8,300. Once the current consolidation phase is over, BTC price may either move above $8,500 or break $8,200 for more losses.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is now back in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently well below the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $8,300\nMajor Resistance Level – $8,600 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T13:40:55.003+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32210, "moreResultsAvailable": 4410, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=27800", "requestsLeft": 384}
