Thus, customers will be able to buy the two added cryptos from the Revolut mobile app. This move signals the company's desire to establish itself in the emerging cryptocurrency fintech market.\nBitcoin Cash Added to the Mix Revolut was founded in London in 2015 as a fintech firm with a core focus on providing alternative digital banking solutions. The company dabbled in cryptocurrency in 2017, offering exchange services for Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. Revolut has a partnership with Luxembourg-based Bitstamp to facilitate its cryptocurrency transactions. Bitstamp is reportedly the oldest surviving cryptocurrency exchange platform in the world. The addition of Bitcoin Cash and Ripple brings the London-based firm's crypto catalog to five supported cryptocurrencies.\nThe firm charges 1.5 percent on every cryptocurrency transaction, and it reportedly facilitates 100,000 such deals per day. Not bad for a company whose primary focus isn't digital currency trading. Revolut supports about 120 different fiat currencies, allowing people from different parts of the world to make use of its services. The firm differs from most traditional crypto exchange platforms in a few ways. Account holders cannot use the Revolut app to transfer or receive cryptocurrency tokens. The platform only enables the buying/selling and holding of cryptocurrency tokens. Revolut also has a vault service that allows users to save small amounts of cryptocurrencies.\nRecent Revolut Developments Revolut currently has a user base of 1.95 million customers with more than 20 percent of that figure engaged in the company's cryptocurrency exchange service. The company wants to increase its user base to 100 million in the next five years. As part of these expansion efforts, Nikolay Storonsky, the CEO of Revolut announced recently that the firm plans to issue a new debit card. He went on to say :\nIn the next three months, we're going to launch Platinum cards; it's a metallic card that allows you to get 1% cash back in cryptocurrencies and also provides you a concierge service.\nDespite being only three years old, Revolut is already a fintech unicorn valued at more than $1.7 billion. The company recently completed a $250 million fundraising round targeted at expanding its operations. The London-based fintech firm also plans to apply for a European banking license. The company is no stranger to successful funding rounds having already completed three of such rounds in the past.\nWill Revolut be able to meet its target of 100 million users in the next five years? Should the firm add more cryptocurrencies to its trading catalog?

In old financial system Fiat currency is controlled. but crypto world anyone launching the coins. so is there any chances of economy crash due to bitcoin and crypto??\nThe Crypto currency does not have such a strong influence on the world economy, as it seems to many. Crypto currency is used mainly by citizens, not by state bodies. States are more interested in blockchein technology and its application in various areas of the economy than decentralized crypto currency. Therefore, there is no strong influence on the economies of the countries. While the states are not going to use the crypto currency as the main type of money for circulation on the territory of their country. If this happened, then indeed such a crypto currency would, because of its high volatility, have a destructive effect on this country.\nI think it is not the bitcoin who can kill the world's economy. As what I have observe bitcoin is a big help and it can really alsobelp the country if they are going to support bitcoin. Bitcoin today is wealth and it is really now precious like gold. This bitcoin is amazing and it can really give us a new hope also with the economy.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T11:11:36.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d88054757431951a6131376f5d4d90b6caaefc14", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSbnEJA0lXItO6RP8t0cPUI-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Will bitcoin win?", "title_full": "Will bitcoin win?", "published": "2018-05-26T16:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.038, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d88054757431951a6131376f5d4d90b6caaefc14", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmSbnEJA0lXItO6RP8t0cPUI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ZAYANDI", "published": "2018-05-26T16:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Will bitcoin win?", "text": "Yes, of course, it will win.

Thus, customers will be able to buy the two added cryptos from the Revolut mobile app. This move signals the company’s desire to establish itself in the emerging cryptocurrency fintech market.\nBitcoin Cash Added to the Mix Revolut was founded in London in 2015 as a fintech firm with a core focus on providing alternative digital banking solutions. The company dabbled in cryptocurrency in 2017, offering exchange services for Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. Revolut has a partnership with Luxembourg-based Bitstamp to facilitate its cryptocurrency transactions. Bitstamp is reportedly the oldest surviving cryptocurrency exchange platform in the world. The addition of Bitcoin Cash and Ripple brings the London-based firm’s crypto catalog to five supported cryptocurrencies.\nThe firm charges 1.5 percent on every cryptocurrency transaction, and it reportedly facilitates 100,000 such deals per day. Not bad for a company whose primary focus isn’t digital currency trading. Revolut supports about 120 different fiat currencies, allowing people from different parts of the world to make use of its services. The firm differs from most traditional crypto exchange platforms in a few ways. Account holders cannot use the Revolut app to transfer or receive cryptocurrency tokens. The platform only enables the buying/selling and holding of cryptocurrency tokens. Revolut also has a vault service that allows users to save small amounts of cryptocurrencies.\nRecent Revolut Developments Revolut currently has a user base of 1.95 million customers with more than 20 percent of that figure engaged in the company’s cryptocurrency exchange service. The company wants to increase its user base to 100 million in the next five years. As part of these expansion efforts, Nikolay Storonsky, the CEO of Revolut announced recently that the firm plans to issue a new debit card. He went on to say :\nIn the next three months, we’re going to launch Platinum cards; it’s a metallic card that allows you to get 1% cash back in cryptocurrencies and also provides you a concierge service.\nDespite being only three years old, Revolut is already a fintech unicorn valued at more than $1.7 billion. The company recently completed a $250 million fundraising round targeted at expanding its operations. The London-based fintech firm also plans to apply for a European banking license. The company is no stranger to successful funding rounds having already completed three of such rounds in the past.\nWill Revolut be able to meet its target of 100 million users in the next five years? Should the firm add more cryptocurrencies to its trading catalog?

In October of 2017 I traded some litecoin for another crypto. Then in January 2018 the tax bill passed and eliminated the like to like exchanges of crypto.\nMy interpretation is that since I made the trade before the law changed then I did not create a taxable event. Am I wrong in this interpretation?\nSome forces are trying to consider Bitcoin as an asset so that they may be able to get taxes on everything a Bitcoin user buys. Bitcoin is not an asset but a currency which is favorable for transaction of money and a source of investment therefore it is a currency and not an asset.

Reports about these promising developments in the labor market and the public sector come from Australia. Also, the Slovak tax authority intends to use blockchain technology for more efficient tax collection.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Friday: Luxury Jets, Cheap Air Tickets Now Offered for Bitcoin Cash\nCrypto-Based Hiring Platform Supports Instant Pay Option A new employment service offers to cut out banks and pay workers in real-time using cryptocurrency. Another feature will rate employees using a blockchain-based reputation and review process, designed to ensure that higher quality work gets paid better. The \"Pay As You Go\" system has been launched recently in Australia.\nSergei Sergienko, the entrepreneur behind the project, claims that instant salary payments are possible with cryptos, tokens, and thanks to the underlying technology – blockchain. His \"global job platform\" Laborx is developed to do exactly that – pay employees while they are working, so that everyone can start spending on the way home.\n\"The way for people to be remunerated is based on pre-Industrial Revolution kind of wages – you spend the time in the factory, and you get paid,\" he said, quoted by Business Insider Australia . \"If you look around, everything else has changed. And it's really, really weird that the way people get paid for their services, for their time, for their work, has not gone through any revolution of sorts,\" Sergienko noted.\nThe businessman, who owns a successful labor hire, staffing and training company called the Edway Group, believes that the revolution comes in the form of the \"Labour-Hour Tokens\" (LHT) and the hiring ecosystem of Laborx, which is now live in beta version. Using it, companies can hire anyone – from top experts from around the world, to local fruit pickers – and pay them instantly with cryptocurrency. \"A fair hour's pay for a fair hour's work\" has been promised.\nLaborx also features a tokenized reputation system. Its developers say that it combines dozens of candidate data points and stores the information on a blockchain. The platform is said to ensure job seekers get their best market rate, while also eliminating payment delays and disputes. \"If your reviews are consistently good, you can charge more per hour for your services. And the person who hires you knows you're worth it,\" Sergei Sergienko explains. Other cryptocurrency projects to be trialing this model include time-based \"knowledge transfer\" service Whenhub , founded by Dilbert creator Scott Adams.\nDistributed Ledger to Be Used For Welfare Delivery While the private sector has been developing a crypto-hiring platform, Australian authorities have been planning to employ blockchain technology to improve the welfare payments delivery in the country. The intentions were made public recently by the Digital Transformation Agency, a government body tasked with the digitization of public services and government institutions. The project to put social security payments on blockchain will pilot the wider implementation of the technology.\n\"Our plan is to look for use cases across the Commonwealth with an initial focus on the welfare payment delivery system. Then, working with our digital service standard, we'll conduct user research with a view to having a prototype by the end of next financial year,\" said DTA's acting CEO Randall Brugeaud during the Cebit Australia conference in Sidney last week.\nRecently, The DTA received AU$700,000 from the 2018-19 budget to probe the implementation of distributed ledger technologies in the public sector. Brugeaud commented that the funds will give his agency an opportunity to explore innovative ways to securely and efficiently deliver government services using blockchain.\nSlovak Tax Authority Eyes Blockchain for Efficient Collection The Financial Administration of Slovakia aims to become a pioneer in blockchain technology implementation. The tax authority in Bratislava intends to use it to streamline its processes and procedures. The main objective is to make tax collection more efficient, the president of Finančná Správa , František Imrecze told Hospodárske Noviny .\nThe technology, which underpins most cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, will be implemented in Slovakia's taxation system to initially process about 2 percent of all tax payments, the publication details. The use of blockchain technologies is expected to increase the trust of taxpayers and protect their personal data. Authorities also hope to increase the transparency of tax collection, reduce red tape and minimize costs, Imrecze explained.\nMembers of the local crypto community and the non-government sector are not sure about the prospects of the project. According to Martin Lindák, analyst with the liberal think-tank F. A. Hayek Foundation, the transparency and security of blockchain applications are there only when they are decentralized. A blockchain lacking this key feature would be just an overpriced database for the public administration, Lindák warned in conversation with the newspaper.\nDo you think crypto and blockchain technologies can be successfully implemented in public services and labor relations?

This can be translated to Bitcoin being held at the same value as Unilever, while Ethereum is held at the same value as Starbucks and Walgreens Boots Alliance. Today the investors in the cryptocurrencies listed above are highly speculative. This forces the cryptocurrencies to be highly volatile with the prices and value proving hard to accurately estimate. What is Bitcoin?\nBitcoin is the first decentralised cryptocurrency and is a globally accepted payment system. The currency operates without a bank or administrators. The transactions are based on peer-to-peer and they take place without the intervention of an intermediary. The transactions are then verified by the network nodes through a cryptography and recorded in a ledger referred to as a blockchain.\nThe bitcoin cryptocurrency was created by an individual or group of individuals using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It was released into the market in the year 2009. Mining is the process of acquiring bitcoins from the open source software. Once acquired they can be traded for services, goods and other currencies. Today more than 100,000 merchants accept payment in bitcoins. By 2017 there were more than 5 million unique bitcoin users of bitcoins.\nWhat is Ethereum?\nEthereum is a computing platform that is decentralised, blockchain based and has an operating system that features smart contract functionality. This platform was invented in the year 2013, by a cryptocurrency programmer and researcher, Vitalik Buterin. The development of the platform was then funded by crowdsale between the months of July and August in the year 2014. In 2015 the system went live.\nThere were 11.9 million coins that were pre-mined at that time. This is only 13% of the total amount of coins circulating online today. Ethereum Virtual Machine executes scripts with the public nodes formed through the international network. It also uses a pricing mechanism called gas that enables spam mitigation and allocates resources rightfully on the network.\nDifference Between Bitcoin and Ethereum Creator\nBitcoin was created by one individual or a group of people under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Ethereum platform was invented by Vitalik Buterin. Currency Issuance Timing\nBitcoin network creates a total of 12.5 unique bitcoins every ten minutes. Ethereum creates three unique coins every fifteen seconds. Currency Cap\nBitcoins are limited to a total of 21 million coins. As of today there are 16.7 million mined. Ethereum doesn’t have a currency cap, so far, there are 96.4 million ethers circulating. There are however, plans to cap the issuance after a couple of years. Block Creation\nBitcoin network creates new blocks on average every ten minutes. Ethereum creates new blocks within every fifteen seconds on average. Scripting Language\nEthereum uses a Turing-complete full multi-purpose integrated language. Any contract that is built with this language is referred to as a smart contract. Bitcoin has a built in scripting language that is limited and can only complete a couple of operations. Costing\nBitcoin transactions are always based on the size or amount. Ethereum transactions are assigned a cost referred to as gas, this occurs with all operations or the use of the storage provided on the blockchain. Block limits\nThe blocks of bitcoins are limited to 1MB or 8BM for the Bitcoin Cash. For Ethereum, the blocks are limited by gas-limits. Which is the total overhead for all operations within the block. In conclusion, bitcoin can process four transactions within a second while Ethereum can process fifteen. Accounts\nEthereum has two accounts, one holds the funds of the user, the other stores the computer codes. Bitcoin has only one account that stores the funds and the related codes. Algorithm Performance\nThe bitcoin algorithm (SHA-256) is performed efficiently with the use of special hardware referred to as ASICs. ASICs are application specific integrated circuit. The Ethereum’s algorithm (KECCAK-256) is more complicated and memory intensive, such that no special-purpose chip can be used to perform the algorithms. Future Plans\nEthereum plans to move from the mining process by changing the algorithm from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake. The PoS invents blocks on the basis of the token holdings of the network nodes rather than the previously used computational power. Ethereum also plans on tackling scalability by using a sharding process. Sharding breaks up the blockchains into several interconnected sub-blockchains. Bitcoins has not made any related future plans. Bitcoin vs. Ethereum : Comparion Chart Summary of Bitcoin vs. Ethereum Bitcoin is a globally accepted payment means and a decentralised cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was released in the market in 2009. Bitcoins are limited to a total of 21 million coins whereas ethereum platform has no limit. The bitcoin technology can only issue 12.5 bitcoins every 10 minutes, ethereum can issue 3 ethers every fifteen seconds. Bitcoin blocks are created every ten minutes while one ethereum block is created every fifteen seconds. Currently the ethers circulating in the market amounts to $88 billion while the bitcoins circulating amount to $143 billion.

Reports about these promising developments in the labor market and the public sector come from Australia. Also, the Slovak tax authority intends to use blockchain technology for more efficient tax collection.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Friday: Luxury Jets, Cheap Air Tickets Now Offered for Bitcoin Cash Crypto-Based Hiring Platform Supports Instant Pay Option\nA new employment service offers to cut out banks and pay workers in real-time using cryptocurrency. Another feature will rate employees using a blockchain-based reputation and review process, designed to ensure that higher quality work gets paid better. The “Pay As You Go” system has been launched recently in Australia.\nSergei Sergienko, the entrepreneur behind the project, claims that instant salary payments are possible with cryptos, tokens, and thanks to the underlying technology – blockchain. His “global job platform” Laborx is developed to do exactly that – pay employees while they are working, so that everyone can start spending on the way home.\n“The way for people to be remunerated is based on pre-Industrial Revolution kind of wages – you spend the time in the factory, and you get paid,” he said, quoted by Business Insider Australia . “If you look around, everything else has changed. And it’s really, really weird that the way people get paid for their services, for their time, for their work, has not gone through any revolution of sorts,” Sergienko noted.\nThe businessman, who owns a successful labor hire, staffing and training company called the Edway Group, believes that the revolution comes in the form of the “Labour-Hour Tokens” (LHT) and the hiring ecosystem of Laborx, which is now live in beta version. Using it, companies can hire anyone – from top experts from around the world, to local fruit pickers – and pay them instantly with cryptocurrency. “A fair hour’s pay for a fair hour’s work” has been promised.\nLaborx also features a tokenized reputation system. Its developers say that it combines dozens of candidate data points and stores the information on a blockchain. The platform is said to ensure job seekers get their best market rate, while also eliminating payment delays and disputes. “If your reviews are consistently good, you can charge more per hour for your services. And the person who hires you knows you’re worth it,” Sergei Sergienko explains. Other cryptocurrency projects to be trialing this model include time-based “knowledge transfer” service Whenhub , founded by Dilbert creator Scott Adams. Distributed Ledger to Be Used For Welfare Delivery\nWhile the private sector has been developing a crypto-hiring platform, Australian authorities have been planning to employ blockchain technology to improve the welfare payments delivery in the country. The intentions were made public recently by the Digital Transformation Agency, a government body tasked with the digitization of public services and government institutions. The project to put social security payments on blockchain will pilot the wider implementation of the technology.\n“Our plan is to look for use cases across the Commonwealth with an initial focus on the welfare payment delivery system. Then, working with our digital service standard, we’ll conduct user research with a view to having a prototype by the end of next financial year,” said DTA’s acting CEO Randall Brugeaud during the Cebit Australia conference in Sidney last week.\nRecently, The DTA received AU$700,000 from the 2018-19 budget to probe the implementation of distributed ledger technologies in the public sector. Brugeaud commented that the funds will give his agency an opportunity to explore innovative ways to securely and efficiently deliver government services using blockchain. Slovak Tax Authority Eyes Blockchain for Efficient Collection\nThe Financial Administration of Slovakia aims to become a pioneer in blockchain technology implementation. The tax authority in Bratislava intends to use it to streamline its processes and procedures. The main objective is to make tax collection more efficient, the president of Finančná Správa , František Imrecze told Hospodárske Noviny .\nThe technology, which underpins most cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, will be implemented in Slovakia’s taxation system to initially process about 2 percent of all tax payments, the publication details. The use of blockchain technologies is expected to increase the trust of taxpayers and protect their personal data. Authorities also hope to increase the transparency of tax collection, reduce red tape and minimize costs, Imrecze explained.\nMembers of the local crypto community and the non-government sector are not sure about the prospects of the project. According to Martin Lindák, analyst with the liberal think-tank F. A. Hayek Foundation, the transparency and security of blockchain applications are there only when they are decentralized. A blockchain lacking this key feature would be just an overpriced database for the public administration, Lindák warned in conversation with the newspaper.\nDo you think crypto and blockchain technologies can be successfully implemented in public services and labor relations?

Because in order for them to make decisions that will benefit them in the future, they need to know the truth.\nWhen this happens, eventually you will see key authoritative figures flip around. When that happens, people that listen to these authorities will also be willing to flip with them.\nNow I know what you are thinking: in Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency there is no authority.\nWell you are dead wrong. If everybody had the exact same skillset as Satoshi (whomever he/her/they be) you would be correct.\nBut my mom and dad will never fully understand Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency and neither do they have a desire to. But when I tell them that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin and I can briefly explain to them why, that's good enough for them.\nThey trust me. When it comes to Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency, I am an authority in their lives.\nAnd so to say that there are no authorities in Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency, is to deny the human factor in Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency. This works for robots, but not for human beings.\nAgain we can separate people in to two groups:\nthose that believe that people serve code\nthose that believe that code serves people.\nThe Bitcoin Core camp is very strongly in the first group. The Bitcoin Cash camp is very strongly in the second group.\nBut the Free Open Source Software movement came from people like Richard Stallman and Pruce Perens and Bitcoin and cypher punks in general came from that very same movement.\nLet's look at this Quote: from Revolution OS.\nOpen Source is a way for people to collaborate on software without being encumbered by all of the problems of intellectual property, having to negotiate contracts every time you buy a piece of software, have a lot of lawyers involved. In general, we just wanna get the software to work and we want be able to have people contribute fixes to that, etc.. So we sort of sacrifice some of the intellectual property rights and just let the whole world use the software.\nNow ask yourself. What vision does this align with?\nThe people serve the code\nThe code serve the people.\nThe answer is obvious, the code serves the people.\nIf you are in the Core camp you have been bamboozled. Their and yours incentives don't line up. You got to ask yourself: Why am I in to Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency?\nBecause it you are just in to Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency to get rich without doing any work... well ... either it already made you rich without doing any work. OR ... it might make your rich in the future. BUT THE WORK. THE WORK IS WHAT MAKES THAT HAPPEN OR NOT.\nSo ask yourself this: Where are the workers? Where are the problem solvers. Where are the creative people.\nBecause all I get from the bitcoin core people is: the code has spoken, final answer. We will remove any further questions. Even those outside or /r/bitcoin that are in the core camp will allow you to speak and debate untill they draw a line and start limiting your free speech: \"This is about bitcoin, not the bcash altcoin. You are not allowed to talk about bcash any furder\"\nI don't think that a value system like that could ever produce a better world. Unless you like to end up being enslaved by some code. Then there won't be a human being to talk to when you to to the bank. Just a computer that might say: no\nAnd if you want to get enriched by Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency, long term ... it can only happen because Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency produces real value for the entire world and you benefit from the overflow of that.\nSo the choice is easy:\nShort term profit by basically plundering the fiat wallets of the new hodlers.\nLong term profit by creating something that adds value to the internet, and thus the world, and thus you.\nThe first one is easy but that phase might end at any moment.\nThe second one requires hard work.\nNeither of them are a given but I give option two a higher chance of success and option one a very high change of failure because it does not work on a human level and the incentives are skewed big time. It operates like those catholic priests that refused to translate the bible from Latin in to the language of the common man because that would mean that now people could read the text themselves and question their authoritative which would mean a loss of power and influence over them.\nBasically \"we serve the code and you should not question it\" is a religion. Well, it's very small so right now it's a cult. But if it grows big it might become a religion. Even when BCH takes over ... this danger will always be there. That we build something so glorious that we start serving it, instead of it serving us. Do not get enslaved.\nThe choice is yours. Choose wisely because if you are all in to Bitcoin Core and the price drops to zero, you will loose everything. And who will compensate you. You think those people at Consesnus 2018 will show you any mercy, sell there lambos and watches and give you some money back?\nI also posted this on /r/bitcoin but it got instantly removed by some code that some people will claim is not working properly but most of us know it's doing exactly what the writers intended it to do.\n submitted by /u/Kain_niaK\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQ3TM-p2QI", "https://youtu.be/jw8K460vx1c?t=194"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T11:38:33.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fbf61737e9f2bf7dc4819037dc6f2b534e10053f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJVDZ1QK.O8Pn7w9T0Kw2sABGBr19dPZnukigQ3H6jz9RUy_bMfRNQu4yJ70WckiE7VXcVgJfZj9UxGnQAq2E1mAwa5h10OznVIgLiwe2GZrCZ4p3jkJst.eyxEbEmYgtSRv.RGF._Ih7pmU1syz._Etp1y1O3THLnTXbQe5oGKTcHrXG7RwyRL0DMiSYlfodB_6_7HgB5DEA5PQhWLo1nq3HmIZ.lcfy6xRaRSqeWKzcweIQt_kzQ6.giA4S.dPyrHY89QZegxTMk0TFDFueOc2I9QUFfgMeFw0IjyiLybc79BPonZIaqoVgnVHfQioKfFhc2_yjlFBQnUsLyIp9EFdIrBiePFjfBqOVglW28OXEDCgkA0zMAe6n0Ecu7Q4zTX9XoxLOS_PI5z83SaXp.LY", "site_full": "news.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "http://www.nigeriatoday.ng/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nigeria Today", "title": "Banking app Revolut adds Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) for its payment options – TheOofy.com", "title_full": "Banking app Revolut adds Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) for its payment options – TheOofy.com", "published": "2018-05-26T15:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fbf61737e9f2bf7dc4819037dc6f2b534e10053f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJVDZ1QK.O8Pn7w9T0Kw2sABGBr19dPZnukigQ3H6jz9RUy_bMfRNQu4yJ70WckiE7VXcVgJfZj9UxGnQAq2E1mAwa5h10OznVIgLiwe2GZrCZ4p3jkJst.eyxEbEmYgtSRv.RGF._Ih7pmU1syz._Etp1y1O3THLnTXbQe5oGKTcHrXG7RwyRL0DMiSYlfodB_6_7HgB5DEA5PQhWLo1nq3HmIZ.lcfy6xRaRSqeWKzcweIQt_kzQ6.giA4S.dPyrHY89QZegxTMk0TFDFueOc2I9QUFfgMeFw0IjyiLybc79BPonZIaqoVgnVHfQioKfFhc2_yjlFBQnUsLyIp9EFdIrBiePFjfBqOVglW28OXEDCgkA0zMAe6n0Ecu7Q4zTX9XoxLOS_PI5z83SaXp.LY", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Business - Google News", "published": "2018-05-26T15:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Banking app Revolut adds Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) for its payment options – TheOofy.com", "text": "Banking app Revolut adds Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) for its payment options - TheOofy.com — Nigeria Today Home » Business » Banking app Revolut adds Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) for its payment options – TheOofy.com Banking app Revolut adds Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) for its payment options – TheOofy.com Banking app Revolut adds Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) for its payment options TheOofy.com The mobile application Revolut has recently added the option to buy XRP and Bitcoin cash.

Thus, customers will be able to buy the two added cryptos from the Revolut mobile app. This move signals the company’s desire to establish itself in the emerging cryptocurrency fintech market. Bitcoin Cash Added to the Mix\nRevolut was founded in London in 2015 as a fintech firm with a core focus on providing alternative digital banking solutions. The company dabbled in cryptocurrency in 2017, offering exchange services for Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum. Revolut has a partnership with Luxembourg-based Bitstamp to facilitate its cryptocurrency transactions. Bitstamp is reportedly the oldest surviving cryptocurrency exchange platform in the world. The addition of Bitcoin Cash and Ripple brings the London-based firm’s crypto catalog to five supported cryptocurrencies.\nThe firm charges 1.5 percent on every cryptocurrency transaction, and it reportedly facilitates 100,000 such deals per day. Not bad for a company whose primary focus isn’t digital currency trading. Revolut supports about 120 different fiat currencies, allowing people from different parts of the world to make use of its services. The firm differs from most traditional crypto exchange platforms in a few ways. Account holders cannot use the Revolut app to transfer or receive cryptocurrency tokens. The platform only enables the buying/selling and holding of cryptocurrency tokens. Revolut also has a vault service that allows users to save small amounts of cryptocurrencies. Recent Revolut Developments\nRevolut currently has a user base of 1.95 million customers with more than 20 percent of that figure engaged in the company’s cryptocurrency exchange service. The company wants to increase its user base to 100 million in the next five years. As part of these expansion efforts, Nikolay Storonsky, the CEO of Revolut announced recently that the firm plans to issue a new debit card. He went on to say :\nIn the next three months, we’re going to launch Platinum cards; it’s a metallic card that allows you to get 1% cash back in cryptocurrencies and also provides you a concierge service.\nDespite being only three years old, Revolut is already a fintech unicorn valued at more than $1.7 billion. The company recently completed a $250 million fundraising round targeted at expanding its operations. The London-based fintech firm also plans to apply for a European banking license. The company is no stranger to successful funding rounds having already completed three of such rounds in the past.\nWill Revolut be able to meet its target of 100 million users in the next five years? Should the firm add more cryptocurrencies to its trading catalog?

After that, a flippening is pretty much a given. Only Tether is still a big unknown.", "text": "I am seeing more and more genuine people ask good questions. Why? Because in order for them to make decisions that will benefit them in the future, they need to know the truth.\nWhen this happens, eventually you will see key authoritative figures flip around. When that happens, people that listen to these authorities will also be willing to flip with them.\nNow I know what you are thinking: in Bitcoin there is no authority.\nWell you are dead wrong. If everybody had the exact same skillset as Satoshi (whomever he/her/they be) you would be correct.\nBut my mom and dad will never fully understand Bitcoin and neither do they have a desire to. But when I tell them that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin and I can briefly explain to them why, that's good enough for them.\nThey trust me. When it comes to Bitcoin, I am an authority in their lives.\nAnd so to say that there are no authorities in Bitcoin, is to deny the human factor in Bitcoin. This works for robots, but not for human beings.\nAgain we can separate people in to two groups:\nthose that believe that people serve code\nthose that believe that code serves people.\nThe Bitcoin Core camp is very strongly in the first group. The Bitcoin Cash camp is very strongly in the second group.\nBut the Free Open Source Software movement came from people like Richard Stallman and Bruce Perens and Bitcoin and cypher punks in general came from that very same movement.\nLet's look at this Quote: from Revolution OS.\nOpen Source is a way for people to collaborate on software without being encumbered by all of the problems of intellectual property, having to negotiate contracts every time you buy a piece of software, have a lot of lawyers involved. In general, we just wanna get the software to work and we want be able to have people contribute fixes to that, etc.. So we sort of sacrifice some of the intellectual property rights and just let the whole world use the software.\nNow ask yourself. What vision does this align with?\nThe people serve the code\nThe code serve the people.\nThe answer is obvious, the code serves the people.\nIf you are in the Core camp you have been bamboozled. Their and yours incentives don't line up. You got to ask yourself: Why am I in to Bitcoin?\nBecause it you are just in to Bitcoin to get rich without doing any work... well ... either it already made you rich without doing any work. OR ... it might make your rich in the future. BUT THE WORK. THE WORK IS WHAT MAKES THAT HAPPEN OR NOT.\nSo ask yourself this: Where are the workers? Where are the problem solvers. Where are the creative people.\nBecause all I get from the bitcoin core people is: the code has spoken, final answer. We will remove any further questions. Even those outside or /r/bitcoin that are in the core camp will allow you to speak and debate untill they draw a line and start limiting your free speech: \"This is about bitcoin, not the bcash altcoin. You are not allowed to talk about bcash any furder\"\nI don't think that a value system like that could ever produce a better world. Unless you like to end up being enslaved by some code. Then there won't be a human being to talk to when you to to the bank. Just a computer that might say: no\nAnd if you want to get enriched by Bitcoin, long term ... it can only happen because Bitcoin produces real value for the entire world and you benefit from the overflow of that.\nSo the choice is easy:\nShort term profit by basically plundering the fiat wallets of the new hodlers.\nLong term profit by creating something that adds value to the internet, and thus the world, and thus you.\nThe first one is easy but that phase might end at any moment.\nThe second one requires hard work.\nNeither of them are a given but I give option two a higher chance of success and option one a very high change of failure because it does not work on a human level and the incentives are skewed big time. It operates like those catholic priests that refused to translate the bible from Latin in to the language of the common man because that would mean that now people could read the text themselves and question their authoritative which would mean a loss of power and influence over them.\nBasically \"we serve the code and you should not question it\" is a religion. Well, it's very small so right now it's a cult. But if it grows big it might become a religion. Even when BCH takes over ... this danger will always be there. That we build something so glorious that we start serving it, instead of it serving us. Do not get enslaved.\nThe choice is yours. Choose wisely because if you are all in to Bitcoin Core and the price drops to zero, you will loose everything. And who will compensate you. You think those people at Consensus 2018 will show you any mercy, sell their lambos and watches and give you some money back?\nI also posted this on /r/bitcoin but it got instantly removed by some code ...\n submitted by /u/Kain_niaK\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQ3TM-p2QI", "https://youtu.be/jw8K460vx1c?t=194"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T10:06:58.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "472ece15df2ad3486a900c1093a72ebc56376450", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSzuDOKk_C66bZ5O_5_Tpfme49.JvcesNqVSXSSxppL2kpNPThiGmWWL3J9QvEIGJ.Vw.bwXSUL9wqXYftyhJJOU1jykhMA68FwMYtGKqHVm_gWGaOvczP6", "site_full": "lastestmoneynews.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://lastestmoneynews.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Money Business News", "title": "Buy a house with Ripple [XRP], Bitcoin [BTC], and Ethereum [ETH]!

If anyone has ANY information on how we can get in contact with him please get in touch and let us know. Until Steven Twain resurfaces or is found there is nothing the admin team can do.\nThe statement included a request for threats towards the leaders and admins to stop, suggesting legal proceedings as an alternative. It said that all of the admin staff had funded him independently and that they were missing a weeks worth of pay. It does also acknowledge that the staff had only two ways of contacting him.\nIn an email statement, the police said:\nMembers of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by BTC Global agents to invest with promises of 2 percent interest per day, 14 percent per week and ultimately 50 percent per month.\nA ponzi, or pyramid, scheme is a business model that requires a constantly expanding supply of new members.

Today we enabled another payment method, crypto currency, specifically Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nWhy? Well crypto currency is something we have been keeping an eye on for the last couple of years. It started off as a novelty, a new fangled thing that most thought probably wouldn’t take off, to what it is today, a huge digital industry evolving, growing and developing in front of our eyes. We are now of the opinion that it is here to stay and wanted to play our small part in bringing crypto currency to the mainstream.\nMany people around the world and in Australia already own some form of crypto currency. It can be held in digital wallets on your smartphone (e.g. BRD or Jaxx for example), in cold storage (e.g. Ledger Nano S ) or held in exchanges (e.g. BTC Markets ) where they can be traded for other crypto currencies or converted back to fiat, the money you and I know so well Australian dollars.\nThe e-commerce platform we use to sell Olympus digital voice products Australia wide is Shopify , their crypto currency partner is Coinbase Commerce .\nWant to know more about crypto, leave us a comment and we will try and answer. Have some crypto you would like to spend?

"text": "26th May 2018 , By Edward Rowe Why it’s only a matter of time before all mosques follow Masjid Ramadan’s lead and accept Bitcoin Bitcoin cryptocurrency Erkin Guney Gurmit Singh Islam Islamic finance Muslims Shacklewell Lane Ramadan Mosque Zayd al Khair\nBritain’s first Turkish-owned mosque made history this week becoming one of the first UK Islamic institutions to accept donations in Bitcoin – a digital or cryptocurrency operating independently from central banks.\nThe East London-based Masjid Ramadan , also known as Shacklewell Lane Mosque, “has embarked on a new venture, which is to take the Bitcoin as an accepted charity from those people who are giving charity in donation,” Imam Abduallah Abu Essa Adeyemi told a packed prayer room on Friday.\nThe mosque hopes to benefit from Zakat (or Zakah, annual alms-giving equivalent to 2.5% of a Muslim’s wealth) and Sadaqah (voluntary year-round donation) payments from Muslim cryptocurrency owners who are both obliged and encouraged to give selflessly during the holy month of Ramadan, or as Turks say Ramazan, which began in mid-May.\n“We are a small independent mosque, which does not receive funding from anywhere. We are constantly trying to serve the local community, both Muslims and non-Muslims alike, and all support is most welcome. Muslims can now give Zakat or Sadaqah as Bitcoins and Ethereum via our website,” the mosque’s board of Trustees Chairman Erkin Guney told a press briefing on Monday.\nThe mosque, which is a registered charity, hopes to raise at least £10,000 from cryptocurrency this Ramazan and donations for this year are earmarked to serve three main functions, including essential repairs to the mosque building, providing assistance to poor Muslim families with funeral costs and offering food and shelter to those in need locally. Gurmit Singh: “Bitcoin is often referred to as digital gold”\n“Cryptocurrency is a decentralised method of transferring wealth. There are many cryptocurrencies specifically designed for this purpose but the most well-known and the one with the largest market cap [value] is Bitcoin” Gurmit Singh told T-VINE.\nMr Singh is the founder of London-based Islamic Finance blockchain technology start-up Combo Innovation, who advised and assisted the mosque on how to receive, store and sell cryptocurrency safely.\n“Bitcoin is used to hold and transfer wealth” he explained, “Therefore Bitcoin is often referred to as digital gold”.\nOne Bitcoin is currently worth £5,658. This new money accounts for 37% of the cryptocurrency market, which is globally worth in excess of £290bn (stats from respected cryptocurrency ranking chart app CoinGekco). If Muslims own just 1% of all digital currency, then they are obligated to pay out Zakat on £2.9bn, creating a charitable pot of some £72.5mn. The figures are likely to be far higher, with this new revenue stream offering vital support to many small mosques and the charitable deeds they do. At the press briefing (L-R) Gurmit Singh, Erkin Guney, and Zayd al Khair, Masjid Ramadan, 21 May 2018. Photo © Ipek Ozerim\nWhen asked about how Combo Innovation helped Masjid Ramadan, Mr Singh explained “We provided advice and support for the mosque into accepting crypto donations. Our research showed that the value currently locked up in cryptocurrency was an opportunity to address the poverty that disproportionately affects Muslims.”\nAt the briefing on Monday, the fintech head highlighted that while a quarter of the world’s population are Muslims, they account for half of the world’s poor. Combo Innovation is developing a blockchain solution based on Islam’s Qard Hasan model to offer interest-free loans to those most in need and to pull them out of poverty. Zayd al Khair: “Zakat is a gift, to help purify our wealth. Cryptocurrency is new, but its usage is growing. In these circumstances, someone needs to lead. We’ve started this ground-breaking campaign. If successful, many more mosques will embrace cryptocurrencies too”\nMasjid Ramadan believes it can set an example for other Islamic institutions to adopt cryptocurrency as an additional way to collect donations for charitable works. “Zakat is a gift, to help purify our wealth. Cryptocurrency is new, but its usage is growing. In these circumstances, someone needs to lead. We’ve started this ground-breaking campaign. If it’s successful, I am sure many more mosques and [Islamic] charities will embrace cryptocurrencies too” said Zayd al Khair, a religious advisor to the mosque during Monday’s press briefing.\nIslamic scholars ( ulama ) are divided over whether cryptocurrency is halal (permissible) or haram (not permissible). Both taking interest and gambling through currency speculation (i.e. purchasing, holding and selling currencies for profit from favourable changes in exchange rates) are forbidden in Islamic commercial and financial activities. This, alongside user anonymity, the lack of a central regulator such as a state, and the potential for cryptocurrency to be used in illegal activities, has led some Islamic authorities to denounce Bitcoin as haram .\n“Buying and selling virtual currencies is not compatible with religion at this time because of the fact that their valuation is open to speculation, they can be easily used in illegal activities like money laundering and they are not under the state’s audit and surveillance,” said Turkey’s official Directorate of Religious Affairs in a ruling last November.\nOther ulama have supported cryptocurrency, arguing that there were similar concerns when fiat currency (paper money) was adopted instead of gold.\nBitcoin was first considered permissible in principle in April in a working paper by Mufti Muhammad Abu Bakar, an Islamic Finance specialist and Shariah (Islamic Law) Consultant who was then Head of Shariah Compliance at the Indonesian company Blossom Finance. In his paper, Mr Abu Bakar – who studied under Pakistani Grand Mufti Muhammad Rafi Usmani at the world renowned Islamic University the Jamia Darul Uloom in Karachi – addressed arguments declaring Bitcoin haram . Islamic finance scholar Abu Bakar: “B itcoin and cryptocurrency cannot be declared haram…if this principle was valid and applied, then trading in gold, silver, US Dollars, and Euros would all be ruled impermissible, since those assets also experience extreme levels of speculation”\n“Bitcoin and cryptocurrency cannot be declared haram (impermissible) based on the fact that they experience speculation. In fact, if this principle was valid and applied, then trading in gold, silver, US Dollars, and Euros would all be ruled impermissible, since those assets also experience extreme levels of speculation,” he wrote.\nMr Abu Bakar also dismissed concerns surrounding the use of the coin for illegal acts in a similar way, explaining that “the use of something lawful for an unlawful purpose does not make the thing itself unlawful. An example from the Hadith can be found in that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) forbade the selling of grapes to a wine merchant, since making wine is haram (impermissible), but did not forbid the production or trading of grapes for lawful purposes.”\nHe also argued that the absence of status as legal tender or state recognition is not enough to disqualify Bitcoin from being a legitimate currency, as the acceptance of a currency by people is the main criteria according to Shariah; its ability to protect wealth is also important. Offering an example of Bitcoin fulfilling this function, the Mufti pointed to the fact that some Venezuelans are opting for Bitcoin as a more reliable unit of exchange and store of value amid their country’s economic crisis in which inflation has meant a loaf of bread could cost barrels of paper money. Masjid Ramadan’s Imam Abduallah Abu Essa Adeyemi is interviewed by Alhurra TV on the mosque’s decision to accept Bitcoin, London, 25 May 2018\nMasjid Ramadan has carefully considered the debate and gone to lengths to ensure that it accepts Bitcoin donations without committing any impermissible acts. “There is no trading, that’s the first thing that needs to be clear, the mosque is not trading in Bitcoin, however this is an outlet for those who have maybe inherited Bitcoin, or it was given to them or those who want to dispose of it. At the end of the day, currency is currency, we will make use of it in regular services like any other donations” said Imam Adeyemi in his Friday sermon. Masjid Ramdan’s Imam Adeyemi said Bitcoin, “is just a coin, like any other currency, and are able to be given as [Zakat] donations”\n“For us it is not an endorsement for you to go and trade because of how it works and the possibilities of what surrounds it can be doubtful, but what is not doubtful is that the coin itself, it is just a coin, it is like any other currency and those are able to be given as donations, this will be transferred into sterling and it will go towards the other avenues of refurbishment and so forth.”\nOnce received, the mosque has promptly liquidated donations, so it does not fall foul of Islam’s speculation rule that concerns some given the volatile valuation of Bitcoin in particular. The transaction takes about 30 minutes, after which the amount in Sterling will be deposited directly into the mosque’s bank account.\nMasjid Ramadan believe the potential additional income from Bitcoin donations present the mosque with an opportunity to do social good. Speaking to T-VINE, Imam Adeyemi said “We can redevelop the mosque, we can redevelop the community, we can have more services. Social order here is at its worst ever, there’s a lot of gang violence, domestic violence, drug addicts and as a religious entity that stands in the community we cannot be heedless and let this go by” .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "masjid ramad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "masjid ramadan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edward rowe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erkin guney gurmit singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramazan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sadaqah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zayd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abduallah abu essa adeyemi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "muslim", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "shacklewell lane mosque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khair britain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T18:52:39.042+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ca2445900cfdc2555c82cc9292e26f5b7e1a256f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYib7EjSz.tcVxFrNkNK00Q-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Saving Bitcoins for your Children", "title_full": "Saving Bitcoins for your Children", "published": "2018-05-26T14:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ca2445900cfdc2555c82cc9292e26f5b7e1a256f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYib7EjSz.tcVxFrNkNK00Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "andrino", "published": "2018-05-26T14:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Saving Bitcoins for your Children", "text": "That is great idea.

Tom Lee’s Optimistic Outlook to his prediction of Bitcoin reaching 25k this year. bitcoin news #bitcoin # invest #money\nA lot of predictions have been made concerning the fluctuations of the bitcoin price, but Tom Lee who is a Co-founder and Fundstrat strategist has held onto his prediction that Bitcoin will reach $25,000 despite its recent performance. An evolution of Bitcoin prices during 2018 by Tradingview showed an overwhelming fall in its history, which is falling from as high as $20,000 to as low a $7,500 as of May 24, 2018. However, Tom Lee who earlier predicted that Bitcoin would reach a record high is so optimistic about his predictions concerning the Bitcoin price, and he considers this fall as a “typical crypto volatility.”\nCryptocurrency thrust quickly below $8,000 and traded around $7,500 thereby giving up most of the gains bitcoin had managed from mid- April to early May after hitting 2018 low as reported.\nTom Lee seems not to be moved by this current downturn of the Bitcoin performance as he believes that the most significant thing is to have a certain amount of Bitcoins for a whole year in order not to lose an increasing streak that lasts for an average of 10 days for a whole year. The Three Basic Reasons.\nAmazingly, Tom Lee seems quite positive about his predictions and an interview revealed three basic reasons why he seems so optimistic.\nFirstly, Tom Lee’s optimism is confirmed by historical data from Fundstrat. Tom Lee describes the Bitcoin’s behavior as bullish. He said:\n“ Historically, 10 days comprise all the performance in any single year of Bitcoin’s price. If you just took out those 10 days, Bitcoin’s down 25 percent a year. So as miserable as it feels holding Bitcoin at $8,000, the move from $8,000 to $25,000 will happen in a handful of days.”\nMoreover, he also believes that many institutional investors have not fully participated in crypto space though shows interest in it. This attitude of most investors can be attributed to fear of some regulatory issues of government. He said:\n“I think institutional investors have gained a lot of interest, and they haven’t really come into crypto yet because there is still some regulatory uncertainty. But that sort of ultimate allocation into crypto as an asset class is going to be a powerful reason why Bitcoin rallies.”\nAlso, Tom Lee added that:\n“So as miserable as it feels holding bitcoin at $8,000, the move from $8,000 to $25,000 will happen in a handful of day.”\nBitcoin is now down by 41 percent this year after Wednesday’s drop.\nLastly, the cost of Bitcoin mining is considered to be one of the basic reasons for Tom Lee’s optimistic behavior. He perceives there will be an upsurge in Bitcoin’s value due to this shortage leading to an increasing equilibrium. This can be achieved in the long term as there is an increase in its adoption. Previous predictions\nWith the many predictions concerning the performance of the cryptocurrency, few of them have been quite negative. The Quinlan Associates some time ago predicted that Bitcoin would trade as low as $1800 . However, most of the expert predictions have been a positive one for the Bitcoin price.\nNick Colas at Data Trek Research, an analyst who has been covering the Cryptocurrency for at least four years predicted that Bitcoin will trade within the range of $6,500 to $22,000 in 2018. Being the first analyst to cover this, he also said there will be at least a 40 percent drop in the price of Bitcoin as well as wild price fluctuations which will be accompanied by four market crashes.\nNick Colas added that:\n“The only way it goes substantially higher is if/when someone comes up with a large-scale business that uses bitcoin. That may come in 2018. But for now that scalable use case is asset protection, so that’s how we value bitcoin today.”\nThis prediction, however, contrasts with that of Tom Lee’s since he predicts Bitcoin rising to 25k irrespective of the current fall. Nick Colas said a midpoint range of $14,035 would be a reasonable price point.\nThe big question still remains, will Bitcoin be able to rise to such rate despite the current fall? Only time will tell.\nJoin the conversation over at Telegram ( https://t.me/coinstaker )", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.coinstaker.com/bitcoin-will-trade-1800-wall-street-consultancy-firm-quinlan-associates-predict/", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://t.me/coinstaker", "https://www.coinstaker.com/tom-lee-says-bitcoin-will-hit-record-high-in-2018/", "https://www.coinstaker.com/guides-page-old/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tradingview", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T20:36:03.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "be2c303b8c0d8b312c6385afbecbd99172d2f7f1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjEW0T8moIzQKq1Z6Q1LGOtGGPz8c7n4gP2SqqLDIyUQECoBsX0tTw.BOsmn9xmnpAznmNPFydEAMd5.8DaRIL8BcikyHrP2SkGP5k3W6DMpUrFRRB10NGiesdp0uvxx_yjeW7ocUWvxF", "site_full": "www.startup365.fr", "site": "startup365.fr", "site_section": "http://www.startup365.fr/feed/", "site_categories": ["job_fairs", "jobs", "hobbies_and_interests", "investors_and_patents"], "section_title": "Startup 365", "title": "#Blockchain Bitcoin in Brief Saturday: Crypto Hiring and Blockchain Welfare, From Down Under", "title_full": "#Blockchain Bitcoin in Brief Saturday: Crypto Hiring and Blockchain Welfare, From Down Under", "published": "2018-05-26T14:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_426534814_1600-768x768.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "be2c303b8c0d8b312c6385afbecbd99172d2f7f1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_VSjh1fsaQjEW0T8moIzQKq1Z6Q1LGOtGGPz8c7n4gP2SqqLDIyUQECoBsX0tTw.BOsmn9xmnpAznmNPFydEAMd5.8DaRIL8BcikyHrP2SkGP5k3W6DMpUrFRRB10NGiesdp0uvxx_yjeW7ocUWvxF", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Startup365", "published": "2018-05-26T14:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "#Blockchain Bitcoin in Brief Saturday: Crypto Hiring and Blockchain Welfare, From Down Under", "text": "#Blockchain Bitcoin in Brief Saturday: Crypto Hiring and Blockchain Welfare, From Down Under Posted on by Startup365\nInstant crypto-denominated salaries and blockchain-based social security payments feature in Saturday’s Bitcoin in Brief.

Another feature will rate employees using a blockchain-based reputation and review process, designed to ensure that higher quality work gets paid better. The “Pay As You Go” system has been launched recently in Australia.\nSergei Sergienko, the entrepreneur behind the project, claims that instant salary payments are possible with cryptos, tokens, and thanks to the underlying technology – blockchain. His “global job platform” Laborx is developed to do exactly that – pay employees while they are working, so that everyone can start spending on the way home.\n“The way for people to be remunerated is based on pre-Industrial Revolution kind of wages – you spend the time in the factory, and you get paid,” he said, quoted by Business Insider Australia . “If you look around, everything else has changed. And it’s really, really weird that the way people get paid for their services, for their time, for their work, has not gone through any revolution of sorts,” Sergienko noted.\nThe businessman, who owns a successful labor hire, staffing and training company called the Edway Group, believes that the revolution comes in the form of the “Labour-Hour Tokens” (LHT) and the hiring ecosystem of Laborx, which is now live in beta version. Using it, companies can hire anyone – from top experts from around the world, to local fruit pickers – and pay them instantly with cryptocurrency. “A fair hour’s pay for a fair hour’s work” has been promised.\nLaborx also features a tokenized reputation system. Its developers say that it combines dozens of candidate data points and stores the information on a blockchain. The platform is said to ensure job seekers get their best market rate, while also eliminating payment delays and disputes. “If your reviews are consistently good, you can charge more per hour for your services. And the person who hires you knows you’re worth it,” Sergei Sergienko explains. Other cryptocurrency projects to be trialing this model include time-based “knowledge transfer” service Whenhub , founded by Dilbert creator Scott Adams. Distributed Ledger to Be Used For Welfare Delivery\nWhile the private sector has been developing a crypto-hiring platform, Australian authorities have been planning to employ blockchain technology to improve the welfare payments delivery in the country. The intentions were made public recently by the Digital Transformation Agency, a government body tasked with the digitization of public services and government institutions. The project to put social security payments on blockchain will pilot the wider implementation of the technology.\n“Our plan is to look for use cases across the Commonwealth with an initial focus on the welfare payment delivery system. Then, working with our digital service standard, we’ll conduct user research with a view to having a prototype by the end of next financial year,” said DTA’s acting CEO Randall Brugeaud during the Cebit Australia conference in Sidney last week.\nRecently, The DTA received AU$700,000 from the 2018-19 budget to probe the implementation of distributed ledger technologies in the public sector. Brugeaud commented that the funds will give his agency an opportunity to explore innovative ways to securely and efficiently deliver government services using blockchain. Slovak Tax Authority Eyes Blockchain for Efficient Collection\nThe Financial Administration of Slovakia aims to become a pioneer in blockchain technology implementation. The tax authority in Bratislava intends to use it to streamline its processes and procedures. The main objective is to make tax collection more efficient, the president of Finančná Správa , František Imrecze told Hospodárske Noviny .\nThe technology, which underpins most cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, will be implemented in Slovakia’s taxation system to initially process about 2 percent of all tax payments, the publication details. The use of blockchain technologies is expected to increase the trust of taxpayers and protect their personal data. Authorities also hope to increase the transparency of tax collection, reduce red tape and minimize costs, Imrecze explained.\nMembers of the local crypto community and the non-government sector are not sure about the prospects of the project. According to Martin Lindák, analyst with the liberal think-tank F. A. Hayek Foundation, the transparency and security of blockchain applications are there only when they are decentralized.

Here, we explore what you need to know about cryptocurrency and gambling.\nMay 25, 2018\nFancy a spin of the wheel?\nWhile some Bitcoin enthusiasts prefer the calculated gamble of investment and day-trading, others have taken to high-roller casino websites to roll the proverbial dice.\nRead: Where to trade your cryptocurrency: the world’s biggest exchanges What are Bitcoin casinos?\nSimply put, the term ‘Bitcoin casino’ can refer to any online casino or sports betting agency that accepts Bitcoin either in preference (or alongside) fiat currency.\nIn recent years, several large-scale Bitcoin casinos have emerged to offer a tailor-made list of games and services for gambler seeking to transact in Bitcoin as opposed to fiat currency such as the US Dollar.\nBitcoin casinos can not only offer traditional casino fair such as roulette, but can further offer sports-based betting, online lotteries, or spread betting. Rather than use the term Bitcoin or ‘BTC’, many Bitcoin casinos instead use the term ‘mBTC’ or ‘millibitcoin’– a term denoting one-thousandth of a Bitcoin , or 0.001 BTC. How do Bitcoin casinos work?\nSave for the process of transferring or ‘cashing out’ Bitcoins after a successful (or unsuccessful) bet, most Bitcoin casinos function similarly to their ‘traditional’ counterparts.\nFor those who’re wishing to take a chance, Bitcoin casinos typically provide new registrations with an in-house wallet, which users can transfer Bitcoins to.\nBets taken within the casino rely on a user’s stored funds when facilitating games. Typically, a user places an opening ‘bet’ from their wallet, and can either lose or profit on that sum depending on their success in a game.\nSome online casinos have gone on to offer immense ‘Bitcoin jackpots’, where users can stand to win sums in excess of 500 BTC.\nOnce a game is complete, any profits are returned to a user’s in-house wallet. From there, a user can direct a transfer to their private wallet when they wish – however, most casinos implement a withdrawal limit to prevent users from cashing out all at once. It is good practice to fully read an online casino’s terms and conditions before playing. Join our Telegram Channel Join now! Why are Bitcoin casinos so popular?\nSince Bitcoin’s emergence, the world’s foremost cryptocurrency has found favor amongst internet casinos thanks to its pseudonymity and its ease of transfer.\nFor much the same reason that Bitcoin initially resonated with online black markets such as The Silk Road , online casinos have quickly moved to adopt cryptocurrency as their base currency to escape regulatory purviews.\nTypically, Bitcoin casino sites have gone on to offer zero transaction fees with unlimited free daily transactions – distinguishing themselves from their counterparts which still rely on fiat currency.\nIn some cases, Bitcoin casinos have gone on to advertise larger jackpots and extensive profits, given that their operating margins can be significantly lower.\nSeveral Bitcoin casinos have again iterated on the formula offered by their ‘traditional’ counterparts, and have customized several ‘standard’ games with new rules and procedures which – depending on their makeup – may or may not be legal.\nPerhaps the biggest contributing factor to the enduring popularity of Bitcoin exchanges is that any user’ s profits or losses are not inherently taxable unless declared to a legal authority. Are Bitcoin casinos legal, or ‘under the microscope’?\nMuch like their broader online counterparts, Bitcoin casinos typically exist in a legal ‘gray zone’ and regulations or sanctions against such websites can differ from nation to nation.\nMany online gambling sites pose a difficulty for international regulators, given the fact that Bitcoin is not facilitated by a central authority and no transaction can effectively be interrupted or mitigated. However, several international regulators have issued strong stances against Bitcoin casinos.\nIn particular, US citizens are prohibited from running a Bitcoin casino in their home territory – meaning that many operations are incorporated elsewhere and simply cater to US citizens on demand.\nSeveral Bitcoin gambling sites have allowed new users to register pseudonymously – meaning that new registrations typically do not require a user to lodge their real name or any other form of their identity. However, any legal authority would be able to analyze Bitcoin transactions – and potentially identify their origin – through chain analysis tools.\nIt is important to comply with any and all legislation in your home territory, and only proceed to gamble online should you be legally allowed to do so. What lies ahead for Bitcoin casinos?\nArguably, the future of Bitcoin casinos may not strictly involve Bitcoin.\nWhile Bitcoin offers immense benefits to the gambling industry – specifically providing an escape from regulation, rapid transfers, and pseudonymity – newer cryptocurrencies may go one to present far more attractive benefits.\nIn the years since Bitcoin’s debut on the world stage, several privacy-focused cryptocurrencies have debuted that specifically anonymize transaction details and the parties involved. Cryptocurrencies such as Monero or Zcash may one day go one to be widely adopted amongst casino websites thanks to their inherent fungibility.\nRead: What are the three generations of blockchain, and how are they similar to the web?\nUltimately, other projects – such as Ethereum – may also offer extremely tempting benefits. Online casinos may one day implement smart contracts to govern gambling activities such as deposits or payouts – effectively ‘decentralizing’ some of the administration of day-to-day duties.\nDisclaimer: Gamble at your own risk. Please adhere to your country’s relevant laws when visiting or participating in gambling sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://t.me/CoinInsiderNews"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T18:37:05.116+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0313ea52a0989931217831f231d50a54e40f30c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.smdDwUub1RpNRO0GZHoa1_hNCNL5Y5cEhwm_EUTkifMhjNVGktopBQZvKIEpq.73b7GmaF1RXnY2", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Saturday: Crypto Hiring and Blockchain Welfare, From Down Under", "title_full": "Bitcoin in Brief Saturday: Crypto Hiring and Blockchain Welfare, From Down Under", "published": "2018-05-26T14:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0313ea52a0989931217831f231d50a54e40f30c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.smdDwUub1RpNRO0GZHoa1_hNCNL5Y5cEhwm_EUTkifMhjNVGktopBQZvKIEpq.73b7GmaF1RXnY2", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-26T14:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Saturday: Crypto Hiring and Blockchain Welfare, From Down Under", "text": "Bitcoin in Brief Saturday: Crypto Hiring and Blockchain Welfare, From Down Under\nLubomir Tassev\nInstant crypto-denominated salaries and blockchain-based social security payments feature in Saturday's Bitcoin in Brief.

And it's really, really weird that the way people get paid for their services, for their time, for their work, has not gone through any revolution of sorts,\" Sergienko noted.\nThe businessman, who owns a successful labor hire, staffing and training company called the Edway Group, believes that the revolution comes in the form of the \"Labour-Hour Tokens\" (LHT) and the hiring ecosystem of Laborx, which is now live in beta version. Using it, companies can hire anyone – from top experts from around the world, to local fruit pickers – and pay them instantly with cryptocurrency. \"A fair hour's pay for a fair hour's work\" has been promised.\nLaborx also features a tokenized reputation system. Its developers say that it combines dozens of candidate data points and stores the information on a blockchain. The platform is said to ensure job seekers get their best market rate, while also eliminating payment delays and disputes. \"If your reviews are consistently good, you can charge more per hour for your services. And the person who hires you knows you're worth it,\" Sergei Sergienko explains. Other cryptocurrency projects to be trialing this model include time-based \"knowledge transfer\" service Whenhub , founded by Dilbert creator Scott Adams.\nDistributed Ledger to Be Used For Welfare Delivery While the private sector has been developing a crypto-hiring platform, Australian authorities have been planning to employ blockchain technology to improve the welfare payments delivery in the country. The intentions were made public recently by the Digital Transformation Agency, a government body tasked with the digitization of public services and government institutions. The project to put social security payments on blockchain will pilot the wider implementation of the technology.\n\"Our plan is to look for use cases across the Commonwealth with an initial focus on the welfare payment delivery system. Then, working with our digital service standard, we'll conduct user research with a view to having a prototype by the end of next financial year,\" said DTA's acting CEO Randall Brugeaud during the Cebit Australia conference in Sidney last week.\nRecently, The DTA received AU$700,000 from the 2018-19 budget to probe the implementation of distributed ledger technologies in the public sector. Brugeaud commented that the funds will give his agency an opportunity to explore innovative ways to securely and efficiently deliver government services using blockchain.\nSlovak Tax Authority Eyes Blockchain for Efficient Collection The Financial Administration of Slovakia aims to become a pioneer in blockchain technology implementation. The tax authority in Bratislava intends to use it to streamline its processes and procedures. The main objective is to make tax collection more efficient, the president of Finančná Správa , František Imrecze told Hospodárske Noviny .\nThe technology, which underpins most cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, will be implemented in Slovakia's taxation system to initially process about 2 percent of all tax payments, the publication details. The use of blockchain technologies is expected to increase the trust of taxpayers and protect their personal data. Authorities also hope to increase the transparency of tax collection, reduce red tape and minimize costs, Imrecze explained.\nMembers of the local crypto community and the non-government sector are not sure about the prospects of the project. According to Martin Lindák, analyst with the liberal think-tank F. A. Hayek Foundation, the transparency and security of blockchain applications are there only when they are decentralized. A blockchain lacking this key feature would be just an overpriced database for the public administration, Lindák warned in conversation with the newspaper.\nDo you think crypto and blockchain technologies can be successfully implemented in public services and labor relations?

Today at Google IO they have announced new updates to ARCore which will help to continue the evolution of AR on Android — now incorporated into hundreds of apps on the Play Store.We have shown several examples of ARCore at work here at Ausdroid ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) and now with today's update Google aims to make it easier to build more collaborative AR apps.Google are introducing a capability called Cloud Anchors that will enable new types of collaborative AR experiences on both Android and iOS. It will allow apps to be made to help redecorate your home, play games with friends and painting a community mural.A new inclusion is Vertical Plane Detection which will allow you to place objects on more surfaces such as textured walls — previously it had to be a flat surface such as the floor or a table.

(Many accuse Tether of doing just that.) Furthermore, blockchains have difficulty scaling. That is why BTC has resorted to the lightning network to attempt to address the scaling problem.\nSo BTC is a solution, but it's really not a solution because someone can come up with a different solution on top of BTC which wouldn't really be a solution at all, thus making underlying BTC not a solution. Think i got it. And then BTC is having problem scaling so that's why they introduced a scaling solution called LN. Did i get it right?\nIf the solution you want is to totally prevent people from running fractional reserves, then no, the blockchain is not the solution. Perhaps if you could cram all of the functionality onto the blockchain itself it may be a solution. However, when you try to cram all of the functionality onto the blockchain itself, you run into a scaling issue. You can get a blockchain to scale, but this always comes at the cost of the network being more centralized.\nOh ok i think you cleared it up now, but just to make sure, so it's impossible to cram every possible functionality in any system, and it's also impossible to prevent a derivatives market based on any underlying asset. And since BTC exists in our faulty universe BTC is burdened with the restrictions that apply to every other system. Thus we draw a conclusion that BTC is a failed experiment and will die?

The issue we all have is the failure of price,-value-to reflect the effort of the community. Not only do we have a robust network that can scale and settle transactions faster, there is wide adoption of the coin from different payment providers and merchants. As it is, Bitcoin Cash is down 14 percent for the week and two percent in the last 24 hours but these metrics would widen should there be a dip past $930 or May 24 lows. Today\\u2019s price action is therefore important in my view. \\n From the News \\n\nA cryptocurrency would be useless if there it has no real user case encouraging retail or corporate adoption. This is why behemoths like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple for example are driving hard selling their products to the masses. Bitcoin Cash is doing the same and few days after forking, Revolut is listing BCH as a tradable asset or investment to their customers. In essence, the London based payment provider is making it possible for customers to integrate their fiat banking details and link it directly to their Revolut card. \\n\nThis way, their users would enjoy instant fiat-crypto transfer via Bitstamp who charges 1.5 percent transaction fees via a simple dash board. Going forward, Bitcoin Cash would be an option for buyers and it\\u2019s not a speculation or ifs because whenever a coin is available to the masses, market capitalization and liquidity follow suits. We expect the same to happen to Bitcoin Cash in the days to come. \\n\nThousands of miles away, there is good news for Bitcoin Cash supporters in Colombia. Bitek might turn out to be their gate-away. As a payment provider, merchants spread throughout Colombia can now receive payment in Bitcoin Cash and convert them to Pesos should they want to liquidate. This is not the first such service as it is similar to what BitPay is doing. Services like these protect merchants from price volatility as they can sell their BCH stash anytime and get their Pesos in an instant. To facilitate this, Bitek will use BCH-Pesos approximates from local cryptocurrency exchanges and Bittrex. \\n \\n It's official!

The attempt by the bulls to pull back on May 24 could not find buyers at higher levels, and prices have turned down once again. Currently, the digital currency is trying to hold the trendline support. If successful, a relief rally to $9,000 is probable. If the trendline breaks, the next major support zone is between $6,075.04-$7,000, which will be strongly defended by the bulls. Due to the strong support just beneath the trendline, we are disregarding the formation of a symmetrical triangle. Any sharp decline below $7,000 can offer the traders a good buying opportunity for the long-term. If purchased, the position should be protected with a stop below the February 06 lows of $6,075.04 because if this level breaks, we may see some panic selling. Traders should avoid buying when the BTC/USD pair is plummeting. The purchase should be made when it shows signs of stabilizing in the 4-hourly chart. We are suggesting a buy because we believe that the virtual currency will remain range bound between $6,075.04-$12,12172.43. ETH/USD Ethereum fell to the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the recent rally on May 24. The bulls attempted a rebound from this level, but it fizzled out at the 50-day SMA. If the bears break below the intraday low of May 24, a decline to $464 will be on the cards. If the bulls hold the supports, the ETH/USD pair can rally to the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern, which also coincides with the resistance line of the descending channel. Aggressive traders can attempt this trade, but the risk-averse traders should wait until a new buy setup forms. XRP/USD Ripple is taking support at the bottom of the range at $0.56. On May 24, it attempted to bounce off the supports but met with selling pressure at higher levels. Currently, the XRP/USD pair is again retracing the previous day’s pullback. If the $0.56 level breaks down, a fall to $0.45 is likely. If the support holds, aggressive traders can take a long position above $0.65 with a stop just below the recent lows. This is a very risky trade because the moving averages will offer a stiff resistance on any rally. Hence, the trade should be attempted only with about 30 percent of the usual position size. A fall to the bottom of the range should be purchased when it shows signs of a rebound, hence, we believe that this trade can be attempted if the buy levels are reached. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash has completed a breakdown from a head and shoulders pattern that has a lower pattern target of $650. However, for the past two days, the bulls are trying to provide support at the $1,000 levels. If this level holds, the digital currency can pull back to the $1,200 levels, which is a major hurdle as both the moving averages are located close to this level. If the BCH/USD pair breaks below $950, it should slide to $750, which is the next minor support. We suggest waiting for the decline to end and a new setup to form before initiating any long positions. EOS/USD EOS is trying to rebound from the $10 levels but is facing stiff resistance at the top trendline of the descending channel and the 50-day SMA. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of these overhead resistances, long positions can be initiated. Traders can wait for the price to scale above the moving averages and the recent swing high of $14.19 on May 20. Positions can be initiated above $14.25 with a suitable stop loss. The target objective of this trade is a rally to $18.67. On the other hand, if the bears force a breakdown below $10, the EOS/USD pair can sink to $7.8 and below that to $5.961. Long positions should not be attempted inside the channel. LTC/USD Litecoin has formed a bearish descending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakdown and close (UTC) below $107. This level has not been breached since December 09 of last year. Therefore, we consider this to be strong support. On May 24, the bulls tried to pull back from the immediate support of $115 but could not break above the overhead resistance of $127. Below $115 the LTC/USD pair will slip to $107. The first sign of strength will be when prices sustain above $127. Until then, it is best to take no action. ADA/USD Cardano is looking weak because the pullback attempt from the $0.19 support level on May 24 did not sustain the higher levels. If this support level breaks, a fall to $0.13 is likely. If the price slides to $0.13 and holds, it will confirm the formation of a large range, which can be traded by buying on a rebound from the lows and selling close to the upper end of the range. A break above the descending channel will be the first sign of a probable change in trend. Currently, the ADA/USD pair is falling. We shall wait for prices to stabilize and turn around before proposing any buys. XLM/USD For the past few days, we have been watching a probable head and shoulders top in Stellar. However, after the previous two days of price action and realigning the trendlines, we find a falling wedge pattern developing. This is a bullish setup that will complete on a break out of the upper resistance line. As traders, we should be quick to identify any new setup and change our opinion according to the charts. Considering the overall negativity, we suggest waiting for the price to break out and close (UTC) above the 20-day EMA before buying. The minimum price target is $0.44, which is close to the overhead resistance of $0.47766719. Traders should keep a close stop loss, preferably below the recent lows because if the break out fails to find buyers at higher levels, the digital currency can slump to $0.184 levels. If the XLM/USD pair moves contrary to our expectation and breaks down, instead of breaking out, traders should not initiate long positions. They should remain on the sidelines until a new buy setup forms. TRX/USD The bulls are trying to hold the 50-day SMA on TRON while the bears are defending the 20-day EMA. The price has been stuck between these two moving averages for the past two days. We believe that the zone between $0.0565 and the 50-day SMA will act as strong support. However, we want to see buying emerge at the critical support levels before recommending a long position because if the support zone breaks, the TRX/USD pair can plunge to $0.04 levels. On the upside, the small downtrend line may act as a resistance. The digital currency might remain range-bound for a few more days before making a decisive move.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

This unauthorized setup in Cashmere was discovered in 2015. (Chelan PUD) Bargain electric rates are attracting digital currency entrepreneurs, but three public utilities districts are reassessing how they deal with the surging demand, and whether they should even try to keep up. Residential customers, meanwhile, worry that their rates will go up. Share story Paul Roberts Special to The Seattle Times\nPublic hearings for rural electric utilities are rarely sellout events. But the crowd that showed up in Wenatchee two weeks ago for a hearing about Bitcoin mining in Chelan County was so large that utility staff had to open a second room with a video feed for the overflow.\nThe turnout wasn’t surprising. Chelan County, along with neighboring Douglas and Grant counties, has been at the center of the U.S. Bitcoin boom since 2012, when the region’s ultracheap hydropower began attracting cryptocurrency “miners.”\nThese entrepreneurs earn Bitcoin by solving increasingly complicated mathematical problems established by the shadowy creators of the digital currency . The process, which the industry calls mining, involves trillions of computer calculations and sucks up huge amounts of power.\nAs a result, an area famous for apples, wheat and conservative politics has been transformed into a kind of cyber-boomtown, with Bitcoin mining operations that range from large-scale, state-of-the-art warehouses to repurposed cargo containers to backyard sheds. By the end of this year, according to some estimates, the Mid-Columbia Basin could account for as much as 30 percent of the global output of new Bitcoin and large shares of other digital currencies, such as Litecoin and Ethereum.\nBut as in any boomtown, success has come at a cost. As the cryptocurrency industry morphs into larger, more energy-intensive operations, the Basin’s three public utilities districts (PUDs) are reassessing how they deal with it, and whether they can — or should even try to — keep up. The Rocky Reach hydroelectric dam on the Columbia River is north of Wenatchee. (courtesy of Chelan County PUD)\nThe sector’s recent growth spurt poses “a very different kind of problem than anything we have addressed before,” Steve Wright, Chelan County PUD general manager, told the crowd at the May 14 hearing. Determining whether the PUD can handle the growth, Wright said, has “required a whole new way of thinking.” Overwhelming “gold rush”\nIn a normal year, demand for electric power in Chelan County grows by perhaps 4 megawatts ­­— enough for around 2,250 homes — as new residents arrive and as businesses start or expand. But since January 2017, as Bitcoin enthusiasts bid up the price of the currency, eager miners have requested a staggering 210 megawatts for mines they want to build in Chelan County. That’s nearly as much as the county and its 73,000 residents were already using. And because it is a public utility, the PUD staff is obligated to consider every request.\nThe scale of some new requests is mind-boggling. Until recently, the largest mines in Chelan County used five megawatts or less. In the past six months, by contrast, miners have requested loads of 50 megawatts and, in several cases, 100 megawatts. By comparison, a fruit warehouse uses around 2.5 megawatts.\nBut it’s not simply the scale of requests that is perplexing utility staff. Many would-be miners have no understanding of how large power purchases work. In one case this winter, miners from China landed their private jet at the local airport, drove a rental car to the visitor center at the Rocky Reach Dam, just north of Wenatchee, and, according to Chelan County PUD officials, politely asked to see the “dam master because we want to buy some electricity.”\nBitcoin fever has created other, smaller-scale problems for the utility. Three times a week, on average, utility crews in Chelan County discover unpermitted home miners running computer servers far too large for the electrical grids of residential neighborhoods. In one instance last year, the transformer outside a bootleg miner’s home overheated and touched off a grass fire, Chelan County PUD officials say.\nIn other cases, utility crews responding to unusual spikes in power usage have found racks of remotely controlled servers whirring away in empty apartments. Worse, when the utility began shutting off power to these so-called “rogue operators” earlier this year, some of them became so belligerent that the utility is installing security cameras and bulletproof glass at its downtown Wenatchee headquarters.\nBy February, the Bitcoin “gold rush,” as Wright calls it, had become so overwhelming that Chelan County PUD declared a three-month moratorium on new mines to determine whether the county can absorb even a fraction of that demand. But answering that question was more complex than the utility anticipated — and at the recent hearing, the commission voted to extend the freeze another three months.\nAt the root of the dilemma is a mismatch in business models. Public utilities are typically managed with the expectation of incremental growth, decades-long investments and a community-oriented bottom line — what Wright defines as delivering “the best value, for the most people, for the longest period of time.”\nBitcoin mining, by contrast, is characterized by soaring demand, massive price volatility, and an investment time frame measured in years or even months.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "douglas", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington public", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wenatchee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelan county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T16:08:12.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5973415b9014adc55a728ad69607c90691ba04e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSY5VS3UG4A4j2qtMT1UcxUKgt9z5U8PN.egaZ9dmsniFJN1uF4lHdwM5NiuzO1tKBQrMP8ra3oRmodKgmVIf_x0yF0lQ1wf86W5p_o3qvKnvnL7e.36CTwPokPXwUZV3hIMcKISSh7Lvu8ciTaVcAcHOpLwD.Uz0mBQYfawHuZQlklGX18z3jV", "site_full": "www.firstorderhistorians.com", "site": "firstorderhistorians.com", "site_section": "https://www.firstorderhistorians.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin adoption: large enterprises from Czechoslovakia, wants to accept Bitcoin payments", "title_full": "Bitcoin adoption: large enterprises from Czechoslovakia, wants to accept Bitcoin payments", "published": "2018-05-26T13:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.firstorderhistorians.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/014061b1de0d9bd4c8cf64d82499a2aa.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5973415b9014adc55a728ad69607c90691ba04e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSY5VS3UG4A4j2qtMT1UcxUKgt9z5U8PN.egaZ9dmsniFJN1uF4lHdwM5NiuzO1tKBQrMP8ra3oRmodKgmVIf_x0yF0lQ1wf86W5p_o3qvKnvnL7e.36CTwPokPXwUZV3hIMcKISSh7Lvu8ciTaVcAcHOpLwD.Uz0mBQYfawHuZQlklGX18z3jV", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Top News", "published": "2018-05-26T13:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin adoption: large enterprises from Czechoslovakia, wants to accept Bitcoin payments", "text": "Bitcoin, Crypto currency, Blockchain Bitcoin adoption: large enterprises from Czechoslovakia, wants to accept Bitcoin payments\nOne of the largest energy suppliers companies from our neighboring country wants bitcoin payments for its customers to introduce.
