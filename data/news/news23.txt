Edward Kelso\nVan Eck and Solid X have teamed, after both failed previously to gain formal regulatory approval for their respective bitcoin core (BTC) exchange traded fund (ETF) proposals, reapplying to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today. They're proposing a physically backed bitcoin ETF, the Van Eck Solid X Bitcoin Trust , and it just might be poised to break the losing streak of mainstreaming BTC on Wall Street.

The Solid X team has in-depth experience with bitcoin, cryptography, and capital markets. We're pleased to join with them in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market.\" The Van Eck Solid X Bitcoin Trust will also offer itself as being insured against bitcoin lost or stolen.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports, \"The firms also set a relatively high per-share price: $200,000. The price tag is designed to aim the product at institutional rather than retail investors.\" And in \"determining a marketing partner,\" Solid X CEO Daniel H. Gallancy underscored, they \"looked for a firm with a clear understanding of the potential of bitcoin and the role it can play in an investment portfolio.

Jan van Eck expressed optimism at their latest tactic, \"We believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process.

The BCH Geek event was held on June 1-3 and firms like Bitmain Technologies, Viabtc, and BTC.top were in attendance. According to local reports and BCH-focused forums , the hackathon featured 100+ programmers who produced solid research, prototypes, and applications built using the BCH blockchain. The BCH Geek event was initiated by the blockchain video portal Chongqing TED.CC, and other members of the BCH community. BCH-Based Browser Plugins, an Authenticator, and a Quiz App\nThere were more than 11 teams who consisted of developers from firms like Viabtc, and students from Chongqing University. This week on Reddit, a BCH Geek attendee stated the hackathon resulted in a “satisfactory way,” while detailing the platforms created by a few of the top teams who participated in the event. Three teams mentioned in particular were the groups Mempool, Viabtc, and Gon. According to the report, Mempool created a URL-paying browser plug-in based on bitcoin cash which integrates with the HTTP and Status Code 402 protocol. Image credits: Cindy Daily\nViabtc developers designed a BCH-based authenticator that can store data and synchronize across multiple devices. The application does not require a server and authentication data can be restored easily. Another team called Gon designed an application called Token Dice which is a decentralized on-chain 1v1 quiz application based on BCH. The Token Dice programmers used the OP_Code, ‘ OP_DATASIGNVERIFY,’ to build the quiz platform. Another application featured was called ‘ IF Password’ a password management software (ifpass.cash) that is tethered to the BCH blockchain. Image credits: Cindy Daily New BCH Apps to Appear in the Wild Soon\nAttendees also heard from speakers such as Edward Liu, the co-founder of Bitkan, and Jiang Zhuoer, the founder of BTC.top, who talked about the innovation being built on top of the Bitcoin Cash network right now. The industry luminaries also spoke about currently built platforms like Memo, Blockpress, and Cointext that are providing the on-chain ‘killer apps’ once heralded a few years ago. The BCH Geek event ended with great success and it’s safe to say quite a few bitcoin cash-infused platforms demonstrated at the event in Hangzhou will be released into the wild shortly.\nWhat do you think about the BCH Geek event held in China this week?

Some economists say it is a disruptive innovation that will blossom on the continent.\nCryptocurrency is not bound by geography because it is internet based; its transactions are stored in a database called blockchain, which is a group of connected computers that record transactions in a ledger in real time.\nThe difference between cryptocurrency and, say, Visa or Mastercard, is that a cryptocurrency is not now regulated by government and doesn’t need middlemen, and transactions rely on the internet, which means they can happen anywhere in the world.\nThe big cryptocurrency global brands include Bitcoin, Litecoin, XRP, Dash, Lisk and Monero, but Bitcoin leads the pack in Africa. Created in 2009 by a person or people with the alias Satoshi Nakamoto, investors hope Bitcoin becomes the new mode of financial transaction in the digital age.\n“Africa is rarely mentioned among the largest markets for cryptocurrency, but it may be set to steal a march over other markets,” says Rakesh Sharma, a business and technology journalist.\nMr. Sharma says that citizens of countries battling high inflation are likely to opt for cryptocurrency, because “with their paradigm of decentralization, cryptocurrencies offer an alternative to disastrous central bank policies.”\nStealing a marchSouth Sudan’s inflation rate was 102% between September 2016 and September 2017, according to the World Bank. Other countries with double-digit inflation rates include Egypt, Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Zambia and Zimbabwe. It is no surprise that some of these countries are among the main Bitcoin economies in Africa. The main Bitcoin countries are Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and Zimbabwe, according to gobitcoin.io, a website dedicated to Bitcoin news in Africa. The BBC adds that cryptocurrency is gaining ground in Uganda.\nWhen Zimbabwe’s inflation skyrocketed in 2015, forcing authorities to print $100 trillion notes (each worth just $40), some Zimbabweans turned to Bitcoin.\nZimbabweans and citizens of other African countries transact in Bitcoin “as opposed to their local currencies, which are plagued with hyperinflation,” comments Emmanuel Tokunbo Darko, vice president of marketing for ICOWatchlist.com, a platform that hosts cryptocurrency tokens.\nThere will be 725 million mobile phone subscribers in Africa by 2020, according to the GSM Association, which represents the interests of mobile operators globally. That means more Africans will have the tools to plug into the cryptocurrency ecosystem, says Mr. Sharma.\n“I check my Bitcoin every day [on my mobile phone] and any chance I can get. Any minute, any hour, anytime, as often as I can,” Peace Akware, a Ugandan millennial, told the BBC.\nBitcoin spreadsThat African governments are not now regulating cryptocurrency may be a factor spurring its growth on the continent; however, there is no guarantee that governments will not change their current mindset.\nRather than simply not wanting to, governments may be powerless to regulate cryptocurrency, the Nigerian central bank indicated recently. Currently tackling the country’s 12% inflation rate, the Nigerian apex bank announced that it could not control or regulate Bitcoin, “just the same way no one is going to control or regulate the internet. We don’t own it.”\nFearing a collapse of the banking industry or arbitrary appropriation of money by the government, Africans without access to banks and who live in politically unstable countries could be attracted to cryptocurrency. “Bitcoin transactions help to eliminate the procedural bottlenecks that plague traditional banking and financial services,” Mr. Darko explains.\nSome 15 cryptocurrency-related operations began in Africa in the past year alone, reports Mr. Sharma. But South Africa–based Luno Exchange, established in 2013 and now boasting 1.5 million customers in over 40 countries worldwide, is the first to be based in Africa.\nOthers, particularly cryptocurrency-based remittance services, are popping up in various countries. These services include Abra, which operates in Malawi and Morocco, GeoPay in South Africa, BitMari in Zimbabwe and London-based Kobocoin, which was launched by Nigerian entrepreneur Felix Onyemechi Ugoji.\nThe Plaas Application is a mobile app that enables farmers to manage their stock on the blockchain.\nLaunched in 2013, Kenya’s BitPesa facilitates virtual remittances transfers to both African and international locations, to and from individuals’ mobile wallets, where cryptocurrency is stored. LocalBitcoins.com in Kenya reported trading volumes in excess of $1.8 million as of December 2017, underlining the lucrativeness of the business.\n“I started mining Bitcoin [in Nairobi, Kenya] in September 2017 and, so far, this is the best business I have ever tried,” Gladys Laboi told Africa Renewal, adding: “Under six months, I earned $800 after investing in $700.”\nNot to be left out, some governments are moving into the virtual currency terrain. Tunisia’s eDinar is a government-issued digital currency. Senegal is in the process of creating eCFA, which, if successful, could be emulated by other Francophone countries in Africa.\nThere will be government-issued cryptocurrencies in Africa in the near future, predicts Shireen Ramjoo, ceo of Liquid Crypto-Money, a South Africa-based cryptocurrency consulting firm.\nIndustry experts believe that cryptocurrency will be around for years. That Bitcoin users can send money to just about anywhere there is an internet connection for relatively small fees and with no third-party interference is an advantage that standard government-issued currencies cannot offer.\n“Every single computer device on the surface of the planet with an internet connection can access information on the blockchain and make ‘transactional’ inputs onto it. The information cannot be distorted, deleted, modified or destroyed, and [the] computer device has the same information as everybody,” says Mr. Darko.\nAnother recommendation is that transactions are anonymous, and users’ information is private and safe; there is little possibility of identity theft, which is common with other forms of digital payment.\nAs of December 2017, the global demand for cryptocurrency had increased to the extent that a Bitcoin sold for $20,000. Its value had been $1,000 one year prior.\nPonzi schemeNevertheless, some industry watchers refer to cryptocurrency as a risky and temperamental scheme, citing the crash to $8,700 in the value of Bitcoin last February, from a high of $20,000 in December 2017.\nWithout regulations, cryptocurrency is a double-edged sword; there may be gains from time to time, but any precipitous crash in price could leave investors with no escape route. Manasseh Egedegbe, an investment manager based in Nigeria, says that Bitcoin’s frenzied prize surge seems like the dot-com bubble at the turn of the millennium.\nThere is also the fact that cryptocurrency can be used by criminals to funnel funds. In 2011 Bitcoin was a currency of choice for drug peddlers, according to the US Justice Department, which seized almost $48 million worth of illegal contrabands that year, and discovered that the criminals involved had made transactions totaling 150,000 Bitcoins (approximately $130 million.\nCountries such as Bangladesh, Ecuador and Kyrgyzstan believe the risks outweigh the gains and have banned Bitcoin as well as initial coin offerings or ICOs, which are used by start-ups to evade the demand for capital by banks and other financing institutions.\nQuartz Africa, an online business news publication, reported last December that a similar scheme, Mavrodi Mundial Moneybox (MMM), once had over two million users in Nigeria, while also operating in Ghana, Kenya, South Africa and Zimbabwe.\nThere are reports that South Africa’s central bank is actively studying cryptocurrency and may institute guidelines to foster innovation. Those guidelines could be a slippery slope to regulation. The Sunday Times of South Africa reported in March that 27,500 individuals, including South Africans, lost more than $50 million when they were duped into transferring their Bitcoins into an online wallet. The publication called it “one of the biggest scams to hit South Africa.”\nAt 22% (the world average is 48%), Africa has the lowest rate of Internet usage of any region, according to a 2017 report by the International Communications Union, which may undercut optimistic projections of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology on the continent. Also, poor power supply in many countries continues to impede the internet access on which cryptocurrency largely depends.\nDespite some analysts likening Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to a Ponzi scheme, many Africans are taking the risk to invest in them.\nOther experts, such as Mr. Darko, believe Africa should warmly embrace the innovation. “Truth be told, Africa needs blockchain technology and its resultant cryptocurrencies more than any part of the world,” he says.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lisk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mastercard", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T20:55:42.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b68fe827249740d154605c52ee35b2bd505e763a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRrQMwA9kyMdJJzb_0.Ff_ndHEMYOvfyKCkSPfGu_S2l22.hw70kGrOh1qER.gpDS_vtXGRCzpYY_KaSqfxZTS30AWEtY1jooPM51qF3ktScLeiqNc_bZvv_m0i3KRKPPpcsyVPa_N2hd9BPnoxPfT7", "site_full": "www.businesswire.com", "site": "businesswire.com", "site_section": "http://www.businesswire.com//portal/site/home/template.PAGE/news/?javax.portlet.tpst=ccf123a93466ea4c882a06a9149550fd&javax.portlet.prp_ccf123a93466ea4c882a06a9149550fd_viewID=MY_PORTAL_VIEW&javax.portlet.prp_ccf123a93466ea4c882a06a9149550fd_ndmHsc=v2*A1525690800000*B1528334095137*DgroupByDate*G19*N1000003&javax.portlet.begCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken&javax.portlet.endCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "All News | Business Wire", "title": "VanEck and SolidX Join Forces to Bring to Market Physically-Backed Bitcoin ETF", "title_full": "VanEck and SolidX Join Forces to Bring to Market Physically-Backed Bitcoin ETF | Business Wire", "published": "2018-06-06T21:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.127, "main_image": "https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20180606005757/en/503377/21/VE_Logo_NoTag_k_rgb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5013, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b68fe827249740d154605c52ee35b2bd505e763a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRrQMwA9kyMdJJzb_0.Ff_ndHEMYOvfyKCkSPfGu_S2l22.hw70kGrOh1qER.gpDS_vtXGRCzpYY_KaSqfxZTS30AWEtY1jooPM51qF3ktScLeiqNc_bZvv_m0i3KRKPPpcsyVPa_N2hd9BPnoxPfT7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "http://www.businesswire.com/", "published": "2018-06-06T21:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "VanEck and SolidX Join Forces to Bring to Market Physically-Backed Bitcoin ETF", "text": "NEW YORK--( BUSINESS WIRE )-- VanEck today announced that it will partner with SolidX to list a physically-backed bitcoin ETF that will be insured against loss or theft of bitcoin. SolidX will act as the sponsor of the ETF and VanEck will provide marketing services. The two firms will work jointly with regulators. VanEck was the first to file for a bitcoin ETF registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 in August 2017, while SolidX in March 2016 was among the first to file under the Securities Act of 1933 for a physically-backed bitcoin ETF that would reflect the performance of the price of bitcoin.\n“I believe that bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of ‘digital gold’ that may make sense for investors’ portfolios,” said Jan van Eck, Chief Executive Officer of VanEck. “The SolidX team has in-depth experience with bitcoin, cryptography, and capital markets. We’re pleased to join with them in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market.”\n“We believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process,” continued van Eck. “A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin.”\n“It is important to communicate with investors about the risks as well as the opportunities, especially for new investment areas, and we have been committed to this effort,” added van Eck.\nVanEck has a history of supporting innovative investment products, from the first gold-focused mutual fund and gold miners ETF, to more recent strategies, including emerging markets debt as well as a series of guided allocation approaches. VanEck has also, through its MVIS subsidiary, created several comprehensive digital asset indices designed to provide a measurement of both individual digital assets and various baskets of digital asset exposures. The SolidX team has been involved with the bitcoin ecosystem since 2011 and was one of the first sponsors to file a registration statement for a bitcoin-based ETF. SolidX has been working on bringing a bitcoin ETF to market since 2015.\n“In determining a marketing partner, we looked for a firm with a clear understanding of the potential of bitcoin and the role it can play in an investment portfolio,” said Daniel H. Gallancy, Chief Executive Officer of SolidX. “VanEck is deeply involved in this space, understands its potential, and has a long track record of successfully opening new avenues for investors to access unique and compelling investment opportunities. We’re excited to work with the team at VanEck.”\nThe ETF is expected to list on the Cboe BZX Equities Exchange.\nAbout VanEck vaneck.com\nVanEck’s mission is to offer investors forward-looking, intelligently designed investment strategies that take advantage of targeted market opportunities.

(\"Virtual Crypto\", or the \"Company\") (OTCQB: VRCP), a technology company dedicated to making cryptocurrencies accessible to the public, announced that it will launch its bitcoin ATM at the TechCrunch Tel Aviv event tomorrow ( June 7, 2018 ).\nIn contrast to most bitcoin ATM platforms, which only allow the purchase of bitcoin, Virtual Crypto's NetoBit ATM is a bi-directional platform that enables users to sell bitcoin as well, i.e. convert bitcoin currencies to regular fiat money, and to buy bitcoin, i.e. convert fiat money to bitcoin. NetoBit ATM is the world's first and only ATM that allows real time conversion, purchase and sale of bitcoin. The product, which already supports most common currencies, is available for purchase globally.\nNetoBit ATM is the second product in Virtual Crypto's NetoBit software and hardware products portfolio. In April 2018 , the Company launched its first product, NetoBit Pay, a retail point-of-sale (\"POS\") device that enables businesses worldwide to securely receive payments in bitcoin in real time, while enjoying protection against exchange rate volatility and guaranteeing transactions up to a value of $3,000 .\nThe cryptocurrencies ATM market, in which Virtual Crypto operates, enjoys exceptional growth rates. According to a study by Coherent Market Insights from October 2017 , the size of the market in 2017 was around $14 billion , but it is expected to grow at a compound average growth rate of 46% between the years 2017 and 2025.\nNetoBit solutions, including Netobit ATM, are different from many other solutions in at least three ways. First, Virtual Crypto's validation algorithm can very precisely and quickly predict if a cryptocurrency transaction will be approved immediately by a blockchain at the moment of the transaction, before the block is digitally signed. This quick process allows the approval of the crypto transaction within seconds to minutes, rather than between 10 minutes and 24 hours and following a process of six confirmations, as is the case today. This way, Virtual Crypto can create a pleasant and immediate transaction experience, minimizing the risk of fraud, which can occur in the usual lengthy transaction approval processes. Consequently, NetoBit ATM users can draw cash and transfer money from and to their digital wallets in seconds.\nSecond, cryptocurrency trading platforms usually allow the customer carrying out the transaction to interact with only one crypto exchange, shackling the customer to the exchange rate which that exchange offers. Virtual Crypto allows the customer to work with several crypto exchanges simultaneously for each transaction. In this way, the Virtual Crypto algorithms can immediately locate the best crypto deal and offer the most attractive exchange rate while the transaction is underway. This ability enables the Company to protect the transaction from currency volatility that is liable to occur during the current lengthy transaction approval process and offer guarantee for transactions of up to $3,000 .\nThird, the implementation of Virtual Crypto's financial management system allows the operation of a large number of cryptocurrency ATMs and points of sale and provides tools that help manage and track the flow of money in each and every terminal. The back-office capabilities include setting currency price limits for each transaction, defining the KYC (Know Your Customer – customer identification), conforming to different regulations and configurations in different countries, managing risk and providing useful statistical data on transactions and points of sale. These capabilities are different from many other solutions that offer back-office capabilities which can manage only one transaction center.\nAlon Dayan , CEO of Virtual Crypto Technologies Ltd. commented on the announcement, \"We continue to set standards for the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. Our proprietary algorithm reduced the typical transaction time from 10 to 60 minutes to several seconds. At this stage, NetoBit ATMs combine that speed with the convenience of an ATM, giving customers the ability to buy and sell bitcoin with fiat money. The result is a vastly improved trading experience for customers, which we believe will be attractive to our business partners as well as consumers.\"\nAbout Virtual Crypto Technologies Inc.\nVirtual Crypto Technologies Inc. ( www.virtual-crypto.com ), through its wholly owned Israeli subsidiary Virtual Crypto Technologies Ltd., has developed NetoBit, a proprietary, Cryptographic algorithmic technology that it is able to confirm in real-time the purchase or sale of any cryptocurrency.\nVirtual Crypto's NetoBit products dramatically improve the cryptocurrency trading experience with faster execution and lower costs. These products are setting a new time to transaction standard, trading in seconds rather the industry norm of 20 minutes. Because of its speed, customers enjoy the best crypto exchange rate at the point of transaction.\nThe company is marketing its NetoBit software and hardware products for the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies through ATMs, tablets, PCs and mobile devices (the \"VC Products\"). Virtual Crypto Technologies further believes that the ability to immediately confirm Cryptocurrency transactions in real-time should be a major competitive breakthrough in making the purchase and sale of crypto currencies user friendly.\nFor more information please visit http://www.virtual-crypto.com/\nTo watch a video, please click https://virtual-crypto.com/resources/ .\nFor further details:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share", "https://virtual-crypto.com/resources/", "http://www.virtual-crypto.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virtual crypto technologies ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tel aviv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T22:10:44.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7022dbca0148a6b7ed376cd1146a76754ba12822", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8v3BmVd24meuL1ei1Bo_4WrVcnnQA4rPXd00POKoKIom5Z9l2Lu0CL96HrhNB3jvRzw9VzDuZN0pK3kozgpSHiyqq_d9ioQ7iFhr._AaWwvv8WmUUFDOR2dmbDFn_xQ1ruGcEgRWnhu1WGtebI68RGBDxLuLSHHTasZnGOdtMyQh4z0FbxKb0M0PdVDHxKKamcOt_6kwdUbw--", "site_full": "www.businessinsider.com", "site": "businessinsider.com", "site_section": "http://www.businessinsider.com", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Feedburner", "title": "Mike Novogratz says a CNBC segment on buying a bitcoin rival shows why regulators are clamping down on crypto", "title_full": "Mike Novogratz says a CNBC segment on buying a bitcoin rival shows why regulators are clamping down on crypto", "published": "2018-06-06T21:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 283, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7022dbca0148a6b7ed376cd1146a76754ba12822", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8v3BmVd24meuL1ei1Bo_4WrVcnnQA4rPXd00POKoKIom5Z9l2Lu0CL96HrhNB3jvRzw9VzDuZN0pK3kozgpSHiyqq_d9ioQ7iFhr._AaWwvv8WmUUFDOR2dmbDFn_xQ1ruGcEgRWnhu1WGtebI68RGBDxLuLSHHTasZnGOdtMyQh4z0FbxKb0M0PdVDHxKKamcOt_6kwdUbw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Frank Chaparro (feedback@businessinsider.com)", "published": "2018-06-06T21:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Mike Novogratz says a CNBC segment on buying a bitcoin rival shows why regulators are clamping down on crypto", "text": "Reuters/Rick Wilking\nMike Novogratz poked a little fun at CNBC while speaking to rival Bloomberg about the crypto hype that marked the very beginning of 2018. \"CNBC, not to pick on CNBC, but I think I can since I am here,\" Novogratz said.

The SEC did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment on Wednesday. Published 1:03 PM ET Wed, 6 June 2018 Updated 14 Hours Ago Artur Widak | NurPhoto | Getty Images A lady passes in front of a Bitcoin exchange shop.\nMoney management firm VanEck is trying again for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.\nOn this third attempt, the company is teaming up with blockchain company SolidX and basing the fund on actual bitcoins rather than futures.\nEach share of the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust is set to cost a hefty $200,000, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. The high price reflects the fund's focus on institutional, rather than retail, investors, SolidX CEO Daniel H. Gallancy said in a phone interview with CNBC.\nIf all regulatory filings go through according to plan, the ETF should launch by sometime in the first quarter of 2019, Gallancy said. The fund will track a bitcoin index from VanEck's subsidiary MVIS that uses prices from over-the-counter trades rather than electronic cryptocurrency exchanges.\nIt's not clear whether the structure of the ETF or bitcoin's relative stability recently will help the fund gain approval. Several companies, including VanEck, have tried unsuccessfully to launch bitcoin ETFs in the United States. show chapters 3:32 PM ET Wed, 6 June 2018 | 04:27\nVanEck first filed for an ETF based on bitcoin futures in August, but withdrew the application in September at the request of SEC staff since the futures didn't exist yet. The company and several other firms filed again when bitcoin futures launched on CME and Cboe in December. But they had to withdraw those applications in January at the request of SEC staff.\nIn a letter that month, the commission raised concerns such as extreme price volatility and the ability for customers to withdraw funds easily.\nThe SEC did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment on Wednesday. Bitcoin traded near $7,500 on Wednesday, holding within the trading range of the last few months.\nSolidX has also struggled to launch a bitcoin ETF. In March 2017, the SEC rejected the company's application for an exchange-traded product based on physical bitcoins.

However, he also claims that Bitcoin is “the last thing” he’d want to own in the event of a catastrophe. ‘The last thing I’d want to own is bitcoin’ In an interview with the New York City-based nonprofit think tank The Institute for New Economic Thinking, nocoiner Jim Chanos didn’t shy away from his negative opinions on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nIn addition to calling Bitcoin merely another fiat currency, Chanos ridiculed those who view cryptocurrencies as stores of value for the future while stereotyping Bitcoin proponents as doomsday conspiracy theorists. He stated :\nFor those who believe it’s a store of value in the coming apocalypse, the idea is that you’re going to have to safeguard your key under a mountain with fingerprint and eye scan security while the hordes are outside your bunker trying to get in to use it — for what, I have no idea. Because for those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that’s exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least. Food would work the best!\nNevertheless, Chanos still admits that such a situation could feasibly take place, though provides little advice — outside of investing in food. He merely claims to invest in Bitcoin, which allows you and you alone to maintain access to its stored value, is foolish. He explained:\nAnd if you say, well, fiat currency is going to bring the world down, which could, of course, happen, then I say the last thing I’d want to own is bitcoin if the grid goes down.\n(One can probably think of a few less valuable things to own “if the grid goes down.”) Difference of Opinion\nChanos’ opinion is not shared by everyone, of course.\nClem Chambers, CEO of ADVFN.com and author of Be Rich, The Game in Wall Street and Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner’s Guide , recently claimed Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are the new flight capital . Chambers explained:\nYou can’t head for the airport with gold bars these days, and opening a foreign bank account is a thankless task that can take months or never get done. A normal person sweating a war isn’t a billionaire with a private office, but in the old days they might have stashed a few thousand or even hundreds of thousands in gold if they thought the balloon was going up.\nToday you’d stash it in Bitcoin and be safe in the knowledge that you could fly away on holiday somewhere safe for a few months and your stash would be as safe as the place your hid you private keys.

However, he also claims that Bitcoin is \"the last thing\" he'd want to own in the event of a catastrophe.\n'The last thing I'd want to own is bitcoin' In an interview with the New York City-based nonprofit think tank The Institute for New Economic Thinking, nocoiner Jim Chanos didn't shy away from his negative opinions on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nIn addition to calling Bitcoin merely another fiat currency, Chanos ridiculed those who view cryptocurrencies as stores of value for the future while stereotyping Bitcoin proponents as doomsday conspiracy theorists. He stated :\nFor those who believe it's a store of value in the coming apocalypse, the idea is that you're going to have to safeguard your key under a mountain with fingerprint and eye scan security while the hordes are outside your bunker trying to get in to use it — for what, I have no idea. Because for those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that's exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least. Food would work the best!\nNevertheless, Chanos still admits that such a situation could feasibly take place, though provides little advice — outside of investing in food. He merely claims to invest in Bitcoin, which allows you and you alone to maintain access to its stored value, is foolish. He explained:\nAnd if you say, well, fiat currency is going to bring the world down, which could, of course, happen, then I say the last thing I'd want to own is bitcoin if the grid goes down.\n(One can probably think of a few less valuable things to own \"if the grid goes down.\")\nDifference of Opinion Chanos' opinion is not shared by everyone, of course.\nClem Chambers, CEO of ADVFN.com and author of Be Rich, The Game in Wall Street and Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner's Guide , recently claimed Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are the new flight capital . Chambers explained:\nYou can't head for the airport with gold bars these days, and opening a foreign bank account is a thankless task that can take months or never get done. A normal person sweating a war isn't a billionaire with a private office, but in the old days they might have stashed a few thousand or even hundreds of thousands in gold if they thought the balloon was going up.\nToday you'd stash it in Bitcoin and be safe in the knowledge that you could fly away on holiday somewhere safe for a few months and your stash would be as safe as the place your hid you private keys.\nConveniently Forgetting the Facts Chanos summed up his opinion on Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market as such:\nSo this is simply a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough in monetary policy.\nAs is the case with many nocoiners, Chanos completely glossed over the \"technological breakthrough\" aspect of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies — namely, the ability to quickly transfer value across borders without the need for a middle-man via a publicly-verifiable distributed ledger, the ability to truly 'be your own bank,' the ability to create self-executing smart contracts, etc.\nWhat do you think of Jim Chanos' opinions on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?

CoinGeek and nChain’s mining firms plan to adjust settings in the software running on their BCH mining units to make two changes: (1) Remove the current minimum “dust limit” of 546 Satoshi . This will makes it is possible for users to send as little as 1 Satoshi (one hundred millionth of a single Bitcoin Cash coin) via a BCH transaction. Any miner can accept a 1 Satoshi transaction amount, and it should be included in a valid block that all other miners will accept. (2) Accept some free (zero mining fee) transactions in each block they mine. CoinGeek and nChain believe that miners should be able to accept free transactions, rather than requiring users to pay a minimum of 1 Satoshi per byte. Their mining firms will each designate a number of free transactions they will accept in each mined block. For the full techy download see full article . Significantly, if miners choose to accept some transactions with zero mining fee, this further encourages more Bitcoin Cash transaction usage. If free transactions are possible, miners will have freedom to set more fee level ranges, from zero to small amounts. Users will have more choice about how much (if anything) they wish to pay for sending a BCH transaction, depending on the speed they want. This fosters a healthy competitive fee marketplace among miners, which will keep fees low for users and support BCH growth. Editor’s Note : CoinGeek is the Calvin Ayre-owned media site and bitcoin mining firm, and nChain is the global leader in research and development of blockchain technologies. nChain’s mining business is BMG Operations.

Behind the scenes though, the development of Bitcoin has continued to defy market movements with the continuous development of the Lightning Network (LN), which has led to the creation of several bitcoin LN wallets.\nThe Lightning Network ushered in the promise of easing network congestion by moving on-chain transactions to the second-layer protocol.\nHere are some of the mobile wallets currently in development. Eclair\nDeveloped by Paris-based ACINQ, Lightning-ready Bitcoin wallet Eclair currently has 3,000 wallet downloads, and it came about as a result of three years of working on Lightning. The Eclair wallet is a real Lightning node not a remote control app for a node running on a server. Users can transfer money from a checking to a savings account by closing channels, generate Lightning invoices, and pay Lightning invoices through QR codes or Lightning invoices.\nDominique Padiou, a software engineer at Eclair, told Bitcoin Magazine that payment route computation is made by the wallet itself, which creates better privacy, similar to the way a node on a server would.\nAt the moment, the wallet is outbound only. This is a deliberate move as the company believes users need a mobile Lightning wallet to make payments but not necessarily to receive payments. There are plans, however, to add a receiving feature in the future.\nFor now, funds stored in LN channels cannot be backed up through the app. Padiou said the company plans to \"improve the performance of the wallet in the future, make it secure and add a backup mechanism for the LN channels.\" This wallet is only available on the Google Play Store . Bitcoin Lightning Wallet\nBitcoin Lightning is an SPV BIP37-based wallet developed by Anton Kumaigorodski. It features full Lightning Network support that provides for both on-chain and off-chain network transactions and is available in both testnet and mainnet.\nProcessing is local for both on- and off-chain transactions. Users can send and receive bitcoin almost instantly through dedicated channels. One unique quality of this wallet is that it uses a system of storage tokens to store channel backups and delay refunding transactions anonymously.\nThis process is important, since \"having a mnemonic phrase won't get your lost channel balance back unless you have a backup,\" Kumaigorodski stated. The potential for funds to go missing due to inconsistencies remain, but Kumaigorodski added that \"the wallet offers off-chain data loss protection by automating the channel.” This wallet is available on the Google Play Store . Rawtx\nRawtx, short for “raw transactions,” is a mobile Lightning Network wallet for Bitcoin that allows users to send and receive testnet bitcoins on the blockchain and Lightning Network. The lead developer, known by the alias “raw tx,” told Bitcoin Magazine that they created the wallet for users who wanted to test out and get familiar with Lightning technology.\nHe went further to explain what makes the wallet unique. \"It is the easiest to start with. One of the first things we show the user is a way of opening a channel with Lightning faucet.” The Rawtx wallet is built on lnd which is one of the most stable Lightning implementations out there.\nThe app currently supports mainnet transactions but enabling it is not entirely straightforward. The developer told us that the current app available for download is only on testnet, but mainnet testing has begun and it looks promising.\nThe iOS version of the Rawtx wallet is scheduled to be released later this month while the Android version can be found here .\nOther bitcoin Lightning wallets that have been released include LND Thin Wallet developed by Union 7 Labs, Swift Lightning Project and Shango Lightning Wallet . They offer similar features with very little difference in structure and how they process off-chain transactions. Usability Issues\nWhile Lightning has grown since it was first proposed back in 2015, there is still a long way to go in making these apps easy to use for everyday payments for the average person.\nAt the time of publishing, there are currently 2,135 open nodes and 5,566 channels . While there is lots of excitement and optimism about what the Lightning Network represents, users are expected to be cautious as the technology is still in development and surprises are possible.\nThere are also usability issues which could affect the speed of its adoption unless they are fixed. This is most evident in the channel creation process. A user has to go through a series of confirmations before a new channel is accepted, which means the user has to monitor the channel carefully.\nYou can read more about the Lightning Network here .\nBitcoin Magazine currently does not endorse any of these wallets. While we have no concrete reason to believe they are insecure, all Lightning software is still in very early stages, and we cannot guarantee they will work as advertised.\nThis article originally

Behind the scenes though, the development of Bitcoin has continued to defy market movements with the continuous development of the Lightning Network (LN), which has led to the creation of several bitcoin LN wallets.\nThe Lightning Network ushered in the promise of easing network congestion by moving on-chain transactions to the second-layer protocol.\nHere are some of the mobile wallets currently in development.\nEclair Developed by Paris-based ACINQ, Lightning-ready Bitcoin wallet Eclair currently has 3,000 wallet downloads, and it came about as a result of three years of working on Lightning. The Eclair wallet is a real Lightning node not a remote control app for a node running on a server. Users can transfer money from a checking to a savings account by closing channels, generate Lightning invoices, and pay Lightning invoices through QR codes or Lightning invoices.\nDominique Padiou, a software engineer at Eclair, told Bitcoin Magazine that payment route computation is made by the wallet itself, which creates better privacy, similar to the way a node on a server would.\nAt the moment, the wallet is outbound only. This is a deliberate move as the company believes users need a mobile Lightning wallet to make payments but not necessarily to receive payments. There are plans, however, to add a receiving feature in the future.\nFor now, funds stored in LN channels cannot be backed up through the app. Padiou said the company plans to \"improve the performance of the wallet in the future, make it secure and add a backup mechanism for the LN channels.\" This wallet is only available on the Google Play Store .\nBitcoin Lightning Wallet Bitcoin Lightning is an SPV BIP37-based wallet developed by Anton Kumaigorodski. It features full Lightning Network support that provides for both on-chain and off-chain network transactions and is available in both testnet and mainnet.\nProcessing is local for both on- and off-chain transactions. Users can send and receive bitcoin almost instantly through dedicated channels. One unique quality of this wallet is that it uses a system of storage tokens to store channel backups and delay refunding transactions anonymously.\nThis process is important, since \"having a mnemonic phrase won't get your lost channel balance back unless you have a backup,\" Kumaigorodski stated. The potential for funds to go missing due to inconsistencies remain, but Kumaigorodski added that \"the wallet offers off-chain data loss protection by automating the channel.\" This wallet is available on the Google Play Store .\nRawtx Rawtx, short for \"raw transactions,\" is a mobile Lightning Network wallet for Bitcoin that allows users to send and receive testnet bitcoins on the blockchain and Lightning Network. The lead developer, known by the alias \"raw tx,\" told Bitcoin Magazine that they created the wallet for users who wanted to test out and get familiar with Lightning technology.\nHe went further to explain what makes the wallet unique. \"It is the easiest to start with. One of the first things we show the user is a way of opening a channel with Lightning faucet.\" The Rawtx wallet is built on lnd which is one of the most stable Lightning implementations out there.\nThe app currently supports mainnet transactions but enabling it is not entirely straightforward. The developer told us that the current app available for download is only on testnet, but mainnet testing has begun and it looks promising.\nThe iOS version of the Rawtx wallet is scheduled to be released later this month while the Android version can be found here .\nOther bitcoin Lightning wallets that have been released include LND Thin Wallet developed by Union 7 Labs, Swift Lightning Project and Shango Lightning Wallet . They offer similar features with very little difference in structure and how they process off-chain transactions.\nUsability Issues While Lightning has grown since it was first proposed back in 2015, there is still a long way to go in making these apps easy to use for everyday payments for the average person.\nAt the time of publishing, there are currently 2,135 open nodes and 5,566 channels . While there is lots of excitement and optimism about what the Lightning Network represents, users are expected to be cautious as the technology is still in development and surprises are possible.\nThere are also usability issues which could affect the speed of its adoption unless they are fixed. This is most evident in the channel creation process. A user has to go through a series of confirmations before a new channel is accepted, which means the user has to monitor the channel carefully.\nYou can read more about the Lightning Network here .\nBitcoin Magazine currently does not endorse any of these wallets. While we have no concrete reason to believe they are insecure, all Lightning software is still in very early stages, and we cannot guarantee they will work as advertised.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dominique padiou", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lightning network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lightning", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eclair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T20:32:33.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2806ac4043eea1363c30dbe1506eeebeb94da4b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYhr.7_6CWmglgkDhEqI1ZO.voXJscQk2S4qlEwtn0lTMdwhCPXGuLTj4DfWxfrkTFWU2pQ528ceHi0lO0aPOypRnQhKXapJoc-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin -

Rather than using a £1 coin or $1 bill, something could be 1 Bitcoin (1 BTC). But Bitcoin is much more than a currency, and this is why people often get confused. It’s also the entire network (known as a Blockchain) that securely oversees the entire process of someone sending money to someone else. Say you spend £20 at a restaurant on a Visa debit card. That transaction must be processed through a card machine, Visa, your bank and the merchant bank. At each step, communication and verification takes place. Bitcoin’s promise is removing all of this friction involved in the verification, whilst also making payments much more secure. You could use your mobile phone to send £20 worth of Bitcoin to the restaurant directly. By cutting out the middlemen, transactions become much cheaper too, especially when it comes to international payments. Bitcoin also takes on the role of government central banks (eg. The Bank of England). Governments traditionally have control over the supply of currency which is open to manipulation and corruption. The Bitcoin Blockchain is completely open. It isn’t owned or controlled by anyone, it’s run by a network of many computers around the world. Of course the young cryptocurrency is not without its critics. Mainstream media, traditional banks and financial commentators all warn against a ‘bubble’ set to burst, and the opportunity for Bitcoin to be used by criminals. 55830\nhttps://www.x-crypto.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T00:00:54.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ae9934acf8b6cb29081eb00a47a76d794d818ba1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScHkJDzI9V6rI3Oo2HiAENDWv3sYZennkuGJA.IQurxfmyA9UeP5F1tqzuuGX0uTEfD.eS6Ie01C", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Development of Lightning Mobile Wallets Promises Faster Bitcoin Payments", "title_full": "Development of Lightning Mobile Wallets Promises Faster Bitcoin Payments", "published": "2018-06-06T20:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ae9934acf8b6cb29081eb00a47a76d794d818ba1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScHkJDzI9V6rI3Oo2HiAENDWv3sYZennkuGJA.IQurxfmyA9UeP5F1tqzuuGX0uTEfD.eS6Ie01C", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-06T20:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Development of Lightning Mobile Wallets Promises Faster Bitcoin Payments", "text": "Development of Lightning Mobile Wallets Promises Faster Bitcoin Payments\nJimmy Aki\nSince the turn of the year, the price of bitcoin has been battered with investors left to lick their wounds. Behind the scenes though, the development of Bitcoin has continued to defy market movements with the continuous development of the Lightning Network (LN), which has led to the creation of several bitcoin LN wallets.\nThe Lightning Network ushered in the promise of easing network congestion by moving on-chain transactions to the second-layer protocol.\nHere are some of the mobile wallets currently in development.\nEclair Developed by Paris-based ACINQ, Lightning-ready Bitcoin wallet Eclair currently has 3,000 wallet downloads, and it came about as a result of three years of working on Lightning. The Eclair wallet is a real Lightning node not a remote control app for a node running on a server. Users can transfer money from a checking to a savings account by closing channels, generate Lightning invoices, and pay Lightning invoices through QR codes or Lightning invoices.\nDominique Padiou, a software engineer at Eclair, told Bitcoin Magazine that payment route computation is made by the wallet itself, which creates better privacy, similar to the way a node on a server would.\nAt the moment, the wallet is outbound only. This is a deliberate move as the company believes users need a mobile Lightning wallet to make payments but not necessarily to receive payments. There are plans, however, to add a receiving feature in the future.\nFor now, funds stored in LN channels cannot be backed up through the app. Padiou said the company plans to \"improve the performance of the wallet in the future, make it secure and add a backup mechanism for the LN channels.\" This wallet is only available on the Google Play Store .\nBitcoin Lightning Wallet Bitcoin Lightning is an SPV BIP37-based wallet developed by Anton Kumaigorodski. It features full Lightning Network support that provides for both on-chain and off-chain network transactions and is available in both testnet and mainnet.\nProcessing is local for both on- and off-chain transactions. Users can send and receive bitcoin almost instantly through dedicated channels. One unique quality of this wallet is that it uses a system of storage tokens to store channel backups and delay refunding transactions anonymously.\nThis process is important, since \"having a mnemonic phrase won't get your lost channel balance back unless you have a backup,\" Kumaigorodski stated. The potential for funds to go missing due to inconsistencies remain, but Kumaigorodski added that \"the wallet offers off-chain data loss protection by automating the channel.\" This wallet is available on the Google Play Store .\nRawtx Rawtx, short for \"raw transactions,\" is a mobile Lightning Network wallet for Bitcoin that allows users to send and receive testnet bitcoins on the blockchain and Lightning Network. The lead developer, known by the alias \"raw tx,\" told Bitcoin Magazine that they created the wallet for users who wanted to test out and get familiar with Lightning technology.\nHe went further to explain what makes the wallet unique. \"It is the easiest to start with. One of the first things we show the user is a way of opening a channel with Lightning faucet.\" The Rawtx wallet is built on lnd which is one of the most stable Lightning implementations out there.\nThe app currently supports mainnet transactions but enabling it is not entirely straightforward. The developer told us that the current app available for download is only on testnet, but mainnet testing has begun and it looks promising.\nThe iOS version of the Rawtx wallet is scheduled to be released later this month while the Android version can be found here .\nOther bitcoin Lightning wallets that have been released include LND Thin Wallet developed by Union 7 Labs, Swift Lightning Project and Shango Lightning Wallet . They offer similar features with very little difference in structure and how they process off-chain transactions.\nUsability Issues While Lightning has grown since it was first proposed back in 2015, there is still a long way to go in making these apps easy to use for everyday payments for the average person.\nAt the time of publishing, there are currently 2,135 open nodes and 5,566 channels . While there is lots of excitement and optimism about what the Lightning Network represents, users are expected to be cautious as the technology is still in development and surprises are possible.\nThere are also usability issues which could affect the speed of its adoption unless they are fixed. This is most evident in the channel creation process. A user has to go through a series of confirmations before a new channel is accepted, which means the user has to monitor the channel carefully.\nYou can read more about the Lightning Network here .\nBitcoin Magazine currently does not endorse any of these wallets. While we have no concrete reason to believe they are insecure, all Lightning software is still in very early stages, and we cannot guarantee they will work as advertised.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\nBitcoin Magazine ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jimmy aki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dominique padiou", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lightning network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lightning", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T20:27:38.057+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9becdca8990043fa420565e458bb98337de31045", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.stObH9kR7sXIIAWebAmtmVPBjZV.8sPQ5jkQMKRlAdhVNn2m6azanplspleRydYr1g--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "I'm stepping over every tow bar if it means falling into more Bitcoin!", "title_full": "I'm stepping over every tow bar if it means falling into more Bitcoin!", "published": "2018-06-06T20:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9becdca8990043fa420565e458bb98337de31045", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.stObH9kR7sXIIAWebAmtmVPBjZV.8sPQ5jkQMKRlAdhVNn2m6azanplspleRydYr1g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-06T20:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "I'm stepping over every tow bar if it means falling into more Bitcoin!", "text": "I'm stepping over every tow bar if it means falling into more Bitcoin!\n/u/tsturg15\nsubmitted by /u/tsturg15\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T20:27:15.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e4f5805ec96a20d31f2f7d0cb64982fbd1c0d9ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSZUXd4nph2IfzOGaxMYWIhSHKyxlA6uWWkDatKE1KMvQXS2BAlMfWgiUVYXef9Skp8a6TbCN1gRF", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin + Segwit + Lightning: ~3.5 Million tx / sec ... and growing!", "title_full": "Bitcoin + Segwit + Lightning: ~3.5 Million tx / sec ... and growing!", "published": "2018-06-06T20:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e4f5805ec96a20d31f2f7d0cb64982fbd1c0d9ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSZUXd4nph2IfzOGaxMYWIhSHKyxlA6uWWkDatKE1KMvQXS2BAlMfWgiUVYXef9Skp8a6TbCN1gRF", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-06T20:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin + Segwit + Lightning: ~3.5 Million tx / sec ... and growing!", "text": "Bitcoin + Segwit + Lightning: ~3.5 Million tx / sec ... and growing!\n/u/MrAlbeos\nEach lightning channel can handle 500 transactions per second.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. Google Trends shows that web searches for the word “Bitcoin” have plunged about 75 percent in 2018 so far. This shows that most people looking to make a quick buck have lost interest in the cryptocurrency. While this is bad news for momentum traders, it is good news for investors because they can buy at lower levels when most of the froth is out of the markets. While Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak believes that Bitcoin is digital gold , the famous short seller Jim Chanos , is not fond of cryptocurrencies and doesn’t see any use for them in case of an apocalypse. Any new disruptive technology always has its share of skeptics. Interestingly, Bitcoin has been “sent to the graveyard” 300 times already but still, it has always emerged stronger than before and this time is going to be no exception. The central banks around the globe are threatened by the virtual currencies. During a recent panel talk , the representatives of the Bank of Canada and the Swiss National Bank agreed that cryptocurrencies can spell the end of fiat currencies in a “situation of hyperinflation” and if the central banks don’t do a good job. So, should we buy some now or wait for better prices later. Let’s see. BTC/USD Bitcoin turned down from close to the 20-day EMA on June 04 but found support at $7433.34 on June 05. Today, the bears are again defending the overhead resistance zone between the 20-day EMA and $7941.68. The BTC/USD pair will gain strength above the $7941.68 levels. On the upside, the target objectives are $8,500, $9,000 and $10,000. On the downside, it has supports at $7317.6, $7106 and $6750. The 50-day SMA has flattened out and the 20-day EMA is falling, which shows that the path of least resistance is on the downside. The failure of the RSI to rise above the 50 levels also adds to the negative sentiment. We shall turn bullish after price rises above the 20-day EMA. Until then, we suggest traders to remain on the sidelines. ETH/USD Ethereum has been trading near the resistance line of the descending channel for the past three days. It has not given up any ground, which increases the likelihood of a breakout of the channel. The traders can buy once price reaches $630, with a stop below $570. The target objective of this trade is a rally to $745. There is a minor resistance at the 50-day SMA but we expect it to be crossed. On the downside, the ETH/USD pair will find support at the trendline but if it re-enters into the channel, it can again slide to the support line of the channel. Hence, we suggest a long position only when the price is clear of the channel. XRP/USD Ripple is taking support at the 20-day EMA but has not shown a strong bounce. The flattening of both moving averages points to the possibility of a consolidation in the near term. The XRP/USD pair will turn positive if it breaks out of the downtrend line of the descending triangle and will turn negative if it breaks below $0.45. We didn’t find any buy setups at the current levels. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash has been sustaining above the 20-day EMA for the past three days, which is a positive sign. The 20-day EMA which had been trending down has flattened, whereas, the 50-day SMA continues to trend up. All these indicate that the path of least resistance is up. Historically, the 50-day SMA has not acted as a major resistance, hence, we don’t expect a major hurdle at this level. However, $1306.5585 might act as a resistance. Above this, a retest of the $1600 levels is likely. On the downside, $1060-$955 is the first support zone. The BCH/USD pair will become negative if it drops below $878. Though we are bullish, we didn’t find any reliable setups; hence, we are not suggesting any trade on it. EOS/USD EOS has held the support at $12.9870, which is a bullish sign. It is currently facing resistance at the 50-day SMA. Both moving averages are turning up, which indicates that the path of least resistance is on the upside. Traders can wait for the EOS/USD pair to trade above the 50-day SMA for four hours and then initiate long positions with a target objective of $18.67. The stops can be kept close to $12.5 levels. If the digital currency struggles to break out of $15.545, the long positions should be closed. Volatility may remain high in the short-term because the virtual currency has just completed a major event. Hence, we suggest keeping the position size at less than 40 percent of usual. This is a high-risk trade. LTC/USD Litecoin has been consolidating in a tight range of $115-$127 for the past seven days. It might pick up momentum once it breaks out of $127. The first target objective on the upside is a move to $140, close to the 50-day SMA. If this level is crossed, the rally can extend to the downtrend line of the descending triangle. If the LTC/USD pair fails to break out of $127, it will continue its range-bound trading action for a few more days. On the downside, it has strong support at $115, and below that at $107 levels. It will become very negative if it breaks down and sustains below $107. We propose a long position on a breakout above $127, with a close stop loss of $115. We recommend to keep the allocation size at only 50 percent of usual because the digital currency is still trading inside a bearish descending triangle pattern. ADA/USD Cardano has been trading near the $0.23 levels for the past three days but has not triggered our recommendation to buy on a close (UTC time frame) above $0.23. The moving averages have flattened out, which points to a range-bound action in the short-term. Even if the $0.23 level is crossed, the ADA/USD pair might again face resistance at $0.263 and $0.286 levels. On the downside, the support is at $0.17 levels. As the risk-to-reward ratio is not attractive, we shall withdraw our buy recommendation and wait for a better opportunity. XLM/USD Stellar is struggling to rally above the $0.303 levels. However, the only small positive is that it has not given up much ground after returning from the 20-day EMA on June 04. We suggest to hold the long positions that triggered on June 03 but the stops should be trailed higher to just under $0.27 because the 50-day SMA is flat and the 20-day EMA is turning down, which is a bearish indication. Hence, let’s reduce our risk. If the XLM/USD pair breaks out and closes above $0.303, it should move up to the 50-day SMA at $0.346 and above that to $0.38 levels. IOTA/USD Though IOTA has held above the critical support at $1.63 for the past two days, it is struggling to stay above the 20-day EMA, which shows lack of buying support at the current levels. Both moving averages have turned flat, which increases the possibility of a consolidation in the IOTA/USD pair. The trend will turn negative only if the $1.63 support breaks down. On the upside, a bounce can reach $2 and $2.2 levels. Traders should establish a long position only after a strong bounce from the key support at $1.63.

SolidX will act as the sponsor of the ETF and VanEck will provide marketing services. The two firms will work jointly with regulators. VanEck was the first to file for a bitcoin ETF registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 in August 2017, while SolidX in March 2016 was among the first to file under the Securities Act of 1933 for a physically-backed bitcoin ETF that would reflect the performance of the price of bitcoin.\n“I believe that bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of ‘digital gold’ that may make sense for investors’ portfolios,” said Jan van Eck, Chief Executive Officer of VanEck. “The SolidX team has in-depth experience with bitcoin, cryptography, and capital markets. We’re pleased to join with them in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market.”\n“We believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process,” continued van Eck. “A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin.”\n“It is important to communicate with investors about the risks as well as the opportunities, especially for new investment areas, and we have been committed to this effort,” added van Eck.\nVanEck has a history of supporting innovative investment products, from the first gold-focused mutual fund and gold miners ETF, to more recent strategies, including emerging markets debt as well as a series of guided allocation approaches. VanEck has also, through its MVIS subsidiary, created several comprehensive digital asset indices designed to provide a measurement of both individual digital assets and various baskets of digital asset exposures. The SolidX team has been involved with the bitcoin ecosystem since 2011 and was one of the first sponsors to file a registration statement for a bitcoin-based ETF. SolidX has been working on bringing a bitcoin ETF to market since 2015.\n“In determining a marketing partner, we looked for a firm with a clear understanding of the potential of bitcoin and the role it can play in an investment portfolio,” said Daniel H. Gallancy, Chief Executive Officer of SolidX. “VanEck is deeply involved in this space, understands its potential, and has a long track record of successfully opening new avenues for investors to access unique and compelling investment opportunities.

The selloff started yesterday during the US session and has continued into today as all gains since Friday have been wiped out. Bitcoin has led the decline by falling 3.5% on the day to $7,430 and Ethereum has taken a bigger hit dropping 5.5% to $585. No news has initiated the fall; it has just become an expected symptom of a sideways market. Altcoins are predictably in the red this morning in Asia, and just as predictably the only one that performs well during a selloff is DigixDAO.\nEverything in the top 25 has plummeted according to Coinmarketcap. To find an altcoin in the green we have to go way down the list to spot 50 where DGD is trading 17% higher. Gold based DigixDAO is currently trading at $165, up from $142 this time yesterday. Over the week it is up 36% from $123 this time last Tuesday. The past month has not been good for DGD however as it has lost 35% from $260 this time last month. Against Bitcoin it is up 23% on the day to 2267700 satoshis from 1845000 sats this time yesterday. Weekly gains on BTC have been 31% from 1726000 satoshis this time last week.\nGold backed Ethereum token DigixDAO always seems to defy the selloff and perform well when all other cryptos are plummeting. In a similar pattern to gold versus fiat it has become somewhat predictable and traders are loading up. The Digix Gold Token DGX was listed on Airswap a few days ago but this current pump is likely to have been caused by inverse action on other altcoins. – News BTC\n 1:09 Economics , Technology ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.thedailyeconomist.com/2018/06/once-again-gold-backed-cryptocurrency.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "archives archives once", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T21:17:52.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "07300d70a534adf66d217837209fe3309d9fff10", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRuocPQl4p_xTOYRT3anAbsA4jt.MCV9jX21jdg6nHtYToeddB400Fuh2CFFZQxYPZhNIWswjIqbzzzNqi3PfmKsjDk0tlzoY5CAX.j6bvJ9b.87VDnN9qQuFR6muQLHGU-", "site_full": "cointradereview.com", "site": "cointradereview.com", "site_section": "http://cointradereview.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Coin Trade Review", "title": "Bitcoin Green (BITG) Recently Hits $5.59105: Crypto Trading Review", "title_full": "Bitcoin Green (BITG) Recently Hits $5.59105: Crypto Trading Review", "published": "2018-06-06T20:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "07300d70a534adf66d217837209fe3309d9fff10", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRuocPQl4p_xTOYRT3anAbsA4jt.MCV9jX21jdg6nHtYToeddB400Fuh2CFFZQxYPZhNIWswjIqbzzzNqi3PfmKsjDk0tlzoY5CAX.j6bvJ9b.87VDnN9qQuFR6muQLHGU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Staff Writer", "published": "2018-06-06T20:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Green (BITG) Recently Hits $5.59105: Crypto Trading Review", "text": "Bitcoin Green (BITG) Recently Hits $5.59105: Crypto Trading Review June 6, 2018 Staff Writer\nWatching some recent cryptocurrency data, we can see that Bitcoin Green (BITG) has moved to the $5.59105 level. The circulating supply levels are presently 3488525 19504518. Recent volume has been seen at 71047.4.\nAbout Bitcoin Green (BITG):No further information about the cryptocurrency is available at this time.\nInvestors may be wondering if the time is right to add cryptocurrency to the portfolio. The space has become very popular over the last few years, and there are many pros and cons that have been discussed regarding the topic. As everyone has seen, the most recognized of all the digital coins, Bitcoin, has been highly volatile. Bitcoin saw a tremendous jump in value but has settled down a bit since. There are many who believe that the coin is destined to shoot back up to high levels, and there are just as many who believe that the value will eventually be completely erased. The highly technical nature of the technology behind cryptocurrency may create some confusion among professionals and amateurs alike. Thoroughly examining the space may take a lot of extra effort, but it may assist the investor immensely when making those tough decisions.\nFollowing all the happenings in the fast paced crypto markets can be a challenge. Cryptocurrency may be in a remarkable position to transform financial systems that have been in place for a long period of time. Technologies that are transformative typically evolve from a need to solve a certain problem. The peer to peer systems have the ability to make transactions easier and quicker. Although there are plenty of naysayers opining about the current crypto scene, it remains to be seen what will transpire over the next six months. The vast number of marketplaces across the Internet may be welcoming to these new technologies as the fast changing conditions evolve.\nInvestors might be trying to figure out how to best navigate the crypto market. With so much uncertainty and volatility, it may be extremely hard to figure out the proper play. The rise of Bitcoin has helped thrust cryptocurrency into the limelight. Although there are plenty of widespread opinions about the future of digital currency, it may be difficult to come to a definite conclusion with the current state of the market. As more information becomes available and research is conducted, the crypto market may become a little more demystified in the near future.

However, he also claims that Bitcoin is “the last thing” he’d want to own in the event of a catastrophe. ‘The last thing I’d want to own is bitcoin’ In an interview with the New York City-based nonprofit think tank The Institute for New Economic Thinking, nocoiner Jim Chanos didn’t shy away from his negative opinions on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nIn addition to calling Bitcoin merely another fiat currency, Chanos ridiculed those who view cryptocurrencies as stores of value for the future while stereotyping Bitcoin proponents as doomsday conspiracy theorists. He stated :\nFor those who believe it’s a store of value in the coming apocalypse, the idea is that you’re going to have to safeguard your key under a mountain with fingerprint and eye scan security while the hordes are outside your bunker trying to get in to use it — for what, I have no idea. Because for those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that’s exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least. Food would work the best!\nNevertheless, Chanos still admits that such a situation could feasibly take place, though provides little advice — outside of investing in food. He merely claims to invest in Bitcoin, which allows you and you alone to maintain access to its stored value, is foolish. He explained:\nAnd if you say, well, fiat currency is going to bring the world down, which could, of course, happen, then I say the last thing I’d want to own is bitcoin if the grid goes down.\n(One can probably think of a few less valuable things to own “if the grid goes down.”) Difference of Opinion\nChanos’ opinion is not shared by everyone, of course.\nClem Chambers, CEO of ADVFN.com and author of Be Rich, The Game in Wall Street and Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner’s Guide , recently claimed Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are the new flight capital . Chambers explained:\nYou can’t head for the airport with gold bars these days, and opening a foreign bank account is a thankless task that can take months or never get done. A normal person sweating a war isn’t a billionaire with a private office, but in the old days they might have stashed a few thousand or even hundreds of thousands in gold if they thought the balloon was going up.\nToday you’d stash it in Bitcoin and be safe in the knowledge that you could fly away on holiday somewhere safe for a few months and your stash would be as safe as the place your hid you private keys. Conveniently Forgetting the Facts\nChanos summed up his opinion on Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market as such:\nSo this is simply a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough in monetary policy.\nAs is the case with many nocoiners, Chanos completely glossed over the “technological breakthrough” aspect of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies — namely, the ability to quickly transfer value across borders without the need for a middle-man via a publicly-verifiable distributed ledger, the ability to truly ‘be your own bank,’ the ability to create self-executing smart contracts, etc.\nWhat do you think of Jim Chanos’ opinions on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies? Can you think of a few less valuable things to own in the event of a catastrophe?

The Bitcoin logo is seen on a pillow on display at the Consensus 2018 blockchain technology conference in New York City, New York, U.S., May 16, 2018. REUTERS/Mike Segar\nThe exchange-traded product, called VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Shares, will be insured against theft, fraud and loss of access to the currency, according to the filing, which is subject to a review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe companies said they intend to buy and sell bitcoin in informally organized “over-the counter” bitcoin markets to cap transaction costs, while trading large blocks of the cryptocurrency.\nVan Eck, which had $46 billion in assets under management, and several other fund managers had previously pushed for exchange-traded funds based on bitcoin futures instead of directly investing in the cryptocurrency.\nThis was to address concerns that bitcoin exchanges were not regulated by traditional financial market overseers, unlike the futures market.\nThe SEC has either denied or tabled all bitcoin ETF proposals received so far, joining a long list of regulators that have taken a tough stance against products and securities related to digital currencies.\nVan Eck and SolidX hope to list the product on the Cboe exchange under the symbol “XBTC”.

That’s compared with $837 for the Antminer S9.\nAs if there was any doubt that GMO plans to knock Bitmain off its pedestal, the firm’s CEO Masatoshi Kumagai reportedly stated:\n“I respect Bitmain, but we will top them”\nWe are not setting business targets such as sales targets yet, but if we cannot sell it, we will use it in our mining business, so I think that it is a very excellent business in that there is no inventory risk.\nThe B2 was revealed on May 24, with GMP saying pre-orders will start on June 6 and shipments to follow in October.\nThe launch comes following a months-long testing period since the firm initially revealed it was researching and developing the new mining processor in September 2017.\nFor more info about GMO Internet Miner check the bellow link :", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitcoinschannel.com/category/bitcoin/", "https://twitter.com/ynakamura56/status/1003908868114509824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.financemagnates.com%2Fcryptocurrency%2Fnews%2Fgmo-wants-bigger-piece-mining-pie-unveils-new-b2-miner%2F", "https://gmominer.z.com/en/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gmo", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taiwan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T21:21:56.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "926f137e43ba3c17f5d05a12a2dab45731936f89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXVMN_c4xQ.VQA8U0SguIm0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why are banks and governments scared of Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why are banks and governments scared of Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-06-06T19:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "926f137e43ba3c17f5d05a12a2dab45731936f89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXVMN_c4xQ.VQA8U0SguIm0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "DoublerHunter", "published": "2018-06-06T19:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why are banks and governments scared of Bitcoin?", "text": "Quote: from: MetalGear on June 06, 2018, 11:24:50 AM Quote: from: AteenaD on April 29, 2018, 04:11:15 AM So many countries now were prohibiting the use of virtual cryptocurrencies. And to think that many unemployed individuals were beginning to uplift their way of living because of their dealings with cryptocurrencies. Banks doesn't expressly say why it is banning the use of Bitcoin.\nWhat do you think is the reason behind this?\nI think banks don't like this innovations because this is a way too different from their working ground. Banks can't take control to cryptocurrencies since no one can even independently influence it. They don't appreciate if this innovation can run free while banks are still rooted by many governing laws and regulation. That's why bitcoin has the advantage here to be more successful in the society.\nBitcoin has an advantage to be more successful in the future because of its technology called blockchain where the transaction are safe and bitcoin is not hackable so it is a plus for the people who want to put their money to bitcoin because it is safe and also transparent so there is no fraud that will going to happen unlike in the fiat and banks.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T23:47:21.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3daa6a0f76c9e838910d19265cfa3235dc8b4dcd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.sjJI4JXi0MkGdaxm4lvZGctlBT5gzgc3od67KjYQtrpmjRWCC9Ot9.8kAf1Ee0eP2w--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Money Launderers Use Property, not Bitcoin", "title_full": "Money Launderers Use Property, not Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-06T19:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3daa6a0f76c9e838910d19265cfa3235dc8b4dcd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.sjJI4JXi0MkGdaxm4lvZGctlBT5gzgc3od67KjYQtrpmjRWCC9Ot9.8kAf1Ee0eP2w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-06T19:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Money Launderers Use Property, not Bitcoin", "text": "Money Launderers Use Property, not Bitcoin\n/u/VY99\nsubmitted by /u/VY99\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T19:56:51.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8060a36c11c7c961e6f081958bd9d448eb3c8515", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeBnUpJeAW31mRMWBMfvhl85NRhNXx3MCp_YFl8.pFGOJL1AOtmd_pZW_GCIBX1Gp033HiY2CfUdTw--", "site_full": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin24on.blogspot.se/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "title": "SEC Chairman Jay Clayton Says Bitcoin Not a Security, Most ICOs Likely Are", "title_full": "SEC Chairman Jay Clayton Says Bitcoin Not a Security, Most ICOs Likely Are", "published": "2018-06-06T19:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8060a36c11c7c961e6f081958bd9d448eb3c8515", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeBnUpJeAW31mRMWBMfvhl85NRhNXx3MCp_YFl8.pFGOJL1AOtmd_pZW_GCIBX1Gp033HiY2CfUdTw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin 24on (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-06T19:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "SEC Chairman Jay Clayton Says Bitcoin Not a Security, Most ICOs Likely Are", "text": "Home » bitcoin » crypto » crypto news » news » SEC Chairman Jay Clayton Says Bitcoin Not a Security, Most ICOs Likely Are SEC Chairman Jay Clayton Says Bitcoin Not a Security, Most ICOs Likely Are bitcoin , crypto , crypto news , news #bitcoin #invest #money\nJay Clayton, chairman of the SEC, believes that distributed ledger tech shows “incredible promise,” noting that it can drive efficiencies in the markets. Jay Clayton, the chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), believes that Bitcoin (BTC) is not a security since it acts as a replacement for sovereign currencies, CNBC reports today, June 6. Clayton, when speaking about the “incredible promise” of distributed ledger technologies driving efficiencies in markets, clarified during today’s CNBC interview his thoughts on cryptocurrencies that are “replacements for sovereign currencies:” “Replace the dollar, the yen, the euro with Bitcoin. That type of currency is not a security.” While Clayton did not comment on specific assets besides Bitcoin about their status as securities, he went on to explain that what he considers to be securities are tokens that act as digital assets: “Where I give you my money and you go off and make a venture […] and in return for me giving you my money, you say, ‘You know what, I’m going to give you a return.’ That is a security, and we regulate that. We regulate the offering of that security, and we regulate the trading of that security.” When asked to make clear his statement on whether Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) are securities, Clayton told the interviewers, CNBC’s Bob Pisani, “Bob, I just did.” Clayton added that the SEC won’t support changing the definition of a security to support the ICO community, as they are not “going to do any violence to the traditional definition of a security which has worked well for a long time.” The SEC chair had previously praised distributed ledger tech, blockchain as an example, during February’s SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) cryptocurrency hearing. At the time, Clayton had noted that every ICO that the SEC had seen so far would be considered a security. Altcoins Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) have come up in the cryptocurrency security question, with Joseph Lubin of Ethereum emphatically denying that ETH was ever a security, and Ripple similarly rejecting a security classification.\nRipple is now facing a class action lawsuit from a disgruntled investor claiming that the sale of XRP is the sale of an unregistered security, with a former SEC chair recently appointed to represent Ripple in court. ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : cointelegraph.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ethereum", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/class-action-lawsuit-against-ripple-alleges-sale-of-unregistered-securities", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-sec-chair-represents-ripple-in-lawsuit-for-alleged-sale-of-unregistered-securities", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ico", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-hints-at-tighter-regulation-for-icos-smart-policies-for-true-cryptocurrencies", "https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/06/06/sec-chairman-cryptocurrencies-like-bitcoin--not-securities.html", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/it-never-was-a-security-ethereum-under-the-regulatory-spotlight", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/sec", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cftc", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/xrp-absolutely-not-a-security-says-ripple-chief-market-strategist", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-and-cftc-hearing-more-legitimate-icos-or-if-there-was-no-bitcoin-there-would-be-no-blockchain", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ripple"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jay clayton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clayton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T01:08:50.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b5cd8af98bc9a5675389a00c26172261ac90bf04", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_0_.SvtRu8zomWdqOFy.X1er5xsxM.Bn4o3vK6TYAF2xGVMJQmC23CB01zT_yKUwkCaR4YU_bxPnmp5FJG.6Rrq9WduqwS9r2adFhjL.NsS6qoHXgYrF0z7h9jjk2u20Xku7TnGC5Q5IuLmuZT7hmHnSpAGGPNL.jWDUyrX8Fd6NMNfH5PCHas2gz7GagmYE3j6T4zN_plTg--", "site_full": "www.publicwire.com", "site": "publicwire.com", "site_section": "http://www.publicwire.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance", "illegal_content"], "section_title": "Public Wire", "title": "SinglePoint Completes Commercial for Bitcoin Wallet Featuring Original Shark Tank Member Kevin Harrington and Provides Update on Form 10", "title_full": "SinglePoint Completes Commercial for Bitcoin Wallet Featuring Original Shark Tank Member Kevin Harrington and Provides Update on Form 10", "published": "2018-06-06T19:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.publicwire.com/newsite/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/publicwire-logo-1.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b5cd8af98bc9a5675389a00c26172261ac90bf04", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_0_.SvtRu8zomWdqOFy.X1er5xsxM.Bn4o3vK6TYAF2xGVMJQmC23CB01zT_yKUwkCaR4YU_bxPnmp5FJG.6Rrq9WduqwS9r2adFhjL.NsS6qoHXgYrF0z7h9jjk2u20Xku7TnGC5Q5IuLmuZT7hmHnSpAGGPNL.jWDUyrX8Fd6NMNfH5PCHas2gz7GagmYE3j6T4zN_plTg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "PublicWire", "published": "2018-06-06T19:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "SinglePoint Completes Commercial for Bitcoin Wallet Featuring Original Shark Tank Member Kevin Harrington and Provides Update on Form 10", "text": "Terra Tech Corp.

VanEck and SolidX Partners Inc. have filed a request to list a Bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Bloomberg reports June 6. VanEck is an NYC-based investment management firm with $38 bln under management and SolidX is a provider of blockchain software development and financial services. According to a report by Bloomberg, the request filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is for a fund that is physically-backed, meaning it will hold actual Bitcoins. The firms bringing the request say that this will protect against the loss or theft of the cryptocurrency. The SEC has held a strict attitude when it comes to ETFs (exchange-traded funds) involving cryptocurrencies, rejecting the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF last year and asking about a dozen applications to be withdrawn in January. SolidX CEO Daniel H. Gallancy said in a phone interview with Bloomberg that he thinks that “regulators are concerned right now about having an ETF that is available to retail investors,” and added that this attitude will change over time, “but right now a good place to start is with a product geared purely toward institutional investors.” If their request is approved, Bloomberg reports that the share price of the fund will be around $200,000 in order to target institutional investors — significantly higher than most ETFs which have traditionally focused on individual investors. The approval of a Bitcoin ETF is considered the holy grail of mainstream financial acceptance of cryptocurrency by some and major players like Huobi — the third largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume — are launching ETFs of their own. An approved Bitcoin ETF would function as an investment vehicle that tracks the value of the underlying asset (the price of Bitcoin, in this case) and could be traded during the working hours of a stock exchange, making investments into Bitcoin simpler and less risky for mainstream customers. ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : cointelegraph.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-and-cftc-take-opposing-views-on-whether-bitcoin-is-ready-for-mainstream-investors", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/third-largest-crypto-exchange-launches-crypto-based-exchange-traded-fund", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/will-etf-become-bitcoins-holy-grail", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-06/bitcoin-etf-dreams-kept-alive-with-new-solidx-vaneck-sec-filing", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/several-bitcoin-related-etf-proposals-withdrawn-at-secs-request", "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1668039/000110465918038369/a18-2298_1s1a.htm", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VanEck"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vaneck", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institutional players investment firm vaneck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "solidx partners inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T01:08:54.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8c38b4c5521275625887c0683afed11177e1c1b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_pozNQcN18.ysNq6GJLZolCKPfJDXDvzb_ihF8V3z8YiZPF7LkgYXIOyFrGi42ibxgwPl_MoYWs2_EzCNK1ZnM_ye8q0yBK7rvCO0ih7w2FS5rw--", "site_full": "instantpaydayloansfl.com", "site": "instantpaydayloansfl.com", "site_section": "http://instantpaydayloansfl.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Technology news | latest news about information technology & world IT", "title": "Van Eck, SolidX seek to launch bitcoin-linked ETF", "title_full": "Van Eck, SolidX seek to launch bitcoin-linked ETF", "published": "2018-06-06T19:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8c38b4c5521275625887c0683afed11177e1c1b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_pozNQcN18.ysNq6GJLZolCKPfJDXDvzb_ihF8V3z8YiZPF7LkgYXIOyFrGi42ibxgwPl_MoYWs2_EzCNK1ZnM_ye8q0yBK7rvCO0ih7w2FS5rw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Reuters: Technology News", "published": "2018-06-06T19:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Van Eck, SolidX seek to launch bitcoin-linked ETF", "text": "technologyNews Van Eck, SolidX seek to launch bitcoin-linked ETF (Reuters) - Asset manager Van Eck Securities Corp and blockchain company SolidX Partners Inc plan to launch a bitcoin-linked investment product that could be traded as easily as a stock, the two companies said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday.

No matter how you feel about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, you can’t deny their presence. Since exploding into the mainstream consciousness last year, millions have jumped onto the bandwagon. That should help boost GBTC, but in reality, nothing is ever simple in the blockchain.\nSure, everyone wants to enjoy wildly insane profitability. However, bitcoin remains a “wild west” asset class. For investors who have grown up with stocks and bonds, and whose idea of going crazy means options markets, bitcoin is the equivalent of dealing crack-cocaine. Thus, the GBTC should be a welcome investment. You get exposure to the cryptocurrencies without getting overly exposed.\nStill, GBTC meets significant resistance despite its traditional cred. An oft-repeated criticism is that the Bitcoin Investment Trust trades at a ridiculous 62% premium over bitcoin. At that point, why not just buy the cryptocurrency and call it a day?\nThe naysaying has even more weight when you look at the Ethereum Classi/SH (OTCMKTS: ETCG ). ETCG trades at over a 300% premium against each share’s net-asset value. Currently, ETCG also trades at a 223% premium over the actual ethereum classic cryptocurrency.\nAgain, the question is, why?\nIn late April, I offered my opinions as to why an investor would accept such a premium on GBTC. I focused on the most important aspect, which is protection. Log on to Alphabet Inc ’s (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Google search engine, and you’ll find several bitcoin rags-to-riches tales. But for every one of those, you’ll find horror stories.\nWhether it’s people forgetting their passwords and having zero access to their funds, or unfortunate souls accidentally throwing away millions of “physical” bitcoin, these cautionary tales remind us that protection shouldn’t be overlooked. The Other Side of GBTC Protection\nBut while we’re talking about this subject, it’s interesting to note that we’re almost always referencing the living. However, a critical component of financial planning is what we Americans euphemistically refer to as “life insurance.” In reality, we should call this concept, “making sure you don’t screw over your loved ones.”\nIndirectly speaking, GBTC is a form of life insurance. Laugh at me all you want. But barring unusual circumstances, you can typically bequeath your equity shares to loved ones as part of your estate planning. Assuming you have a last will and testament, and depending on your state’s estate laws, the process is straightforward.\nBut die with bitcoin, and you can leave a painful mess.\nThis was best illustrated in mid-April when banking heir Matthew Mellon died suddenly . The 54-year old was in Cancun, Mexico, intending to check in to a drug rehabilitation facility. Tragically, he never made it. Compare Brokers\nWhat really made this story stand out, though, is that Mellon was an early ripple proponent. Marketed as the cryptocurrency for the bankers, he put in $2 million during its initial stage. When ripple went bonkers earlier this year, the position was worth over $1 billion.\nHaving amassed such extraordinary wealth so quickly, Mellon understandably became paranoid. He bought an armored vehicle, got a security detail, and firmly established himself in the public eye. If anybody was going to attack him, they’d have to do it in front of witnesses.\nThe problem was that in his paranoia, Mellon utilized complex safety protocols to protect his cryptocurrency portfolio. That’s great if he’s alive. But when he’s gone, it may be next to impossible for his heirs to recover the funds.\nIf even a little bit of your crypto funds are diverted to GBTC, you can save your family heartache. Death Can Happen to Anyone\nAs you’re reading this story, the temptation is to ignore this as a high-profile case. After all, how many of us are banking heirs or ride around in armored vehicles?\nThese are fair points. However, you should also be aware that “ zombie coins ,” or cryptocurrencies that lay dormant seemingly indefinitely, have existed for years. Whether it’s through death or simply losing a password, these lost bitcoins are in financial purgatory.\nWe see them in the blockchain, but they’ll never record a transaction again. That right there is a sobering thought. Hopefully, now you can better sympathize with why GBTC has substantial market demand.\nBut the most important takeaway is that everyone reading this article will die. Where this certainty becomes unclear is the timing. It can happen tomorrow, or it can happen 50 years from now. But before this event, you can buy GBTC. Your family will thank you.\nAs of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long the cryptocurrencies mentioned above.\nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, https://investorplace.com/2018/06/how-the-bitcoin-investment-trust-is-a-life-or-death-play/.\n©2018 InvestorPlace Media, LLC", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11362827/The-625m-lost-forever-the-phenomenon-of-disappearing-Bitcoins.html", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2018/04/19/the-last-days-of-banking-heir-matthew-mellon/#3da076d55d52", "https://ethereumworldnews.com/500-million-in-ripple-xrp-possibly-lost-forever-after-billionaire-owner-dies-unexpectedly/", "https://www.ccn.com/the-ethereum-classic-investment-trust-etcg-is-trading-at-a-300-premium-over-its-nav/", "http://rdf.data-vocabulary.org/#", "http://bit.ly/2xMtTOt", "http://time.com/money/2850661/gift-stock-or-let-heirs-inherit/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin investment trust", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T20:09:19.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2fcd992c0e47eb26936f2d2bb7eafa7570020b9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQsnthDCSipynQWuIl9uvqjDFABifMoiL9YFrN3pd6.biz_Hg5IhTWQyXkrae21JDe3RS6Yv_6sMfWNVyfdCzPG", "site_full": "blog.bitmex.com", "site": "bitmex.com", "site_section": "http://bits.aihosting.com/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BTC News Aggregator", "title": "Money Launderers Use Property, not Bitcoin", "title_full": "Money Launderers Use Property, not Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-06T19:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2fcd992c0e47eb26936f2d2bb7eafa7570020b9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQsnthDCSipynQWuIl9uvqjDFABifMoiL9YFrN3pd6.biz_Hg5IhTWQyXkrae21JDe3RS6Yv_6sMfWNVyfdCzPG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T19:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Money Launderers Use Property, not Bitcoin", "text": "Arthur Hayes\n​For some, crypto-coins have a bad reputation: “it facilitates money laundering” is a common belief. Enlightened Hodlers retort that Bitcoin is a terrible way to launder money: it has a public ledger and relative illiquidity vs. the USD. While USD is the preferred method of account, which USD assets do money launderers favour? Pro-Tip: It ain’t Bitcoin.\nIn these modern times, washing $1 million of crisp cocaine-tainted Benjamins is no easy feat. If you walk up to a teller and attempt to deposit into a bank, they most likely will turn you away or call the police. You could call Saul in New York’s diamond district and attempt to wash it through precious stones; but, fencing those diamonds at close to par will prove difficult.\nGovernments always want more money parked in their jurisdictions. However, sometimes they have to play the coy mistress and profess their desire to stop terrorist financing (except for the Saudis). Below I will show that the property market is the preferred washing machine for the world’s unclean cash.\nI will take a look at the real estate purchase and holding disclosures in Hong Kong, where China launders its money, and the United States where the world launders its money. I will look at both through the lens of the Common Reporting Standard (CRS). We will step into the shoes of our average USD millionaire Zhou from China. How would he clean his cash, and keep the eye Xi from knowing where his loot is?\nChinese people are under no illusion about the rapacious nature of their government. While many have benefited handsomely over the past 30 years, one wrong political misstep could send them back to the countryside penniless. The complete lack of financial freedom means that Beijing, if it wants to, can completely bankrupt you on a whim with no due process.\nAmerica, the home of the free, decided that it needed to know where all the financial assets of its tax donkeys globally reside. They required any financial institution to report on the assets of any American. China and many other countries also thought this was a great idea. Hence, the Common Reporting Standard was born. The CRS allows member countries to share financial data between themselves. Under the CRS, China can call up Hong Kong and request information on any Chinese national.\nThere were two very interesting developments in the history of the CRS: America failed to ratify the CRS. Which means, for example, that America is not obliged to share financial data on Chinese people with assets in America with China. Things that make you go ‘Hmmmm…’ for $200, Alex – America wants all countries to follow FACTA and inform on Americans, but it won’t return the favour. I wonder where all those assets held by non-Americans will end up? Hong Kong exempted property from the assets deemed reportable.\nAs this SCMP article notes, Chinese people rushed to convert bank deposits into property. Property is one of the best generators of economic activity. Many jobs are created on the back of a property boom. From a policy perspective, anything a government can do to encourage an increase in the property stock will make it look like it knows how to run a successful economy.\nThat’s the date the country falls in line with the Common Reporting Standards, or CRS – a Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)-type regime developed in response to a G20 request, aimed at combating cross-border tax evasion and protecting the integrity of the international tax system. The Chinese government pledged to join in with CRS in 2014. Details on financial assets held by foreign individuals within mainland China will also start being collected. The agreement means information will be exchanged with tax authorities in 100 countries and regions from next year, including Hong Kong. The city has been considered a tax haven for many mainland investors, as there is no capital gains tax levied here. But now they are being forced to convert those financial investments into property, prior to the July deadline to avoid declaring any financial assets held abroad, to the Chinese authorities.\nWhen it comes to the US, the National Association of Realtors is hell-bent on property purchases being exempt from KYC / AML regulations. FinCEN recognised that property became a blatant cash washing machine in certain hot markets, and imposed some disclosure requirements in August 2017.\nSet to expire on February 23, 2017, FinCEN discovered that a significant portion of the reported covered transactions in the latest GTOs were linked to possible criminal activity by the individuals revealed to be the beneficial owners of the shell company purchasers. As a result, FinCEN is extending the current GTOs for an additional 180 days, until August 22, 2017, and may consider permanent data collection requirements later this year for more cities.\nThe GTOs require certain title companies to identify natural persons with a 25 percent or greater ownership interest in a legal entity purchasing residential real property without a bank loan or similar external financing in the following geographic areas meeting specific transaction thresholds: $500k and above – Bexar County, Texas $1m and above – Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties, Florida $1.5m and above – New York City Boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island $2m and above – San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara Counties, California $3m and above – New York City Borough of Manhattan\nThis is a step in the right direction to fight those evil money launders at the very high end of the market, but for your average Zhou with a few million big ones to stash, it is still business as usual.\nAmerica remains the favoured place to stash cash away from Beijing’s prying eyes, or, indeed, those of any other government bent on stemming capital flight. As long as someone stays below those investment limits, he or she can expect to have little difficulty obtaining a clean bank account and making a property purchase with cash.\nLet’s Try With Bitcoin\nIt is clearly easy to wash and hide a few million USD in the liquid property markets of Hong Kong and America. What about using the favourite monetary boogeyman, Bitcoin?\nAssume you want to move $1 million in cash into Bitcoin.\nThere are two options: either you can open an account on an exchange, or trade over-the-counter (OTC) with a dealer.\nAny exchange that can handle this sort of volume has a serious banking relationship. Their bank will require extensive KYC / AML checks on all accounts. If the purpose is to hide the flow of funds, this is suboptimal. Presented with a subpoena, the exchange will be obligated to present the customer details.\nIf you can’t use an exchange, perhaps an OTC dealer would trade with you. Unfortunately the large dealers also must follow KYC / AML regulations. They again have banking relationships to maintain.\nThe major liquidity sources are exchanges and compliant OTC dealers. There are dealers who will onboard a client without KYC checks; however, their spread vs. the market will be extremely aggressive. A 20%+ vig to clean your money, assuming they can handle your size, is to be expected.\nWashing money through the crypto capital markets is very difficult if you are unwilling to provide KYC information. Property is much easier, and vested interests from the government to the real estate brokers want you involved. They will do all they can to alleviate KYC / AML reporting requirements. Satoshi ain’t the biggest illegal finance enabler: no, it’s Uncle Sam.

Raj Kundra (Photo: Twitter)\n“I was summoned by the ED merely as a witness. An enquiry is underway by the concerned regulatory authorities and I stand committed to extend all my cooperation to the law enforcement agency,” Kundra said, clearing the air on the issue in a statement.\nA businessman with interest in sports, this is not Kundra’s first brush with law.\nIn the past, he had appeared before different authorities on his investments in the Rajasthan Royals IPL team.\nSome members of that team were also embroiled in the cricket spot-fixing scandal.\nIn his statement here vis-A-vis the media speculation of his grilling, Kundra said: “I am terribly disappointed by the irresponsible reporting carried out by some sections of the media. Clarity on the issue should have been sought before carrying such headlines.”\n“The authorities, summoned me merely as a witness, as the accused Amit Bharadwaj happens to be an acquaintance and some introductions were made hence there is a certain protocol being followed by the agencies,” said Kundra.\nHe added that Bharadwaj was intending to buy a team in his Poker League and had entered into a contract with them for the same.\n“However, he was expelled on account of non-payment of fees and I was called as a witness in this connection. While we continuously strive to keep taking steps to improve our reputation, these type of unconfirmed, baseless, reports severely dent our market perception and erode investor sentiments,” he said.\n“Notwithstanding what has happened, at Viaan Industries, we shall continue to focus on growing our gaming and media vertical. We remain excited about the company’s future and strive to keep adding shareholder value,” he said.\nIt may be recalled, the ED, sometime back, had registered a criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against a bitcoin-based investment website GainBitcoin, its founder Amit Bhardwaj and eight others.\nThe ED had alleged that about 8,000 investors lost around Rs 2,000 crore funds by transacting in this scheme.\nThe Pune police had later arrested Bhardwaj and his brother Vivek in the case.

That is today and if that trend holds true to form, it could be significant for the struggling digital currency.\n“A major reprieve just may be in the offing for the battered bitcoin bulls in the next 36 hours – if, that is, historical patterns repeat themselves,” reports CoinDesk . “Intriguingly, the cryptocurrency tends to take a significant change of direction on the sixth day of every month.”\nThe all-time high for bitcoin is around $20,000, which was seen in December 2017. In recent weeks, there have been plenty of calls for the cryptocurrency to return to those record highs and beyond. Still, bitcoin has some technical issues to deal with. A move below $7,000 could send bitcoin to $5,000. Bitcoin prices flirted with $7,600 on Tuesday.\nBitcoin does not lack for supporters as there have been plenty of bullish calls on the cryptocurrency in recent weeks. Some crypto market observers have opined bitcoin could reach new highs this year, but those are just projections. In financial markets, price matters and bitcoin’s price has rapidly eroded since the start of May. What’s In Store for Bitcoin This Month\n“Going by the historical pattern, the cryptocurrency seems likely to turn higher in the next 36 hours or so. In this case, bitcoin could revisit triangle (narrowing price range) resistance, currently located at $9,225,” according to CoinDesk. “On the other hand, long-term technical studies are biased to the bears, which was not the case on previous occasions.”\nOn a technical basis, bitcoin has its work cut out for it. The largest digital currency has been laboring below its 50-day moving average, indicating it will take a lot more than a solid June 6 th performance to get cryptocurrency back to bullish territory.\nSome chart watchers believe bitcoin needs to reclaim the $7,800 area before the bulls regain control.\nFor more information on the cryptocurrency market, visit our Bitcoin category .

I think it's plausible we could see $5-$10 this year. I still think however that after our next pump will have another massive swing down again. I don't think bitcoin will go away all at once. I see it fading into obscurity in a developing, larger, and more mature Crypto market. I don't see the market maturing to a point where we have a decrease in volatility. This will come after we have a parabolic climb in price for the whole market. One which I think personally will be led by banking liquidity flowing into XRP.
