Photo: BalticServers/Wikimedia It takes a lot of electricity to mine bitcoins, and as more miners try to cash in on the crypto craze, the amount of energy required to win new coins increases accordingly. New research suggests the entire bitcoin network could consume as much as 7.7 gigawatts of electricity by the end of this year—enough to power a country the size of Austria. But the new analysis is not without its critics, who say there are many other factors to consider.\nBy the end of this year, bitcoin could use half a percent of the world’s electric energy, according to research published today in the science journal Joule . What’s more, if bitcoin’s value rises as high as some experts predict , the network could eventually consume upwards of five percent of the world’s electricity.\nThat’s shocking, to say the least, if not completely absurd. If true, it means bitcoin in its current state is grossly inefficient, completely unsustainable, and an environmental menace. But as critics of the new study are quick to point out, the new paper is predicated on several shaky assumptions, insufficient evidence, and an eye towards the status quo in terms of how new technologies and regulations might alter the situation. The future of bitcoin, and all the alternate currencies vying crypto glory, has not been set in stone.\nBlockchain specialist Alex de Vries, the founder of the Digiconomist blog, a senior consultant at the Experience Center of PwC in the Netherlands, and the sole author of the new study, estimates that bitcoin currently requires about 2.55 gigawatts of electricity, and that a single transaction sucks up as much power as an average household during an entire month. By analyzing current trends in bitcoin mining production, and assuming an electricity price of five cents per kWh, de Vries predicts that bitcoin’s energy needs could reach 7.67 gigawatts later this year, placing it in the ballpark of countries such as Ireland (3.1 gigawatts) and Austria (8.2 gigawatts).\n“With the Bitcoin network processing just 200,000 transactions per day, this means that the average electricity consumed per transaction equals at least 300 kWh, and could exceed 900 kWh per transaction by the end of 2018,” writes de Vries in his paper, adding, “Bitcoin has a big problem, and it is growing fast.”\nAdvertisement\nThe mining problem Bitcoin requires such a tremendous amount of energy because it needs computers to time-stamp transactions along the blockchain—a publicly validated, network-powered ledger that makes cryptocurrency possible. The blockchain prevents duplicate spending of coins through a process known as “proof-of-work,” but it needs an army of computers to function.\n“The main problem is that the energy consumption primarily relates to how agreement on the underlying blockchain is reached,” de Vries told Gizmodo. “Mining makes it a big competitive lottery where the winner—every 10 minutes—gets to create the next block for the blockchain. The built-in reward for this process is fixed, so it motivates participants to constantly add new machines to the network to get a bigger slice of the pie—the more computational power the more you win.”\nAdvertisement\nCurrently, the prize for spawning the next block of transactions is 12.5 bitcoins , and 1,800 BTCs are generated each day. At the current rate of $8,190, that amounts to $102,381. That’s a lot of money by any measure, so it makes sense for bitcoin miners, armed with their fleets of computers, to participate in this modern day gold rush. But as more and more bitcoin miners appear on the scene, the demand for electricity increases accordingly.\n“Mining power is high and getting higher, thanks to a computational arms race, Roberto Frota Decourt, a cryptocurrency expert at the Unisinos Business School in Brazil who wasn’t involved in the new study, told Gizmodo. “The required number of zeros at the beginning of a hash is tweaked biweekly to adjust the difficulty of creating a block—and more zeros means more difficulty. The bitcoin algorithm adds these zeros in order to keep the rate at which blocks are added constant, at one new block every 10 minutes. The idea is to compensate for the mining hardware becoming more and more powerful.”\nBy “hash,” Decourt is referring to the output of a hash function—a specific algorithm used to map or simplify data. In the world of cryptocurrency, the hash rate is the speed at which a computer can complete an operation in the bitcoin code, so the higher the hash rate, the better chance a miner has of building the next block and receiving the bitcoin reward. But when the hashing gets harder, as Decourt points out, it takes more computations to create a block and thus more effort to earn new bitcoins, which are then added to circulation.\nAdvertisement\nThe bitcoin block mining reward gets cut in half every 210,000 blocks, so the next time this happens the reward will decrease from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC. Decourt likens bitcoin mining to a bingo game.\n“In the beginning there were few participants, so players won by completing a row. This was enough to give a block every 10 minutes and each participant won X Bitcoins per day,” he explained. But the number of participants is steadily increasing, so it became necessary to make the game more difficult, he said, and now a player wins by completing two rows. “But now each participant is winning X/2 bitcoins. And you have much more participants consuming energy to produce the same amount of bitcoins. This is why the energy consumption is increasing so much. More miners does not produce more bitcoins, but they consume more energy.”\nUsman Chohan, an economist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, also not involved in the new study, said developments in bitcoin mining is a lot like the changes seen in conventional mining.\nAdvertisement\n“In the old days, people had to go deep into dark, toxic mines just to pull out a few lumps of coal or gold,” Chohan told Gizmodo. “Today, enormous extractors just cleave the ground, but require much more electricity to do so.:\nIn the world of bitcoins, Chohan says that even a slight edge in terms of computational power can help miners secure a larger share of the distributed rewards, which is why there’s now a race to build ever more powerful—and thus energy-consuming—mining devices. It’s brutally inefficient, and that’s because the bitcoin network keeps making the calculations harder to solve, which means more and more power is required just to get the same rewards.\nAs noted, around 200,000 bitcoin transactions are processed each day, which means the ratio of hash calculations to processed transactions, as calculated by de Vries, is 8.7 quintillion to 1 at best.\nAdvertisement\n“This is an indication of the amount of frivolous processing power now being deployed to chase an increasingly prohibitive reward,” Chohan told Gizmodo.\nThe power of incentive Bitcoin is an energy hog because it needs a lot of computational power—and troves of electricity as a result—to run the hashing functions. But it’s hard to precisely measure how much electricity is actually being used. The new study is an attempt to provide some estimates around this unanswered, and increasingly important, question.\nAdvertisement\n“In essence I’m taking an economic point of view to figure out where energy consumption is heading. Previous work typically looked at available hardware, and produced results that only said something about the current consumption,” de Vries told Gizmodo. “My findings were based on the current conditions, so bitcoin doesn’t need to increase in value for the conclusion to hold.”\nUsing economic principles, and the underlying assumption that people don’t like to lose money, de Vries sought to determine the amount of electricity that will be used once it’s no longer profitable to mine for bitcoin. Eventually, an equilibrium point will be reached when hardware and energy costs will equal the value of the bitcoin being mined. To reach his figures, de Vries looked at the hard costs of bitcoin mining, which included production information from Bitmain, a secretive Chinese company and the largest manufacturer of mining machines.\nFor instance, Bitmain has a mining facility in the Mongolian desert (electricity is extremely cheap in China). Armed with 21,000 bitcoin mining machines, the vast majority of which are Antminer S9 computers, the facility has been rated at between 33.3 to 40 Megawatts. This represents less than one percent of the currently global network hash rate, but it’s from information like this that de Vries was able to estimate how much of a miner’s costs are due to hardware and electricity, and when the equilibrium point might be reached.\nAdvertisement\n“Ultimately this paper tells us that if bitcoin rewards miners with $X million dollars of coins mined per day, then miners are incentivized to spend up to $X million of dollars per day on...electricity, hardware, data center, labor, and so on.” Marc Bevand , a bitcoin investor and entrepreneur, told Gizmodo. “It’s not really a new finding. We knew this already.”\nSo Many Considerations Indeed, Bevand doesn’t think the new paper has much to offer, and that de Vries is likely overstating the situation. He says the half-a-percent estimate by the end of 2018 is plausible, but not likely, saying de Vries’ figures are inflated on account of two errors.\nAdvertisement\n“Firstly, his model assumes that manufacturers sell at cost and make zero profits, which allows miners to spend more on electricity. In reality we’ve seen Bitmain, the largest manufacturer, make billions of dollars over the last few years. No one expects them to make zero profits by the end of 2018,” Bevand told Gizmodo. “Secondly, de Vries makes the mistake of assuming that all cryptocurrency mining chips produced by TSMC [Taiwan Semi- conductor Manufacturing Company] on behalf of Bitmain end up in bitcoin mining machines. In reality many chips are fabricated for cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin. This altcoin sector is rapidly growing. It wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that bitcoin mining machines will represent less than half of Bitmain’s sales by the end of 2018.”\nAccording to Bevand’s own calculations, we should expect bitcoin to use 0.2 to 0.3 percent of the world’s electricity by the end of the 2018, which is about half of what’s predicted by de Vries.\n“A major limitation of de Vries’ model is that it depends on guessing bitcoin’s future price as well as the cost of electricity to miners,” adds Bevand. “In the paper he assumes bitcoin maintains its current level at approximately $8,000 and electricity costs $0.05 per kWh. If either bitcoin goes up or electricity costs plummet, the energy consumption should increase, and vice versa.”\nAdvertisement\nGame Changers There’s also the issue of competing cryptocurrencies to consider, also known as altcoins. Bitcoin utilizes a system known as proof-of-work, but there are at least two other increasingly common ways to build cryptocurrencies: proof-of-research and proof-of-stake . Less energy intensive coins could eventually nudge bitcoin off its lofty pedestal, or undermine its value at the very least.\nAnother problem with the paper, according to Decourt, is that de Vries’ projections don’t consider the evolution of technologies involved in mining. He points to advances in just two generations of Bitmain’s Antminer machines, showing a 250 percent improvement in equipment efficiency in just two years.\nAdvertisement\nHe also pointed to the work of Canadian entrepreneur Bruce Hardy, who found a way to recycle heat generated by mining equipment to produce vegetables and even fish . Perhaps ironically, the energy poured into cryptocurrency could eventually be channeled elsewhere, and not wasted frivolously.\n“The largest unstated assumption about the mining costs mentioned in this paper is regulatory, in that it assumes that Bitcoin will continue to remain largely legal.” And finally, there’s government intervention to consider.\n“The largest unstated assumption about the mining costs mentioned in this paper is regulatory, in that it assumes that bitcoin will continue to remain largely legal,” said Chohan. That said, he believes government interventions are unlikely to be effective in reducing or managing such power use, because the monitoring and oversight costs of such operations are likely to be high, and will likely involve substantial resources of time and personnel.\nAdvertisement\n“It is likelier that, through the ‘market pressures’ of high input costs (i.e. electricity), many of the current mining operations will be out-competed by the largest players,” he said. “In such a situation, detection of such operations will become easier as the players will be more concentrated.”\nMoving Crypto Forward This study claims to be the first rigorously peer-reviewed article quantifying Bitcoin’s energy requirements. But as de Vries himself admits, much of his analysis was based on incomplete information, as miners are hesitant to share information like hardware and electricity usage. If anything, the new study points to the inherent difficulties in quantifying realms like bitcoin, while highlighting the need to study this area more vigorously.\nAdvertisement\nLooking ahead, de Vries hopes that researchers will scrutinize and verify his results, and also collect better data. For that to happen, however, things will have to change.\n“A first step would be to require openness from these mining facilities,” said de Vries. “On an international level we should look at whether we can perhaps impose some sort of carbon tax or other measure on these facilities. I don’t think this can be solved locally, since miners will just move elsewhere.”\nDespite the limitations of the new study, however, it’s clear that bitcoin consumes a shocking amount of electricity. The number predicted by de Vries may be unrealistic, but even if it’s a quarter or even a tenth this much it’s still a horrendous amount of power—and the world needs to take notice. As our civilization struggles towards sustainability and a cleaner environment, it’s sad to think that a cryptocurrency could somehow get in the way. The estimate provided by de Vries may not be perfect, but it warrants a call to action; bitcoin is a beast that needs to be tamed.\nAdvertisement\n[ Joule ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2018.04.016", "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3131897&#39;,", "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3131232&#39;,", "http://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/bitcoin-mining-greenhouse-fish-farm-1.4470295&#39;,", "http://www.zorinaq.com/&#39;,", "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2018.04.016&#39;,", "http://fortune.com/2018/04/25/bitcoin-price-prediction-john-pfeffer/&#39;,", "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3131232", "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3131897", "http://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/&#39;,", "http://fortune.com/2018/04/25/bitcoin-price-prediction-john-pfeffer/", "https://digiconomist.net/", "http://www.zorinaq.com/", "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/bitcoin-mining-greenhouse-fish-farm-1.4470295", "https://digiconomist.net/&#39;,"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "astonishing amount of energy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T22:38:16.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e00d93c391dbb2f43f57034aa230cb02dfba6474", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTYGs7QS5_ImXXda3STuXbA-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "in 2020 wich one will be higher bitcoin or ethereum ?", "title_full": "in 2020 wich one will be higher bitcoin or ethereum ?", "published": "2018-05-16T13:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e00d93c391dbb2f43f57034aa230cb02dfba6474", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTYGs7QS5_ImXXda3STuXbA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "wowprolol", "published": "2018-05-16T13:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "in 2020 wich one will be higher bitcoin or ethereum ?", "text": "The confrontation of two coins, I am sure that bitcoin will always be more expensive than Ethereum .

Major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, and Cardano dropped in the 5 to 13 percent region, with Bitcoin Cash and EOS dropping 11 percent and 13.5 percent respectively.\nBitcoin Cash and EOS Traders have often described Bitcoin Cash investment as leveraged bitcoin trading because on both the upside and downside, Bitcoin Cash moves by larger margins. Throughout April, as the market continued to recover and bitcoin started to gain momentum in the $9,500 region, Bitcoin Cash experienced a 10 to 20 percent increase in value quite regularly.\nHowever, as the cryptocurrency market started to fall, Bitcoin Cash began to record losses with significantly larger margins in comparison to bitcoin and Ethereum. Today, on May 16, Bitcoin Cash fell by more than 6 percent against both bitcoin and Ethereum, which also fell by 5 percent.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) of Bitcoin Cash is at 50, signifying a neutral zone for BCH. If the RSI of BCH signifies an oversold condition, the price of BCH could bounce relatively quickly in the short-term but given that the RSI of BCH is neutral and both exponential and simple moving averages are demonstrating a negative short-term trend for BCH, it is likely that the price of BCH will continue to fall over the next 24 hours.\nOther cryptocurrencies and tokens that have performed strongly against the US dollar over the past month such as EOS and 0x (ZRX) have also slumped over the past week. EOS has dropped by more than 38 percent from its monthly peak in April against bitcoin.\nWithin a period of two weeks, the price of EOS declined from 0.0024 to 0.00149 BTC, by 38.17 percent. Considering that the price of EOS increased from 0.0009 to 0.0024 BTC from early April to April 29, the sudden drop in the price of EOS was unexpected.\nBut, the struggle of EOS, which has been able to secure strong momentum throughout April, demonstrates the current state of the market. Despite the initiation of the Blockchain Week in New York and the Consensus 2018 event, the cryptocurrency market is failing to rebound from its short-term losses.\nBitcoin to $50,000 On CNBC, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes stated that he sees the price of bitcoin reaching $50,000 by the end of 2018, despite the correction the market has seen from February to May.\nBitMEX, which supports margin trading, profits from both the downside and upside of bitcoin because traders can register short and long contracts.\n“If it goes up, if it goes down, if you have Bill Gates calling it a fraud … Short it, I don’t care.

We just match trades,” Hayes said, emphasizing that his prediction of bitcoin reaching $50,000 is objective as increase in the price of bitcoin does not impact the profitability of the exchange.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cardano", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin cash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T13:33:25.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "87e6c1eebdd1c021d45b4cbfe6964076d216fc12", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmc9cyyLa3L0kF9JpQ7TXHso-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "I never sold my First bitcoin.

The first hard fork splitting Bitcoin happened on 1 August 2017, resulting in the creation of Bitcoin Cash.\nBitcoin Gold is a free open source software project built by volunteer developers and supported by a rapidly growing community of Bitcoin enthusiasts. The purpose of Bitcoin Gold is to make mining decentralised again following Satoshi Nakamoto's vision of \"1 CPU = 1 vote\".\nLuno customers allege the company is keeping its users' Bitcoin Gold from the hard fork that happened at the end of last year.\n\"Even though they don't support it for their users, they can collect it for themselves which I assume will be millions of rands worth of their users' Bitcoin Gold,\" says one client. No profit\nResponding to the claims, Marius Reitz, Luno's South African country manager, said Luno is not making any profit from Bitcoin Gold but it is stored in the same storage system the company uses for Bitcoin.\n\"When a new version of Bitcoin gets created by forking from the main Bitcoin branch, those tokens are securely held by Luno. We do not use or sell them,\" Reitz said.\nAccording to Reitz, the Bitcoin Gold code is not currently in a sufficiently secure state and most reputable international platforms have also signalled to not support Bitcoin Gold.\n\"If a new fork is announced, we will observe its market adoption and provide a level of support accordingly. We have not seen a sufficient level of adoption for Bitcoin Gold and, therefore, have no plans to support it or enable withdrawals.\"\nHowever, one customer says the fact of the matter is Luno supported the Bitcoin Cash fork last year, which means it could have supported the Bitcoin Gold fork for users but instead kept it for itself even though it belongs to its users.\n\"How it works is if they held people's Bitcoins for them during the fork, they automatically get the Bitcoin Gold coins without having to do anything anyways. So they are deviously keeping all their users' Bitcoin Gold now and if word got out, their users would be very angry. Fact of the matter is there is billions worth in Bitcoin Gold that they have or that they have spent. Why should they decide or profit?\"\n\"Since we're getting inundated with queries about many proposed Bitcoin forks, we'd first like to repeat that our number one priority is keeping our customers' money, local and digital currency, safe,\" Reitz says. \"Many forks come with various security risks, which could result in the loss of funds.\n\"Secondly, we have a vision and a responsibility to make it safe and easy to buy, sell and learn about digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Most of these Bitcoin fork proposals don't add significant value to the ecosystem and generally just add complexity and confusion to the market.\" Unnecessary distractions\nReitz adds these are distractions that unnecessarily complicate the industry and divert limited resources such as engineering resources needed to add the ability to buy, sell, send, receive and store the new tokens; internal processes in storing and securing the tokens in hot and cold wallets, etc; design resources, adding more complexity to products; as well as community support resources needed in helping customers use, understand and fix issues related to each new token.\nLastly, he points out there are thousands of alternatives to Bitcoin, known as altcoins. Many of the proposed Bitcoin forks ultimately create just another altcoin with low or no value, he explains, adding that customers who want access to any of those new altcoin chains should move their Bitcoin to a compatible platform.\n\"We can't make any recommendations for these third-party platforms, but please do your research about the security of the new chain and stay clear from fraudsters. Note that you don't double your money during a fork. Just because you have some newly forked tokens, doesn't necessarily mean they will have any value, now or in the future.\" Admire Moyo ITWeb's business editor.\nAdmire Moyo is ITWeb's business editor.

The vast majority of Bitcoin transactions take place through centralized or centrally-managed exchanges or other types of “trusted third parties”.\nIn the opinion of the Bitcoin Atom team, this directly negates not only the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto, but even more importantly, it directly detracts from the power and potential of Bitcoin to be a truly revolutionary change that positively impacts, literally, billions of people, over time.\n實用相關搜尋: MBA Software", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://citicoins.com/fintrux-network", "https://hk.promotions.yahoo.com/ysm/combinedsearch/?fr=discuss&sp=discuss&type=home&p=MBA", "https://citicoins.com/bitcoin-atom", "https://hk.promotions.yahoo.com/ysm/combinedsearch/?fr=discuss&sp=discuss&type=home&p=Software"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T02:08:25.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8af584af3f37332ae97a5b40836ea348c8f7562b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf33gyBMBkaRdw9FIXrTeAM5TNdlokvrJmNbvH5yol_HGxMkPU5VJnI2g6aOJRnsOAxZl2DsZlOu9I", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "http://bits.aihosting.com/rss", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "BTC News Aggregator", "title": "Survey regarding bitcoin and Blockchain", "title_full": "Survey regarding bitcoin and Blockchain", "published": "2018-05-16T13:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.redditstatic.com/icon.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8af584af3f37332ae97a5b40836ea348c8f7562b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf33gyBMBkaRdw9FIXrTeAM5TNdlokvrJmNbvH5yol_HGxMkPU5VJnI2g6aOJRnsOAxZl2DsZlOu9I", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T13:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Survey regarding bitcoin and Blockchain", "text": "Community guidelines Do not use URL shortening services: always submit the real link.

Buy, sell & accept #bitcoin. Our investors include @DCGco @BoostVC @BankToTheFuture @FundersClub @BlumeVentures @MumbaiAngels. May 16 Peter Thiel on Bitcoin Peter Thiel on Bitcoin Peter Thiel, the founder of Paypal, a venture capitalist and a godfather to some sorts for Facebook, in an interview with the CNBC has spoken about his views of the world’s largest cryptoasset Bitcoin. According to him, he is betting on Bitcoin because it is the biggest of them all. “I would be long bitcoin, and neutral to skeptical of just about everything else at this point with a few possible exceptions,” Thiel says. However, he has scored a 50 to 80 percent chance that Bitcoin ends up being worthless. Also a 20 to 50 percent chance that it’s values goes even higher. Thiel has backed the idea that bitcoin could become a long-term storage asset rather than being a go-to asset. He believes that it is the online equivalent to gold. He also revealed that he does not believe in an entirely new payments system as according to him, Bitcoin does not qualify for such use. But for him, it is a hedge of sorts that remains while the whole financial system around the world is falling apart. Bitcoin has been working fine by dominating around 42 percent of the market capitalisation, followed by Ethereum with just 19 percent. On the notion of other cryptoassets beating Bitcoin in price, Thiel addressed the possibility of cryptos like Ethereum beating Bitcoin. “But, Bitcoin has a much greater appeal in its size. After all, gold continues to be gold as its the main asset class. Maybe it would be beaten by silver but it doesn’t look like happening.” Founders fund which is run by Thiel, bought $15 million to $20 million of cryptoasset in Bitcoin, which led to Bitcoin rising 9 percent inside 24 hrs of the purchase, earlier this January. Nonetheless, he still doesn’t encourage people to run out right away and buy cryptoassets. Yet, his optimism is restricted only to Bitcoin, not to all crypto-assets. In October 2016, at the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Thiel said he thinks people are underestimating the potential which Bitcoin holds in the financial market. He has been a long time supporter of Bitcoin, and believes in the speculation of Bitcoin become the digital-gold-safe haven. With a monster investment and the optimism that Peter Thiel has shown in Bitcoin, it is clear that he is a big fan of the cryptoasset and does see the benefits of investment. He said that Bitcoin is based on the “security of math” which makes it very hard to hack. Hence, it becomes harder to mine than gold which somehow increases its constrained nature. Although Bitcoin has faced criticism, statements from investors of the stature of Peter Thiel in favour of Bitcoin do represent the high gain opportunities around it. His statements of Bitcoin being the digital gold have surfaced the internet like a storm and inspired many investors to indulge themselves in the mainstream and liquidity of Bitcoin.

electronics HTC Corporation has announced its plans for the world's first ever native blockchain smartphone dedicated to providing consumers with high-end experiences while running decentralized applications (DApps).\nA Decentralized World in Your Pocket Called the HTC Exodus, the smartphone is slated to include a built-in secure hardware enclave and is aimed at \"helping underlying protocols expand their base of dedicated nodes, thus expanding the total blockchain ecosystem.\" Phil Chen, who has returned to HTC as the company's Decentralized Chief Officer, writes in a post on Medium :\nI want to see a world where the end consumers can truly own their data (browsing history, identity, assets, wallets, emails, messaging, etc) without the need for central authorities. There is a lot of work ahead of us, but I believe the mobile hardware layer can contribute significantly to our new decentralized world.\nMeet @HTCExodus – The World's First Native Blockchain Phone. Reserve yours now: https://t.co/mlCyN0ThQ7 #LetMyDataGo cc @VitalikButerin @starkness @edithyeung pic.twitter.com/MkDDTSGGMv\n— HTC Exodus (@htcexodus) May 15, 2018\nThe HTC Exodus will support underlying protocols, including Bitcoin , Lightning Networks, Ethereum, Dfinity, and others. According to Chen, the team is working to support the entire blockchain ecosystem and will, therefore, be announcing a whole slew of new partnerships in the coming months. \"Together, we want to craft the best blockchain & decentralized application experiences to end consumers,\" he stated.\nOf course, the phone will come with a built-in cryptocurrency wallet. More interestingly, each Exodus smartphone will purportedly act as a node for both the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. If successful, every phone would essentially expand the scope of both leading cryptocurrencies.\nKey members of the HTC Exodus team include Sean Moss-Pultz, Edith Yeung, Chris McCann, Elizabeth Stark, and Dominic Williams.\nCurrently, details regarding the price of the phone are scant. It is also unknown whether or not HTC will go all the way by allowing customers to purchase the phone with cryptocurrency .\nNevertheless, Chen hopes the new phone from HTC will open up the world of decentralized systems to a mainstream market. Stated the DCO:\nWe think that the phone can be an agent in the future for decentralization. We want you to hold your own key [through] a secure management method in our phones.\nWhat do you think of the HTC Exodus? Would such a phone pull you away from your iPhone or other models?

BTC/USD broke this week's ascending channel with support at $8,500 on the hourly chart (data feed from Kraken). The pair settled below a key support at $8,400 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Bitcoin price made a sharp U-turn from $8,800 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD is now trading well below $8,500 with a few bearish signs.\nBitcoin Price Analysis The past two days were mostly positive for bitcoin price above the $8,600 support against the US Dollar. However, the price failed to move above the $8,800 resistance area. Buyers struggled to place the price above $8,800, which resulted in a downside move. The price declined sharply and broke a couple of support levels such as $8,700, $8,600 and $8,400.\nThe decline was substantial as the price settled below a key support at $8,400 and the 100 hourly simple moving average . During the decline, BTC/USD broke this week's ascending channel with support at $8,500 on the hourly chart. The pair traded close to the $8,000 support level and a low was formed at $8,080. At the moment, the price is consolidating above $8,000s, with an initial resistance around the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $8,854 high to $8,080 low.

There is a lot of work ahead of us, but I believe the mobile hardware layer can contribute significantly to our new decentralized world.\nMeet @HTCExodus – The World's First Native Blockchain Phone. Reserve yours now: https://t.co/mlCyN0ThQ7 #LetMyDataGo cc @VitalikButerin @starkness @edithyeung pic.twitter.com/MkDDTSGGMv\n— HTC Exodus (@htcexodus) May 15, 2018\nThe HTC Exodus will support underlying protocols, including Bitcoin , Lightning Networks, Ethereum, Dfinity, and others. According to Chen, the team is working to support the entire blockchain ecosystem and will, therefore, be announcing a whole slew of new partnerships in the coming months. \"Together, we want to craft the best blockchain & decentralized application experiences to end consumers,\" he stated.\nOf course, the phone will come with a built-in cryptocurrency wallet. More interestingly, each Exodus smartphone will purportedly act as a node for both the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. If successful, every phone would essentially expand the scope of both leading cryptocurrencies.\nKey members of the HTC Exodus team include Sean Moss-Pultz, Edith Yeung, Chris McCann, Elizabeth Stark, and Dominic Williams.\nCurrently, details regarding the price of the phone are scant. It is also unknown whether or not HTC will go all the way by allowing customers to purchase the phone with cryptocurrency .\nNevertheless, Chen hopes the new phone from HTC will open up the world of decentralized systems to a mainstream market. Stated the DCO:\nWe think that the phone can be an agent in the future for decentralization. We want you to hold your own key [through] a secure management method in our phones.\nWhat do you think of the HTC Exodus? Would such a phone pull you away from your iPhone or other models?

However, the price failed to move above the $8,800 resistance area. Buyers struggled to place the price above $8,800, which resulted in a downside move.

However, this remains a rumour as many people have proclaimed themselves as the inventors of the famous digital currency.\nThe Bitcoin principle is quite simple. It is a new currency outside the banking system based on what is called the \"Block-chain\". The block-chain being metaphorically a chain of bicycle of which each link is a book of account which lists a great number of transactions.\nIn a classic banking scheme, transactions are collected in the bank's computer and validated by the bank. In the case of Bitcoin, transactions are validated by the block-chain which is distributed on a multitude of computers around the world that download and validate transactions from the block-chain. Namely that these computers generally belong to private individuals and are paid in Bitcoin for their work. These are called \"miners\". Therefore, the advantage of the block-chain lies in these computers whose system is very secure thanks to the many mathematical algorithms used. A transaction cannot be usurped.\nOn the other hand, the reliability of crypto-currencies has been called into question several times following computer bugs. Moreover, like any currency, Bitcoin is subject to speculation and is as likely to appreciate in value as to lose. Indeed, the Bitcoin having plummeted by more than 60% of its rate since the beginning of this year, worried investors are forsaking digital currencies to transform them into a more real and ancestral value such as Gold.\nFor example, Bunker Gold&Silver , a leading precious metals dealer based in Singapore, whose customers have turned away from crypto-currency in favour of physical gold. Investors fear and worry that the massive price appreciation is not sustainable. More and more people are realising that these digital assets have much higher levels of risk than traditional assets.\nThe advantage of gold is the fact that there is no password or digital wallet to lose, volatility is much lower, growth is historically sustainable and most importantly, you can hold your investment in your hands.\nIndeed, gold is considered as the safe investment because it has existed for 4 000 years against other currencies such as the US dollar which is the current world reference currency. For example, after a long period of stability between 1792 and 1971 (-100.00 USD on average), its price has soared to over 1,000.00 USD and is steadily increasing. Today, the gold price is approaching 1,400 USD/OZ.\nOne of the good reason to invest in Gold is for insurance against a financial meltdown, disintegration of fiat currency and or crypto-currency collapse. This is why many investors buy physical gold with their Bitcoin in the end.\n*This is a guest post\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T01:10:52.033+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5406cbebd2f708a9e4492218b2d4c80b14a1dece", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMo0e_6ONJm6lQspOio0wO00R.VKpGRgOMksa8wicvs8di2r3Md0.i1Ky.glzlV7V7EHbM28V7ofUA--", "site_full": "thefinance.sg", "site": "thefinance.sg", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/thefinancesg", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "TheFinance.sg", "title": "Bitcoin for Gold Exchange", "title_full": "Bitcoin for Gold Exchange", "published": "2018-05-16T12:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://thefinance.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img24.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5406cbebd2f708a9e4492218b2d4c80b14a1dece", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMo0e_6ONJm6lQspOio0wO00R.VKpGRgOMksa8wicvs8di2r3Md0.i1Ky.glzlV7V7EHbM28V7ofUA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "SG Young Investment", "published": "2018-05-16T12:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin for Gold Exchange", "text": "Posted by SG Young Investment | May 16, 2018 | Guest Post | 0 |\nAfter the craze for Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies, it would appear that the trend is currently in favour of Gold.\nIndeed, the collapse of crypto-currencies (loss of 70% of the total value of virtual currencies) in recent months and especially Bitcoin which fell below 7 000 USD, encourages investors anxious to preserve their capital to move towards precious metals.\nBut first of all, what is Bitcoin and what is its origin?\nBitcoin would have been invented by a Japanese named Satoshi NAKAMOTO in 2009.

Led by China-based mining outfit Bitmain, the round includes support from Accel, Blockchain Capital, Breyer, Digital Currency Group, General Catalyst, IDG, Pantera and Tusk Ventures.\nWith the funding, the company is also revealing an ambitious plan to bolster its products and services by launching a “US dollar coin,” or a blockchain native asset that would be both regulated and backed by real government currency, through its affiliate CENTRE project.\nIn this way, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire framed the round as one that helps it position itself as a true conglomerate of cryptocurrency services, as opposed to just an exchange or payment startup, both characterizations having been given to the company in the past.\nAllaire told CoinDesk:\n“A core part of vision is open-protocols that would enable the free movement of value. A real critical piece is there has to be open, interoperable standards for our how fiat money can move over blockchains. That’s where fiat stablecoins and payment protocols come into play.”\nMore than a technical novelty, Allaire positioned the stablecoin project as essential to Circle’s maturation and continued expansion, painting it as integral for its mobile payments application, its over-the-counter (OTC) trading business and its exchange service.\nThe launch also comes at a time when Silicon Valley investors have shown a preference for investments in such products, owing to the massive role stablecoins play in facilitating global cryptocurrency exchange and the perceived issues with today’s market leaders.\nIt’s this vision, Allaire said, that made Bitmain, the controversial cryptocurrency mining giant, a natural fit to lead the funding round.\nAs recently as March, Bitmain co-CEO Jihan Wu had made appearances at major U.S. conferences where he vowed to back high-tech alternatives to central banking.\n“Jihan is a visionary and he is a visionary for changing the global financial order,” Allaire said. “They believe in the long-term potential of Circle.”\nAll told, the funding will also help boost staffing at Circle, which today employs more than 200 employees globally in locations including Boston, San Francisco, Dublin, London, Paris, Madrid, Hong Kong, Beijing and Shenzhen. A new twist on stablecoins\nBut while Circle’s funding round and valuation are likely to grab a majority of headlines, it’s perhaps its launch of a US dollar cryptocurrency initiative with participation from Bitmain that may most impact the crypto market.\nAs noted by Allaire, the play is a strategic one that finds Circle taking aim at one of the most important elements of the crypto economy.\n“It’s a big piece, as we acquired Poloniex and Poloniex was a crypto-only exchange,” Allaire explained. “The way people have handled fiat on an exchange like that has been through something like Tether, and we see a lot of weaknesses and challenges with Tether.”\nIndeed, Allaire isn’t alone, as many commentators have sought to position Tether as a systemic weakness that, through its affiliation with the troubled exchange provider Bitfinex, a company that has struggled with regulatory issues, threatens the integrity of the market.\nYet, it’s important to note that Circle will be seeking to take an open approach to its USD-C token, framing it as an open-source project with a more robust governance model.\nThe vision is that regulated financial institutions, whether they’re a crypto exchange or a money transmitter, would be authorized by CENTRE to become issuers of stablecoins, and that many issuers could offer and manage different fiat-backed cryptocurrencies.\n“Circle can be an issuer of US dollar coin, Square could be an issuer. If I got US dollar coins from Circle, I could transmit those to another digital wallet for an issuer,” he explained. A foundation for payments\nBut if all the conversation about exchanges and crypto-plumbing lead to perceptions that Circle is straying from its more consumer-focused products, Allaire was quick to push back.\nRather, Allaire suggested that bolstering the exchange and fiat cryptocurrency ecosystems globally only strengthens products like its original mobile money application, enabling that product to work more effectively at scale in accordance with its original vision.\n“To realize the vision for ubiquitous payments, we need there to be currencies that can be stored, settled and used,” Allaire continued.\nWith the funding, the company is also publishing a new white paper on its stablecoin work, as well as an FAQ that will seek to educate others on they can engage in this new market Circle hopes to steward.\nOf note in these materials is that all USD-C tokens will be issued on ethereum, a notable detail given the platform’s issues in scaling to support its current diversity of users. (The company said more announcements on the project are expected this summer).\nStill, the overall message was that this is an effort to bring an opaque offshore market back into the regulated cryptocurrency economy, as Allaire said CENTRE will require members to undergo compliance and balance sheet audits to ensure assets are properly backed.\nIn this way, Allaire summed up his message succinctly, dismissing existing market alternatives as nothing more than clever “regulatory hacks.”\nHe concluded:\n“The CENTRE model is out in the open in a regulated context with real banking connectivity and that’s really based on an open standard.”\nCircle image via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

A Decentralized World in Your Pocket\nCalled the HTC Exodus, the smartphone is slated to include a built-in secure hardware enclave and is aimed at “helping underlying protocols expand their base of dedicated nodes, thus expanding the total blockchain ecosystem.” Phil Chen, who has returned to HTC as the company’s Decentralized Chief Officer, writes in a post on Medium :\nI want to see a world where the end consumers can truly own their data (browsing history, identity, assets, wallets, emails, messaging, etc) without the need for central authorities. There is a lot of work ahead of us, but I believe the mobile hardware layer can contribute significantly to our new decentralized world.\n— HTC Exodus (@htcexodus) May 15, 2018\nThe HTC Exodus will support underlying protocols, including Bitcoin , Lightning Networks, Ethereum, Dfinity, and others. According to Chen, the team is working to support the entire blockchain ecosystem and will, therefore, be announcing a whole slew of new partnerships in the coming months. “Together, we want to craft the best blockchain & decentralized application experiences to end consumers,” he stated.\nOf course, the phone will come with a built-in cryptocurrency wallet. More interestingly, each Exodus smartphone will purportedly act as a node for both the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. If successful, every phone would essentially expand the scope of both leading cryptocurrencies.\nKey members of the HTC Exodus team include Sean Moss-Pultz, Edith Yeung, Chris McCann, Elizabeth Stark, and Dominic Williams.\nCurrently, details regarding the price of the phone are scant. It is also unknown whether or not HTC will go all the way by allowing customers to purchase the phone with cryptocurrency .\nNevertheless, Chen hopes the new phone from HTC will open up the world of decentralized systems to a mainstream market. Stated the DCO:\nWe think that the phone can be an agent in the future for decentralization. We want you to hold your own key [through] a secure management method in our phones.\nWhat do you think of the HTC Exodus? Would such a phone pull you away from your iPhone or other models?

This New App Can Show Bitcoin Transactions Without Internet This New App Can Show Bitcoin Transactions Without Internet May 16, 2018 Now you can deal with your bitcoin transactions offline. Yes! You got it right. Samourai Bitcoin wallet and goTenna, decentralized communications startup is launching an app which is active without internet connection.\nThe goTenna, NewYork based startup was found in 2012 by Jorge Perdomo and Daniela. The startup is pairing up with Samourai Wallet to launch an android app that can be used for transactions without internet.\nIt doesn’t seem to be too easy, one need to have device called goTenna mesh that costs $179. The txTenna app will allows users to sync their mobile with goTenna device. Later, using UHF frequencies, allows you to transact offline and send bitcoin with cellular data. Richard Myers goTenna engineer said:\n“You need to be able to spend your bitcoin even in disaster areas. As long as you have a way to charge your phone, you can be up and meshed and communicating”.\nAs such, on Samourai Wallet users have to create a standard bitcoin transaction offline. However, the information of transaction is passed on to txTenna app through paired goTenna mesh device that broadcasts it to nearby mesh nodes. Therefore, every transaction depends on information of transactions until it is running the txTenna app and also connected to data. Since, till the last device syncs with a phone, it will send your transaction info through to the Bitcoin network.\nOn the consideration, if you’re in remote area, you need intermediary mesh devices between you and another goTenna gizmo that’s have cellular data connectivity. Myers adds:\n“It offers an alternative that is more censorship-resistant. It’s going to obscure who you are and where you’re at when making these transactions. So that’s a big privacy advantage there”.\nHowever, the process uses a free and unlicensed radio frequency. Besides, its not the first partnership to explore such potential for crypto systems.\nMost significantly, the crypto wallet will be an open source project on txTenna aspect. Certainly, goTenna’s tram was first inspired by the Samourai’s Wallet open source communication tools on Github, as to come up with bitcoin startup. Richard Myers explains:\n“It absolutely could work with any software wallet and they [Samourai Wallet developers] are not writing it specifically for the Samourai wallet anyway. It will be something any wallet provider could send transactions through”.\nOn top, the app requires massive adoption for the mesh network to make it effective.

A Decentralized World in Your Pocket\nCalled the HTC Exodus, the smartphone is slated to include a built-in secure hardware enclave and is aimed at “helping underlying protocols expand their base of dedicated nodes, thus expanding the total blockchain ecosystem.” Phil Chen, who has returned to HTC as the company’s Decentralized Chief Officer, writes in a post on Medium :\nI want to see a world where the end consumers can truly own their data (browsing history, identity, assets, wallets, emails, messaging, etc) without the need for central authorities. There is a lot of work ahead of us, but I believe the mobile hardware layer can contribute significantly to our new decentralized world.\n— HTC Exodus (@htcexodus) May 15, 2018\nThe HTC Exodus will support underlying protocols, including Bitcoin , Lightning Networks, Ethereum, Dfinity, and others. According to Chen, the team is working to support the entire blockchain ecosystem and will, therefore, be announcing a whole slew of new partnerships in the coming months. “Together, we want to craft the best blockchain & decentralized application experiences to end consumers,” he stated.\nOf course, the phone will come with a built-in cryptocurrency wallet. More interestingly, each Exodus smartphone will purportedly act as a node for both the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. If successful, every phone would essentially expand the scope of both leading cryptocurrencies.\nKey members of the HTC Exodus team include Sean Moss-Pultz, Edith Yeung, Chris McCann, Elizabeth Stark, and Dominic Williams.\nCurrently, details regarding the price of the phone are scant. It is also unknown whether or not HTC will go all the way by allowing customers to purchase the phone with cryptocurrency .\nNevertheless, Chen hopes the new phone from HTC will open up the world of decentralized systems to a mainstream market. Stated the DCO:\nWe think that the phone can be an agent in the future for decentralization. We want you to hold your own key [through] a secure management method in our phones.\nWhat do you think of the HTC Exodus? Would such a phone pull you away from your iPhone or other models?

The industries covered by blockchain include medical care, Internet of things, and supply chain management, cyber security, education, games, polling elections, car home assets leasing, etc. Even the third-ranked ripple is also committed to the development of the financial industry. Recently, I discovered that a blockchain technology involving human health has received a lot of people's favor. That is Lympo.\nThe lympo ecosystem solves the problem of interconnecting health data. With user-generated and user-controlled exercise and health data support, Lympo will allow the exchange of value by trading lym public tokens. Lympo's goal is to enable all industry stakeholders to effectively use motion data in the ecosystem and everyone can receive fair rewards.\nThe Lympo system digital fitness wallet and user rewards are the core of the Lympo system. The wallet function serves as an entrance to the ecosystem, allowing users to receive rewards in the LYM logo for their healthy lifestyle achievements. Lympo is eager to bring revolutionary changes to a healthy lifestyle ecosystem and reward users with monetization of sports and health data through blockchains.\nIn 2018, the lympo price has been steadily rising. It has to be said that it is an extremely wise choice for lympo to seek development industries related to human health. After all, it is an era that is very health-conscious. In addition, the participation of the famous tennis player Wozniacki boosted the development of Lympo in this domain. According to reports, Wozniacki is the first female athlete to endorse the blockchain product. Lympo uses blockchain technology to award tokens to users who set and achieve fitness, running, and swimming goals, while tokens can be used to purchase more health products and services.\nI am personally optimistic about lympo, first because of the industry outlook it involved.

After an unsuccessful test of it, a slight correction is developing, but the downward movement potential still maintains. The breakdown of the level 8125.00 will let Bitcoin fall to the area of 7812.50 (Murray [1/8])–7500.00 (Murray [0/8]). 7500.00 is a strong support level, where the reversal and the formation of the upward trend are possible.

While the digital coin experienced a drop in the afternoon, it managed to cap its losses and successfully defended the $8,500 mark. Bitcoin finished the session at $8,510.38, down from its opening level of $8,705.19.\nThe Bitcoin price experienced another decline in the early hours of today’s trading, falling to an intraday low of $8,175.49. This was the cryptocurrency’s lowest price level since April 19, data from digital currency tracker Coinmarketcap shows. The coin has since edged higher and its price is currently hovering around $8,260.\nBitcoin’s recent performance has been consistent with a strong downtrend affecting the wider cryptocurrency market. Most digital coins in the top 100 have suffered heavy losses in the past 24 hours. Major cryptocurrencies such as EOS, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Cardano (ADA) and Stellar (XLM) are posting double-digit percentage losses for that period.\nEarlier this week, Microsoft’s online search platform Bing announced that, starting June, it was banning advertising for cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency related products, and un-regulated binary options.\n“Because cryptocurrency and related products are not regulated, we have found them to present a possible elevated risk to our users with the potential for bad actors to participate in predatory behaviors, or otherwise scam consumers,” Melissa Alsoszatai-Petheo, advertiser policy manager at Bing, wrote in a blog post on Monday.\nOther tech companies, including Google, Facebook and Twitter, have made similar changes to their advertising policies this year. These moves contributed to the sharp drop the cryptocurrency market experienced in the first quarter. It is unclear whether Bing’s announcement has had a similar negative effect on the market.\nIn today’s trading, the Bitcoin price stood at $8,263.37, as of 09:36 BST. The cryptocurrency has lost 5.5% in the past 24 hours.\nFor further information on how to buy and trade Bitcoin, see our comprehensive Bitcoin guide.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/post/may-2018/bing-ads-to-disallow-cryptocurrency-advertising?feed=blogposts"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dimitar bogdanov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T20:41:50.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f21df341940f1c79de7898b1c651a293977300fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCrdQxGNHgQCsAf42xCDciQRb63.yKjOPx6kNlUE_dBjtw--", "site_full": "blog.explodingads.com", "site": "explodingads.com", "site_section": "http://blog.explodingads.com/?feed=rss2", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Exploding Ads", "title": "1 – Man who claims he created Bitcoin committed perjury, lawsuit says", "title_full": "1 – Man who claims he created Bitcoin committed perjury, lawsuit says", "published": "2018-05-16T11:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f21df341940f1c79de7898b1c651a293977300fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCrdQxGNHgQCsAf42xCDciQRb63.yKjOPx6kNlUE_dBjtw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tyler Durden", "published": "2018-05-16T11:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "1 – Man who claims he created Bitcoin committed perjury, lawsuit says", "text": "1 – Man who claims he created Bitcoin committed perjury, lawsuit says May 16, 2018 Your email address will not be published.

As I write this Bitcoin is selling to $8,000.\nMy calls are based on a valuation model that I post every day to subscribers on my Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/SpeculatorSeth\nThe valuation model is extremely predictive of tops and bottoms. I honestly didn't believe it myself, but since I created the model it has successfully predicted four major pivots on the daily charts. The incredible success has led me to call my model \"the golden goose\". I was planning on posting a victory tour of sorts once it was clear to everyone that we are in a down trend. I really wanted to rub it in everyone's faces. However, I did not expect such quick flushes lower. At this point it is hard for me to find any joy in being right.\nMy model is currently projecting the bottom at around $3,000. This move may take up to 6 months to occur, but it may be faster as someone big is definitely panic selling. Think of my targets as Bollinger Bands that adjust as we get closer to them. So we will have to watch the lower band as we continue to drop. It could be a little lower, and it could be a little higher. It all depends on the transactions on the blockchain.\nWhy am I posting this? As you can probably guess I do use the money I get from sharing the indicator to invest back into Bitcoin. It's unfortunate that I discovered the model when it was already too late to catch last year's bull, but I have made money from the bounce we got between $6,000 and $10,000. You better bet I'm saving up so I have a big wad of cash to throw at this when my indicator says we're oversold again. I also feel a responsibility to warn people. I've had traders tell me that my call saved them thousands of dollars. Maybe I don't make money from that, but I think it's worth it.\nBut there is a larger trade here as well. Bitcoin's value depends on the transactions happening on the block chain. If there isn't enough money being transacted on the chain to back up the current value then a crash becomes inevitable. There simply isn't enough buyers to sustain it. It is the transactions that gives Bitcoin value. With that knowledge the market can invest based on fundamental information instead of just pure speculation. That means that some day we won't get these bubbles and brutal bear markets. Instead price will move based on economic cycles, and how those cycles affect the amount of money transacted on the blockchain. Such stability makes Bitcoin more valuable, and ultimately increases the value of my own investment.\nIf you want to follow the model day by day subscribe to the patreon. Hopefully next time I make a post like this it will be after better markets.\n submitted by /u/SethEllis\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.patreon.com/SpeculatorSeth"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T07:21:23.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb92d37a2eac3de1ab1b08809e361e083d7fa6e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTHYWoefGMsEE785EoiYmuwyUMaClYaOIZnAds.L6I6aUxAB6OM9NCHJBtWQCQ2u1YLo6EoJ5od0Ei0e35smrz5ZQP.vsQC_kzJ_kLmC5d1.GqrgltQBH9KN5sPukUjtKYVNe9cTsO3ypCjYV_jmg2s", "site_full": "code4ppl.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://code4ppl.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The Cash Consortium Launches Open Standard Initiative for Bitcoin Cash", "title": "The Cash Consortium Launches Open Standard Initiative for Bitcoin Cash", "title_full": "The Cash Consortium Launches Open Standard Initiative for Bitcoin Cash", "published": "2018-05-16T11:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb92d37a2eac3de1ab1b08809e361e083d7fa6e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTHYWoefGMsEE785EoiYmuwyUMaClYaOIZnAds.L6I6aUxAB6OM9NCHJBtWQCQ2u1YLo6EoJ5od0Ei0e35smrz5ZQP.vsQC_kzJ_kLmC5d1.GqrgltQBH9KN5sPukUjtKYVNe9cTsO3ypCjYV_jmg2s", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "code4ppl", "published": "2018-05-16T11:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Cash Consortium Launches Open Standard Initiative for Bitcoin Cash", "text": "This week a Bitcoin Cash organization was founded called the Cash Consortium (C2) that aims to be a technical group framed off of the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) open standards. C2 is an international community that intends to bolster open standard development in order to provide long-term Bitcoin Cash growth.\nThe Cash Consortium: Open Standards for Bitcoin Cash Much of the cryptocurrency community understands what open source or open standard development is, and most of them embrace the idea. Furthermore, organizations like the W3C and other believers of open standards welcome the sharing of open sourced code that allows anyone the rights to study, change, and distribute OSS protocol for any purpose. Open standards also allows other developers to review a protocol’s design in order to prevent flaws and bugs within the software by coming up with sets of development standards that everyone agrees to and uses. The Cash Consortium will have engineers from leading companies to work together to build Bitcoin Cash (BCH) development standards much like how developers build on the open web with shared concepts like HTML.\n“The C2’s mission is to lead Bitcoin Cash to its full potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the blockchain,” explains the C2 website.\nBitcoin Cash is the soundest money the world has ever known. It has scarcity, fungibility, divisibility, durability and transferability. It’s our intention that it remain the soundest money the world has ever known — Bitcoin Cash enables smart contracts/property, colored coins, tokens, ICOs and much more. We intend to standardize these emerging technologies in a way that plays to Bitcoin Cash’s strengths.\nA Formal Bitcoin Standards Body At the moment organizations that are listed as members of C2 include Cointext , Atlantis Labs, Akari Global Foundation, the Bitcoin Cash Fund , Bitbox, Blockpress , Centbee, and the social network Yours . Last night news.Bitcoin.com spoke with the creator of the Cash Consortium, Carlos Cardona , who is also the lead developer of Bitbox , the open source development toolkit for Bitcoin Cash. Cardona tells us he is a firm believer in open standards and explains why he initiated the C2 organization.\n“When I was in college I was a member of the W3C’s HTML5 Working Group. There were engineers from Apple, Google (who I was with), Microsoft, Firefox and many more meeting up regularly in working groups to flesh out the next generation of technical specs for the web (HTML/CSS etc),” Cardona tells news.Bitcoin.com . “When the spec was nearing completion the teams would each implement it. Some open source like Firefox. Some closed source like Internet Explorer. But both implementing technical specs which were created together.”\nWhen I joined the blockchain space several years ago it surprised me that there was no formal Bitcoin standards body.\nThe Cash Consortium will affirm and adhere to the Principles in support of The Modern Paradigm for Standards —cooperation, due process, broad consensus, transparency, balance, and openness. Huge Forces at Play Are About to Phase the Blockchain Industry Then Cardona says he started thinking about the upcoming Bitcoin Cash upgrade that will not only increase the block size by 4X but the fork will also add Satoshi OP_Codes that can enable the ability to create color coins and smart contract features on the BCH network.\n“With the new OP_Codes coming I had recently been thinking again about how to best standardize on new transaction types and then Memo/Blockpress happened,” Cardona emphasizes. “Having recently updated Bitbox’s block explorer to support both Memo and Blockpress I was struck with the same feeling I had during IE6/FF days — writing code twice with slightly different APIs because there was no standard. With OP_RETURN going from 80 bytes to 220 bytes we’re just seeing the start of OP_RETURN prefixed protocols — That got me thinking again about a standards body.”\nIn my opinion our industry spent many years fighting the Blockstream wars and became complacent — Things which I would expect in any other nearly decade old tech industry (such as a tech consortium) doesn’t exist in our space. The final part which caused me to move on it was when I found out Zuckerberg created a blockchain division last week. To me that is just a sign that HUGE forces are at play which are about to phase shift our entire industry.\nCardona Believes the Opportunity to Move Quick and be Proactive is Now The C2 website explains that if you work with a company that develops with Bitcoin Cash then they can feel free to fork this repo or reach out to Cardona to see how you can get involved.\n“I believe we have the opportunity to move quick, be proactive, build bridges and standardize or some much larger player will step in an do it for us,” Cardona adds.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cash consortium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "standard initiative for bitcoin cash this week a bitcoin cash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "w3c", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oss", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T11:37:21.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c0dab681162dba6e740f36a71a66b2a0048e2dff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOo5RFP8QS.zhH5B1lTN1VOyUuz32lMWb_dRcDwHDBrRF9AoD0j0UeqARoNZiLkLG94TyALuOSjwA2IYT.5iwRocgDOrdO0p8TIMtwd1jWbxa4dLrqhe2nrbmW0XAv7T6MMQfNl4zsyR9Q--", "site_full": "sgtalk.org", "site": "sgtalk.org", "site_section": "http://sgtalk.org/mybb/syndication.php?type=atom1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "SG Talk - All Forums", "title": "Square Cash app is growing faster than Venmo, getting a boost from bitcoin, an*l", "title_full": "Square Cash app is growing faster than Venmo, getting a boost from bitcoin, an*l", "published": "2018-05-16T11:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c0dab681162dba6e740f36a71a66b2a0048e2dff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOo5RFP8QS.zhH5B1lTN1VOyUuz32lMWb_dRcDwHDBrRF9AoD0j0UeqARoNZiLkLG94TyALuOSjwA2IYT.5iwRocgDOrdO0p8TIMtwd1jWbxa4dLrqhe2nrbmW0XAv7T6MMQfNl4zsyR9Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T11:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Square Cash app is growing faster than Venmo, getting a boost from bitcoin, an*l", "text": "Square Cash is growing faster than PayPals Venmo as more people turn to the software to trade cryptocurrency bitcoin, according to Nomura Instinet.

Why you'll hear more about it By John Gallagher, Detroit Free Press May 16, 2018 Save\nBack before Detroit began to get its act together, the city's property records were a mess. With thousands of parcels in the city vacant, abandoned, foreclosed and often subject to mortgage or title fraud, it could prove frustrating, if not impossible, to even discover who owned a property.\nA new technology called blockchain, best known as the underlying architecture for the digital currency bitcoin, can solve problems like messy land titles, plus a lot more. Industries from banking to the automotive world have been taking notice.\nLast week, General Motors and Ford joined BMW and Renault and other firms to create the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative (or MOBI) to explore how this new technology could operate in the automotive world. Banks are also paying attention; so are many other industries.\nBut the technology for blockchain is so new (about 10 years old at this point) and so little understood by the public that it's worthwhile to take a few moments to understand it. And so:\nWhat is it?\nA blockchain is a digital network for transactions that eliminates the need for a middleman or central regulator like a bank or a government. Parties to the network create records of their transactions that, once entered in the digital \"ledger,\" cannot be altered or changed without the approval of the broader network.\nTo use a simple example, say Mary lends John a sum of money. A year from now John plans to repay the loan, but disagrees with Mary on the amount. Each one kept a record of the loan but each disputes the other's paperwork.\nA blockchain, however, would record the amount of the original transaction - the amount of the debt - and this entry in the \"ledger\" would remain there for both to see. And because of the complex nature of the blockchain's design, in which all parties to the network, not just Mary or John, must agree on changes to the stored data, the ledger is essentially unhackable.\nAs the Economist magazine put it a few years ago: \"The blockchain lets people who have no particular confidence in each other collaborate without having to go through a neutral central authority. Simply put, it is a machine for creating trust.\"\nThe term itself derives from \"block\" - the term for a batch of data in the system - and \"chain,\" meaning the broader network.\nHow does it work?\nThe blockchain is a digital network maintained not by a single command-and-control site but is open to all and maintained by users. Thus no one entity controls it, and there is no one central computer that manages it.\nThe blockchain is rather like the internet itself - a vast network in which millions of users interact freely. But because of its unique architecture, in which multiple points of the system must confirm the validity of any transaction or changes, the blockchain ledger of transactions is seen as immune to bad actors trying to hack it.\nWhat would we use it for?\nKeeping honest land records would be one use. Once a property sale is entered into the digital ledger, it would represent a true record of ownership. Events like mortgage fraud and tax foreclosure would no longer muddy the record. Some nations are already exploring how to use blockchain in this way.\nBeyond that, any transaction that requires an honest record and trust on the part of all parties could benefit from blockchain technology.\nWhat about automotive uses?\nOnce automakers start giving each vehicle a digital identity when it comes off the line, blockchain would allow the collection of data on vehicle use, location, maintenance records and much more. All that data, collected and safely stored in the blockchain ledger, could be used to offer new services to consumers.\nSome have even suggested that the self-driving cars of the future may be self-owned, using blockchain technology to record the fees consumers pay for a lift and using that stored cash to buy gas or pay for repairs.\nIsn't this all rather SciFi stuff?\nNo question blockchain remains in the early stages of development. Some think the technology is overhyped. Among other challenges, it tends to be slower than more conventional means of handling transactions.\nAnd the use of blockchain as the underlying technology for bitcoin - the digital currency said to be favored by money launderers and drug cartels - hasn't helped its reputation.\nBut the promise of a tamper-proof recordkeeping system immune to digital attacks or fraud creates a powerful motive to explore blockchain's possibilities.\nChances are consumers won't need to worry about mastering yet another new technology anytime soon. But bankers, automakers, tech firms and other high-level players who design the world in which we live are paying serious attention.\nVisit the Detroit Free Press at www.freep.com Love", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "detroit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T13:03:30.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bd117aebb4b11abd16987b249e7ecbf7f28f8573", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXJ_.kqueFPjQ.OpUUtzgUM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=5.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Marketplace", "title": "Bitcoin - new Business Opportunities", "title_full": "Bitcoin - new Business Opportunities", "published": "2018-05-16T11:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.01, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bd117aebb4b11abd16987b249e7ecbf7f28f8573", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXJ_.kqueFPjQ.OpUUtzgUM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Blue Bell", "published": "2018-05-16T11:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin - new Business Opportunities", "text": "There are many great opportunities that Bitcoins has provided in last few years.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T09:55:34.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2a953f919a97ee64cc61947e657b7d9166c0aea4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSdtP3LHb6wXgwpyr_hW5jDauFPCKoxRiqfwJoSWTYK4BvAgKx.LegEkyXSvsrO3ZC2.YGCcMRc8l_napWGwwdnQhQ7WMUa_y3By6uk9I3Gh25JgV4ose7dePwcXVKTu.JyKfisOGXkzkjThm.QFVS8iab7jU75BX5_FTBX9jNQA--", "site_full": "www.thepaypers.com", "site": "thepaypers.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/thepaypers/cfKW", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Paypers Headlines", "title": "LedgerX platform upgrades Bitcoin trading options", "title_full": "LedgerX platform upgrades Bitcoin trading options", "published": "2018-05-16T11:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.thepaypers.com/images/linkedin-share.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2a953f919a97ee64cc61947e657b7d9166c0aea4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSdtP3LHb6wXgwpyr_hW5jDauFPCKoxRiqfwJoSWTYK4BvAgKx.LegEkyXSvsrO3ZC2.YGCcMRc8l_napWGwwdnQhQ7WMUa_y3By6uk9I3Gh25JgV4ose7dePwcXVKTu.JyKfisOGXkzkjThm.QFVS8iab7jU75BX5_FTBX9jNQA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-16T11:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "LedgerX platform upgrades Bitcoin trading options", "text": "LedgerX platform upgrades Bitcoin trading options 31 AM CET LedgerX , a bitcoin derivative platform, has launched an interface that allows Bitcoin investors to earn interest on their holdings.\nThe service operates similarly to its existing Bitcoin call options with a streamlined user face for investors, LedgerX representatives said for CoinDesk.\nEssentially, participants place a bet on what Bitcoin’s price will look like at some point in the future.

While it's making headlines around the world, many people don't really understand how bitcoin works or the underlying concepts of cryptocurrency. In this course, Tom Geller demystifies bitcoin, revealing the promise and perils of the new crypto economy. Tom begins by explaining what bitcoin is, how it originated, and how it compares with other cryptocurrencies. Next, he explains how to get started by creating a bitcoin wallet, buying and selling bitcoin, and protecting your transactions. He discusses other top cryptocurrencies-Ripple, Ethereum, and IOTA-and explains how \"initial coin offerings\" (ICOs) have changed the investment landscape. Finally, he covers bitcoin mining, threats to the bitcoin economy, and how to connect with others in cryptocurrency communities.

Created in response to the 2008 financial crisis, anarcho-capitalists hailed it as the decentralized future of commerce.\nBut as prices soared and the biggest names on Wall Street bought in, Bitcoin became mostly known as a speculative, unregulated investment. Think Beanie Babies, but you can also use them to buy drugs and engage in human trafficking.\nPerhaps the most remarkable Bitcoin storyline recently has been just how much computational horsepower it takes to create the virtual currency: some 26 quintillion calculations per second. That adds up to tremendous energy bills.\nBut it’s been tough to put exact numbers on Bitcoin’s massive energy consumption. Most estimates have been “back-of-the-envelope” type calculations. A study published Wednesday in the journal Joule attempts to change that. Economist and digital currency expert Alex de Vries applied traditional economics to better understand Bitcoin’s current and future energy consumption.\nHis results are staggering: Bitcoin uses roughly as much electricity annually as Ireland. And just one Bitcoin transaction requires as much electricity as an average household in his native Netherlands uses in a month.\nProjecting forward, the power drain becomes even more alarming. By year’s end, Bitcoin could consume as much electricity as Austria — or roughly one half of one percent of humanity’s total power needs . If the cryptocurrency’s price grows as some expect, it could eventually chew up 5 percent of global electricity.\n“This increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,” says de Vries, who’s also the founder of Digiconomist, in a media release.\nAlways-On Technology\nBitcoin’s intense energy consumption is baked into its design.\nTo stop people from fraudulently spending their virtual money more than once, each Bitcoin transaction gets a precise timestamp. This public ledger is known as the blockchain. It underpins all consumer confidence in the system.\nTo create it, computers around the world continuously crank away at calculations, generating numbers as they compete to process transactions. If your computer gets selected to process a Bitcoin transaction, you’re rewarded 12.5 new coins plus a transaction fee.\nThis means that the computers processing Bitcoin are chugging away at calculations non-stop — even when they’re not involved in an actual transaction. The more calculations you do, the more chances you have to get a transaction fee.\nIn Bitcoin’s early days, the need was small and many transactions happened on home computers. But now some 200,000 Bitcoin transactions transpire every day.\n“If you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power,” de Vries says. “So there’s a big incentive for people to increase how much they’re spending on electricity and on machines.”\nThe growth and increased complexity, paired with the reward, has led to a worldwide rush to build vast Bitcoin mining operations. You can see this across Eastern Europe, China, Russia and Siberia, where Bitcoin server farms are so big that their excess energy is literally warming houses. Or, for example, the Russian nuclear scientists caught trying to use a government supercomputer for mining cryptocurrency.\nde Vries’ study tries to figure out when the expense will level off with the reward, slowing the industry’s growth and energy consumption. And he admits his estimates are shaky. Bitcoin mining is a secretive business, and so some of the information he relies on came from eyewitness accounts. But the results are important for understanding the industry’s sustainability and passing effective regulations.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2018/05/16/bitcoin-will-soon-use-more-energy-than-austria/#.WvyQdkgvyUk"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T23:56:02.081+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3df44c6f368a23bfa3c3e42c3846e99926bab707", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfJYyEuXc8URkGMGW.aYErY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Is it possible to grow demand of bitcoin?", "title_full": "Is it possible to grow demand of bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-16T11:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.284, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3df44c6f368a23bfa3c3e42c3846e99926bab707", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfJYyEuXc8URkGMGW.aYErY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Phil2018", "published": "2018-05-16T11:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is it possible to grow demand of bitcoin?", "text": "We have to use it daily and make it familiar with every part of the world.

As I expected, the price tested the level of $8.239 and met my yesterday's targets. Japanese internet giant GMO has updated its plans to manufacture and sell its 7nm bitcoin mining chips as well as for its own mining operations. Interested customers will soon be able to reserve some of these chips. The technical picture on Bitcoin looks neutral to bearish.\nTrading recommendations:\nAccording to the H1 time - frame, I found that price broke consolidation zone in the background, which is a sign that sellers are in control. I also found a potential intraday bearish flag in creation, which is another sign of weakness. My advice is to watch for potential selling opportunities if you see a valid breakout of bearish flag. The downward targets are set at the price of $7.810 and at the price of $7.156.\nSupport/Resistance", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

The price is not a measure of a coin success so what I'm referring to here is the the number of ATMs, exchanges, stores, services, and people accepting it.\nSo even If we have some people using alts currently because they believe they are better then bitcoin (which may be true), bitcoin is evolving and the development is super active and exciting times are coming. I honestly believe that this make alts useless (say, by the end of the year), your thoughts?\nThis is the problem about having many cryptocurrencies in the market. They think they are in competition with each other. Personally I think it is a good thing that some incompetent and failing ICOs get kicked out of the market. This makes the industry not too saturated and gives way for better ICOs to come and showcase their coins. Furthermore, altcoins are becoming big right now. Though it's a gradual process, it still a good sign of altcoins having a face in this industry.\nIt's not that much of a bad thing in that point of view.

Although most of us agreed to the cryptocurrencies attracted by the mermaid chants of making easy money and fast, as interesting in itself as the concept of virtual currencies, is the blockchain, which is the technology that enables transactions anonymously, safely and decentralized. The blockchain not only serves for virtual currencies, but also this technology can change everything digital . We are talking about digital files such as photos of your vacations, songs, emails … they explain it in a simple and clear way on the blog Bit2me . From today, the benefits of the blockchain know Budweiser So yes, the blockchain is great, it’s so wonderful that you could even provide your health literally Because from today you can get beer (or any other soda) while the blockchain technology takes place in this incredible vending machine, which we hope will be the first of many. Forget thinking about the potential of this technology and savor its benefits in the form of a frothy, cool Budweiser beer can . We have known this brilliant invention in the conference around the Blockchain Consensus 2018 in New York, an event that has managed to bring together experts in the field as well as potential scammers to know everything about the decentralized future and already, receive crypto-worms for the face . Civic, the company behind this project explains for Mashable :\nWe are excited to invite you to try the first beer vending machine achieved through blockchain that exists\nHow does this vending machine work? The idea is as simple as downloading the app from Civic and fill out your profile, where you have to complete your profile verifying your identity and your age. And that’s it. Now it’s just a matter of approaching so peculiar vending machine for your beer . If you are at the Consensus conference, the first one is free. This is the first blockchain vending machine. Mashable No queues, interactions with the waiter, or having to show your ID if you are potentially underage … nothing. Just go up and take it . Civic has developed this idea so that anyone can savor how the transmission of a data chain works in a practical way with the application of processing our identity in a decentralized, anonymous and secure way. Will this vending machine expand all over the world? So although after a catastrophic year for virtual currencies As it is 2018 you have felt disillusioned and a little cheated, at least you can comfort yourself knowing that the blockchain is useful for much more, even for such mundane things as it is to serve yourself a beer . Of course, as it has already happened with apps like Coinbase, the process of verification of your identity it can become a nightmare If the system is saturated or is not able to read the information properly. Or if the app is too heavy to download and install it on your phone. But if it works, it could change the way it works controls the sale of alcoholic beverages or tobacco In the not too distant future. We do not know what will be the future of virtual currencies , but what is clear is that the blockchain has come to stay and revolutionize everything, until something so different from cryptocurrencies such as soda machines.

It’s highly necessary to compare a range of services before concluding on which one you want to make a trade with. It is also advised you stick to one kind of service due to the volatile nature of the market.\nThe total cost of buying Bitcoin doesn’t depend on just trading fees, but also its deposit, conversion and withdrawal fees; this can hinder you from knowing the true cost. There’s, therefore, a method that helps in measuring the true cost of transactions known as complete cost index (CCI). It’s a viable tool that aids the understanding of your total transaction cost so that your assessment isn’t based on trade fees alone.\nAll exchanges at some point struggle to keep up with user demands, even with no fees at all like Paxful ; so when platforms with the lowest fee are down for some time, and the need to buy Bitcoin arises, it’s advisable to pay a slightly higher fee to acquire the coins, rather than miss out due to waiting patiently for a lower fee.\nThe trading activity of traders determine the fees for trading, which could be topped with an extra small fee or no fee at all. Trading fees have a variation of a taker fee or a maker fee . Fees that are paid when liquidity is added to the order book by putting a limit above the ticker price for sale and below the ticker price for sale are known as maker fees. Taker fees are paid when your liquidity is removed from your order book, by setting any order that is implemented against an order on the order book. The taker fee will be paid if a market order is used to buy or sell because market order removes liquidity from the order book. A taker fee will always be paid if a hidden order is placed, while a maker fee will be paid if a limit order placed matches a hidden order.\nBelow are some of the platforms that give you easy access to buying Bitcoin. 1. Bitwala\nBitwala’s Fees vary based on partners policies; there is a 5% fee of the transaction cost with a minimum amount of 10$. On Bitwala, the partner simply charges all prices and service fees. Cash Advance Fee is imposed on Bitcoin purchase subject to further charges enacted by your bank. Additional fees are charged from customers who buy Bitcoin by utilizing a credit card; this is done by some issuing banks that see buying Bitcoin as a “money order.” Regardless of market instability between the time when your purchase is completed and the time Bitcoin is received, the price received is locked in at that time when Bitcoin is bought. The price can be unstable; by locking in the price, you always know precisely the Bitcoin that is paid for. Visit Bitwala 2. Luno\nThis is another platform, very affordable and utilized to sell, buy, store, trade and use Bitcoin. The fee structure is very transparent and accountable. In situations where costs are incurred to receive your funds, Luno levies a fee for local currency. A small fee may be charged, when local currency is withdrawn from Luno to your bank account. Regardless of the transaction’s size, Luno charges a nominal fee for Bitcoin to receive transactions. It also makes use of the maker-taker model whereby market makers pay no fees while market takers pay a nominal fee. When Bitcoin is sent, a fee is charged to make sure transactions are quickly processed. Visit Luno 3. Poloniex\nThis trading platform also utilizes the maker-taker model just like Bitwala and Luno. It encourages market liquidity by awarding makers with lower fees. This motivates makers to outbid each other. The last thirty days of trading volume determines the calculation of the fees.

It received approval for its platform from the CFTC in July 2017. The license authorizes LedgerX to provide clearing services for fully collateralized digital currency swaps.\nJuthica Chou, Chief Operating Officer at LedgerX, said the bitcoin savings product is certified by a CFTC derivatives clearing organization (DCO) license and a swap execution facility (SEF) license.\n“Everything we do requires both the licenses,” said Chou. “And a lot of that is intentional, because by making it a package deal we can offer a number of services to our customers in a really clear, vertically integrated way.”\nLedgerSavings is aimed at serving bitcoin investors who want to buy and hold. The goal is to provide investors with a fiat-based yield on their bitcoin holdings. This is done through a simplified version of a call overwrite, a trading strategy through which an investor deposits bitcoin on the platform and then sells a call option at a longer date with a higher strike call.\nLedgerSavings’ interface allows users to choose the implied rate they’re anticipating to earn and the number of BTC they wish to earn the yield on. The options contracts will initially be offered for transactions over a three-month duration and a six-month duration, and LedgerX is charging a transaction fee for each service.\n“This interface will definitely be skewed to the long bitcoin holders, who will likely only deposit bitcoin and who will want to earn interest off of that bitcoin,” Chou said.

In today’s digital gold rush, supplying equipment to bitcoin miners is where the money’s at.\nCanaan Creative, the world’s second-largest maker of bitcoin mining rigs, yesterday (May 15) filed to go public in Hong Kong, according to media reports (paywall). The Chinese company is reportedly seeking to raise up to $1 billion, in what is expected to be the world’s biggest crypto-related initial public offering (IPO) ever .\nThe company didn’t immediately reply to Quartz’s request for comment about the details of the IPO, which is expected to take place as soon as July.\nCanaan is known for mass producing chips designed for bitcoin mining, known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), under the brand name Avalon. The company comes after Beijing-based competitor Bitmain as the world’s second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier in market share. It was founded in 2013 (link in Chinese) by Zhang Nangeng, a chip-design expert in his mid-thirties.\nThe initial Avalon machine was the first bitcoin-mining ASIC sold to retail users . Prior to that, most people used the graphic cards of their PC to mine the cryptocurrency, which was far less efficient. China-made ASICs are now among the most popular bitcoin mining hardware around the world.\nThe company’s corporate filing (pdf, in Chinese) to the Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday is a vivid reminder of how lucrative the business of making bitcoin mining hardware is, as the document revealed many details about Canaan’s financials for the first time.\nAccording to the filing, the company had revenue of 1.3 billion yuan ($204 million) in 2017, a 27-fold increase from two years earlier. Its profit in 2017 was 361 million yuan, up more than 230-fold from 2015.\nLast year, Canaan sold a total of 294,523 Avalon ASICs, tripling the number from a year ago. The company noted that the US and Sweden were its biggest overseas markets last year. In 2017, Avalon mining machines were responsible for 19.5% of the world’s processing power for mining bitcoin, the filing said, citing a report from research firm Frost & Sullivan.\nCanaan had previously sought to list in mainland China, but canceled its plan due to regulatory difficulties amid government crackdowns on crypto exchanges and mining farms . But last month, a senior official from China’s security regulator visited the company’s headquarters in Hangzhou to persuade it to reconsider its listing destination, following a call by Beijing to develop its domestic chip industry amid US sanctions against telecom giant ZTE . “You are essentially a chip firm. You are welcome to issue IPO in the domestic markets,” said Jiang Yang , vice head of the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission.\nAs Beijing tightens its control over the crypto-mining industry, China’s major players are increasingly shifting their focus overseas. China’s Ebang, another leading ASIC maker which previously delisted from Shenzhen, is also seeking to file an IPO in Hong Kong to raise $1 billion, according to Reuters . Bitmain, which is reportedly developing mining facilities in Europe and Canada , announced yesterday that it led a $110 million funding round in Circle , a Boston-based crypto exchange and wallet service.

Most notably, bitcoin (BTC) halved in value after briefly passing the 20K margin back in December 2017. BCH suffered a similar fate, as after reaching an all time high of $4100 in December 2017, it quickly started tumbling with the turn of the year. Despite noting a decrease in value, Bitcoin Cash has remained relatively stable. BCH currently has a market cap of $24 billion and a circulating supply of more than 17 million.\nIn the second quarter of 2018, the crypto-markets have shown signs of recovery and some are predicting that BCH could soon be among the top three cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple are currently the top 3 largest cryptocurrencies based on their total market cap, but since its inception, Bitcoin Cash has been growing at unprecedented rates. BCH has managed to accumulate an impressive total market cap of 24 billion and is currently threatening to claim Ripple’s claim to third place in the cryptoverse with a total market cap of 29 billion.\nCash Consortium (C2) described the cryptocurrency as “the soundest money the world has ever known. It has scarcity, fungibility, divisibility, durability, and transferability.” Cash Consortium uses open standards that allow developers to identify bugs and glitches inside the blockchain’s software. BCH has also undergone a second network upgrade on May 15, 2018, introducing many anticipated updates to the network, including bigger block sizes and the introduction of some exciting new features. The restored OP_Codes will enable tokenization and smart contracts to be executed on the BCH blockchain while more advanced functions will be possible with future upgrades to the Bitcoin Cash network. Experts have predicted that this could be the biggest boost BCH has seen, and could help it push forward to be one of the top three cryptocurrencies in the world.\nUser Steve Shadders, a co-author for re-enabling disabled Op codes, posted on his blog that the reactivation of formerly disabled Op codes is compelling to developers and could bring value to the BCH economy. Outspoken BCH advocate Roger Ver also posted on Twitter that BCH–above all Bitcoin forks–follows Satoshi’s vision!\n*Please note that this article is not meant to be construed as investment advice or suggestion of an investment strategy with respect to any financial instrument.\nSources: CoinGeek, Financial Times", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/home?status=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.bdswiss.com%2Fen%2Fbitcoin-cash-set-to-join-worlds-top-3-cryptocurrencies%2F"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin cash", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T14:49:13.033+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e95da310f98f54f6e58d5b385b9ef3fb4e1c2415", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkdynKqnkSXb3ysc8WGD3P5ANF9wr4lqVXSmOMbg8lA6cktSLN0aiaL99byloCXAqtzVhkqnXyVAm1S.4XwyuLTJStBeXUgy4as-", "site_full": "www.americanbankingnews.com", "site": "americanbankingnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.americanbankingnews.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "American Banking News", "title": "Bitcoin God (GOD) Price Hits $34.23 on Exchanges", "title_full": "Bitcoin God (GOD) Price Hits $34.23 on Exchanges", "published": "2018-05-16T10:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/2370.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e95da310f98f54f6e58d5b385b9ef3fb4e1c2415", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkdynKqnkSXb3ysc8WGD3P5ANF9wr4lqVXSmOMbg8lA6cktSLN0aiaL99byloCXAqtzVhkqnXyVAm1S.4XwyuLTJStBeXUgy4as-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ABMN Staff", "published": "2018-05-16T10:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin God (GOD) Price Hits $34.23 on Exchanges", "text": "Posted by ABMN Staff on May 15th, 2018 // No Comments\nBitcoin God (CURRENCY:GOD) traded down 0.1% against the U.S. dollar during the 1-day period ending at 22:00 PM Eastern on May 15th.

Interested customers will soon be able to reserve some of these chips.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space GMO Readies 7nm Mining Chips\nJapanese conglomerate GMO Internet Group published its first quarter results for the fiscal year 2018 last week. During the earnings results presentation, the company outlined its plans for the sale of its long-awaited 7nm bitcoin mining chips.\nGMO is building two versions of the chip, dubbed V1 and V2. The former is the initial prototype of the 7nm mining chip. The latter is for mass production of the 7nm mining chips, which the company plans to use in-house for its own mining operations, sell to the public, and use in cloud mining.\nV2 is now being designed and will enter the mass production phase in the fourth quarter of this year. Sale of 7nm Chips Starting Soon\nIn its presentation, GMO has revised its mining business plans from the fourth quarter of last year. The company now indicates that its mining operations are initially “based on store-bought mining computers,” and in roughly June the “7nm (V1) operation” will commence and in approximately October the “7nm (V2) operation” will be underway.\nAs for the sale of its 7nm bitcoin mining chips, the company spokesperson told news.Bitcoin.com:\nWe can disclose that accepting reservation will start from Q2 onwards and launch will be Q4 onwards only at this moment.\nThe actual sale dates are not specified. Furthermore, the company says its cloud mining operation will be launched in June. GMO’s Mining Business\nThe mining business was launched on December 20 through GMO’s European legal entity. It comprises three areas: “[1] In-house mining; [2] Develop, manufacture, and sell mining machines; [and 3] Cloud mining.”\nGMO says “Hash rate is increasing as planned. Amount of mined bitcoin is increasing as expected.” The company added that it has “new businesses at multiple locations in 2 countries,” noting that its hashrate in April was 241 PH/s but is confident that it will reach the target hashrate of 3,000 PH/s by the year’s end.\nIn addition to its mining business, GMO also operates a crypto exchange called GMO Coin and plans to launch a crypto payment service.

Bitcoin ‘s market value was about $150.1 billion.\n“With smart and thorough regulatory oversight, the development and long-term growth of the industry will remain thriving,” Financial Services Superintendent Maria Vullo said in a statement.\nCryptocurrencies are digital tokens that use encryption techniques to secure transactions.
