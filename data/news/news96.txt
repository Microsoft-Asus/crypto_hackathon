Escape will cancel and close the window.\nMr Greenspan, a senior market analyst at eToro, said it could be decades before bitcoin has a stable price. Speaking exclusively to Express.co.uk, Mr Greenspan said: “I don’t think the volatility is going to go away any time soon, especially since we still have a lot of bitcoin ‘whales’ or people who are involved in bitcoin early on who have amounted a large amount stockpile.\n“That’s going to be a threat to the near-term and possibly for the long-term. “Over time, if we are looking at decades into the future, once the adoption rate of bitcoin is normal and has reached full market penetration, which we are nowhere near at the moment, and once you see more distribution and more liquidity in the market, I believe we can then have a much more stable price fluctuation.” I don’t think the volatility is going to go away any time soon Bitcoin hit sub-$8,000 for the first time since mid-April on Friday, far below its summer peak of $9.826.\nThe erratic pricing marks a huge contrast to the bitcoin boom of late-2017 and early-2018. From October to December the value of bitcoin soared from $4,309 to $19,304 – a staggering 450% increase.\nBitcoin price is at $7,458.64 at 20:21 (BST) on Tuesday, according to Coindesk. Despite the falling markets towards the end of May, BitMex CEO Arthur Hayes predicted bitcoin will be at “$50,000 by the end of the year”.

Italy’s economy is reeling amid a political crisis that has placed a spotlight on the cracks in the EU’s economic foundation.\nBitcoin Price Trends up as Italy’s Economy Falters\nItalian bonds are going bust, and the negativity has spilled over into stocks as well. But as the global financial markets are reeling, bitcoin is finally beginning to see the light of day again, and it could just have something to do with the fact that a potential threat to the euro highlights the benefits of a decentralized currency like bitcoin.\nThe bitcoin price is currently trading above the $7,400 threshold after falling to a May low earlier in the day.\nReason to Rally\nThe cryptocurrency markets have been searching for a reason to rally, and many of us have been looking to the centralized governments of the world to provide that catalyst.\nMeanwhile, the mechanics of the cryptocurrency markets are working just fine, and have pulled off a rally — albeit on modest trading volume — on a development that highlights the very strengths of a decentralized world. Bitcoin and its altcoin peers have proven once again the power of a digital currency that is not controlled by the central bank but instead the masses.\nThe crisis in Italy has placed a great deal of pressure on the euro, sending Europe’s common currency to its lowest levels against the USD in months. Italian bonds have similarly sold off amid the possibility of Europe’s third-largest economy staging a Brexit of its own. A decentralized currency like bitcoin becomes even more attractive when the common currency of Europe becomes unstable.\nFundstrat’s Thomas Lee cheered the crypto market’s response, telling Business Insider:\n“To an extent, I think its good to see Bitcoin rallying with Gold, as the adverse developments in Italy and globally are pushing investors to risk-off. It’s good to see Bitcoin as an uncorrelated trade on a risk off day.”\nTake the Latin American economy of Venezuela as an example. While the economic conditions in Venezuela are specific to the region, comprised of hyperinflation, food crisis and a broke government, the end result is a currency whose value has been destroyed.

Despite its niche appeal, it was incredibly easy to mine in rather large quantities.\nUnfortunately, a lot of people have since lost their Bitcoin holdings. One particular holder lost close to $60 million worth of Bitcoin due to a lost hard drive.\nSECURELY STORING BITCOIN IS IMPORTANT Considering that Bitcoin has been around for over nine years now, it is safe to assume that not all of the minted coins are still in circulation today. Given the vast number of hacks, thefts, and lost currencies over the years, the actual Bitcoin supply is closer to the 15 million mark than the 17+ million which have been mined to date.\nA scarce currency only becomes more scarce over time, especially when users do not take the best security precautions. While Bitcoin-related hacks and thefts make most of the headlines, they are not necessarily responsible for the largest losses in the cryptocurrency world.\nRather, it seems human error is the main cause of many Bitcoins having been lost over the years. Granted, storing the world’s leading cryptocurrency is not necessarily all that straightforward, but things have improved dramatically in the past few years.

You might ask, well, can this happen to bitcoin? The answer is it's extremely improbable. No pool has 51% of the bitcoin hashrate to themselves, and there is only one other coin that share the mining algo. Only other coin that uses SHA256 mining algo is BCH. Is BCH safe? Let's do some math. As can be seen here , current hashrate for BTC is 25.69 EH/S and BCH is 4.75 EH/S. This means to pull of a 51% attack on bitcoin, you need 13.10 EH/S and to pull it off on BCH you need 2.42 EH/S. Who has 2.42 EH/S hashrate? Mining pools BTC.com, Antpool, BTC.top, Slushpool, ViaBTC and F2Pool currently has more than this amount, as can be seen here . So in conclusion, these 6 pools can switch a button and take control of bch network in any moment. This goes to show how safe bitcoin network is, compared to altcoins such as bcash.\n submitted by /u/Markers34\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://btc.com/", "https://fork.lol/pow/hashrate"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T04:02:04.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "35c8dd958d64d0bc24fba8bde6638fc90d58645a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.GRgyRNuS8mMWgD.XZGeIEeMTyJD918bO.UMghuqOoBdnkgwqwagb4ilrPlx9dbFEGSkrvhyVqwm1jj7QAPfnQHY_4RMaJqNEOkUfSmSwtTKMPQ6tiRCUTZzPO7b21pGHIf0BZP6oUoyoOJ2Nd869SpT0M0P07gSowCfIsolSOrzJTmm2D.RDoxKF9oZXunWfynGkPLhcPM3ASSKUsMq.d", "site_full": "www.sbwire.com", "site": "sbwire.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.sbwire.com/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "ReleaseWire - Latest Press Releases", "title": "Report on Bitcoin Technology Market 2018: Studied in Detail by Focusing on Product Type, Application and Competitive", "title_full": "Report on Bitcoin Technology Market 2018: Studied in Detail by Focusing on Product Type, Application and Competitive", "published": "2018-05-30T07:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://media.releasewire.com/photos/show/?id=136870", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81594, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "35c8dd958d64d0bc24fba8bde6638fc90d58645a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.GRgyRNuS8mMWgD.XZGeIEeMTyJD918bO.UMghuqOoBdnkgwqwagb4ilrPlx9dbFEGSkrvhyVqwm1jj7QAPfnQHY_4RMaJqNEOkUfSmSwtTKMPQ6tiRCUTZzPO7b21pGHIf0BZP6oUoyoOJ2Nd869SpT0M0P07gSowCfIsolSOrzJTmm2D.RDoxKF9oZXunWfynGkPLhcPM3ASSKUsMq.d", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-30T07:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Report on Bitcoin Technology Market 2018: Studied in Detail by Focusing on Product Type, Application and Competitive", "text": "RSS Report on Bitcoin Technology Market 2018: Studied in Detail by Focusing on Product Type, Application and Competitive On report Bitcoin Technology Market 2018: Studied in Detail by Focusing on Product Type, Application and Competitive.The Global Bitcoin Technology Market Research Report Forecast 2017-2021 is a valuable source of insightful data for business strategists.\nPune, This research report helps provide insights into innovations, opportunities and new development in the Bitcoin Technology and its connected industries.

He is the inventor of Bitcoin, a multi-billionaire and the genius behind blockchain technology. But his name is just a pseudonym! But there are many arguments that behind the fake name of the computer scientist Nick Szabo.\nRich, ingenious and influential. That and more is Satoshi Nakamoto, the man or woman behind the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. His mind sprang from a digital currency that shook banks in power, transcending national boundaries, and could change the blockchain technology that could change all industries. Nakamoto owns a total of 980,000 Bitcoin – a fortune of over six billion euros. But who is the person behind the pseudonym? So far there is no clear answer. Is Nakamoto a man, a woman, a whole bunch of programmers or maybe even an extraterrestrial Artificial Intelligence? For years, fans of cryptocurrencies are puzzling and speculating.\nSome people were suspected of being Satoshi Nakamoto, including a Japanese physicist , cryptographer Hal Finney, mathematician Shinichi Mochizuki, and programmer Craig Steven Wright. For almost all candidates, there are good arguments. However, more and more evidence points in the direction of a computer scientist who was working on a digital currency long before the Bitcoin whitepaper came into being. His name: Nick Szabo. However, the celebrated in the crypto scene as a genius scientist is almost as inscrutable as his presumed alter-ego.\nWho is Nick Szabo?\nThe computer scientist Nick Szabo has many interests, that’s for sure. As early as 2005 Szabo runs a blog in which he deals at irregular intervals with the origins of currency, national and international economics and also cryptography. On Twitter he shares and comments on the price of gold, inflation and the general political discourse culture. On the other hand, he never writes about himself and private affairs. In fact, hardly anything is known about Nick Szabo man. Even his age could not be revealed to date. What he looks like is only known from a video by the insurance group Swiss Re and further lecture and interview recordings on YouTube.\nSignificantly more is known about Nick Szabo’s work. Already in 1998, he had devised a model for a digital currency called Bit Gold . He described how a decentralized cryptography based currency should be built ten years before the Bitcoin whitepaper. Both currencies are based on the same findings, considerations and methods. However: unlike bitcoin, bit gold has never been implemented.\nNick Szabo’s motivation to design such a currency: he wanted to prevent money from being misappropriated. And that is only possible if the public has control over the currency and every transaction – not a bank or nation.\nSzabo wanted to create with Bit Gold so a way to handle transfers without a middleman. Movements of money should take place without a bank and only from person to person. What Szabo did not manage with Bit Gold, however, was to solve the double-spending problem . This is the question of how to prevent a digital coin from being issued more than once. Otherwise such a digital currency would not be suitable as a store of value. Only with the Bitcoin this problem could be solved.\nLikewise, in 1996 Szabo anticipated the idea of ​​smart contracts . So automated contracts that run on the Blockchain and were mainly known by Ethereum.\nNick Szabo worked as a consultant at eCash Technologies in 2005 – later DigiCash -, a company that wanted to facilitate cashless and above all anonymous financial transactions. After Bitcoin became a success, he worked for the start-up Vaurum or Mirror.co, which was to become a better Mt.Gox. Today, however, Szabo is co-founder of Global Financial Access, which claims to be “helping people access their assets around the world”. Since 2016, investors from all over the world have invested several million in the company. Otherwise, just as with its founder, little is known about the company.\nWhy Nick Szabo could actually be Satoshi Nakamoto?\nAlthough the true identity of the Bitcoin inventor is still unknown, there are a number of indications suggesting that Bitcoin and Bit Gold were devised by the same person. And even if Szabo vehemently denies being Satoshi Nakamoto , some facts and overlaps can not be denied. We have collected six arguments that suggest that Szabo really invented Bitcoin.\n1. Nick Szabo has enough expertise\nIt seems that bitcoin has come from one day to the next – someone put a computer science masterpiece on the net. But that’s not the case: rather, Bitcoin seems to have been the result of a long process. It is therefore very likely that Satoshi Nakamoto is someone who has spent a long time studying electronic money. This is definitely the case with Nick Szabo.\n2. Nick Szabo and Satoshi Nakamoto did not sign emails\nNumerous concepts later expressed in Bitcoin were debated and elaborated in the Cypherpunk community – a loose group of developers, scientists, and activists connected through channels such as Usenet, mailing lists, and forums. Among them was Wei Dai, who used b-money to devise a hypothetical cryptocurrency that has many principles that define Bitcoin today. And Adam Beck, whose anti-spam mechanism Hashcash represents the basis for the mining. With Hashcash, Beck proposed a proof-of-work principle for the digital space: that is, to pay for sending an email, mining a coin, or confirming a transaction with a computing power. Also there was Hal Finney, another self-proclaimed Cypherpunk and former PGP developer who devised the RPOW token system and took pleasure in Szabo’s Bit Gold. Finney suggested he help with the implementation.\nSatoshi Nakamoto later wrote in his forum bitcointalk.org that he drew his ideas from among others that Cypherpunk community. Bitcoin is an implementation of Wei Dais b-money and Nick Szabo’s Bit Gold – the latter is not acknowledged in the whitepaper. Both Wei Dai, Adam Back and Hal Finney had regular contact with Nakamoto during development and also after the release of Bitcoin. Not only Nick Szabo – even though many of his ideas became reality in this project. Szabo therefore admits – despite his denial of Nakamoto speculation – that there is “a lot of parallels” between Bit Gold and Bitcoin, and he understands that “looks strange to a lot of people.”\n3. Satoshi Nakamoto’s initials\nHal Finney has publicized some of his private emails with Satoshi Nakamoto . Interestingly, Nakamoto mentions that he has used his initials in his Bitcoin passkey: NS. But actually, the initials of Satoshi Nakamoto: SN. Possible counterargument that remains: Nakamoto is a Japanese and in Asia it is common to name the surname first.\nWhen looking at Nakamoto’s forum posts and emails, however, his language vocabulary and vocabulary are striking. He writes almost flawless, with a correct punctuation and makes use of phrases and phrases that use mainly native Americans. So it’s unlikely that Nakamoto learned English as a foreign language. Although Nick Szabo has Hungarian roots, he was born and raised in the United States and holds a doctorate from the University of Washington. Yes, the letter wheel in the initials is certainly a scant clue – but it’s one of many.\n4. Did Nick Szabo get support from Hal Finney?\nMaybe it’s simply true, as Nick Szabo keeps saying: he’s not Satoshi Nakamoto at all. But perhaps he makes use of a subtlety in his denial: Not he alone, but he and a second person – possibly Hal Finney – together have used the name as a pseudonym. At least some evidence suggests this: Szabo wanted to revise and revive his idea for Bit Gold 2008. In April of the same year he wrote about it on his blog and asked, “May someone help me to coden?”\nOnly four and a half months later – in November 2008 – Satoshi Nakamoto put the Bitcoin white paper online. Two months later, the first implementation of the cryptocurrency was released. At that time, Szabo retrospectively changed the date of publication of his blog entry on Bit Gold to December 2008. It apparently appeared as if he had resuscitated his idea in the wake of Bitcoin and searched in vain for help from capable developers.\nSzabo and Finney knew each other already in 1993. This raises a crucial question: why should Finney help a completely unknown character like Satoshi Nakamoto to implement a project that is inspired by Bit Gold, and not his good friend, who invented the original ? Authorized question, right?\nIn addition, Satoshi Nakamoto has not written his white paper in the first person. He does not write from the point of view of a single developer, but from the perspective of a team: “We suggest a solution …”, “We define an electronic coin …”, “We will show later that …” many sentences of the document.\nHal Finney was also the first to respond to Satoshi’s release of the Bitcoin code . This gave the previously unknown and ominous genius a certain sovereignty and credibility. Later, Finney became the first person to receive a transfer via Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto sent 10 of the digital coins to the developer.\nAnd there is something else. It may just be a stupid coincidence: Finney was living in Arcadia just a few blocks from a man named Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto . Ironically, the man to whom Newsweek insinuated in 2014 to be the “face behind Bitcoin”.\n5. Szabo’s silence to Bitcoin\nAs interesting as what Szabo wrote is what he did not say. He was silent for almost two years to Bitcoin. He initially did not appreciate the Bitcoin whitepaper and did not seem to notice that a completely unknown person was using his ideas. Especially given the fact that Szabo had dealt with the issue for almost ten years, that’s suspicious. Even as Bitcoin gradually found an audience, it was hardly worth a syllable.\nOnly in 2009, the computer scientist mentions the cryptocurrency as a side note in his blog. As Bitcoin 2010 is more successful and breaks the one dollar threshold for the first time, Szabo remains calm. A year later, he appreciatively and apparently satisfied that once only he, Wei Dai and Hal Finney had believed in a concept like Bitcoin and pursued it persistently – at least until Nakamoto came. He claims that Nakamoto could well be one of the same group – Hal Finney or Wei Dai. As Satoshi submerges in 2011, Szabo begins to write more about Bitcoin and its possibilities.\nExactly these texts provide further clues that support a relationship of Szabo and Nakamoto. Because in 2014, 40 aspiring linguists at Aston University compared the Bitcoin white paper with texts by 11 people who are said to be Satoshi Nakamoto . The result? “The number of linguistic similarities between Szabo’s writings and the Bitcoin thesis paper are irritating. No other candidate also scores nearly as well. “Even if Szabo was just one of several people traveling under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, he probably wrote much of the white paper.\n6. Why does he resist the rumors?\nSo more evidence points to Nick Szabo than anyone else. But if he is Satoshi Nakamoto, why is he so against fame? The reasons are likely to be manifold: Alone his Bitcoin treasure would make him a target – not only by criminals, but also government agencies. Similarly, the inventor of Bitcoin would be under similar observation as Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and other tech celebrities – if not more.\nHad the proof been provided that Nick Szabo is the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, not only fame and glory would await him, but also resentment and hate. Andreas Antonopoulos, the author of the book Mastering Bitcoin drew a fitting comparison here: If Satoshi Nakamoto would be exposed, he would be similar to the Titan Prometheus from Greek mythology. He had dared to steal fire from Olympus and give it to people. An act for which Zeus punished him with eternal torments.\nimage by shutterstock Bitcoin News\nTheBitcoinNews.com – leading Bitcoin News source since 2012\nVirtual currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to consumer protections.

worldwide has surpassed the 3,000 milestone in the month of May at an accelerating pace of 6 new installations daily.\nBITCOIN ATM COUNT BREAKS 3,000 Despite the lackluster price action of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in recent months, the Bitcoin ATM industry appears as healthy as ever.\nThe latest data from CoinATMradar shows that the number of Bitcoin vending machines has passed the 3,000 milestone in mid-May and is currently at 3,125 machines worldwide.\nThis milestone comes just 15 months after surpassing the 1,000 mark back at the beginning of 2017, indicating an accelerating pace, which now stands at 6.15 installations daily.\nBack in April, Bitcoinist reported on a UK-based ATM startup, BCB ATM, whose rapid expansion is just one example of a rapidly growing market. In just eleven months through 2017, BCB ATM’s machine count grew from 7 to 32 or by 528.07 percent.\nBITCOIN ATM OPERATORS UNFAZED BY PRICE SLUMP What’s more, it appears that the Q1 2018 Bitcoin price slump has not had much of an effect on the installation rate. In fact, the last time there was a drop-off was in late-2015, when the price of Bitcoin was as low as $200 USD.\nHowever, the market has grown at an accelerating pace in the past 3 years with rising prices. From the latest data, we can assume two things with certainty: 1) the demand for buying (and selling) Bitcoin through automatic vending machines is increasing, and 2) the business model is largely profitable for the operators despite the price volatility.\nMoreover, the share of two-way machines, allowing both buying and selling, has also increased to over 35 percent with improved hardware, whose operators scoop up the fees on both sides of the trade at 8.77 percent on average per transaction.\nAt the same time, Bitcoin remains king despite an increasing number of altcoin vending options. In fact, 99.99 percent of all machines support Bitcoin, while only 50 percent of all machines support some type of altcoin(s). Litecoin is the most popular altcoin, supported by 47.8 percent of the ATMs, with Ether coming second at 28.1 percent.\nOut of the 31 total hardware manufacturers, the top three include Genesis Coin (34.37%), General Bytes (27.49%), and Lamassu (11.23%) who comprise over 70 percent of the entire market.\nAt the same time, the United States remains the clear leader of installations with over 1,800 machines, dwarfing second-place Canada, whose count stands at 477 and then Austria in third place with just 174.\nBITCOIN ATMS DON’T PAINT THE WHOLE PICTURE Of course, Bitcoin ATMs is just one facet of a much bigger industry that provides cryptocurrency buying and selling services. Indeed, the amount of physical locations where one can purchase Bitcoin, whether it’s through vouchers, gift cards, web-money kiosks, etc., is much larger, numbering in the tens of thousands across the globe.\nFor example, anyone can buy Bitcoin at the 1,357 Swiss Railway ticket kiosks in Switzerland. Ukraine boasts almost 7,000 web-money kiosks that let you also buy bitcoins. While Canada’s sprawling network of Flexepin cashier machines can be found at over 5,500 locations.\nAll of these services provide useful options for those who prefer not to deal with online exchanges and are looking to quickly buy or sell Bitcoin for some local cash. At the same time, the increasing pace of expansion points to a healthy industry that has adapted to the volatile market conditions and has found its niche.\nHow important is the Bitcoin ATM industry to Bitcoin’s overall adoption?

Bloomberg states that there is possibility that traders might be trying to alter bitcoin prices as well as the prices of other cryptocurrencies to their favor to earn profits of the trades they pull off.\nThe bitcoin has fallen down to one of its lowest values in recent time as it continues to get closer to the $7,000 mark. The value fell down to the $7,400 mark during the trading day on Thursday. The drop marks the continuation of a trend where the currency has been struggling to catch up in value. The currency has lost nearly a thousand dollars in the past week. The move comes as there are concerns that some illegal actions are causing currencies to change in value without warning, thus leading to some difficulties in the market in general.\nThe currency market is struggling with issues surrounding how such transactions are made and what is available for use. This may complicate the market further based on certain moves that come along over how currencies are made available. However, some added efforts in the industry are being used to try and make currencies easier for people to trade.\nSpecific Actions\nThere are concerns that many illegal actions have been utilized to get the bitcoin to change in its value. This includes spoofing, a process where traders add large numbers of fake orders for larger buy or sell deals.\nWash trading is another concern that is being investigated. People will trade currencies with themselves here. This creates an artificial rise in volume, thus making people believe that there is some kind of demand on the currency market.\nThe DOJ is working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to find information on how the currency market is running. Part of this may include a review of how currencies are being traded based on who is conducting the trades and how often those moves are being handled.\nPossible Recovery\nThere has been a chance for a recovery to take place on the market when the bitcoin’s value is considered. Deutsche Boerse, the owner of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, said that it is thinking about offering cryptocurrency investment products. This could help increase the value of the bitcoin and other currencies thanks to there being more people trading such currencies. However, the German group is looking for added information on how the industry works and what makes it valuable for investing.\nCoinbase will also make trading easier as it rebrands its GDAX professional trading platform into a new system entitled Coinbase Pro . The setup will offer an added analytics system and a streamlined setup that makes it easier for data to be analyzed. Some staking activities may also be supported.\nHowever, these are both moves that had minimal influence in the cryptocurrency market. The volatility of the currency field is still intense, thus leading to concerns that the bitcoin and other currencies might decline some more.

There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $960 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may correct a few points in the short term, but downsides remain supported above $950.\nBitcoin cash price is back in a bullish zone above $950 against the US Dollar. BCH\\/USD has to gather pace above $1,040 for more gains in the near term. Bitcoin Cash Price Trend\nThere was a decent support formed around the $870 level in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price started a solid upside move and traded above the $900 resistance level. It opened the doors for more gains and the price broke the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,010 high to $870 low. During the upside move, the price also managed to clear a major barrier near $950.\nA break above the stated $950 resistance is a positive sign for buyers. More importantly, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $960 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair. The pair is now placed nicely above the $960 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The recent high was around $1,030 and the price is currently consolidating gains. On the downside, an initial support is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $970 low to $1,030 high.\nLooking at the chart , the previous resistance near $950 is likely to act as a strong support. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $970 low to $1,030 high is near $950 to provide support.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD \\u2013 The MACD for BCH\\/USD is now back in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \\u2013 The RSI for BCH\\/USD is currently near the 65 level.\nMajor Support Level \\u2013 $950\nMajor Resistance Level \\u2013 $1,040\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH\\/USD Broke Key Resistance ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T12:07:29.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3701a6fb87495eb331b181676500545e42d0d516", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_o_yUiV0KBhgL7czNXiYKwIH21Tc5L9TcVGBrpEtnzdcS4NNv1iqXLZxLsFo4P4W_sE4dylkXD2TAGQYq68SxLvgJdp3i4XrpNjVPdJVgNaseG0w0Ori295lpkiJp3fOA-", "site_full": "www.heimwerkerrunde.de", "site": "heimwerkerrunde.de", "site_section": "http://www.heimwerkerrunde.de/syndication.php", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Forums - Alle Foren", "title": "Ace high casino entertainment no deposit bonus bitcoin casino 2018", "title_full": "Ace high casino entertainment no deposit bonus bitcoin casino 2018", "published": "2018-05-30T07:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3701a6fb87495eb331b181676500545e42d0d516", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_o_yUiV0KBhgL7czNXiYKwIH21Tc5L9TcVGBrpEtnzdcS4NNv1iqXLZxLsFo4P4W_sE4dylkXD2TAGQYq68SxLvgJdp3i4XrpNjVPdJVgNaseG0w0Ori295lpkiJp3fOA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-30T07:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ace high casino entertainment no deposit bonus bitcoin casino 2018", "text": "Bewertung 0 Ace high casino entertainment no deposit bonus bitcoin casino 2018 Jackpot Grand is a newly born online casino with one intention: to offer the best gaming experience players could find.

jumped higher and broke a key resistance at $950 against the US Dollar. There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $960 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may correct a few points in the short term, but downsides remain supported above $950.\nBitcoin cash price is back in a bullish zone above $950 against the US Dollar. BCH\\/USD has to gather pace above $1,040 for more gains in the near term. Bitcoin Cash Price Trend\nThere was a decent support formed around the $870 level in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price started a solid upside move and traded above the $900 resistance level. It opened the doors for more gains and the price broke the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,010 high to $870 low. During the upside move, the price also managed to clear a major barrier near $950.\nA break above the stated $950 resistance is a positive sign for buyers. More importantly, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $960 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair. The pair is now placed nicely above the $960 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The recent high was around $1,030 and the price is currently consolidating gains. On the downside, an initial support is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $970 low to $1,030 high.\nLooking at the chart , the previous resistance near $950 is likely to act as a strong support. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $970 low to $1,030 high is near $950 to provide support.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD \\u2013 The MACD for BCH\\/USD is now back in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \\u2013 The RSI for BCH\\/USD is currently near the 65 level.\nMajor Support Level \\u2013 $950\nMajor Resistance Level \\u2013 $1,040\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH\\/USD Broke Key Resistance appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T12:16:39.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1009f85c56b70fa87930deff7705d7516396d468", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfZRHykMtA.0rOEDQEPoNAg-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Remember, Bitcoin is the best Cryptocurrency to Hodl.", "title_full": "Remember, Bitcoin is the best Cryptocurrency to Hodl.", "published": "2018-05-30T07:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1009f85c56b70fa87930deff7705d7516396d468", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfZRHykMtA.0rOEDQEPoNAg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sebo.k", "published": "2018-05-30T07:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Remember, Bitcoin is the best Cryptocurrency to Hodl.", "text": "The market is now green because bitcoin turned green.

Italy’s economy is reeling amid a political crisis that has placed a spotlight on the cracks in the EU’s economic foundation.\nBitcoin Price Trends up as Italy’s Economy Falters Italian bonds are going bust, and the negativity has spilled over into stocks as well. But as the global financial markets are reeling, bitcoin is finally beginning to see the light of day again, and it could just have something to do with the fact that a potential threat to the euro highlights the benefits of a decentralized currency like bitcoin.\nThe bitcoin price is currently trading above the $7,400 threshold after falling to a May low earlier in the day.\nbitcoin price More Reason to Rally The cryptocurrency markets have been searching for a reason to rally, and many of us have been looking to the centralized governments of the world to provide that catalyst.\nMeanwhile, the mechanics of the cryptocurrency markets are working just fine, and have pulled off a rally — albeit on modest trading volume — on a development that highlights the very strengths of a decentralized world. Bitcoin and its altcoin peers have proven once again the power of a digital currency that is not controlled by the central bank but instead the masses.\nThe crisis in Italy has placed a great deal of pressure on the euro, sending Europe’s common currency to its lowest levels against the USD in months. Italian bonds have similarly sold off amid the possibility of Europe’s third-largest economy staging a Brexit of its own. A decentralized currency like bitcoin becomes even more attractive when the common currency of Europe becomes unstable .\nFundstrat’s Thomas Lee cheered the crypto market’s response, telling Business Insider :\n“To an extent, I think its good to see Bitcoin rallying with Gold, as the adverse developments in Italy and globally are pushing investors to risk-off. It’s good to see Bitcoin as an uncorrelated trade on a risk off day.”\nTake the Latin American economy of Venezuela as an example. While the economic conditions in Venezuela are specific to the region, comprised of hyperinflation, food crisis and a broke government, the end result is a currency whose value has been destroyed. As a result, Venezuela’s currency was being exchanged for bitcoin at a record pace in mid-April, when more than $1 million in “bolivar-to-bitcoin” conversions occurred in a single day.\nItaly’s fate in the EU has yet to unfold, and a snap election appears to be taking shape for the coming months there. In the meantime, it’s not just bitcoin that’s benefitting. Other leading digital currencies including ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and litecoin were all trading between 2%-4% higher while cardano soared nearly 10%.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock\nThe post Italy’s Economic Pain Is the Bitcoin Price’s Gain appeared first on CCN .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0hHawaX0ZYO7TXzQtHkM9g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjgxO2g9NTc2/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/5ddfc92432ff83832464bbc429f8a205", "https://www.ccn.com/italys-economic-pain-is-the-bitcoin-prices-gain/&quot;", "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dollar-drives-to-6-month-high-against-euro-as-italian-and-spanish-political-worries-fester-2018-05-29", "http://ccn.com/bitcoin-price", "https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-price-rebounds-from-7040-to-7450-but-bulls-yet-to-turn-up/", "http://ccn.com/bitcoin-price&quot;", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-18/bolivar-to-bitcoin-market-hits-record-1-million-per-day", "http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/5ddfc92432ff83832464bbc429f8a205", "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dollar-drives-to-6-month-high-against-euro-as-italian-and-spanish-political-worries-fester-2018-05-29&quot;", "http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-crypto-making-comeback-italy-political-crisis-mounts-2018-5&quot;", "http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-crypto-making-comeback-italy-political-crisis-mounts-2018-5", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0hHawaX0ZYO7TXzQtHkM9g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjgxO2g9NTc2/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/5ddfc92432ff83832464bbc429f8a205);", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-18/bolivar-to-bitcoin-market-hits-record-1-million-per-day&quot;", "https://www.ccn.com/italys-economic-pain-is-the-bitcoin-prices-gain/", "https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-price-rebounds-from-7040-to-7450-but-bulls-yet-to-turn-up/&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/HCLK4qbNZ_u2UDfNbAoerg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/7208f4882ed1d43a035a5b657c031805"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T02:46:56.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bdf802884b5b11a05deefe548b76c9b742c91c30", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywOl5DShMMW5AtIyXMmRySGGI389QkeSBp83NNOVI3viqHPWzs8MW4JA--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Fresh Hopes for the Bulls!", "title_full": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Fresh Hopes for the Bulls!", "published": "2018-05-30T07:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bdf802884b5b11a05deefe548b76c9b742c91c30", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywOl5DShMMW5AtIyXMmRySGGI389QkeSBp83NNOVI3viqHPWzs8MW4JA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-30T07:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Fresh Hopes for the Bulls!", "text": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights\nBitcoin price appears to be finding support at the bottom of its symmetrical triangle. If it keeps holding as a floor, price could head back to the resistance around $9,000. Oscillators are suggesting that a return in bullish momentum is in order. Bitcoin price is finding support at the bottom of its symmetrical triangle while oscillators indicate oversold conditions.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside, which suggests that a break below support is still possible.\nPrice is also trading below the 100 SMA so this moving average could hold as near-term resistance in a bigger bounce. The gap between the moving averages is sufficiently wide so there is no imminent threat of a bullish crossover.\nHowever, RSI is pulling up from oversold levels to signal that buyers are getting back on their feet. Similarly stochastic is moving out of the oversold region to signal a return in buying pressure. A bullish divergence can also be observed for this oscillator as stochastic made lower lows since April while bitcoin price made higher lows.\nBTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nEven though cryptocurrencies have been hit by risk-off flows recently, it looks like fears of rising anti-EU sentiment are driving up demand for bitcoin again. This has been particularly evident during previous referendums wherein euro zone nations threatened to leave the bloc.\nItaly is said to be headed for another round of polls as the coalition government leaders are unable to draw enough support. Some say that the elections could be a proxy for a referendum vote, possibly even spurring anti-EU sentiment in other countries like Spain and Portugal.\nThe polls aren't likely to happen until late July or even September, which means continued political uncertainty in the region and a chance for anti-EU parties to gain more traction.\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Fresh Hopes for the Bulls! appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T07:04:34.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2d689f1402594f1e3cad17ec9831d6a652791529", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFQMMgLntuWGmEJnjOjrwUrsSiYkqDfMMdyAgOdeVz4QJ3X6VaFIbHXMeZ34g8woQv17J0Kbxj0TMmNRNc4GWM8auZ4YgfZdJNB0TLQcedxU1", "site_full": "www.youbrandinc.com", "site": "youbrandinc.com", "site_section": "http://www.youbrandinc.com/feed", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "You Brand, Inc.", "title": "Overpaying for Security, or Misallocating?

Bitcoin and Dash vs. 51% Attacks by 0\nRecent cryptocurrency news has been dominated by 51% attacks, whereby a single actor controls the majority of the mining power and is able to use this to reverse transactions. Bitcoin Gold and Verge, as well as Monacoin, recently suffered similar attacks.\nThis has called into question original estimates of the level of network security provided by pure proof-of-work mining. A determined and powerful actor can compromise most major cryptocurrencies with relative ease The selling point of proof-of-work models is that miners are incentivized to secure the network with their computing power, and mature networks will acquire enough hashrate from miners to effectively block all but an extremely powerful attacker from compromising the network.\nHowever, attacking a network may prove to be easier than originally thought. 51Crypto compiled a list of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies with a projected chart of the costs to take over a majority of hashrate for an hour.\nThe site estimates ease of attack by finding the cost of purchasing hashrate on NiceHash for each respective coin, then estimating the total cost of attacking a network for an hour’s duration. NiceHash’s rates are used to calculate the entire hashrate’s cost, even when only a small percentage could be used from the service.\nNaturally, mounting such an attack can prove more complicated than simply purchasing hashrate, as in some cases purchasing specialized hardware, which may be in limited supply, and other logistical issues may be present, but the experiment illustrates some challenges facing pure proof-of-work coins. Proof-of-stake’s centralization problem The main alternative mechanism to proof-of-work mining is proof-of-stake, which essentially limits validation of the blockchain to actors who prove control over a portion of the coin’s supply.

If it keeps holding as a floor, price could head back to the resistance around $9,000. Oscillators are suggesting that a return in bullish momentum is in order.\nBitcoin price is finding support at the bottom of its symmetrical triangle while oscillators indicate oversold conditions.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside, which suggests that a break below support is still possible.\nPrice is also trading below the 100 SMA so this moving average could hold as near-term resistance in a bigger bounce. The gap between the moving averages is sufficiently wide so there is no imminent threat of a bullish crossover.\nHowever, RSI is pulling up from oversold levels to signal that buyers are getting back on their feet. Similarly stochastic is moving out of the oversold region to signal a return in buying pressure. A bullish divergence can also be observed for this oscillator as stochastic made lower lows since April while bitcoin price made higher lows. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nEven though cryptocurrencies have been hit by risk-off flows recently, it looks like fears of rising anti-EU sentiment are driving up demand for bitcoin again.

If it keeps holding as a floor, price could head back to the resistance around $9,000. Oscillators are suggesting that a return in bullish momentum is in order.\nBitcoin price is finding support at the bottom of its symmetrical triangle while oscillators indicate oversold conditions.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside, which suggests that a break below support is still possible.\nPrice is also trading below the 100 SMA so this moving average could hold as near-term resistance in a bigger bounce. The gap between the moving averages is sufficiently wide so there is no imminent threat of a bullish crossover.\nHowever, RSI is pulling up from oversold levels to signal that buyers are getting back on their feet. Similarly stochastic is moving out of the oversold region to signal a return in buying pressure. A bullish divergence can also be observed for this oscillator as stochastic made lower lows since April while bitcoin price made higher lows.

(Image source: YouTube screencap) Tweet\nCastle Craig Hospital in Peeblesshire, Scotland, has opened a new clinic offering help to those addicted to trading forms of alternative currencies.\nA spokesman from Castle Craig, Rupert Wolfe Murray, said they’ve been fielding calls from all over the world inquiring about services related to their cryptocurrency addition program. A matter of time, or of markets?\nTrading addiction is often likened to gambling addiction. The hospital said in a press release: “Cryptocurrency users can get hooked by the volatile fluctuation of prices online which creates a ‘high’ when they buy or trade a winning currency.\n“This can be exciting but also addictive and, like gambling addiction, can be financially disastrous.”\nBehavioral addiction professor Mark Griffiths, of Nottingham Trent University added, “Addiction to cryptocurrencies is a sub-type of online day-trading addiction, ” and echoed, “I see these as akin to gambling addiction.”\nThe clinic’s opening was announced during bitcoin losing streak — last week alone, the total value of all cryptocurrencies tumbled by over $60 million. What are the signs?\nCastle Craig offers a guide on cryptocurrency addiction, and explains that if a person answers “yes” five or more times to the following questions, they are a pathological cryptocurrency addict who needs to seek help: Do I spend a lot of time thinking about different types of cryptocurrency? Am I spending large amounts on cryptocurrency? Have I tried to slow down or completely stop cryptocurrency trading — but not been able to? Do I become restless or irritable if I try to cut down my screen time related to cryptocurrency? Do I jump on the computer and start trading in cryptocurrency to escape from life’s problems or to try to elevate my mood?

London mosque now accepts bitcoin", "text": "Wednesday, 30 May 2018 11:30 AM MYT Looking for a new way to give money to charity as part of Ramadan? A mosque in Britain's capital is willing to receive your donation - in bitcoin. The Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said. \"For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,\" said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology. \"For the donor, it's just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque's perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,\" Musial said. Egypt's Grand Mufti, the nation's top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque's decision. \"Bitcoin is like any other currency. It's ... accepted by a group of people .... We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved ... we are a charity,\" Adeyemi told Reuters. The mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results. It says it is on track to double its donations this year to more than £10,000 (RM52,950). Muslims with the means are religiously obliged to give alms, often calculated based on Islamic texts as being 2.5 percent of their wealth, and many do so during the holy month, a time when Muslim charities are most active. - Reuters", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ramadan", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "lukasz musial", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "musial", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdalla adeyemi def", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shacklewell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shacklewell lane mosque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dalston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T08:02:26.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6dfa3b9cd2f14e5df40f109617329f78ffba1ecb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnyw._xVWigfihSs3EAyX1z7MW0XVU05dJG.dP.2Wkn5_hc-", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Bitcoin Gets Sexy: Goodbye Pasty Neckbeards, Hello Vin Armani", "title_full": "Bitcoin Gets Sexy: Goodbye Pasty Neckbeards, Hello Vin Armani", "published": "2018-05-30T06:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6dfa3b9cd2f14e5df40f109617329f78ffba1ecb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnyw._xVWigfihSs3EAyX1z7MW0XVU05dJG.dP.2Wkn5_hc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-30T06:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Gets Sexy: Goodbye Pasty Neckbeards, Hello Vin Armani", "text": "Bitcoin cash is beginning to shed its inner nerd, and Vin Armani is one of the leading reasons. He's lived what most men can only dream as a high class, world renowned escort to wealthy women. More recently, he's the brain behind Cointext , a revolutionary rebranding of sending crypto without needing an internet connection. If all that wasn't enough, he's also something of a compelling philosopher. We caught up with Mr. Armani ahead of his long-form interview on Humans of Bitcoin , an episode that's quickly become mandatory listening.\nAlso read: Bitgrail Exchange Ordered Down Indefinitely as Italian Court Upholds Halt\nVin Armani's Art of Seduction Brought to Bitcoin Cash News.Bitcoin.com : Dude, you're beefcake. You've got ladies. You're in great shape. You're a television star. You don't live in your mom's basement. What the hell are you doing in crypto?\nVin Armani : Ha! The smartest people I know have figured out how much better life is on all fronts with a little time spent in the gym and a little money spent on a good tailor. I never lived in my mom's basement. That's probably attributable to my father, a tech entrepreneur, buying me a TI-99 for my 5th birthday (complete with cassette drive) and spurring my love for technology. By the time I was 15, I was already getting myself into unnecessary trouble with hacking and phreaking. When the TV show came along, [Showtime's Gigolos ] totally out of the blue, in 2010, I was already well into my software development career and I actually had to quit my position at what is now Saatchiart.com (where I'm told much of my code is still in the foundation of their platform) to go to Vegas and film the first season of the show [Showtime's Gigolos , which ran for six season].\nIt was around that time that a developer buddy passed along a link to some information about Bitcoin. I believe that I first downloaded mining software in 2011, though I didn't see it as anything more than just novelty at the time. I bought my first bitcoins in December 2012 for $15 each from Julian Tosh, who was running Bitcoinsinvegas.com at the time. When the price went to $1,000 for the first time in 2013, I cashed out, had an awesome Christmas, and I've been a vocal proponent ever since. When I started doing The Vin Armani Show in the Fall of 2016, cryptocurrency was a significant part of the show. It's an even bigger part of the show, and my consciousness, now.\nBitcoin Core vs Bitcoin Cash You took-on the bitcoin cash versus bitcoin core debate. Your tweets advocating bitcoin cash are increasing. What attracts you to bitcoin cash?\nStarting in 2014, I began working on some prototypes for various gaming devices that could utilize [bitcoin core (BTC)] as a settlement layer. One example, Ocelot is a mobile slot machine app that interfaces with a paper fiat collecting kiosk. Basically, it allows a player to insert paper cash and receive [BTC] in a wallet integrated into the app. They then use that [BTC] to gamble within the app and can \"cash out\" back to fiat. Because transactions would confirm, at that time, with miner fees of under 1 cent, I (and several very important gaming industry luminaries in Vegas) thought it could be a game changer.\nAs fees began to go into double digits in cents and then move into the multi-dollar range, I was forced to drop [BTC] as the settlement layer. Same goes for a tipping prototype that I built for Legends Room strip club in Vegas – the first \" Strip Club ICO \". Fees got ridiculous and I lost all confidence in [BTC]. I have personally seen the power and potential of cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange. That's where the value has always been for me. When fees got out of control, I began advocating Litecoin and Ethereum, but neither felt as solid as [BTC] had felt to me when I first encountered it and got a chance to develop using the platform.\nAfter the fork, as Bitcoin Cash showed itself to be a return to the cryptocurrency I fell in love with, and as I was able to move my projects over to Bitcoin Cash with minimal effort, my excitement for Bitcoin returned. Bitcoin Cash brought me back into the fold. I don't think I'm alone in that feeling. As I look around the cryptocurrency landscape, the voices and mindsets most aligned with my own are all coming from individuals who have thrown their lot in with Bitcoin Cash.\nThese Are Important Times You've said your program, The Vin Armani Show , is an exploration of a whole new way of being. Can you expand on that a bit? Is that just the hubris of our time? What is so different about this time in human history?\nEvery generation probably thinks that they are living in the most important time ever. To a certain extent, that is actually true. I think what is different about the time in which we currently live is substantially different, however. There was a time, at the dawn of our species, where every homosapien on earth could communicate, face-to-face, with every other member of the species. After all, they were members of the same small family. From the time that the first band of our early ancestors separated from that family and set off to find new lands in which to live, humans have existed in distinct pockets.\nOver hundreds of thousands of years, we eventually began to reconnect with our lost relatives. For the first time in human history, since the dawn of our species, every human on the planet really can communicate, in real time, face to face, with every other human. I believe that represents a \"reset button\" for the species. In fact, it may represent our evolving into a completely new species. Our generation is going to be the one that decides the fate of that species. These are important times.\nLearn more about Mr. Armani's projects on the latest episode of Humans of Bitcoin , online now.\nDo you think we're living in unique times?

He’s lived what most men can only dream as a high class, world renowned escort to wealthy women. More recently, he’s the brain behind Cointext , a revolutionary rebranding of sending crypto without needing an internet connection. If all that wasn’t enough, he’s also something of a compelling philosopher. We caught up with Mr. Armani ahead of his long-form interview on Humans of Bitcoin , an episode that’s quickly become mandatory listening.\nAlso read: Bitgrail Exchange Ordered Down Indefinitely as Italian Court Upholds Halt Vin Armani’s Art of Seduction Brought to Bitcoin Cash\nNews.Bitcoin.com : Dude, you’re beefcake. You’ve got ladies. You’re in great shape. You’re a television star. You don’t live in your mom’s basement. What the hell are you doing in crypto? Vin Armani : Ha! The smartest people I know have figured out how much better life is on all fronts with a little time spent in the gym and a little money spent on a good tailor. I never lived in my mom’s basement. That’s probably attributable to my father, a tech entrepreneur, buying me a TI-99 for my 5th birthday (complete with cassette drive) and spurring my love for technology. By the time I was 15, I was already getting myself into unnecessary trouble with hacking and phreaking. When the TV show came along, [Showtime’s Gigolos ] totally out of the blue, in 2010, I was already well into my software development career and I actually had to quit my position at what is now Saatchiart.com (where I’m told much of my code is still in the foundation of their platform) to go to Vegas and film the first season of the show [Showtime’s Gigolos , which ran for six season].\nIt was around that time that a developer buddy passed along a link to some information about Bitcoin. I believe that I first downloaded mining software in 2011, though I didn’t see it as anything more than just novelty at the time. I bought my first bitcoins in December 2012 for $15 each from Julian Tosh, who was running Bitcoinsinvegas.com at the time. When the price went to $1,000 for the first time in 2013, I cashed out, had an awesome Christmas, and I’ve been a vocal proponent ever since. When I started doing The Vin Armani Show in the Fall of 2016, cryptocurrency was a significant part of the show. It’s an even bigger part of the show, and my consciousness, now. Bitcoin Core vs Bitcoin Cash\nYou took-on the bitcoin cash versus bitcoin core debate. Your tweets advocating bitcoin cash are increasing. What attracts you to bitcoin cash? Starting in 2014, I began working on some prototypes for various gaming devices that could utilize [bitcoin core (BTC)] as a settlement layer. One example, Ocelot is a mobile slot machine app that interfaces with a paper fiat collecting kiosk. Basically, it allows a player to insert paper cash and receive [BTC] in a wallet integrated into the app. They then use that [BTC] to gamble within the app and can “cash out” back to fiat. Because transactions would confirm, at that time, with miner fees of under 1 cent, I (and several very important gaming industry luminaries in Vegas) thought it could be a game changer.\nAs fees began to go into double digits in cents and then move into the multi-dollar range, I was forced to drop [BTC] as the settlement layer. Same goes for a tipping prototype that I built for Legends Room strip club in Vegas – the first “ Strip Club ICO “. Fees got ridiculous and I lost all confidence in [BTC]. I have personally seen the power and potential of cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange. That’s where the value has always been for me. When fees got out of control, I began advocating Litecoin and Ethereum, but neither felt as solid as [BTC] had felt to me when I first encountered it and got a chance to develop using the platform. After the fork, as Bitcoin Cash showed itself to be a return to the cryptocurrency I fell in love with, and as I was able to move my projects over to Bitcoin Cash with minimal effort, my excitement for Bitcoin returned. Bitcoin Cash brought me back into the fold. I don’t think I’m alone in that feeling. As I look around the cryptocurrency landscape, the voices and mindsets most aligned with my own are all coming from individuals who have thrown their lot in with Bitcoin Cash. These Are Important Times\nYou’ve said your program, The Vin Armani Show , is an exploration of a whole new way of being. Can you expand on that a bit? Is that just the hubris of our time? What is so different about this time in human history? Every generation probably thinks that they are living in the most important time ever. To a certain extent, that is actually true. I think what is different about the time in which we currently live is substantially different, however. There was a time, at the dawn of our species, where every homosapien on earth could communicate, face-to-face, with every other member of the species. After all, they were members of the same small family. From the time that the first band of our early ancestors separated from that family and set off to find new lands in which to live, humans have existed in distinct pockets.\nOver hundreds of thousands of years, we eventually began to reconnect with our lost relatives. For the first time in human history, since the dawn of our species, every human on the planet really can communicate, in real time, face to face, with every other human. I believe that represents a “reset button” for the species. In fact, it may represent our evolving into a completely new species. Our generation is going to be the one that decides the fate of that species. These are important times.\nLearn more about Mr. Armani’s projects on the latest episode of Humans of Bitcoin , online now.\nDo you think we’re living in unique times?

The selloff was mainly due to a lack of trader confidence in the future fundamentals of the cryptocurrency market. The total cryptocurrency market also fell to $300 billion earlier today but has since climbed back to $325 billion later in the trading.\nTraders and investors are showing their concerns over the considerable drop in Bitcoin Cash price despite infrastructural upgrades and improved transaction processing time. Traders were expecting BCH coin price to rise sharply following the recent events that have the long-standing impact on its future fundamentals.\nThe reaction to Jared Schlar was also interesting. The majority of users have blamed market volatility and lack of adaptation for the recent losses.\nThe cryptocurrency market has been under pressure due to regulatory concerns. The ongoing investigation in the United States and the United Kingdom, amid price manipulation activities and unfair trading practices sharply impacted trader’s sentiments over the last couple of days.\nSome traders and market participants believe that BCH coin is trading on speculations. It is more volatile than Bitcoin – which reduces its potential work as viable currency. The Rest of the Market is in Green\nThe entire cryptocurrency market has been in a freefall over the last couple of weeks. Analysts’ bashing and controversies related to price manipulation activities have negatively impacted investor’s sentiments. TRON (TRX) and EOS (EOS) were among the biggest losers earlier today before gaining some momentum later in the session. Cardano (ADA) has posted positive price movement today after declining robustly in the last couple of days.\nAnalysts, on the other hand, are correlating the cryptocurrency market to the dot-com bubble. They believe only a few crypto coins will survive when the cryptocurrency bubble busts in days to come.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "siraj sarwar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared schlar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T06:18:55.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "19a44024b23d2d89379076d7d6763a521eb1d154", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9VGISmYZvA8eFMBKLKRGGEf7gLRbTuCj9GPawOAHe5xJwF4j6iQRYffBdXT4lH_aBK3yPpiAMzsTOkFmb4.WvAEYyo6Qc7VJe6HOb8n3ohhzMJMNg19yjEZdf.XTQ6ilc_AMPK0sN56Lkk61S1rpCOUAucO9kBDmk0e.bIeEBzsL.nExJRFN1o", "site_full": "www.zombiecommand.com", "site": "zombiecommand.com", "site_section": "http://www.zombiecommand.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Zombie Command", "title": "Online Arcoxia Generic Over The Counter BitCoin payment Is Available Safe Pharmacy To Buy Generic Drugs", "title_full": "Online Arcoxia Generic Over The Counter BitCoin payment Is Available Safe Pharmacy To Buy Generic Drugs", "published": "2018-05-30T05:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "19a44024b23d2d89379076d7d6763a521eb1d154", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9VGISmYZvA8eFMBKLKRGGEf7gLRbTuCj9GPawOAHe5xJwF4j6iQRYffBdXT4lH_aBK3yPpiAMzsTOkFmb4.WvAEYyo6Qc7VJe6HOb8n3ohhzMJMNg19yjEZdf.XTQ6ilc_AMPK0sN56Lkk61S1rpCOUAucO9kBDmk0e.bIeEBzsL.nExJRFN1o", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "LendMeYourEyes", "published": "2018-05-30T05:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "Online Arcoxia Generic Over The Counter BitCoin payment Is Available Safe Pharmacy To Buy Generic Drugs", "text": "Online Arcoxia Generic Over The Counter Generic Arcoxia\nSafe Order Generic Arcoxia Now.

blockchain that serves as Bitcoin’s crypto-foundation, continue to outpace the ability of law and regulation to keep pace. During 2017 alone, the market price of Bitcoin rose 1,735 percent, from about $970 to $14,292, causing an investor feeding frenzy. As of March 31, 2018, a total of 1,595 cryptocurrencies are reported, having an approximate market capitalization of $266.97 billion at that date. A brief history of the fast moving adoption of blockchain-based technology is provided, along with a look at the efforts of regulators to keep up with the staggering worldwide growth in the usage of virtual currencies.

He’s lived what most men can only dream as a high class, world renowned escort to wealthy women. More recently, he’s the brain behind Cointext , a revolutionary rebranding of sending crypto without needing an internet connection. If all that wasn’t enough, he’s also something of a compelling philosopher. We caught up with Mr. Armani ahead of his long-form interview on Humans of Bitcoin , an episode that’s quickly become mandatory listening.\nAlso read: Bitgrail Exchange Ordered Down Indefinitely as Italian Court Upholds Halt Vin Armani’s Art of Seduction Brought to Bitcoin Cash\nNews.Bitcoin.com : Dude, you’re beefcake. You’ve got ladies. You’re in great shape. You’re a television star. You don’t live in your mom’s basement. What the hell are you doing in crypto? Vin Armani : Ha! The smartest people I know have figured out how much better life is on all fronts with a little time spent in the gym and a little money spent on a good tailor. I never lived in my mom’s basement. That’s probably attributable to my father, a tech entrepreneur, buying me a TI-99 for my 5th birthday (complete with cassette drive) and spurring my love for technology. By the time I was 15, I was already getting myself into unnecessary trouble with hacking and phreaking. When the TV show came along, [Showtime’s Gigolos ] totally out of the blue, in 2010, I was already well into my software development career and I actually had to quit my position at what is now Saatchiart.com (where I’m told much of my code is still in the foundation of their platform) to go to Vegas and film the first season of the show [Showtime’s Gigolos , which ran for six season].\nIt was around that time that a developer buddy passed along a link to some information about Bitcoin. I believe that I first downloaded mining software in 2011, though I didn’t see it as anything more than just novelty at the time. I bought my first bitcoins in December 2012 for $15 each from Julian Tosh, who was running Bitcoinsinvegas.com at the time. When the price went to $1,000 for the first time in 2013, I cashed out, had an awesome Christmas, and I’ve been a vocal proponent ever since. When I started doing The Vin Armani Show in the Fall of 2016, cryptocurrency was a significant part of the show. It’s an even bigger part of the show, and my consciousness, now. Bitcoin Core vs Bitcoin Cash\nYou took-on the bitcoin cash versus bitcoin core debate. Your tweets advocating bitcoin cash are increasing. What attracts you to bitcoin cash? Starting in 2014, I began working on some prototypes for various gaming devices that could utilize [bitcoin core (BTC)] as a settlement layer. One example, Ocelot is a mobile slot machine app that interfaces with a paper fiat collecting kiosk. Basically, it allows a player to insert paper cash and receive [BTC] in a wallet integrated into the app. They then use that [BTC] to gamble within the app and can “cash out” back to fiat. Because transactions would confirm, at that time, with miner fees of under 1 cent, I (and several very important gaming industry luminaries in Vegas) thought it could be a game changer.\nAs fees began to go into double digits in cents and then move into the multi-dollar range, I was forced to drop [BTC] as the settlement layer. Same goes for a tipping prototype that I built for Legends Room strip club in Vegas – the first “ Strip Club ICO “. Fees got ridiculous and I lost all confidence in [BTC]. I have personally seen the power and potential of cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange. That’s where the value has always been for me. When fees got out of control, I began advocating Litecoin and Ethereum, but neither felt as solid as [BTC] had felt to me when I first encountered it and got a chance to develop using the platform. After the fork, as Bitcoin Cash showed itself to be a return to the cryptocurrency I fell in love with, and as I was able to move my projects over to Bitcoin Cash with minimal effort, my excitement for Bitcoin returned. Bitcoin Cash brought me back into the fold. I don’t think I’m alone in that feeling. As I look around the cryptocurrency landscape, the voices and mindsets most aligned with my own are all coming from individuals who have thrown their lot in with Bitcoin Cash. These Are Important Times\nYou’ve said your program, The Vin Armani Show , is an exploration of a whole new way of being. Can you expand on that a bit? Is that just the hubris of our time? What is so different about this time in human history? Every generation probably thinks that they are living in the most important time ever. To a certain extent, that is actually true. I think what is different about the time in which we currently live is substantially different, however. There was a time, at the dawn of our species, where every homosapien on earth could communicate, face-to-face, with every other member of the species. After all, they were members of the same small family. From the time that the first band of our early ancestors separated from that family and set off to find new lands in which to live, humans have existed in distinct pockets.\nOver hundreds of thousands of years, we eventually began to reconnect with our lost relatives. For the first time in human history, since the dawn of our species, every human on the planet really can communicate, in real time, face to face, with every other human. I believe that represents a “reset button” for the species. In fact, it may represent our evolving into a completely new species. Our generation is going to be the one that decides the fate of that species. These are important times.\nLearn more about Mr. Armani’s projects on the latest episode of Humans of Bitcoin , online now.\nDo you think we’re living in unique times?

Edward Kelso\nBitcoin cash is beginning to shed its inner nerd, and Vin Armani is one of the leading reasons. He's lived what most men can only dream as a high class, world renowned escort to wealthy women. More recently, he's the brain behind Cointext , a revolutionary rebranding of sending crypto without needing an internet connection. If all that wasn't enough, he's also something of a compelling philosopher. We caught up with Mr. Armani ahead of his long-form interview on Humans of Bitcoin , an episode that's quickly become mandatory listening.\nAlso read: Bitgrail Exchange Ordered Down Indefinitely as Italian Court Upholds Halt\nVin Armani's Art of Seduction Brought to Bitcoin Cash News.Bitcoin.com : Dude, you're beefcake. You've got ladies. You're in great shape. You're a television star. You don't live in your mom's basement. What the hell are you doing in crypto?\nVin Armani : Ha! The smartest people I know have figured out how much better life is on all fronts with a little time spent in the gym and a little money spent on a good tailor. I never lived in my mom's basement. That's probably attributable to my father, a tech entrepreneur, buying me a TI-99 for my 5th birthday (complete with cassette drive) and spurring my love for technology. By the time I was 15, I was already getting myself into unnecessary trouble with hacking and phreaking. When the TV show came along, [Showtime's Gigolos ] totally out of the blue, in 2010, I was already well into my software development career and I actually had to quit my position at what is now Saatchiart.com (where I'm told much of my code is still in the foundation of their platform) to go to Vegas and film the first season of the show [Showtime's Gigolos , which ran for six season].\nIt was around that time that a developer buddy passed along a link to some information about Bitcoin. I believe that I first downloaded mining software in 2011, though I didn't see it as anything more than just novelty at the time. I bought my first bitcoins in December 2012 for $15 each from Julian Tosh, who was running Bitcoinsinvegas.com at the time. When the price went to $1,000 for the first time in 2013, I cashed out, had an awesome Christmas, and I've been a vocal proponent ever since. When I started doing The Vin Armani Show in the Fall of 2016, cryptocurrency was a significant part of the show. It's an even bigger part of the show, and my consciousness, now.\nBitcoin Core vs Bitcoin Cash You took-on the bitcoin cash versus bitcoin core debate. Your tweets advocating bitcoin cash are increasing. What attracts you to bitcoin cash?\nStarting in 2014, I began working on some prototypes for various gaming devices that could utilize [bitcoin core (BTC)] as a settlement layer. One example, Ocelot is a mobile slot machine app that interfaces with a paper fiat collecting kiosk. Basically, it allows a player to insert paper cash and receive [BTC] in a wallet integrated into the app. They then use that [BTC] to gamble within the app and can \"cash out\" back to fiat. Because transactions would confirm, at that time, with miner fees of under 1 cent, I (and several very important gaming industry luminaries in Vegas) thought it could be a game changer.\nAs fees began to go into double digits in cents and then move into the multi-dollar range, I was forced to drop [BTC] as the settlement layer. Same goes for a tipping prototype that I built for Legends Room strip club in Vegas – the first \" Strip Club ICO \". Fees got ridiculous and I lost all confidence in [BTC]. I have personally seen the power and potential of cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange. That's where the value has always been for me. When fees got out of control, I began advocating Litecoin and Ethereum, but neither felt as solid as [BTC] had felt to me when I first encountered it and got a chance to develop using the platform.\nAfter the fork, as Bitcoin Cash showed itself to be a return to the cryptocurrency I fell in love with, and as I was able to move my projects over to Bitcoin Cash with minimal effort, my excitement for Bitcoin returned. Bitcoin Cash brought me back into the fold. I don't think I'm alone in that feeling. As I look around the cryptocurrency landscape, the voices and mindsets most aligned with my own are all coming from individuals who have thrown their lot in with Bitcoin Cash.\nThese Are Important Times You've said your program, The Vin Armani Show , is an exploration of a whole new way of being. Can you expand on that a bit? Is that just the hubris of our time? What is so different about this time in human history?\nEvery generation probably thinks that they are living in the most important time ever. To a certain extent, that is actually true. I think what is different about the time in which we currently live is substantially different, however. There was a time, at the dawn of our species, where every homosapien on earth could communicate, face-to-face, with every other member of the species. After all, they were members of the same small family. From the time that the first band of our early ancestors separated from that family and set off to find new lands in which to live, humans have existed in distinct pockets.\nOver hundreds of thousands of years, we eventually began to reconnect with our lost relatives. For the first time in human history, since the dawn of our species, every human on the planet really can communicate, in real time, face to face, with every other human. I believe that represents a \"reset button\" for the species. In fact, it may represent our evolving into a completely new species. Our generation is going to be the one that decides the fate of that species. These are important times.\nLearn more about Mr. Armani's projects on the latest episode of Humans of Bitcoin , online now.\nDo you think we're living in unique times?

Cryptocurrencies allow investors to move their money off the balance sheets of banks and decrease credit risks. Published 9:28 PM ET Tue, 29 May 2018 CNBC.com 8:56 PM ET Tue, 29 May 2018 | 08:33\nThe answers to which way the market will move next may lie in bitcoin , said Brian Stutland of Equity Armor Investments.\n\"Bitcoin is sort of becoming the new VIX , in sort of getting ahead of credit risk in the banking industry,\" Stutland said on \" Fast Money \" on Tuesday.\nThe CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, is a long-held measure of volatility and fear in the marketplace illustrated by way of S&P 500 stock options prices. The index is sometimes referred to as the market's \"fear gauge.\" But Stutland told CNBC that bitcoin is just as good of an indicator.\n\"T here is huge correlation right now between VIX and bitcoin 30 days ago, 30 trading days ago, t hat is starting to measure out credit risk in the market,\" Stutland said. \"That's what cryptocurrency is becoming. It's becoming a way to sort of de-risk yourself from credit risk in the banking industry.\"\nStutland said that makes sense considering cryptocurrency is still an unregulated way for investors to transfer capital.\n\"Bitcoin is a way to for investors to basically move their money off the balance sheets of banks and into their own wallets,\" he said. \"Essentially storing their money under their pillow in the form of virtual currency.\"\nAnd investors are more likely to be cautious with their money when banks have increased credit risks, Stutland said.\n\"As credit risk increases we get more volatility in the market,\" he said.\nThe VIX shot up to highs of 18.39 Tuesday, from Friday's lows of 12.59. The market also had a turbulent day Tuesday . All three major indexes closed lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down nearly 500 points at its lows.\nBitcoin, priced around $7,500 6:30 p.m. ET Tuesday, down from nearly $9,000 a month ago or close to $10,000 on May 5.
