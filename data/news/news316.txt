Isn't it safe to say that the number of hashes performed when \"block in the blockchain is hashed by every client\" is negligible in comparison? I'm looking at a significant \"etc, etc\" .. Perhaps, for blockchain maintenance/compaction, which remains quite a mystery to me. – fgrieu Oct 27 '17 at 17:04 1 Depends what you consider negligible. A rough Fermi estimation for this number would be for the blockchain (500,000 blocks * 1,000,000 total downloads) = 500,000,000,000 and for transactions (250,000,000,000 * 10,000 clients) = 2,500,000,000,000,000. So small in comparison to the mining hash rate, to be sure, but perhaps not negligible. – Luke Mlsna Oct 27 '17 at 17:12 1 Validating a single block can involve tens or hundreds of thousands of sha256.

Most tokens such as Ziliqa (ZIL) and 0x (ZRX) outperformed both cryptocurrencies, demonstrating gains of over 20 percent.\nEarlier this week, the Federal Reserve released a report which noted that the launch of bitcoin futures has had a negative impact on the bitcoin price, and that bitcoin has not been able to sustain its momentum since CME and CBOE introduced bitcoin futures to the US market.\n“The peak bitcoin price coincided with with the day bitcoin futures started trading on the CME… we argue these price dynamics are consistent with the rise and collapse of the home financing market in the 2000s,” said the Federal Reserve of San Francisco.\nAnalysts have argued that bitcoin futures have allowed institutional investors and retail traders to manipulate the bitcoin market by shorting the cryptocurrency and selling massive amounts of bitcoin contracts to cash out their short contracts.\nAs such, the cryptocurrency community did not necessarily react well to the entrance of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to the cryptocurrency market, until reports revealed that the parent company of NYSE has been preparing a proper bitcoin exchange, not a futures market.\nOver the past three days, the bitcoin price has recovered from $9,000 to $9,300, and is continuing to increase in value. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of bitcoin is 55, which signifies that the dominant cryptocurrency is in a neutral zone and is neither overbought or oversold. But, both exponential and simple moving averages show a negative short-term trend for bitcoin, which may allow the bitcoin price to remain in the $9,300 region.\nStill, analysts including Wall Street’s Fundstrat founder Tom Lee expressed his optimism towards bitcoin in the short-term given that many institutional investors and retail traders will be motivated to invest in the cryptocurrency market after the biggest cryptocurrency conference launches.\n“Already one of the largest crypto conferences in the world, attendance this year is up dramatically and coming at a time when Bitcoin/Crypto is down YTD. Hence, we expect the Consensus rally to be even larger than past years,” said Lee.\nTokens Ziliqa has seen a 25-fold increase in its value since its initial coin offering (ICO) in December and its recent 20 percent increase in price led the market valuation of ZIL to reach $1.4 billion. Other tokens such as VeChain (VEN) and ZRX have also recorded large gains against bitcoin and the US dollar, making up for their losses throughout the first quarter of 2018, a period during which tokens fell significantly more than major cryptocurrencies.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ziliqa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T13:11:30.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "69f927fc1f15aba30277214859138d10d260400e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_pozj1Z8NU88Qzypaqq3fGO3u9Uy6T5oDI0tGi9RUCFUWPhza7JPUxYDaDQkJxlqwQckHOEem0b5QVQM9LeCvgcnc", "site_full": "investorshub.advfn.com", "site": "advfn.com", "site_section": "http://investorshub.advfn.com/Bitcoin-Services-Inc-BTSC-30680/", "site_categories": ["investing", "stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Services Inc.

A number of Bitcoin investors are locking up their loot in underground vaults across the globe to prevent them from being stolen.\nXapo, a Hong Kong based company that provides Bitcoin wallet and cold storage services, now holds close to $10 billion worth of BTC in its vaults, Bloomberg reports .\nThat’s roughly 6 percent of BTC’s current market cap being stored by a single entity – making Xapo one of the largest cryptocurrency storage services on the planet.\nXapo is one of the first companies to capitalize on the security concerns associated with storing Bitcoins, which have been rampant pretty much since the virtual currency’s inception. In fact, the first major Bitcoin theft , of 25,000 BTC (worth $231 million at today’s market price), can be traced back to 2011, when Bitcoin was still worth $19.\nXapo’s clientele have the option of locking away their cryptocurrency in one of its vaults located in undisclosed physical locations across three different continents, guarded by biometric locks and armed guards. The private key to a customer’s wallet is stored in these vaults, and access is granted to the user only if their identity has been established beyond doubt.\nThe shortcomings with the usual wallet services force cryptocurrency holders to turn to such extreme methods to store their valued investments.\nExchange wallet services offer the simplest user experience, especially for frequent trading, but they are the worst when it comes to security . A number of exchanges have lost significant money of their users to hackers including Mt. Gox , Bitfinex , Poloniex , Bitstamp , and Bitfloor .\nOnline wallets are considered to be a safer choice, but even they are vulnerable to phishing attacks and compromise of private keys.\nWhile hardware wallets are considered even safer, researchers have shown that that these can be hacked too . In March, a 15-year-old programmer managed to hack Ledger Neno S and even disclosed the security flaw to the company.\nIt is worth noting that while Xapo’s services significantly improve the security concerns associated with Bitcoin storage, they kind of defeat the entire purpose of cryptocurrencies.\nLocking up your Bitcoins in remote physical locations doesn’t exactly sound like the ideal way to secure a supposedly revolutionary digital currency.\nIt takes upward of 48 hours for your Bitcoin to show up in your Xapo wallet from the company’s vaults if you want to withdraw them, that is on business days — your wait can stretch up to 4 days if you happen to catch the weekend in between.\nIf you intend to further trade your BTC for another cryptocurrency, there is an added wait and cost for transferring your BTC to an exchange wallet.\nXapo’s services are meaningful for HODLing Bitcoin for a long term like you would gold, and might suit major investors. But for people who hold smaller investments, or who like to frequently trade their cryptocurrencies, Xapo’s services are less than ideal. Both the cost incurred in the transactions and the time taken will be too high for it to be viable.\nXapo’s solution to the Bitcoin’s security problem is not efficient for mass adoption, and better solutions need to be figured out.\nWhile it’s interesting that a service like Xapo’s exists, it underscores the need for better solutions that all investors can take advantage of. Hopefully, we’ll see a better security option soon: the Ethereum Foundation is looking to fund projects that are trying solve the security problems faced by existing wallet services.

Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The leveraged nature of FX trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds and such may work against you as well as for you. Past results are no indication of future performance. Information contained this web site is intended for informational purposes only and was obtained from sources believed to be reliable.

You are welcome to issue IPO in the domestic markets,\" said Jiang Yang, vice chairman of CSRC.\nBitmain and Cancan, both from China, are the top two Bitcoin mining machine vendors globally. They design chips specially for Bitcoin mining.\nBesides Bitcoin mining, the machines and chips can be used in blockchain technologies, which are adopted in finance, logistics and other sectors.\nChina strengthened regulations on crypto-currencies, including Bitcoin and ICOs, and shut down Bitcoin trading platforms domestically.\nIn 2017, Canaan's revenue was 1.2 billion yuan (U.S.$190.5 million), 20 times the 2015 level. Profit last year was 300 million yuan, sharply up from 2.45 million yuan in 2015.

and jumped higher against the US Dollar. There was a break above a crucial declining channel with resistance at $9,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is currently struggling to settle above $9,400 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Bitcoin price is showing positive signs above $9,200 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD has to settle above the 100 hourly SMA to climb above $9,500 in the near term.\nBitcoin Price Trend After a downside correction, bitcoin price found a strong buying interest near the $9,000 level against the US Dollar. The price formed a low at $8,969 and started an upside move. It climbed higher and cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $9,959 high to $8,969 low. It opened the doors for more upsides and the price broke a couple of key hurdles near $9,180 and $9,200.\nMore importantly, there was a break above a crucial declining channel with resistance at $9,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair tested the next major resistance at $9,450 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It seems like buyers struggled to break the $9,450 resistance since it is the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $9,959 high to $8,969 low. It is currently consolidating gains near the $9,350 level and the 100 hourly SMA. Once there is a successful close above 100 SMA and $9,450, the price may resume its uptrend.\nLooking at the chart , there are many positive signs above the $9,200 support. As long as the price is stable and holds the bullish bias above $9,200, it is likely to break $9,450. The next stop for buyers could be $9,600 and $9,750.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is slowly moving in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is now well above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $9,200\nMajor Resistance Level – $9,450\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Broke Key Barrier appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T12:19:16.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1c47c75ca87aaa4f891fa076bf809c401d14f8ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSA3vSZX73vDm1CrvEpKLTdb78GMuVl2K6e9e2h9UH3BadM7Ibm1CCe_rJxILQQujHL7eMlf04ji_7VE7TzI7CLHj7lwD2bsj0zmhrHk.QAsPel0x67eyQiwpfUsi25GNNrWwX2b1szE5BQo9yG1MRJ", "site_full": "harounkola.com", "site": "harounkola.com", "site_section": "http://harounkola.com/feed", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Haroun Kola", "title": "Trade Bitcoin & Ethereum in South African Rands With GT247", "title_full": "Trade Bitcoin & Ethereum in South African Rands With GT247", "published": "2018-05-10T12:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i0.wp.com/harounkola.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/trade-bitcoin-ethereum-gt247.jpg?fit=1188%2C626&#038;ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1c47c75ca87aaa4f891fa076bf809c401d14f8ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSA3vSZX73vDm1CrvEpKLTdb78GMuVl2K6e9e2h9UH3BadM7Ibm1CCe_rJxILQQujHL7eMlf04ji_7VE7TzI7CLHj7lwD2bsj0zmhrHk.QAsPel0x67eyQiwpfUsi25GNNrWwX2b1szE5BQo9yG1MRJ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Haroun Kola", "published": "2018-05-10T12:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "Trade Bitcoin & Ethereum in South African Rands With GT247", "text": "by Haroun Kola | May 10, 2018 | GT247 It’s launch time, CryptoCurrencies are here!\nBitcoin and Ethereum are now available to trade on the GT247 MetaTrader 5 platform.

A number of Bitcoin investors are locking up their loot in underground vaults across the globe to prevent them from being stolen.\nXapo, a Hong Kong based company that provides Bitcoin wallet and cold storage services, now holds close to $10 billion worth of BTC in its vaults, Bloomberg reports .\nThat’s roughly 6 percent of BTC’s current market cap being stored by a single entity – making Xapo one of the largest cryptocurrency storage services on the planet.\nXapo is one of the first companies to capitalize on the security concerns associated with storing Bitcoins, which have been rampant pretty much since the virtual currency’s inception. In fact, the first major Bitcoin theft , of 25,000 BTC (worth $231 million at today’s market price), can be traced back to 2011, when Bitcoin was still worth $19.\nXapo’s clientele have the option of locking away their cryptocurrency in one of its vaults located in undisclosed physical locations across three different continents, guarded by biometric locks and armed guards. The private key to a customer’s wallet is stored in these vaults, and access is granted to the user only if their identity has been established beyond doubt.\nThe shortcomings with the usual wallet services force cryptocurrency holders to turn to such extreme methods to store their valued investments.\nExchange wallet services offer the simplest user experience, especially for frequent trading, but they are the worst when it comes to security . A number of exchanges have lost significant money of their users to hackers including Mt. Gox , Bitfinex , Poloniex , Bitstamp , and Bitfloor .\nOnline wallets are considered to be a safer choice, but even they are vulnerable to phishing attacks and compromise of private keys.\nWhile hardware wallets are considered even safer, researchers have shown that that these can be hacked too . In March, a 15-year-old programmer managed to hack Ledger Neno S and even disclosed the security flaw to the company.\nIt is worth noting that while Xapo’s services significantly improve the security concerns associated with Bitcoin storage, they kind of defeat the entire purpose of cryptocurrencies.\nLocking up your Bitcoins in remote physical locations doesn’t exactly sound like the ideal way to secure a supposedly revolutionary digital currency.\nIt takes upward of 48 hours for your Bitcoin to show up in your Xapo wallet from the company’s vaults if you want to withdraw them, that is on business days — your wait can stretch up to 4 days if you happen to catch the weekend in between.\nIf you intend to further trade your BTC for another cryptocurrency, there is an added wait and cost for transferring your BTC to an exchange wallet.\nXapo’s services are meaningful for HODLing Bitcoin for a long term like you would gold, and might suit major investors. But for people who hold smaller investments, or who like to frequently trade their cryptocurrencies, Xapo’s services are less than ideal. Both the cost incurred in the transactions and the time taken will be too high for it to be viable.\nXapo’s solution to the Bitcoin’s security problem is not efficient for mass adoption, and better solutions need to be figured out.\nWhile it’s interesting that a service like Xapo’s exists, it underscores the need for better solutions that all investors can take advantage of. Hopefully, we’ll see a better security option soon: the Ethereum Foundation is looking to fund projects that are trying solve the security problems faced by existing wallet services.

Hourly chart\nAs of writing, bitcoin is attempting a break above $9,380 on Bitfinex, above which a major resistance is seen at $9,442 - the 200-hour moving average (MA). Meanwhile, a strong support is seen at $9,228 (marked by a circle).\nThe momentum studies are biased bearish. For instance, the 100-hour MA is trending south in favor of the bears and the 50-hour MA is still gradually descending (yet to bottom out or shed bearish bias).\nAs a result, a convincing move above $9,442 could be a tough task.\nFurther, the short-term moving averages in the daily chart have rolled over in favor of the bears. Daily chart\nThe bearish crossover between the 5-day MA and the 10-day MA indicates a short-term (5 days) bullish-to-bearish trend change. It also indicates the pullback from the recent high of $9,990 has not run its course. View A break below $9,228 (support on the hourly chart) would add credence to the bearish 5-day MA and 10-day MA crossover and open the doors for a drop to $8,980 and $8,868 (100-day moving average). A daily close (as per UTC) below $8,652 (April 26 low) would confirm a bearish reversal. On the higher side, a daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA (currently located at $9,452) would signal the end of the pullback from the recent high of $9,990.\nArrows image via Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/yellow-line-on-high-way-arrow-296596352?src=v5Ffgl-d_p7GNjKME4vKgw-2-29", "https://twitter.com/CoinDeskMarkets/status/994172407551348736"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin rally drop", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T13:13:59.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3e22bc73086a1925855a6e0919c62a17796aae88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbPMVMSdwD3w5qkNktIu.14-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "In Germany, bitcoin was recognized as legal tender", "title_full": "In Germany, bitcoin was recognized as legal tender", "published": "2018-05-10T11:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.531, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3e22bc73086a1925855a6e0919c62a17796aae88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbPMVMSdwD3w5qkNktIu.14-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "tdtduy", "published": "2018-05-10T11:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "In Germany, bitcoin was recognized as legal tender", "text": "Quote: from: lehuong on May 08, 2018, 03:56:20 AM itcoin has been recognized as a legal currency and taxable in Germany.

He stated that the volatile cryptocurrency is unreliable and can’t be used for anything concrete. The price of one bitcoin has soared past $2,000 last year to reach above $19,000 in mid-December. Since then the crypto-currency has since lost more than half its value. It is currently trading at $9,300 . Bitcoin has raised approximately $9.8 billion through sales of new coins, or ICOs, since 2016, according to reports. \"As an asset class, you're not producing anything and so you shouldn't expect it to go up. It's kind of a pure 'greater fool theory' type of investment,\" Gates said. \"I agree I would short it if there was an easy way to do it,\" he said. \"Bitcoin and ICOs, I believe completely [they're some] of the crazier, speculative things,\" Gates said. He stated that he had received a bitcoin for his birthday, but had sold it a few years later. Gates is on the board of Warren Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) and stated his views while speaking from Omaha, Nebraska, where the conglomerate held its annual shareholders meeting over the weekend. Warren Buffett has also been bearish on cryptocurrency in general for quite some time now. Buffet had stated a while back, “In terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending.

However, the cryptocurrency bounced back in the afternoon and managed to finish the day with modest gains. Bitcoin closed the session at $9,325.28, up from its opening level of $9,223.73.\nWhile Bitcoin’s advance has slowed down in today’s trading, the digital currency has held above the $9,300 level. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price was hovering around $9,375, according to data from cryptocurrency tracker Coinmarketcap.\nThe current price levels give Bitcoin a total market capitalisation of around $160 billion, which represents 36.5% of the total value of all cryptocurrencies. Since its inception, Bitcoin has remained the dominant force in the crypto space, but that could change in the future, according to one tech investor.\nSpeaking on CNBC’s TV programme “Squawk Box” on Wednesday, North Island chairman Glenn Hutchins said that the original cryptocurrency “could turn out to be Betamax”. His comment referenced the infamous videotape format war of the late 1970s and the 1980s, which was ultimately won by JVC’s VHS format, while Sony’s Betamax was relegated to a niche market position.\nHutchins argued yesterday that the VHS of the cryptocurrency space could be a Bitcoin alternative like Ethereum, Ripple or Litecoin.\n“The token of exchange at the heart of the math solution that leads the technology will be there,\" Hutchins said, as quoted by CNBC. \"Different tokens will be used for different applications.\"\nHe also sees Bitcoin as the digital equivalent of an industrial metal, rather than gold.\n\"I think it's more like copper, like an industrial metal that's used for a purpose to drive an outcome,\" Hutchins said. \"There will be a token that's used just like there's an industrial metal that's used for wiring.”\nIn today’s trading, the Bitcoin price stood at $9,372.97, as of 09:41 BST. The digital currency has gained 2.8% in the past 24 hours.\nFor further information on how to buy and trade Bitcoin, see our comprehensive Bitcoin guide.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/09/bitcoin-could-flop-like-vhs-competitor-betamax-tech-investor-glenn-hutchins-says.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coinmarketcap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimitar bogdanov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T18:22:40.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1192741075b1b0627cc586e122200399085a43c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSZKemHu4_3GvBd8AbEfb53YRa1dgtvaWkZAPAD3_qWStgqAK.VI3FRxUwwrujU0JbTkm0SczcPVH", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ziliqa Record Big Gains in Crypto Market Rebound", "title_full": "Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ziliqa Record Big Gains in Crypto Market Rebound", "published": "2018-05-10T11:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1192741075b1b0627cc586e122200399085a43c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSZKemHu4_3GvBd8AbEfb53YRa1dgtvaWkZAPAD3_qWStgqAK.VI3FRxUwwrujU0JbTkm0SczcPVH", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-10T11:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ziliqa Record Big Gains in Crypto Market Rebound", "text": "Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ziliqa Record Big Gains in Crypto Market Rebound\nJoseph Young\nThe cryptocurrency market has rebounded over the past 24 hours, as the bitcoin price rose by around 3 percent and other major cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash recorded gains in the 3 to 8 percent range.

Greg Tusar, the former electronic trading chief at Goldman Sachs is reported to be one of the startup's co-founders.\nSimplifying the Trading Process for Institutional Investment Executing large orders in the crypto market is a tedious process. This is due to the fragmented nature of the cryptocurrency market. There are numerous exchange platforms all over the world with no central connection between them. Also, many of these platforms impose limits on trading volumes and deposits/withdrawals. As a result, many large-scale crypto transactions are executed over-the-counter.\nWith cryptocurrency prices notoriously volatile, the time taken to execute a significant trade could result in enormous losses for the trader. To solve this issue, Tagomi plans to appropriate an automated bulk trading process from the mainstream market called \"smart order routing.\" A smart order router (SOR) is a software that makes it easier to execute large buy and sell orders. The software sends the orders simultaneously to different trading venues.\nUsing advanced routing rules and pre-programmed algorithms, the SOR can execute trades across these different trading venues. According to a Wall Street Journal article , Tagomi is planning to develop a similar tool to handle big crypto trades. The company has raised over $15 million in investment and is in the process of refining its corporate strategy.\nFounders Fund Seriously Investing in Bitcoin Peter Thiel, the billionaire PayPal co-founder and Facebook investor, is a bitcoin believer. Speaking during a gathering of the New York Economic club in March, Thiel declared that he was \"long\" on bitcoin .\nAccording to him, bitcoin might be a bubble, but it could also shield investors from an uncertain economic climate. Thiel is a noted libertarian and is a proponent of the notion that bitcoin could become the digital equivalent of gold.\nFounders Fund has been investing seriously in bitcoin as of late. There are reports that the firm acquired between $15 million and $20 millions worth of bitcoin in 2017 alone. The firm has an asset management portfolio worth an estimated $3 billion.\nWhat do you think about Peter Thiel helping his billionaire friends to invest in bitcoin? Do you think the proposed bitcoin smart order routers will make sizeable large-scale bitcoin trading easier?

One BTC is selling for $9,289 right now, down from $9,764 dollars last Tuesday. Litecoin is trading lower by $4 dollars to $157 per coin.\nBitcoin Rally Stalls\nAs noted above, the rally in BTC/USD is somewhat stalling. Prices topped out at $9,987 dollars five days ago and since then it’s been a slow ride down. Early this morning we dipped below the $9,000 round figure briefly but recovered quickly for a second time. However the bulls may not be so lucky the third time around, another retest may lead to a breakdown lower.\nThe potential trend-ending support stands at the $8,815 swing low although not far from here there’s more decent support at the $8,650 swing low. A new downtrend may commence on a decisive break below the $8,000 round figure. Further down there’s some support around the former swing low at $7,287 dollars.\nBut a stronger area to watch out for is the $6,420 to $6,600 range. This is where we bottomed out last time. This year’s low at $5,980 dollars is another notable level. A clearing of these support levels may open the door to the $5,000 round figure. There’s no change on the longer-term charts. Here the weekly is still range-bound with the monthly keeping a bullish bias.\nLitecoin Down $4 Dollars\nLitecoin is again following big brother, this time lower. Prices are Quote: d at $157 dollars right now, down by 2.5 percent in a week. The sentiment on the daily charts is similar to BTC/USD. The bullish trend remains but the momentum has been lacking during the past few days. Litecoin topped out at $184.74 dollars four days ago and it’s been drifting lower ever since.\nThe bears need a break below the important $142 swing low to end the bullish trend. A clean break below the $136 figure could re-start the downtrend. Further down there’s more support at $123.50 followed by the the $108.44 swing low.

News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites.

For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system .

Bitcoin reaches above $10,000, and the aether above $800. The Internet unfolds a new drama — the participants reveal another plot, based on “drawing” volumes, prices and even the number of mined coins on some resources. The whole story is reminiscent of the familiar Forex cuisine “painting” arbitrary best for them numbers. According to the calculations of speculators, on the site OKEX about 93% of the volume simply made up. Simultaneously, Goldman Sachs makes impossible a couple of years ago the statement: “We came to the conclusion that bitcoin is not a hoax”, and soon leading investment Bank launch “design forward” — his version of futures. Of course, the direct participation in the auction of the question, but the difference with recent times, when the bitcoin is mainly seen as a means of payment for the purchase of weapons and drugs Darknet, tangible. But Warren Buffett at the annual meeting of his Foundation traditionally criticizes cryptocurrencies, they are predicting a bad end after reducing the digital euphoria. Charlie Munger, Vice-President of the company, expressed figuratively: “If someone starts to trade with excrement, you will be afraid to stay on the sidelines and miss out on their growth?”. Apparently, to talk about the mass recognition of cryptocurrency institutional investors too early, despite rumors that the major foundations interested in scriptactive and wait for the moment to enter the position. 10,000 and the emergence of “physical” bitcoins with the value of 0.01 and 0.05 BTC from the Singapore startup is unlikely to improve the situation. Overall, despite positive expectations in the long term, to predict the growth of quotations in the near future difficult. While the cryptocurrency market is recovering, growth of special interest to him has not yet occurred — the number of search queries in Google it is significantly lower than winter rates, and growth of new wallets behind last year’s values. In the last article talked about the seasonality on the market — a natural falling of quotations in the beginning of the year and a new sharp rise in June and July, and the return to the market “risk-on”. In short, if there are positive changes in queries, increase transactions and the number of new wallets, 2018 is no exception. The break of the 200-day moving average (MA) will be crucial for bitcoin. If we analyze price movements in the past, we will notice that after each serious deviation from the course from MA has been rolled back over the middle line, and then a long consolidation as long as to the current prices did not fit the average, its penetration and new growth. So it was in the past, and apparently will happen again. The only difference is that “rally” in 2017 was much longer, and quotes experienced a parabolic rise at the beginning of the year, the gap between the indicators was 63%, while in December the difference was as much as 260%.

A large number of Reddit users appreciated the ingenuity of the artist, which placed the object of street art QR code to the grateful audience could translate a donation in bitcoin.\nInspired by the looks of Satoshi Nakamoto and bitcoin, Pascal made cryptocurrency and decentralization a Central theme of his work. In his works, bitcoin is not only creativity but also the method by which the artist can profit. Posted on jobs QR codes is simultaneously a Manifesto against centralization and censorship and an instrument of liberation. Thus, the artist’s interest in technology serves two purposes: it helps to examine how cryptocurrencies challenge to art mediators, and testing a new payment system.\nDepicting world-famous painter Rembrandt, whose life was periodically marred by financial difficulties, despite the recognition of his talents, the artist addresses the topic of arts funding and provides a solution in the form of a game. This work was actively discussed at the forum Reddit, but this is not the first picture where the artist has placed the QR code.\n“The first time I put a QR code from a bitcoin wallet on their work in November 2017. I drew a picture of a child asking his father about what money is, and put a QR code next to the signature to work. I was not sure, did so, someone before me, but I wanted to check whether people will be able to support street artists donations. I did it in deference to the book “Internet money” Andreas Antonopoulos” – says the artist.\nSince then, according to the artist, he has received more than $ 1,000 (about 0.11 BTC) in bitcoin from fans of his work.\nPascal first learned about bitcoin in early 2014 year, but it took him four years to find a way to use technology in his art:\n“I did not understand much earlier. Thought it was a new PayPal. But last may I got really inspired by a new concept of money… I was thinking about the best ways to use technology for artists… It can liberate us from institutions and galleries… the Most interesting aspect is the decentralization, horizontal P2P system. I believe that art and the process of its creation need it… Street art is quite a costly, in terms of materials and work. But instead of such ways of fundraising as [a crowdfunding platform] Ulule, I was looking for a solution that would allow direct financial interaction with the audience… Bitcoin is perfect for this.”\nThe topic of cryptocurrency, the interaction of technology and society, is of concern to many representatives of creative professions. Artist Andy Bauch in his installations of Lego, representing, at first glance, the simple abstract patterns, coded the key, finds that the audience has received the bitcoins. Previously, we reported that the Creative Union of artists of Russia in April announced a contest “Era of bitcoin”.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pascal boyart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pascal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rembrandt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T11:41:56.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc787286e8bcc3d95d2f87f413e21e412feffab7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY3qlUlIlUyni_XdIPmV1eAIR8iNqeEDbx8pATfPrGpQsz0kSQhd1fZmmjdUHGIlRNw--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "London-Based LBX Exchange Adds Bitcoin Cash to Its Offerings", "title_full": "London-Based LBX Exchange Adds Bitcoin Cash to Its Offerings", "published": "2018-05-10T11:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dc787286e8bcc3d95d2f87f413e21e412feffab7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY3qlUlIlUyni_XdIPmV1eAIR8iNqeEDbx8pATfPrGpQsz0kSQhd1fZmmjdUHGIlRNw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-10T11:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "London-Based LBX Exchange Adds Bitcoin Cash to Its Offerings", "text": "London Block Exchange has listed Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) among its cryptocurrency offerings.

He began mining for Bitcoin while he was a student a Utah Valley University. He continued to accumulate more of the cryptocurrency as he made his way through life over the next few years, seeing his investment culminate with Bitcoin's highest recorded price amidst a crypto-craze late last year.\nIt appears that Shamo's wealth is not a result of early investment or a lucrative trade. Law enforcement says that he utilized the internet to sell narcotics and accepted Bitcoin for the transactions.\nShamo is accused of selling fentanyl, a deadly opioid that is 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine. He allegedly ordered his supply from China, where authorities suspect the purest form of the drug is manufactured.\nLaw enforcement raided Shamo's house in 2016, discovering more than 500 bitcoins in the residence along with cash and pills. The bitcoins were valued around $500,000 at the time of Shamo's arrest but have since skyrocketed to over $10 million since then. He is currently awaiting trial in prison while prosecutors investigate a number of fatal overdoses that they believe are connected to the alleged drug ring.\nCurrency of Choice A Senate committee comprised of undercover investigators released a report earlier this year detailing the activities of six different websites offering fentanyl, including users and potential overdose deaths connected with sales. The report was part of a yearlong investigation into the international supply chain that runs directly from China to the doorsteps of Americans.\nOne thing that stood out to the Senate committee was that Bitcoin was the preferred payment choice. Authorities maintain that the supposed anonymity of cryptocurrencies makes them popular with users on the Dark Web.\nLaw enforcement points to the infamous Silk Road as an example of people using Bitcoin to buy and sell drugs online. Last year, AlphaBay, a marketplace of illicit goods, was shut down by the US Justice Department. This shutdown resulted in the seizing of 144,000 bitcoins, valued at $48 million USD.\nNow law enforcement says Bitcoin is helping fuel the ongoing opioid crisis in the United States. They maintain that criminals are using virtual currencies to buy drugs online from places like China, which are then shipped into the country via the US Postal Service. Unlike other mail carriers, the US Post Office does not require key pieces of information for a shipment, such as what is contained in the shipment or who the shipper is.\nOverall, authorities report that the influx of opioid drugs into the country is increasing at a dramatic rate. Police have seen an astounding 375 percent increase in opioid seizures from 2016 through 2017.\nGovernment is springing into action, looking at crafting anti-money laundering bills that target Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies . Attorney General Jeff Sessions has pushed for such legislation, stating:\nIt will help us make more arrests of those selling these deadly substances online as well as shut down the marketplaces that these drug dealers use — and ultimately help us reduce addiction and overdoses in this community and across the nation.\nStill, all this attention paid to Bitcoin over the opioid crisis may be somewhat hysterical. It's a certainty that not every user is paying for their drugs in crypto. In fact, a recent study showed that less than 1% of all Bitcoin transactions were criminal in origin, and a majority of those transactions were made to Europe, not Asia.\nAs for Aaron Shamo, his bitcoins were sold by law enforcement in January when the cryptocurrency was selling for $11,000 each.\nDo you think Bitcoin plays a role in the ongoing opioid crisis, or is the government looking for a convenient scapegoat?

The jury has been called on by a U.S. District Court in which businessman Maksim Zaslavskiy faces fraud charges related to two ICOs that regulators allege were in violation of securities laws. Zaslavskiy, who pleaded not guilty to the charges in December, has argued that the ICO token sales did not constitute securities offerings, moving to dismiss the Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department case against him, according to Coindesk. The jury's decision on whether ICOs are securities could set an important precedent in the crypto space, but it might not happen for some time. Judge Raymond Dearie didn't decide on the matter in preliminary hearings this week, instead opting to let the jury decide when the case goes to trial in January 2019.\nSEC Warns Against Blanket ICO Classification\nEarlier this week, SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce told a crowd at the Medici Conference that \"sandbox\" regulation for ICOs won't work. \"My fear that regulators will grab hold of the shovel and buckets is why I am often wary of so-called regulatory sandboxes. I am entirely in favor of finding ways to make appropriate regulatory allowances that clear the way for innovation to flourish. What troubles me about sandboxes, however, is that the regulator is typically sitting there next to the entrepreneurs,\" Pierce said. The commissioner went on to say that, in her experience, all ICOs are securities. But she clarified, \"Given the undeveloped nature of this area, I am wary of any blanket designation for all ICOs,\" and urged regulators to \"evaluate the facts and circumstances of each offering.\"\nGary Cohn 'Not a Big Believer in Bitcoin'\nGary Cohn, former leader of President Donald Trump's National Economic Council, told CNBC, \"I'm not a big believer in bitcoin. I am a believer in blockchain technology.\" Cohn then added that he does think \"we will have a global cryptocurrency at some point,\" noting that such a development in digital assets would hinge on mining costs and cost of electricity, to name a few factors. In that world, the global cryptocurrency \"will be a more easily understood cryptocurrency that will probably have some blockchain technology behind it, but it will be much more easily understood how it's created and how it moves and how people can use it,\" Cohn said.\nWinklevoss Twins Win Patent\nTyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twins behind the Gemini cryptocurrency platform and of Facebook (FB - Get Report) fame, have won a patent claim that aims to settle exchange traded products (ETPs) that hold cryptocurrency. The Winklevoss' patent, awarded to their Winklevoss IP fund, outlines a system that can execute transactions for ETPs holding cryptocurrencies from high-market-value bitcoin to lesser known assets like dogecoin. It's the latest step in the Winklevoss' goal to gain approval for cryptocurrency ETFs to trade on larger-scale markets.\nRecommended for you:\nALL comments are In My Own OPINION.

Like industrial metals used for purpose to drive an outcome.”\nMr Hutchin added: “Bitcoin could turn out to be Betamax and, in other words, you could have something like XRP or ethereum or litecoin that actually becomes the token that is used.”\nBetamax was an early form of video cassette that was a competitor to VHS tapes.\nDuring the 1980s, both Betamax and VHS fought for dominance and VHS eventually won.\nDespite Sony’s Betamax offering a better quality video, VHS won out due to it offering a more affordable home viewing experience.\nThe tech investor explained that one digital currency will eventually be accepted by the general public. He said: “The token of exchange at the heart of the math solution that leads the technology will be there – different tokens will be used for different applications.”\nMr Hutchins said bitcoin does not have to be the only token. He said: “It doesn’t have to be the only one because different tokens will be used for different applications.”\nBitcoin price was at $9,268.85 at 11:20 (GMT) on Thursday, according to CoinDesk.\nBillionaire investor Warren Buffett said on Monday that bitcoin is “rat poison squared” and the fascination with the cryptocurrency has caused the price to rally.\nBut BBC Apprentice Winner, Mark Wright is a BTC investor and a firm believer in cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin was trading at $9,318.9 by 11:43AM ET (03:43 GMT) on the Bitfinex exchange, up 1.9% over the previous 24 hours. Ethereum, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was up 2.8% at $754.10 on the Bitfinex exchange.\nRipple’s XRP token was 1.8% lower at $0.79176 on the Poloniex exchange. Meanwhile, Litecoin slipped 0.2% to $159.04.\nThe cryptocurrency markets were under pressured since the beginning of the week after Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett called Bitcoin “rat poison” and that the “asset itself is creating nothing”. Co-founder of Microsoft Bill Gates echoed Buffet’s comment and said he would bet against Bitcoin if he could.\nReports that Nasdaq chief executive Adena Friedman is bullish on cryptocurrency received some attention on Thursday. In an interview with CNN, Friedman said that cryptocurrency feels like the “right next step in the space of currency” because a “globalized payment mechanism is a natural fit for the cross-border digital economy.” “How it evolves and which of the cryptocurrencies may or may not be the one that ultimately gets embraced, I think that really the jury is still out on that.\nBut I do think the idea of a more globalized payment mechanism that is more efficient than what we have today allows for money to transfer across countries and certainly supports the Internet economy.” Friedman then noted that she believes blockchain technology will first take place gradually in markets with less regulation or high levels of inefficiency before being adopted in the global financial system. “The first uses of the blockchain will be in the less regulated markets, less efficient markets, more bespoke markets.

Recently, a new wallet that goes by a similar name — Electrum Pro — popped up with the domain name, electrum.com, clearly attempting to divert users from the official website at electrum.org . The team behind Electrum now claims Electrum Pro is a malware meant to steal bitcoins. To make things worse, Electrum Pro comes above the legitimate Electrum on Google search because of Google Ads, a fact that will clearly trip up many users. The team behind Electrum has given a detailed explanation on Github which anyone can follow to find the rogue lines of code on Electrum Pro which steals recovery seeds and sends them to the attackers. Aecovery seed is a feature in most modern wallets where random words are generated that can be used to recover a wallet if the keys are lost. Once these keys are transmitted, the scammers can use it to retrieve user wallets along with all their funds. This is not the first time a fraudulent Electrum wallet has appeared. Scammers have registered similar domains, hosting an infected version of the software for users to download. However, this is the first time scammers have been able to use the electrum.com domain. The website looks reasonably professional, and it is hard to identify it as a fraud unless you have been to the original site before. They have a slightly different logo and claim to be a fork of the legitimate Electrum wallet. Electrum claims the malware is only available in the Windows and OS X versions of ElectrumPro. The Linux version remains unaffected, probably because the scammers did not want to have it in plain sight. To combat these problems, Electrum recommends users check the GPG signatures before they start using the wallet. In addition to GPG signatures, Electrum is working towards verifying the wallet using Windows native scheme. Also, some point, they intend to have the official app on Mac App Store to avoid similar scams. If you have recently installed Electrum, make sure you installed the official version from electrum.org and not from any other source. If you mistakenly used the malicious wallet, move your bitcoins immediately and remove the application from your computer.

Before diving into the process, you may be wondering what is cold storage? In simple terms, cold storage refers to keeping your Bitcoin Core (BTC) completely offline. Cold storage, also known as a cold storage wallet, is the opposite of a hot wallet where your BTC is kept online. Since Bitcoin Core is a digital asset, keeping them online increases your risk or attack surface for having your bitcoin stolen when kept online using a custodial service. By keeping your bitcoin in cold storage, at https://wiki.bitcoin.com/w/Cold_storage your attack surface is greatly diminished. (Update: Bitcoin Core is less usable as money due to much higher fees and delayed transaction times.\nThe Core team has also expressed an interest in keeping these fees high since they view BTC as a “store-of-value” and not something to be transacted on a daily basis. In contrast, Bitcoin Cash’s transaction fees cost pennies and payments can be validated even with zero confirmations. These facts make BCH the ideal cryptocurrency for sending and receiving money anywhere in the world.) Getting started. The first step to getting your Bitcoin Core into cold storage is creating an offline Bitcoin address. This address will have both a public and private key-pair which never goes online (until you’re ready to spend it). With this guide, we will show you how to make a free cold storage wallet using the paper wallet method. Setting up a paper wallet. Setting up your cold storage paper wallet is fairly simple and requires very little technical knowledge. The first step will be to go to the Bitcoin.com paper wallet tool here at https://tools.bitcoin.com/paper-wallet/.\nBefore doing anything else, while on this page you will want to save it locally to your computer. To save a web page to your local machine, press Ctrl-S and save the file as a complete webpage (to your desktop for example). After saving, simply close out the open Bitcoin.com paper wallet tool page. Then disconnect your computer from the internet; don’t worry, you only need it offline temporarily for this task. After disconnecting from the internet, open the saved file (on your desktop). Move your mouse around on the page and/or type some random characters into the text box to create extra entropy (randomness). By doing this, you create a random Bitcoin address that has both a public and private key-pair. Since you saved the file locally and are not connected to the internet, the Bitcoin address you created was done completely offline. Print the page.\nThe next step is making an offline copy of your Bitcoin address which you can later load with Bitcoin for a complete cold storage solution. While on the locally saved paper wallet page, while still disconnected from the internet, click on the Print button. Warning: before printing the page, make sure your printer is also offline (not connected to the internet through Wi-Fi for example). Once you are sure, print the page. Congratulations, the hard part is over! You have now created an offline Bitcoin address and made a hard copy of it locally for safekeeping. On the printed page should be the public Bitcoin address and QR code with the corresponding private key and QR code. We strongly recommend that you store the paper wallet somewhere secure, such as a fireproof safe. You can now safely connect back to the internet.

We were in the correction phase for first 3 to 4 months and then when the price started gaining upward momentum, investors started selling as they were waiting for the opportunity to exit at a good level which resulted in a minor price fall. However, I think we are done with it and now price will start recovering for the rest of the year.\nCorrect, if you look at the price before the month of December of 2017 you see that the price was close to 11000 and now the current price is close to 9000, which means that almost all the growth that we saw in December was artificial, but the growth that we saw in the previous months was real and that is why the price came back to those levels.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T06:13:01.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "beeb60a4d4917f584366a51c5dc2f3647f82348a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYM.OJ3Ir8YklW9LrnNolnLshOo1_1uxYWe8oxYqIB1EWVwsuRyqhgJiFV7nbgsShchN3NBs8oBEr6iF9WpkQft", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : btc", "title": "Are these the official repos for Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin ABC?", "title_full": "Are these the official repos for Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin ABC? : btc", "published": "2018-05-10T10:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "beeb60a4d4917f584366a51c5dc2f3647f82348a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYM.OJ3Ir8YklW9LrnNolnLshOo1_1uxYWe8oxYqIB1EWVwsuRyqhgJiFV7nbgsShchN3NBs8oBEr6iF9WpkQft", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "N0tMyRealAcct", "published": "2018-05-10T10:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Are these the official repos for Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin ABC?", "text": "https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/ https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc/\n submitted by /u/N0tMyRealAcct\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc/", "https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T05:50:22.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "da5ad3c77cdfa542200ccc36c2c7c78e91f087e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQWg6KROh8B31Zvy2xF2SGijtAyU0TM.DUxtjSsEUdmfnBMYehVSPKH9AAMIl.1shtjDdwk7o2kam3fi6fgCOsdQuR3s51P1i_jj8sbCCGkUw--", "site_full": "www.retailnews.asia", "site": "retailnews.asia", "site_section": "http://www.retailnews.asia/feed/rss", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Retail News Asia", "title": "Vietnamese government fines illegal Bitcoin trading site", "title_full": "Vietnamese government fines illegal Bitcoin trading site", "published": "2018-05-10T10:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.retailnews.asia/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin-Dollar-1280x840.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "da5ad3c77cdfa542200ccc36c2c7c78e91f087e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQWg6KROh8B31Zvy2xF2SGijtAyU0TM.DUxtjSsEUdmfnBMYehVSPKH9AAMIl.1shtjDdwk7o2kam3fi6fgCOsdQuR3s51P1i_jj8sbCCGkUw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Retail Asia", "published": "2018-05-10T10:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "Vietnamese government fines illegal Bitcoin trading site", "text": "Vietnam’s HDBank to absorb PGBank The firm claimed to have a license to trade the cryptocurrency, but was hit by a $1,750 fine. Vietnam’s information ministry has fined a company that claimed to be the first website to be certified to exchange bitcoin in Vietnam for illegal social networking and setting up an illegal site. Bitcoin Vietnam, which is based in District 4, Ho Chi Minh City, received a VND40 million ($1,750) penalty from the Vietnam Radio, Television and Electronic Information Department under the Ministry of Information and Communications. Nguyen Tran Bao Phuong, the legal representative for Bitcoin Vietnam, said they were looking into the charges. The company is in a transition period, so its business registration code had been revoked before the decision was made, she said . “Bitcoin Vietnam is a cryptocurrency exchange. We do not yet have a license to offer intermediate services, but we are not operating illegally. The company is closely following any new regulations about Bitcoin, and is willing to comply with any new law,” Phuong said. The company opened in 2013 and is certified to buy and sell Bitcoin, according the company’s website. However, in a recent interview, a representative admitted that the company’s license is only for “financial advisory” purposes. Over the last four years, the company has launched a number of websites such as bitcoin.vn and vbtc.vn. The State Bank of Vietnam does not recognise virtual currencies as a legal form of payment, and distribution or use of digital currencies is not protected by law.

Before diving into the process, you may be wondering what is cold storage? In simple terms, cold storage refers to keeping your Bitcoin Core (BTC) completely offline. Cold storage, also known as a cold storage wallet, is the opposite of a hot wallet where your BTC is kept online. Since Bitcoin Core is a digital asset, keeping them online increases your risk or attack surface for having your bitcoin stolen when kept online using a custodial service. By keeping your bitcoin in cold storage, at https://wiki.bitcoin.com/w/Cold_storage your attack surface is greatly diminished. (Update: Bitcoin Core is less usable as money due to much higher fees and delayed transaction times.\nThe Core team has also expressed an interest in keeping these fees high since they view BTC as a “store-of-value” and not something to be transacted on a daily basis. In contrast, Bitcoin Cash’s transaction fees cost pennies and payments can be validated even with zero confirmations. These facts make BCH the ideal cryptocurrency for sending and receiving money anywhere in the world.) Getting started. The first step to getting your Bitcoin Core into cold storage is creating an offline Bitcoin address. This address will have both a public and private key-pair which never goes online (until you’re ready to spend it). With this guide, we will show you how to make a free cold storage wallet using the paper wallet method. Setting up a paper wallet. Setting up your cold storage paper wallet is fairly simple and requires very little technical knowledge. The first step will be to go to the Bitcoin.com paper wallet tool here at https://tools.bitcoin.com/paper-wallet/.\nBefore doing anything else, while on this page you will want to save it locally to your computer. To save a web page to your local machine, press Ctrl-S and save the file as a complete webpage (to your desktop for example). After saving, simply close out the open Bitcoin.com paper wallet tool page. Then disconnect your computer from the internet; don’t worry, you only need it offline temporarily for this task. After disconnecting from the internet, open the saved file (on your desktop). Move your mouse around on the page and/or type some random characters into the text box to create extra entropy (randomness). By doing this, you create a random Bitcoin address that has both a public and private key-pair. Since you saved the file locally and are not connected to the internet, the Bitcoin address you created was done completely offline. Print the page.\nThe next step is making an offline copy of your Bitcoin address which you can later load with Bitcoin for a complete cold storage solution. While on the locally saved paper wallet page, while still disconnected from the internet, click on the Print button. Warning: before printing the page, make sure your printer is also offline (not connected to the internet through Wi-Fi for example). Once you are sure, print the page. Congratulations, the hard part is over! You have now created an offline Bitcoin address and made a hard copy of it locally for safekeeping. On the printed page should be the public Bitcoin address and QR code with the corresponding private key and QR code. We strongly recommend that you store the paper wallet somewhere secure, such as a fireproof safe. You can now safely connect back to the internet.

Trading volumes are looking a bit subdued again, but there is nothing that is too concerning on the horizon as it seems extremely unlikely that there is a united global front of regulation which is going to come out of nowhere and blindside Crypto markets.\nFrom the crucial technical perspective, Omkar Godbole, analyst at Coindesk, believes that the downside continues to look compelling as BTC/USD struggles to overcome what looks like clear resistance to the upside,\n“Bitcoin risks a deeper sell-off to $8,652 (April 26 low) if the failure to beat inverse head-and-shoulders neckline hurdle (as seen over the weekend) is followed by a 4-hour close below the trendline support, currently seen at $9,055.” Moving averages in danger of topping out\nPerhaps most concerning for bulls is that the technical indicators are beginning to suggest that the recent bull trend may be getting tired, and if the longer term picture tells us anything over the last three months, it is that the tired bulls have been met with some very active bears. Mr. Godbole highlights the 50 and 100-day moving averages as of particular concern, particularly while it remains below other crucial levels,\n“The 50-candle and 100-candle moving averages (MAs) have shed bullish bias (topped out) and BTC is trading well below other key moving averages. Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) is holding well below 50.00 (in the bearish territory), also signaling scope for further losses.”\nThe most dangerous thing currently facing Bitcoin markets is the lack of a clear value, but this also remains its greatest opportunity. Hence, the trading or investing in Cryptocurrency is speculative no matter how many early investors might scoff at the old school and say they are “outdated”. The amount of money still flowing into blockchain startups is impressive however and ultimately this will help the longevity of the burgeoning technology even if it does not guarantee price gains in the future. Look out for a Bitcoin ETF as the next step in the journey of Cryptocurrency in its maturation.

Bitcoin is capped at approximately 21 million bitcoins. These protocols are complied with by consenting operators. This paper discusses whether such currency-caps are illegal quantity-fixing conspiracies in violation of antitrust law. It is found that there is a present antitrust risk for cryptocurrency operators. This may render such operators subject to criminal and civil liabilities. http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/antitrustprof_blog/2018/05/the-case-for-a-21-million-bitcoin-conspiracy.html", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3136044"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "peder østbye", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "norges bank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T18:57:17.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "797f88650a0c3a31262b9a35c16fd5087abbbc10", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS6jJEbXjbXWRYK4hZvx7M.1GL9VDOPHEfulCQG5jY7FpMSlbRid4njKAwUEMvJ4FvUhbClL6.SWuRAiaLDd_umzqVvf3G5x1CVoHqQl2rTUg-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptocurrencymemes/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "CryptoCurrency Memes - Have a laugh", "title": "When I wake up and bitcoin is up!", "title_full": "When I wake up and bitcoin is up!

The process aids in confirming that enough computational effort is devoted to a block. The method also creates new Bitcoins in each block. Get a lot more information about crypto buzz news\nTo mine you'll want to take a look at the transactions within a block and then confirm their validity. You'll want to then choose probably the most current transactions inside the header on the most current block and insert them into the new block as a hash.\nJust before a new block is added for the regional blockchain, you need to solve the proof of function dilemma. This can be a issue that's created to make sure that the new block to be made is tricky plus the data employed in producing the block satisfies the laid down requirements.\nBitcoin utilizes the Hashcash proof of operate; therefore, for you personally to resolve the issue you may need to make a hash.\nTips on how to create a hash\nIn case you know how to do it it's really quick to produce a hash from a collection of Bitcoin blocks. The unfortunate thing is the fact that you can not function out the data by just looking at the hash-you want to test diverse blocks.\nHashes are found at the blocks and also you must combine them to prove that your data is genuine. There are actually some miners who make an effort to take the uncomplicated route by attempting to fake a transaction by changing an currently stored block.\nYou should note that each and every hash is unique and distinct to a provided block; hence, when you manipulate a offered block, you transform the hash. When a offered miner runs a hashtag function around the manipulated block, the block is found to be fake, and you will not get any rewards.\nMining reward\nAfter you successfully resolve a proof of operate, you get a mining reward. The number of Bitcoins inside the reward will depend on quite a few variables such as complexity on the issue. For you personally to create additional income it's important to solve a lot of complications. You also want to possess high speed computers to enable you to solve as numerous problems as you can.\nAt present, mining pools have sprung up and are found on a very very simple idea. Right here a group of miners come together and function on several blocks. After the issue is solved, the miners share the rewards.\nConclusion\nWith all the suitable info and tools Bitcoin mining is just not only rewarding, it is also a exciting and secure strategy to transfer income across the world wide web. To create as significantly income as possible you need to have the appropriate computer software and powerful laptop or computer hardware.
