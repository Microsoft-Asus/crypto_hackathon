By Stephanie Busari CNN\nLAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- The South African teenager who was kidnapped by unknown men demanding a $120,000 ransom in bitcoins has been found alive, police say.\nKatlego Marite, 13, was taken by three men in a car as he played with two friends near his home in the eastern province of Mpumalanga on Sunday.\nPolice spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed to CNN that Marite had been found but declined to comment further on the circumstances.\n\"The combined efforts by the police and the community paid off when Marite was found safe and sound. The circumstances under which he was found are a subject of investigation,\" Hlathi said.\nThe police spokesman also declined to comment on whether the bitcoin ransom demanded by the kidnappers was paid.\nThe men had demanded 15 bitcoins, which is roughly equivalent to $120,000 in cash.\nIn the ransom note, the kidnappers asked the boy's parents to pay \"One bitcoin by May 21 and the full amount by May 27.\" The boy's family told police they didn't know what bitcoins were.\nBitcoin is a new currency that is not tied to any country or subject to regulation. Bitcoins are traded on exchanges and stored in virtual bank accounts called digital wallets.\nThe ransom note also included information about a wallet to which to send the payment.\nIn December, kidnappers in Ukraine received a ransom worth more than one million in bitcoins for releasing their victim -- an employee of a British cryptocurrency exchange, according to a report from Reuters news agency.\nTM &© 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The US Department of Justice and CFTC are apparently taking a hard look at bitcoin traders based in the UK, among other countries.\nEarlier this week, Bloomberg reported on a Department of Justice (DOJ) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) criminal investigation into cryptocurrency price manipulation. The probe includes two of the world's most popular cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and Ether, though there may be others . The authorities are focused on rooting out illegal tactics, including spoofing (when a malicious actor submits fake trading orders) and wash trading (when a malicious actor trades with himself to entice others into a false market).\nNow, it appears that the investigation is broader than was initially reported. On Friday, May 25, 2018, The Times – a daily newspaper in London – reported that American officials are examining bitcoin traders based in the UK and other countries, not just market participants located in the United States.\n\"The investigation can't have borders because the internet doesn't have borders,\" an unnamed source told The Times. \"They're looking everywhere, at everything, and Britain is a massive market for crypto.\" The publication noted that South Korea has also been under the microscope.\nThe supposedly global nature of the DOJ-CFTC investigation is unsurprising. Over the last several months, government officials across the world have emphasized the importance of international cooperation to address the cryptocurrency markets. Last month, the governor of the French central bank, François Villeroy de Galhau, called for \"internationally harmonized answers\" to address the potential risks of cryptocurrencies. In February, European Commission VP Valdis Dombrovkis even raised the possibility of cryptocurrency regulation at the EU level. Clearly, regulators recognize that the cryptocurrency phenomenon (and its accompanying financial challenges) must be dealt with at a supranational level.\nWith that in mind, the focus on British bitcoin traders is particularly interesting because of the relative absence of European cryptocurrency regulation. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has cautioned consumers about potential abuses in the cryptocurrency derivatives market and even issued a warning directed at cryptocurrency-based contracts for differences . But, while the regulator seems to have authority over cryptocurrency-based financial instruments, it does not necessarily have jurisdiction over the cryptocurrencies themselves (i.e., the spot markets). In April, the FCA explained that under the European Union's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II), it does not consider cryptocurrencies to be commodities or currencies for regulatory purposes, but does believe that cryptocurrency derivatives may qualify as financial instruments.\nIt's not immediately apparent how the FCA will approach the cryptocurrency spot markets, or whether that would fall under the purview of another entity. Essentially, this puts the FCA in a similar position as the CFTC – with a measure of authority over the derivatives markets, but not over the underlying cryptocurrencies themselves. Even with the patchwork of guidance and regulatory standards for the cryptocurrency markets, authorities are obviously taking steps toward punishing fraudsters and cryptocurrency charlatans.\nWhen reached by ETHNews , a DOJ spokesperson declined comment.

Users didn’t receive their ZIL in their wallet and some users were restricted to deposit or withdraw the coin. This led to a state of panic amongst those users who bought the coin. The Unocoin team hadn’t provided a clarification on what exactly was happening with the coin at that point in time on their platform.\nDuring an exclusive interview with AMBCrypto, the team said that the ZIL issue will be resolved and people are receiving their token in their account. In addition, the Unocoin team has also announced that they will be offering Bitcoin [BTC] as a way to compensate for all the users affected by the error.\nThey said:\n“The ZIL issue is on the verge of being resolved and people are receiving their token into the respective accounts. Along with that Unocoin is also offering BTC worth Rs.200, while we are also giving up zero network fees for ZIL till Friday . This is just a small initiative to compensate for the loss the user faced.”\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, Zilliqa [ZIL] at press time was trading at $0.11 with a market cap of $871 million and has dipped by more than 18% in the past 24 hours.

At 12:00 PM UTC, XMC was currently trading $7.43 while the prices dropped at a rate of 12.90%.\nAfter the hard fork of Monero, at block height 1546000, Monero Classic [XMC] has retained the cryptoNote protocol, all the parameters, and features of the original Monero chain. The team of developers at Monero Classic said that they are going to continue to develop a surrounding ecosystem with the features for the original chain of Monero.\nMonero Classic has all the advantages of a decentralized cryptocurrency without any privacy concerns as it uses ring confidential transactions, ring signatures and stealth addresses to make unintelligible the amounts, origins, destinations and other details of the transactions.\nThe transactions on the Monero Classic blockchain are untraceable as they can’t be linked back to a particular user or identity. The units of Monero Classic cannot be blacklisted by exchange or vendors because it is fungible in nature.\nJames Tim, a crypto enthusiast says:\n“ASIC friendly Monero chain $XMC #MoneroClassic is on the hitBTC exchange now” loading… Monero [XMR] introduces Tari, a counterparty by the tycoons\nPublished Simran Alphonso Source: Pixabay\nTari is a decentralized assets protocol that is going to be built on top of Monero. Tari has been founded by Riccardo Spagni, Naveen Jain, and Dan Teree.\nRiccardo Spagni is the core team member of Monero, Naveen Jain is a successful entrepreneur and Dan Teree who sold his company Ticketfly for $450 million to Pandora. They are the co-founders of Monero’s counterparty. This combination of tech entrepreneurs developed the new kickstart for Monero; Tari.\nTari, like a counterparty, will have a native token. It will be operated as a merge-mined sidechain. The miners will be capable to earn Tari block rewards and fees as they will be mining Monero. In addition to combining Tari in Monero’s security model, it will also support atomic swaps between itself and Monero.\nTari will use Rust as their language of choice for the Tari Protocol Software. The team of Tari decided Rust because they believe it is an incredibly capable language that is purpose-built for a software like theirs and also because they want to make sure that Tari does not drain any of the existing Monero contributor support.\nTari, on their page, says:\n“Our mission is to steward the most useful decentralized platform that empowers anyone to create digitally scarce things people love.”\nRiccardo Spagni, to portray his support for Tari tweeted:\n“In case anyone says something dumb like “fluffypony’s leaving Monero” point them to this:”\nAlong with the tweet, he attached a link to the official subreddit of Monero where he posted an article about Tari and Monero.\nTari is backed by some of the world’s leading top-tier VC firms, such as Redpoint, Trinity Ventures, Canaan Partners, Slow Ventures, Aspect Ventures, as well as some of the leading blockchain VC firms.\nTari will be an open-source project built in the spirit of Monero, to the point where Tari will reuse a lot of the patterns that they developed over the years for Monero. loading… ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zilliqa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T07:20:03.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9f55964cf23367c4f6d7568d4844c2f749141d61", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KYnxSYwv6Adb7JdqQUeewdMK25VtS.zV_717Ca27IRXgvoFzCbMH_VVxARaKK8MPJ0zVNIWsixZZUkklMjToTo07sXLziC_yvg.0GnYY84JkMQDclyE3.2GYtoxChwAGM7t4PnILbbw--", "site_full": "www.www.forpressrelease.com", "site": "forpressrelease.com", "site_section": "http://www.ForPressRelease.com/pressrelease_rssfeed.php", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "ForPressRelease.com - For Press Release - Online Press Release Distribution Service", "title": "Anonymous Bitcoin Available September 2018", "title_full": "Anonymous Bitcoin Available September 2018", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.forpressrelease.com/uploaded_files/news_img/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 36899, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9f55964cf23367c4f6d7568d4844c2f749141d61", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_KYnxSYwv6Adb7JdqQUeewdMK25VtS.zV_717Ca27IRXgvoFzCbMH_VVxARaKK8MPJ0zVNIWsixZZUkklMjToTo07sXLziC_yvg.0GnYY84JkMQDclyE3.2GYtoxChwAGM7t4PnILbbw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Anonymous Bitcoin Available September 2018", "text": "64 Anonymous Bitcoin Available September 2018 The Anonymous Bitcoin (ANON) team will debut their cryptocurrency, ANON, in September 2018. ANON coin was developed to address the demand for a cryptocurrency that provides truly anonymous transactions. A list of participating exchanges is expected by August 15, 2018, and the remainder of the BTCA testnet will take place up to the snapshot on September 9, 2018. ANON will officially be available on September 10, 2018 at a 1:1 ratio to holders of Bitcoin (BTC) and ZClassic (ZCL). As it is a co-fork of BTC and ZCL, one must hold BTC or ZCL prior to the fork to acquire ANON. The maximum amount of ANON will be 31.5 million, with 24 million ANON available when the fork occurs. BTCA intends to set ANON apart from other forks by succeeding where previous forks did not. The team cites lack of anonymous transactions, high transactions fees, and lengthy transaction times as some of the failures their coin will circumvent. The ability to anonymously transact draws many to cryptocurrency. BTC, the most prominent cryptocurrency, does not facilitate anonymous transactions. ANON draws from the privacy protocol of ZCL to provide anonymous transactions by using the same MIT-developed zkSNARKs privacy protocol. The zkSNARKs protocol allows for verifiable transactions without requiring interaction between the prover and verifier. As such, transactions are both secure and completely anonymous. While previous forks, like ZCL, have succeeded in providing anonymous transactions, they have fallen short in other ways that deterred widespread market adoption of the currency. The BTCA team includes several crypto and Fintech veterans who have observed other forks and what the crypto community wants to see. Increased block size and incorporation of masternodes are two features the BTCA team integrated into ANON in response to crypto market demand. Developers increased block size to support faster transaction times. Masternodes provide an opportunity for return on investment for holders of a minimum required amount of a particular coin. Through masternodes, holders of ANON can stake the currency. Staking incentivizes holding the coin for extended periods of time. The BTCA team intends that ANON is accessible and appealing to both those who have never used crypto and existing crypto users. As such, a community presence and transparent development are core principles for BTCA. BTCA has a social media presence, through which they communicate with their public. Videos of the forking process, frequent updates, and Q&A events allow anyone to follow the forking process. The team wants to tell their forking story in such a way that those unfamiliar with crypto are interested and informed, thus overcoming what was a challenge for previous forks in terms of effectively connecting with those new to crypto.

U.S. Launches Probe Into Market Manipulation\nThe U.S. Justice Department launched a criminal investigation to determine whether traders were manipulating the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, according to Bloomberg . The investigation was said to be focused on illegal practices that have ratcheted up crypto prices, including spoofing, the practice in which traders flood the market with fake orders to breed large-scale buying or selling. The investigation will also probe wash trading, in which bad actors trade with themselves to create a false sense of demand in the market. The Justice Department is working in conjunction with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which regulates cryptocurrency derivative products. The investigation was said to still be in its early stages. Coinbase Set to Rebrand Platform\nCoinbase announced that it will be rebranding its GDAX digital asset exchange to create a new version called Coinbase Pro. The new platform will aim to \"make the trading experience easier and more intuitive,\" Coinbase said. It will feature a new charting system, streamlined access to historical price data and a consolidated portfolio view option. \"Our vision is to give customers the ability to participate in services like staking and protocol voting that are distinct to crypto,\" Coinbase said. \"As the decentralized ecosystem advances, we expect there will be many more opportunities for customers to interact with digital assets in new and unique ways.\" Germany Wants Bitcoin Products\nFrankfurt Stock Exchange owner Deutsche Boerse is considering adding cryptocurrency products to its offerings, head of clients Jeffrey Tessler said at an industry event in London Wednesday. \"We are deep at work with it,\" Tessler said, according to a Coindesk report. He noted that the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and Deutsche Boerse will first work to gain a better understanding of the underlying transaction technology before adding anything to its offerings. Tessler said he and his team will study cryptocurrency volatility and make sure regulators are \"in line\" before any major moves are made. Singapore Offers Warnings\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has warned eight cryptocurrency exchanges to stay away from trading digital tokens that could be classified as securities or futures contracts. \"If the digital tokens constitute securities or futures contracts, the exchanges must immediately cease the trading of such digital tokens until they have been authorized as an approved exchange or recognized by market operator by MAS,\" authorities said in a statement Thursday. MAS also said it warned one cryptocurrency firms that initial coin offering (ICO)issuers should stop selling tokens that represent securities.

Using gold’s post futures historical price pattern we can try to forecast Bitcoin’s next all time high. The gold model proposes that Bitcoin will climb to around $86K in December 2018. This is in line with my previous Bubble analysis which had Bitcoin near $70K in the second week of December 2018. Bitcoin futures were met with much fanfare in December 2017. Chicago Board of Exchange (CBOE) launched on December 10th and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) December 17th. Anticipation of the respective launches had spread through cryptosphere in advance of CME and CBOE filings with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on December 1st. Futures contracts give buyers the opportunity to bet with or against Bitcoin. Yet there is no direct exposure to the underlying asset as contracts are cash settled. However, many lauded the move and took this as a sign of institutional acceptance. Futures gave Bitcoin an air of legitimization and were one step closer to exchange traded funds (ETFs). More money would come in. Prices would go higher. During this period social discovery spiked. Google Trends chart shows the number of searches for “bitcoin” spiked at the end of 2017. This confluence of factors allowed euphoria to take hold and Bitcoin’s price rose precipitously in a parabolic fashion to a peak value of nearly $20,000 on December 17, 2017. Chart on the left shows Bitcoin’s price rapidly rising from April 2017 to the peak in December 2017. The chart on the right is a magnified view covering the November 2 to December 16, 2017 period. Price appreciated 2.9X in 47 days. As seen in the right chart, between November 1, 2017 and December 17, 2017 price rose from $6800 to $19500 — 2.9X price appreciation in 47 days. Bitcoin was in a bubble. The peak on December 17 coincided with CME’s first futures contracts and subsequently price began its collapse. Bitcoin fell to a low of $6700 on April 6, 2018. After launch of CME futures trading on December 17, 2017 Bitcoin’s price fell significantly reaching a low of about $6700 on April 6, 2018. Did futures kill Bitcoin? Bitcoin is likened to “digital gold.” There is a limited supply of approximately 21 million coins. Mining becomes more difficult, costly and rewards fall over time (block reward halving). The asset is hoarded. HODLers go to great lengths to protect their investment. An underground bunker reminiscent of Fort Knox has been built by Xapo to store coins (private keys). Satoshi Nakamoto referenced gold in his original Bitcoin white paper . The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. Some well known Bitcoin advocates such as Trace Mayer have drawn parallels to gold as well. Like gold, Bitcoin aims to become a store of value, unit of account and medium of exchange. And like Bitcoin, gold futures were launched at a time of great interest and ATH. Let’s look at the impact futures trading had on its price. In a Medium article posted on December 7, 2017 Crypto Quantic Ph.D analyzed gold’s price history and correlated it to Bitcoin’s. He came to the following conclusion using post futures price action as guidance: I wouldn’t expect the Bitcoin trend to follow the gold trend exactly, but if it did, we would see a large drop that would bottom out in about April 2018 (remember, Bitcoin is moving at 4.3X Speed). Followed by an eventual rise to $60k — $80k before another major pull back, with a final run up to $180k. This article will (in part) revisit his analysis, add contemporary data and correlate his longterm forecast with my own (previously shared here and here ). Using gold as our model we will see how introduction of futures did not kill Bitcoin but instead opened the door for further substantial price appreciation. First, let’s review the issues surrounding U.S gold ownership in the late 19th and 20th centuries for some historical context. A Brief History of the Gold Standard A few years after 1834, “gold became the principal coin of domestic commerce” in the U.S. The strict gold standard began in 1879 and when silver was confined to fractional currency usage ( Congressional Research Service, 2011 ). President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6102 on April 5, 1933 which made it illegal to hoard gold coins, gold bullion, and gold certificates in an effort to spur economic growth during the Great Depression. These had to be turned in to the Federal Reserve for $20.67/oz of gold. Hoarders faced a penalty of $10,000 USD (nearly $200,000 adjusted) and up to 10 years in prison. This nationalization effort marked the end of the true gold standard. The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 required all gold and gold certificates held by the Federal Reserve to be sold to the U.S. Department of Treasury. It also adjusted gold’s price to $35/oz. U.S. Citizens were allowed to buy non-redeemable gold certificates beginning in 1964. On August 15, 1971 President Nixon suspended gold’s convertibility to U.S. dollars. This was spurred by stagflation and a potential global run on U.S. gold reserves. There were more U.S dollars held by foreign nations than gold backing those dollars. Nixon effectively deflated the dollar’s value. In 1973 the U.S. completely abandoned the gold standard and currencies began to float against one another (the beginning of the fiat era). Gold’s price was no longer fixed. President Ford signed Pub.L. 93–373 on August 14, 1974 which allowed U.S. citizens to own and hold gold effective January 1, 1975. December 31, 1974 the first gold futures contracts were traded. Gold Futures Gold maintained a relatively flat (manipulated) price in the years prior to the Nixon adminstration’s decision to adopt a fiat currency economic policy in 1973. Price began its move up well in advance of Ford’s announcement in 1974. Let’s take a look at gold’s price before the introduction of futures. Gold’s price between May 1971 and December 1974. Gold reached an all time high of nearly $200/oz on December 30, 1974. And as we can see it steadily climbed up. Gold prices began a bull run pushing from a baseline of $40 to $200 between May 1971 and December 1974. Then this happened: After the introduction of futures trading gold price fell and lost 50% value by August 31, 1976 Futures were introduced on December 31, 1974 coindentally a day after gold reached nearly $200/oz. Over the subsquent two years gold prices fell reaching a low of $102 on August 31, 1976 representing nearly 50% loss in value. Futures launch seemed to have a pround negative impact on the price of gold. But futures didn’t kill gold: Gold futures launch and subsequent correction preceded additional price appreciation. Gold’s ATH at futures launch is just a blip on the chart. After the initial correction price appreciated leading to two clear major sets of peaks. One cluster in early 1980 and a series of peaks in 2011-2012. We will use this price action as our guide. Bitcoin Futures Bitcoin began its bull run in late 2016. As discussed above price accelerated coinciding with the futures announcement. We know what happened after futures trading started. After futures trading Bitcoin’s price fell to a low of $6700 on April 6, 2018. In this Bitcoin chart we see a pattern similar to the post futures gold chart playing out over a shorter time period. Price peaked on the day the first CME futures contracts traded and over the next 117 days fell to a low of $6700 representing nearly 70% loss of value. Here are the charts side by side (gold on the left): Gold charts on the left and Bitcoin’s on the right. Pre futures are the top panels, post futures are the bottom panels. The patterns are quite similar. Now that we have a reference let’s use gold’s post futures price chart as a guide for Bitcoin’s next move. Although the charts look similar the periods are quite different which will require us to normalize the timeframe. Introduction of futures will be our common starting date: Gold futures launch — December 31, 1974. Subsequent low August 23, 1976 Bitcoin futures launch — December 17, 2017. Subsequent low April 6, 2018 Normalization factor: Gold futures launch, ATH to low = 601 days. Bitcoin futures launch, ATH to low = 117 days. Normalization factor = 601 days/117 days = 5.1 Bitcoin moves 5.1X faster than gold using these start and end dates. (N.B. Crypto Quantic calculated Bitcoin price moved 4.3X gold.) Now we will use this factor to calculate Bitcoin’s next ATH date: Gold post futures low to next ATH =1232 days Bitcoin post futures low to next ATH = 1232/5.1 = 242 days Bitcoin new ATH = April 6, 2018 + 242 days = December 3, 2018 How about price? Gold pre futures ATH = $200 Gold post futures next ATH = $850 Appreciation factor =4.3 Bitcoin pre futures ATH = $20,000 Bitcoin post futures next ATH = $20,000 x 4.3 = $86,000 My earlier analysis shared here pointed to a $70K peak on December 10, 2018. Comparing the earlier with the current analysis we get: Using my Bitcoin bubble analysis (unpublished), Bitcoin’s next peak price will be in early December 2018. Current analysis using the gold model proposes a similar date. These two analyses use different methods and have arrived at approximately the same dates and prices for Bitcoin’s next peak. There is variation in peak value but within the range delimited by the upper and lower boundaries of the bubble zone. As of this writing Bitcoin’s price is oscillating around $8K. Remember in 2017 price appreciated nearly 3X in less than 60 days. If Bitcoin’s price gradually rises and reaches $15K in the fall, year-end new ATH price will be within reach. This outcome though is predicated on April 6, 2018 price remaining the low in the current cycle. A Higher Calling Crypto Quantic’s analysis also included looking at future Bitcoin price peaks as correlated to gold’s. He estimated that Bitcoin’s maximum price would be around $180K. …an eventual rise to $60k — $80k before another major pull back, with a final run up to $180k. Bitcoin will exceed this value as network effects absent in gold will continue to power growth to orders of magnitude greater value. Secondary and tertiary layers will be additional catalysts. Social awareness, growing adoption of cryptocurrencies by Millennials and HODL philosophy will also play important roles in price appreciation. If Bitcoin follows Metcalfe’s law and mimics earlier cycles it can reach Tim Draper ’s $250K price point near the end of 2021. Multiple bubbles with intervening corrections. Tim Draper’s $250K estimate can be reached at the end of a future bubble in 2021. Of course all of this is speculative and based on loose math (mathemagics?). These are at best guestimates and at worst completely wrong. Bias plays a role as well (see disclosure below). But given the attention Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have enjoyed I believe we are in the early stages of a fundamental and disruptive shift in financial technology akin to what the internet did to many industries. I remind myself that ecommerce has transformed how we shop yet only accounts for 8% of U.S. retail sales. There is still much room for growth. Cryptocurrency is a nascent industry. It’s just warming up. Acknowledgments This journey into Bitcoin and price analysis was inspired by many people. I wish to acknowledge a few. Crypto Quantic Ph.D  — this article owes much to his earlier analysis of gold and Bitcoin futures. Parabolic Trav  — his deep knowledge of markets has pushed me to learn about technical analysis and the psychology of equities and crypto trading. Chris Burniske , Willy Woo, and Dmitry Kalichkin earlier work on crypto valuation methods spurred my interest in this subject. My next articles will address Bitcoin Bubbles and Hyperbitcoinization. Bitcoin has seen unprecedented price appreciation against a background of volatility. The “predictions” are academic exercises and should not misconstrued as investment advice.

Everything is in the deep red, with some currencies noting rather spectacular losses. The biggest concern is the Bitcoin price, which has effectively dropped below $7,500 for the first time in five weeks. The Bitcoin Price is Getting Battered\nIt is evident things are not going according to plan as far as the Bitcoin price is concerned. While there has been some interesting momentum in early March and throughout late April and early May, things have fallen apart once again. More specifically, the Bitcoin price has roped below $7,500 for the first time since April 12th.\nThis is not a positive development by any means. While the bears are thoroughly enjoying this new trend, the rest of the cryptocurrency community isn’t necessarily happy with this current development, for obvious reasons. At this point, it seems highly unlikely the Bitcoin price will hit $10,000 anytime soon, even though it successfully did so in late March.\nDue to this latest Bitcoin price decline of 5.76%, it remains to be seen where the bottom lies exactly. Some people speculate the Bitcoin price will drop to $5,500 or even lower in the coming days, although it remains to be seen whether or not this can effectively be reached. Most cryptocurrency holders don’t hope to see such a low Bitcoin price in the near future, but it is evident there isn’t much that can be done about this current trend.\nEven though the Bitcoin trading volume isn’t declining all that much lately, it seems the sellers are in full control of this market for quite some time to come. With $6.33bn in trades over the past 24 hours, the sellers vastly outweigh the number of buyers. It is still possible this situation will turn around in the coming days and weeks, but for now, the momentum will remain bearish.\nLooking over the exchanges ranked by Bitcoin trading volume, Bitfinex is clearly in the lead right now. Binance is not that far behind with its USDT pair OKEx closes out the top three with another USDT market. Huobi and bitFlyer are also in the top five, which means there are two fiat currency pairs and three USDT markets in this top five. An interesting mix, although not something that will improve the Bitcoin price anytime soon.\nIt is evident volatility remains the name of the game in the world of cryptocurrency. With the Bitcoin price in the dirt, all alternative currencies are suffering as well. It will be interesting to see how things evolve in this regard. With all of the panic selling taking place right now, there will be a lot more losses to contend with moving forward, for obvious reasons.

This has reduced the entire value of the cryptocurrency market to US$333.7 billion according to Coin Market Cap, down over 8.5% or US$32 billion since this time yesterday. Here is the state of play on Thursday morning: The Bitcoin (BTC) price has fallen 6.7% over the last 24 hours to US$7,606.83 per coin, reducing its market capitalisation to US$129.7 billion.

Reports that India is planning to place GST on cryptocurrencies appears to have weighed heavily on increasingly weak trader sentiment. In addition to this, Chinese regulators have reportedly uncovered over 400 fake cryptocurrencies.\nThe Ethereum (ETH) price is down 10.3% over the period to US$592.85, leaving Ether with a market capitalisation of just over US$59 billion.\nThe Ripple (XRP) price has dropped 7.2% since this time yesterday to 61.3 U.S. cents, reducing XRP’s market capitalisation down to US$24 billion.\nThe Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price has tumbled 10.5% lower over the last 24 hours to US$1,029.53. The Bitcoin offshoot now has a market capitalisation of US$17.6 billion.\nThe EOS (EOS) price has been the worst performing major coin with a 13.5% decline since this time yesterday to US$11.00. EOS now has a market capitalisation of US$9.6 billion.\nOnce again, the declines have continued outside the top five. In fact, there is only one coin within the top 50 that is in positive territory over the last 24 hours.\nLitecoin (LTC) is off 7.2%, Cardano (ADA) is down 10.3%, Stellar (XLM) is 8.4% lower, TRON (TRX) has fallen 8.5%, and IOTA (MIOTA) has tumbled almost 11%.\nWhat now?\nWith sentiment becoming weaker and weaker I think it is quite likely that Bitcoin and its peers could continue to sink lower from here. Because of this, I would suggest investors stay well clear of the market for the time being.\nIn the meantime this next tech boom that could be bigger than Bitcoin could be a better place to put your hard-earned money.\nOne of the world's richest people is sounding the alarm on what could be a trillion-dollar technology.\nEveryone is talking about the artificial intelligence revolution.\nHarvard Business Review calls it, \"the most important general-purpose technology of our era.\"\nOne Google Insider predicts AI, \"will be as transformative as the discovery of electricity.\" And it already is transforming industry after industry.\nAfter all we have been hearing about AI for years...but it never really lived up to the hype...so what's finally unlocked this huge tidal wave of innovation?\nClick here to learn more!\nMotley Fool contributor James Mickleboro has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Despite the uncertainty and lack of regulation in the industry, Main Street banks are jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon and raking in huge revenues. Main Street Banks Catching the Bitcoin Bug\nThe big banks on Wall Street have largely shunned the cryptocurrency market with only a few making tentative forays into the industry. This has paved the way for smaller banks to take advantage of the void created by the major players to dominate the arena. Banks like Silvergate, Cross River Bank, and Metropolitan Bank are offering their customers premium crypto-focused banking solutions.\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal , Silvergate’s asset base increased from $978 million to more than $1.9 billion. A significant portion of this revenue growth came from the over 250 cryptocurrency firms supported by the bank. Main Street banks are offering crypto startups the ability to enjoy the convenience of banking support.\nGenesis Global Trading is one of Silvergate’s crypto customers. Genesis specializes in cryptocurrency trading, and according to CEO Michael Moro, the firm appreciates the services provided by the bank. According to Moro, Silvergate is a big believer in his company’s mission, and that helps to foster an excellent working relationship. The Genesis Global CEO also went on to say that crypto companies need banks to remain in business.\nSilvergate isn’t the only bank basking in the bountiful Bitcoin revenue. According to CEO Mark DeFazio, Metropolitan Bank has increased its deposits without having to incur the cost of opening new branches. The bank’s 2017 revenue more than tripled the earnings of 2016. DeFazio is of the opinion that there is a significant paradigm shift in the payments industry. A Calculated Risk\nMainstreet Banks aren’t ignorant of the potential pitfalls of backing cryptocurrency firms. According to Alan Lane, the CEO of Silvergate:\nBanking in this [cryptocurrency] ecosystem is not for the faint of heart.\nThe crypto regulatory waters remain murky and even the banks that back cryptocurrency firms tend to play it safe. Main Street banks like Silvergate and Metropolitan have to observe a watchful vigilance in their compliance with KYC and AML regulations. As a result, many of these banks reject clients that do not meet up with statutory standards. Even with the hurdles along the way, smaller banks still manage to attract crypto behemoths like Coinbase, Kraken, and BitFlyer.\nThe trend of small banks backing digital currency firms isn’t only limited to the United States. Major banks in Europe remain critical of Bitcoin and the crypto market in general. Thus, smaller banks like Falcon and Vontobel in Switzerland as well as Fidor in Germany and Bank Frick in Liechtenstein have embraced the crypto market, offering a catalog of useful products and earning huge revenues.\nCan smaller banks leverage Bitcoin trading to take on the prominent Wall Street giants?

Are these concerns valid? Here’s what’s happening. The Bitcoin Gold (BTG) Double Spend Attack\nA malicious miner was able to take temporary control over the Bitcoin Gold network by scooping up 51% of the total hashpower.\nOnce they had control of the network, the miner started depositing Bitcoin Gold (BTG) into crypto exchanges and then immediately sending those deposits to a wallet they owned. Because the miner held the majority of the Bitcoin Gold network, they were able to reverse the transactions, where normally these actions would have been blocked by the blockchain, and get the coins into their own wallet from the exchanges.\n>> Possible Bitcoin Price Manipulation? US Launched Criminal Probe to Investigate The Guilty Wallet\nA Bitcoin Gold wallet has been discovered that appears to be the wallet where the stolen coins ended up. The deposits started on May 16th and continued through until May 18th. In this time period, over 388,200 BTG was deposited into the wallet.\nAt current prices, this equates to almost $18 million worth of Bitcoin Gold (BTG) that may have been stolen. Bitcoin Gold (BTG) Double Spend Attack Discovered\nBy May 18th, authorities were aware of the double spend attack and Bitcoin Gold director of communications Edward Iskra issued a warning about the attack.\nThe Bitcoin Gold team advised crypto exchanges to increase the number of confirmations required for a deposit to clear. Increasing the number of confirmations would make it more difficult for a hacker to reverse the transactions and deposit them back into their personal wallet.\nBlockchain data showed that the miner was able to reverse transactions as far back as 22 blocks. Exchanges have therefore been advised to increase the number of confirmations required to 50 blocks.\n>> India Proposes to Tax Cryptocurrencies 18% Under GST Could This Happen Again?\nTechnically speaking, yes, it could. If the hacker still maintains hold of the majority of the Bitcoin Gold hashpower, they might be able to deposit more funds to their wallet.\nHowever, now that people are aware of the attack and assuming that exchanges work against it by increasing their confirmation requirements, the hacker may find their task more difficult.\nOther tokens have fallen under attack recently, including Verge (XVG) . Bitcoin Gold (BTG)\nBitcoin Gold (BTG) is currently selling for $46.27, which actually puts the coin up 1.05% in the past 24 hours. Source: CoinMarketCap\nIs the coin up today because people aren’t concerned about the attack, or is the attack making Bitcoin Gold worth more?

Bitcoin raised a lot of eyebrows, when it surged from just under $1,000 to almost $20,000 last year, with many investors calling out the digital currency for its volatility.\nLack of regulation surrounding cryptocurrencies is what worries federal authorities, as that leaves the market vulnerable to abuse, a number of sources told Bloomberg.\n“Authorities worry that virtual currencies are susceptible to fraud for multiple reasons: skepticism that all exchanges are actively pursuing cheaters, wild price swings that could make it easy to push valuations around and a lack of regulations like the ones that govern stocks and other assets.”\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is helping the Justice Department with the investigation, according to the report.\nSome of the more specific behaviors federal prosecutors will be investigating include “spoofing” and “wash trading.”\nThe Justice Department declined to comment on the matter and the CFTC did not respond to Bloomberg’s requests.

Many skeptics describe it is as a very volatile currency and at the moment it is. But what causes such sharp fluctuations? Here are 4 key things that impact Bitcoin value today. Bitcoin governance\nEven though Bitcoin is decentralized, there are some decisions that still need to be made from time to time on how it will evolve. For instance, a decision to create a “hard fork” was made on August 1, 2017. This resulted in the creation of a new digital currency, Bitcoin Cash. Most users were not sure what this fork meant and the uncertainty pushed prices and overall Bitcoin value down for a while but then the prices rose steadily afterward. Government regulations\nWhen South Korea announced its intention to ban Bitcoin trading, overall Bitcoin value by an incredible $1,000 in mere minutes. Bitcoin regulation by governments of countries that have a high number of Bitcoin traders usually causes a panic in the market. As the masses run to sell their Bitcoins, the prices nosedive. Demand and supply curve\nThere are only 21 million Bitcoins available for mining. As the demand for these limited Bitcoins increases, prices and overall Bitcoin value will keep increasing. Fear of missing out (FOMO) is one reason the demand for Bitcoin keeps increasing. FOMO happens when people see and hear how others are making a fortune and they do not want to miss out on the opportunity. News and events\nTrading views are shaped by what people hear on the news. Negative news, like the closing down of major exchanges, or the hacking of digital currency websites, can affect the prices of Bitcoin. On the flip side, positive news, like the introduction of futures trading pushes the Bitcoin value through the roof.\nWhile it is true that Bitcoin prices are volatile, it is also a fact that overall the price has risen over time. A careful examination of the charts reveals a steady increase in average price ever since its inception. If this is anything to go by, we can safely infer that Bitcoin value will keep rising into the future.

Lee believes that the drop is due to “typical crypto volatility”, identifying three factors that will make his prediction come true. While he did say that the charts are “pretty scary for folks”, he mentioned that the “notion of blockchain as a way to solve trust in the digital world has gained a lot of traction”.The first of Tom Lee’s three factors is the cost of producing Bitcoin. Lee also mentioned that he would keep an eye on institutional investors, believing that they would be one of the big catalysts in the crypto space. “I think institutional investors have gained a lot of interest, and they haven’t really come into crypto yet because there is still some regulatory uncertainty, but that sort of ultimate allocation into crypto as an asset class is going to be a powerful reason why bitcoin rallies.”.Lee believes that a declaration for the side of cryptos would push Bitcoin into a rally. He also went on to say that only 10 days comprise all the performance in one year of Bitcoin’s price. Without those 10 days, Bitcoin is only down by 25% in a year.

It will, however, feature a variant of the Proof of Authority consensus protocol called Proof of Ambassador instead.\nThe Proof of Ambassador protocol will be a combination of two major consensus methods - Proof of Stake and Proof of Authority, and will enable a high transactional throughput of 15,000 transactions per second on the blockchain.\n\"The existing Proof of Work cryptocurrency model is not sustainable, environmentally speaking, with energy consumption rising exponentially. Generating new coins requires dedicated hardware which is expensive and consumes a lot of energy. An eventual switch to another consensus method is inevitable,\" said Greg van der Spuy, CEO of Bitcoin Origin.\n\"What we are doing with Bitcoin Origin is introducing energy-efficient and highly secure variants of popular cryptocurrencies with an exponentially higher transactional throughput than what's in practice right now. As the Proof of Ambassador consensus does away with cryptographic puzzles, our system is also energy-efficient, scalable and sustainable.\"\nBitcoin Origin will also make use of ground-breaking, innovative blockchain protocols like multi-state engines (MSE), cross-chain, multi-layering and namespace sharding to let users of any technical skill implement their own native, serverless blockchains. And in turn solve the problem of economic abstraction. Moreover, the use of an Ethereum Token Bridge will allow for dApp fees to be paid in native tokens.\nThe board of advisors for the project includes Cyber Security Expert and Consultant, Andrew Henwood, renowned Researchers and Developers, Schalk Dormehl and Afri Schoedon and serial entrepreneur, Thomas van der Spuy.\nThe testnet launch for the project is scheduled for Q3 of 2018 with a mainnet launch planned in Q4.

BREAKING DOWN 'Bitcoin IRA'\nIn a standard Individual Retirement Account (IRA) , individuals can keep their investments in traditional securities like stocks, bonds and money market funds . Bitcoin IRAs provide an additional option for investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin .\nThough most such IRA accounts tend to carry the name “Bitcoin” owing to the brand value linked with the most popular cryptocurrency, they also allow investments in other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum , Ripple , Litecoin , Bitcoin Cash , and Ethereum Classic .\nSuch Bitcoin IRA accounts are covered by custodians who manage the self-directed account and allow for virtual currencies to be among the required alternative investments. However, the custodians may not have any fiduciary responsibility to the investor for such investments. High Risk, High Cost Linked with Bitcoin IRA\nWhile such cryptocurrency IRAs are gaining traction owing to the hype around cryptocurrency valuations and allow for a good level of diversification , they come with their own perils. Cryptocurrency valuations are hit with wide price swings making it a very risky venture for retirement savings. For instance, the most popular bitcoin cryptocurrency zoomed from levels of $1,000 in February 2017 to the all-time high of around $19,600 in December 2017, before tanking to $6,252 by February 2018. Imagine mistakenly investing your retirement funds at the peak and then seeing them lose around two-thirds of their value over the next two months. Essentially, one should make cryptocurrency investments only after thoughtful consideration of the impact on one's retirement needs and risk tolerance .\nAnother issue with Bitcoin IRA accounts is that they come with high fees. Typically, a firm may charge a minimum monthly account fee, say $20, and a percentage of the account balance as a holding fee. There are additional charges linked to the account opening, to asset purchases, and fees for fund transfer which the investors should be aware of as they can be very high. This contrasts with the standard IRA accounts which don’t have any annual or monthly maintenance or account opening fees, and transaction charges are also very small.\nOne should also keep the investments confined to the prescribed limits - $5,500 a year for those under the age of 50, and $6,500 for the elders.\nInvestors should also note that they cannot buy cryptocurrencies on their own and move them to an IRA account. One needs to utilize the services of a designated firm, like Bitcoin IRA or BitIRA, to make the purchase as mandated by the necessary compliance rules adding to the cost. Such third-party involvement also impacts during periods of extreme volatility. Due to the 24/7 trading nature of cryptocurrencies, their valuations may change significantly within a few hours. However, holdings in such Bitcoin IRAs can be liquidated only during standard market hours on business days.\nAs cryptocurrencies are considered as property by the IRS, the investments are taxed at the applicable capital gains rate for long or short term.

It is the only form of money which can reliably be sent across the world without having to deal with currency conversions or country borders. Argentina’s Banco Masventas has acknowledged this, as the institution now relies on Bitcoin to settle cross-border transactions. Bitcoin and Banking can Work Together There is a good reason why banks have opposed Bitcoin for many years. This form of money is capable of doing something that’s currently impossible to do using the traditional banking system. More specifically, Bitcoin and similar currencies are capable of sending value across borders without any real restrictions, whereas fiat currencies are not. Even so, banks around the world are looking for ways to provide this functionality. To that end, innovative features will need to be experimented with. In the case of Argentine bank Banco Masventas, the focus lies on using Bitcoin as a way to complete cross-border payments. That is rather intriguing, as it is the first time that a bank has acknowledged the potential of cryptocurrencies in this regard. This change, which came into effect Monday, was made possible through a partnership with Bitex, a startup focusing on bringing cryptocurrency services to Latin America.

I think that cryptocurrency enthusiasts are seriously underestimating the importance of double-spending attacks to the economics of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nA few points that convinced me not to put my money into this system:\nIf hash capacity were traded on a perfectly competitive market, then it would always make sense to rent 51% of the capacity at market rates, earn the transaction fees, and also perform a double-spending attack. There is no equilibrium point for transaction fees where this attack becomes uneconomical. The only defense is that the market for hash capacity is imperfect.\nThe market for hash capacity is going to become more efficient over time. ASIC miners will be commoditized, so that hardware investment becomes a much smaller factor in hash cost versus energy. This might be even worse during a bitcoin downturn, because there could be a glut of ASIC miners.\nMiners will coordinate with market prices, turning off capacity when the price dips (for example, because someone is underbidding to create a 51% attack). If mining becomes more decentralized, it will be harder for miners to act in their common interest (fending off 51% attacks) and against their immediate interest (selling their hashrate to the highest bidder, or taking it off the market during an underbidding attack).\nHigh transaction volume is not necessarily any help - the more transaction volume, the higher the cost of the attack, but the greater the rewards. The semi-anonymous nature of bitcoin means that one could easily flood the network with double-spend transactions. Attacking a huge network like bitcoin would be an audacious and expensive act, but there are certainly organizations with the resources to do it, e.g. intelligence agencies, organized crime. The massive rewards to such an attack also offset fixed costs such as writing and testing the software to carry out the attack.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T00:52:21.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1e8eeef43cdd7cff934bafb8d0634647a6fb8828", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/MaiuMkfi7hSdY1NSNIZQAyYueJJe7qgT..eoOGjlMpJs74ODZ0DctpTrQ8nStTHk7P6u5gUZE9_6GHtXXjBqwzC3Brf9mjOnck.vjp7Iq8Ae9GYKSTWU.chaBuG.zdRBg_pIctANLmX13qfyCWtohg--", "site_full": "cointelegraph.com", "site": "cointelegraph.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Tom Lee Holds to $25,000 Bitcoin Price Prediction, Cites Three Supporting Factors - Latest Cryptocurrency", "title_full": "Tom Lee Holds to $25,000 Bitcoin Price Prediction, Cites Three Supporting Factors - Latest Cryptocurrency", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://latestcryptocurrency.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/725_Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9mYzdjODU5M2ZmMGUxNzUxYWIzNGYwODI2NzkwM2RhNS5qcGc=.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45237, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1e8eeef43cdd7cff934bafb8d0634647a6fb8828", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSDAcJIStjdfDkxWnrppft1MEnv7o_RxgGzPgz6ZjpjLGXd3iZ96hBI0CiQIbm2WYnOKE0fMUIY5CQWbQwkkpG1XUWSMMD1gCeous7kvMIB0z2mumQIwF0cmui0zVx2y1UD1JWIhwiV.w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Tom Lee Holds to $25,000 Bitcoin Price Prediction, Cites Three Supporting Factors - Latest Cryptocurrency", "text": "By admin in cryptocurrency market May 24, 2018\nTom Lee explains why he believes Bitcoin will reach $25,000, even though the leading cryptocurrency is down 41 percent this year ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T04:27:51.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c57605d6b538ce2c1bdaa5ccea1cf0956b8a1b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSmCL_6f2hFu2tP1ohupIVFqIbV_.4C7c_a6sTjuMTDbaaCZP3kcy_PUzjyYqFB1Yf2_9eOY2NdHkcVnXtAlfpCb1awfOMEA5Ps2a24Re1UenYolP9Id_qb0m5uOUZ1oa0-", "site_full": "www.cryptocoincache.com", "site": "cryptocoincache.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "London Fintech Firm Revolut adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash Trading – CryptoCoin Cache", "title_full": "London Fintech Firm Revolut adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash Trading – CryptoCoin Cache", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2c57605d6b538ce2c1bdaa5ccea1cf0956b8a1b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSmCL_6f2hFu2tP1ohupIVFqIbV_.4C7c_a6sTjuMTDbaaCZP3kcy_PUzjyYqFB1Yf2_9eOY2NdHkcVnXtAlfpCb1awfOMEA5Ps2a24Re1UenYolP9Id_qb0m5uOUZ1oa0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "London Fintech Firm Revolut adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash Trading – CryptoCoin Cache", "text": "by admin · May 24, 2018\nThe British based company that created the first app allowing customers to invest in Bitcoin has announced it will add Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as it completes series C fundraising of $250 million.

At its previously weekly low, the valuation of the cryptocurrency market dipped to $327 billion. Today, on May 24, the cryptocurrency market fell to a new monthly low. What is Causing the Market to Drop?\nAs always, a wide range of factors have contributed to the recent market correction and it is difficult to pinpoint several events as the definitive factors behind the fall of the market. Rather, it as an amalgamation of many events that have occurred throughout the year, which include: Mt. Gox sell-off Possible manipulation by large-scale traders in the futures market Bitfinex taxation policy Bithumb and UPbit scandal in South Korea Failure of institutional investors to meet the anticipation of the community Regulatory uncertainty in several regions\nBut, it is most likely that the launch of the bitcoin futures market in late 2017 and the manipulation of the cryptocurrency market eventually led the market to become extremely volatile and experience large corrections on a regular basis.\nThe massive sell-off of bitcoin by the Mt. Gox trustee and a series of negative events from South Korea and the US-led investors to lose confidence in the cryptocurrency market in the short-term.\nEarlier today, Bloomberg also reported that the US government and the Justice Department launched an investigation into illicit trading and bitcoin price manipulation.\n“The Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into whether traders are manipulating the price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, dramatically ratcheting up U.S. scrutiny of red-hot markets that critics say are rife with misconduct, according to four people familiar with the matter,” Matt Robinson from Bloomberg reported.\nDue to the abnormal volatility in the cryptocurrency market, it is likely that the US government suspects whales and large-scale investors of manipulating the market to drive larger movements on both the upside and downside. Where Does Bitcoin go From Here?\nYesterday, CCN reported that the breach of the $8,000 resistance level could send the bitcoin price to the lower end of $7,000. Based on the strong downward trend of bitcoin, it is likely that the dominant cryptocurrency dips below $7,000 and reaches $6,900 before rebounding.\nOther cryptocurrencies such as Polymath, Ethos, Storm, Zcash, and Waves, which have recorded large gains throughout April and May, declined by 10 to 20 percent against both bitcoin and the US dollar.\nAlthough the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of bitcoin is signifying a neutral zone, it is unlikely that the bitcoin price rebounds before dropping to the lower end of $7,000.\nEthereum, in particular, has experienced a sharp drop over the past 24 hours, declining by more than 10 percent against the US dollar.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

This is approximately $100 less than where it stood 24 hours ago. While nothing huge, it’s a clear sign that the bears still have their hands on the reins, and it’s unclear when – or even if – the current trends can reverse themselves.\nThe manipulation of cryptocurrency prices is a common concern amongst both traders and financial authorities alike. These concerns initially began after the fall of Mt. Gox in 2014, which ultimately caused bitcoin to drop from the $1,000+ range to $600, and then $500 soon after. The end of 2014 ultimately saw bitcoin trading at around $400.\nSince then, bitcoin has experienced solid price hikes, though every time a sell-off occurs or Mt. Gox trustees move their remaining stashes, the price of bitcoin seems to take a stumble. Executives have admitted that their behavior bears influence on how bitcoin will move, yet their actions remain unchanged. This has sparked questions regarding the intent behind moving the coins. Are the trustees trying to manipulate bitcoin’s price, or is it all a big coincidence?\nThose in charge aren’t waiting around for an answer anymore, and in what could be the most significant action on the part of financial regulators today, the United States Justice Department has announced that it will be opening an investigation into illicit trading and any possible price manipulations on the part of bitcoin and its crypto-cousins.\nRepresentatives of the Department said they will be focusing on illegal practices that can swing prices in a negative direction. These practices include spoofing (or market rigging) and flooding the market with fake orders to trick traders into buying and selling. Federal prosecutors claim they are working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to gather more information on bitcoin and its present trading practices.\nBitcoin and cryptocurrencies have garnered a reputation for being fraudulent or the target of criminals, according to University of Texas finance professor John Griffin. As a teacher of monetary policy, Griffin has studied price manipulation, including in digital-coin markets, and says there’s very limited oversight regarding crypto-trading, making it a natural target for financial crooks.\n“There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading,” he says. “It would be very easy to spoof this market.”\nAnd despite all the hype and hoopla – right as bitcoin continues to fall deeper into the red and the Department opens its investigation into illicit trading – Fundstrat’s Tom Lee is there to remind us all where he stands, and where bitcoin could be in the future.\nAt $7,500, bitcoin has lost over $2,000 in about two weeks. The Department’s investigation is likely to break the price down even more, and yet Lee is adamant that bitcoin will end 2018 at $25,000, saying that the recent drops are merely a result of bitcoin’s “typical volatility.”\n“Historically, ten days comprise all the performance in any single year of bitcoin’s price,” he explained. “It you took out those ten days, bitcoin’s down 25 percent a year, so as miserable as it feels holding bitcoin at $8,000, the move from $8,000 to $25,000 will happen in a handful of days.” About The Author ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "mt. gox", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T00:50:44.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cde6aee27a0e222a368c7a6c0544a11a714d4740", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSI7.defLbdsj1aMHxFeuamD5peCtjiskpY9KJV8TxkklJvBfNqoADrMckhY3VOzUc65itkjm7WBvIzXgiP6JAjsIXQba0ooGiu3vOpR329uGWTU2W2FVCOnlT5CYHfhMM-", "site_full": "forexandcryptocurrencynews.com", "site": "forexandcryptocurrencynews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Sellers In Control - Forex and Cryptocurrency", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Sellers In Control - Forex and Cryptocurrency", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "https://i0.wp.com/forexandcryptocurrencynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin14.png?fit=1824%2C917&#038;ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cde6aee27a0e222a368c7a6c0544a11a714d4740", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSI7.defLbdsj1aMHxFeuamD5peCtjiskpY9KJV8TxkklJvBfNqoADrMckhY3VOzUc65itkjm7WBvIzXgiP6JAjsIXQba0ooGiu3vOpR329uGWTU2W2FVCOnlT5CYHfhMM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD Sellers In Control - Forex and Cryptocurrency", "text": "Key Points Bitcoin price was not able to move back above $8,000 and declined further against the US Dollar. There are two important bearish trend lines in place with resistance at $7,700 and $7,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/ USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is currently moving higher, but it is likely to face a strong selling interest just below $8,000.\nBitcoin price nosedived towards $7,500 against the US Dollar. BTC/ USD is currently recovering ground towards a few key barriers like $7,800 and $8,000. Bitcoin Price Analysis\nThe past 5-6 sessions were mostly bearish as bitcoin price tumbled below the $8,000 support against the US Dollar. The BTC/ USD pair declined sharply and even broke the $7,600 support level. It traded towards the $7,400 level before finding buyers. A low was formed near $7,440 from where a fresh upward correction was initiated and the price moved above $7,600.\nThe price managed to move above the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,970 high to $7,443 low. However, there are many hurdles for buyers around the $8,000 level. At the moment, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,970 high to $7,443 low is acting as a resistance near $7,700. There are also two important bearish trend lines in place with resistance at $7,700 and $7,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The second trend line is significant since it is formed via connecting the $8,300 swing high.\nLooking at the chart , the price is showing a few positive signs above $7,500. Having said that, a break above the $8,000 barrier is must for buyers to gain control. On the other, if buyers fail to push the price above $8,000, there is a risk of yet another slide back to $7,500.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is slowly moving in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is struggling to move back above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $7,500 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc/ usd", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T12:55:37.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "73eb3e20488d4ecbcce960992e3daebf4c7cb67d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jcsQGin1KrlG20HInLCjjW1tIvh_ABYGsYBbNDQEH2R_tejgwrJTtG1BbYYmyuP7Jx1Q8GhvpgmfgIyb_qnV0WlVuKpAdlqbreDSCuzj61ENCAHMZlfExYV5AuKxjqpki4IMQyQ3xiWGQ--", "site_full": "coinaio.com", "site": "coinaio.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Breaking: US Criminal Probe to Look Into Potential Bitcoin Price Manipulation", "title_full": "Breaking: US Criminal Probe to Look Into Potential Bitcoin Price Manipulation", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.087, "main_image": "http://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dd8zQidUwAAtYmI.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "73eb3e20488d4ecbcce960992e3daebf4c7cb67d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jcsQGin1KrlG20HInLCjjW1tIvh_ABYGsYBbNDQEH2R_tejgwrJTtG1BbYYmyuP7Jx1Q8GhvpgmfgIyb_qnV0WlVuKpAdlqbreDSCuzj61ENCAHMZlfExYV5AuKxjqpki4IMQyQ3xiWGQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Breaking: US Criminal Probe to Look Into Potential Bitcoin Price Manipulation", "text": "Well, Well, Well — Look Where We Are. LITECOIN! (LTC) >=D The US Department of Justice has recently launched a criminal probe into potential bitcoin price manipulation. The investigation is in its early stages, and is said to be targetting illegal activities like wash trading and spoofing.\nThe US Department of Justice (DOJ) has reportedly launched a criminal probe into whether traders are actively manipulating the price of various cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin. The probe is said to be after spoofing and wash trading.\nAccording to Bloomberg, the move is a culmination of the US’ scrutiny into cryptocurrency markets, which some claim are rife with misconduct. Bloomberg’s report cites four people familiar with the matter.\nThe investigation, according to the unnamed sources, is still in its early stages and is focusing on illegal practices that can influence prices. These include spoofing the market with fake orders to trick other traders, and wash trading to create fake trading volume.\nFederal prosecutors, Bloomberg adds, are working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), a financial regulator, on the investigation. Notably, the CFTC is a derivatives watchdog that doesn’t regulate markets in which actual cryptocurrencies are traded. Nevertheless, it has the authority to act if it spots fraud.\nThe limited oversight, University of Texas finance professor John Griffin noted, makes the cryptocurrency ecosystem a target for crooks. He was quoted as saying:\n“There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading. It would be easy to spoof this market.” John Griffin\nVarious cryptocurrency enthusiasts have long believed bitcoin’s price is actively being manipulated. According to CryptoCompare data, the flagship cryptocurrency has fallen from a nearly $20,000 all-time high in mid-December, to about $7,500 at press time.\nThe cryptocurrency’s bearish period has notably seen it various odd patterns, which some critics claim to be proof of price manipulation. Last year, a blogger known as Bitfinex’ed documented the actions of “Spoofy,” a single entity the blogger claims is dominating bitcoin’s price.\nAccording to his work, Spoofy was a trader or group of traders that often placed orders of $1 million or more, without actually executing them. Its goal was to trick other traders and force the cryptocurrency’s price to go in the direction it wanted it to go.\nAs for other cryptocurrencies, it’s well-known various groups organize “pump and dump” schemes to manipulate their prices, especially when it comes to small-cap cryptos. As covered, last month a group of cryptocurrency influencers were reported to the FBI and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for orchestrating these schemes.

I almost feel guilty for being excited about Bitcoin Cash, but payments is so important and cool, and Bitcoin Cash is kicking ass in that area!” loading… Bitcoin Cash [BCH], Litecoin [LTC], Dash [DASH] now accepted to book flights and hotels on CheapAir\nPublished Ketaki Dixit Source: Pixabay\nCheapAir, an American online travel agency announced that they would now accept Bitcoin Cash [BCH], Litecoin [LTC], and Dash [DASH] for booking flights and hotels. On 22nd November 2013, CheapAir became the first travel agency to accept Bitcoin for flight bookings.\nAccording to the press release, the coins were added on customer demand and will ensure lower transaction fees and a faster transaction time. Using cryptocurrencies for bookings has its own challenges as their supplies demand money in fiat currency. CheapAir has ensured that all the problems they faced after adding Bitcoin are fixed, ensuring smooth transactions.\nJeff Klee, the CEO of CheapAir said:\n“Over the last six months, we’ve seen a huge uptick in the number of customers requesting alternative currencies, so we’ve worked hard to integrate the three that were most requested.”\nHe further added that their customers were open about their demands, something that CheapAir appreciates.\nRecently on 21st April, in a letter to their customers, the online travel agency said:\n“We were recently informed by our processing partner, Coinbase, that they will no longer support “custodial” solutions for merchants….. removing a number of the tools and features that we rely on to accept Bitcoin from CheapAir.com shoppers. These changes are scheduled to occur in a matter of weeks.”\nCoinbase was responsible for converting the Bitcoin into fiat currency. However, as they no longer provided them the services as CheapAir faced problems in accepting Bitcoin payments.\nThey also announced at the time that they would use BitPay as their processor and run tests for the addition of Bitcoin Cash, Dash, and Litecoin as a payment alternative.\nSlickinfinity, a Redditor said:\n“I use cheapair all the time and pay with cryptocurrency. Its easier than using my card.”\nAnother Redditor commented:\n“Someone needs to tell them to accept Nano rather than a bunch of shitcoins.” loading… ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "revolut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vlad yatsenko", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "revolut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T16:33:44.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "74066421e7f3e51c5603287c1b1ec6cbc67fd722", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jfclrIspyEQ.w.2ZrQhDgJP2NwOZE.SKVr_.6gDDoiL8JiKbO71P3t4JndZyCDoMcHbNkthHuP2jTNQMTiAEKjvVyzGATWciZirKnnb0PSImdfzn2vC6_o5uIpZdru7jKpESnC1O.NTvg--", "site_full": "cryptowirelive.com", "site": "cryptowirelive.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Price Drops to $7,300 as Cryptocurrency Market Correction Continues - Crypto Wire Live", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Drops to $7,300 as Cryptocurrency Market Correction Continues - Crypto Wire Live", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.022, "main_image": "https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bitcoin-price-fall-760x400.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "74066421e7f3e51c5603287c1b1ec6cbc67fd722", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jfclrIspyEQ.w.2ZrQhDgJP2NwOZE.SKVr_.6gDDoiL8JiKbO71P3t4JndZyCDoMcHbNkthHuP2jTNQMTiAEKjvVyzGATWciZirKnnb0PSImdfzn2vC6_o5uIpZdru7jKpESnC1O.NTvg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Drops to $7,300 as Cryptocurrency Market Correction Continues - Crypto Wire Live", "text": "Posted on 2 hours ago Advertisement\nGet exclusive analysis and cryptocurrency insights on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nThe bitcoin price has dropped below the $7,300 mark as the valuation of the cryptocurrency market declined by more than $25 billion, from $350 billion to $325 billion over the past 24 hours.\nWithin the past three days, within merely 72 hours, the valuation of the cryptocurrency market sharply dropped from $390 to $333 billion, losing more than $57 billion. At its previously weekly low, the valuation of the cryptocurrency market dipped to $327 billion. Today, on May 24, the cryptocurrency market fell to a new monthly low. What is Causing the Market to Drop?\nAs always, a wide range of factors have contributed to the recent market correction and it is difficult to pinpoint several events as the definitive factors behind the fall of the market. Rather, it as an amalgamation of many events that have occurred throughout the year, which include: Mt. Gox sell-off Possible manipulation by large-scale traders in the futures market Bitfinex taxation policy Bithumb and UPbit scandal in South Korea Failure of institutional investors to meet the anticipation of the community Regulatory uncertainty in several regions\nBut, it is most likely that the launch of the bitcoin futures market in late 2017 and the manipulation of the cryptocurrency market eventually led the market to become extremely volatile and experience large corrections on a regular basis.\nThe massive sell-off of bitcoin by the Mt. Gox trustee and a series of negative events from South Korea and the US-led investors to lose confidence in the cryptocurrency market in the short-term.\nEarlier today, Bloomberg also reported that the US government and the Justice Department launched an investigation into illicit trading and bitcoin price manipulation.\n“The Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into whether traders are manipulating the price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, dramatically ratcheting up U.S. scrutiny of red-hot markets that critics say are rife with misconduct, according to four people familiar with the matter,” Matt Robinson from Bloomberg reported.\nDue to the abnormal volatility in the cryptocurrency market, it is likely that the US government suspects whales and large-scale investors of manipulating the market to drive larger movements on both the upside and downside. Where Does Bitcoin go From Here?\nYesterday, CCN reported that the breach of the $8,000 resistance level could send the bitcoin price to the lower end of $7,000. Based on the strong downward trend of bitcoin, it is likely that the dominant cryptocurrency dips below $7,000 and reaches $6,900 before rebounding.\nOther cryptocurrencies such as Polymath, Ethos, Storm, Zcash, and Waves, which have recorded large gains throughout April and May, declined by 10 to 20 percent against both bitcoin and the US dollar.\nAlthough the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of bitcoin is signifying a neutral zone, it is unlikely that the bitcoin price rebounds before dropping to the lower end of $7,000.\nEthereum, in particular, has experienced a sharp drop over the past 24 hours, declining by more than 10 percent against the US dollar.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

By Stephanie Busari CNN\nLAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- The South African teenager who was kidnapped by unknown men demanding a $120,000 ransom in bitcoins has been found alive, police say.\nKatlego Marite, 13, was taken by three men in a car as he played with two friends near his home in the eastern province of Mpumalanga on Sunday.\nPolice spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed to CNN that Marite had been found but declined to comment further on the circumstances.\n\"The combined efforts by the police and the community paid off when Marite was found safe and sound. The circumstances under which he was found are a subject of investigation,\" Hlathi said.\nThe police spokesman also declined to comment on whether the bitcoin ransom demanded by the kidnappers was paid.\nThe men had demanded 15 bitcoins, which is roughly equivalent to $120,000 in cash.\nIn the ransom note, the kidnappers asked the boy's parents to pay \"One bitcoin by May 21 and the full amount by May 27.\" The boy's family told police they didn't know what bitcoins were.\nBitcoin is a new currency that is not tied to any country or subject to regulation. Bitcoins are traded on exchanges and stored in virtual bank accounts called digital wallets.\nThe ransom note also included information about a wallet to which to send the payment.\nIn December, kidnappers in Ukraine received a ransom worth more than one million in bitcoins for releasing their victim -- an employee of a British cryptocurrency exchange, according to a report from Reuters news agency.\nTM &© 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Can Bitcoin Replace SWIFT?\nThrough a strategic partnership with Bitex, a cryptocurrency payment service provider based in South America, Dakak explained that the bank will outsource the conversion process of bitcoin to fiat currencies to Bitex, which will then send bitcoin to the recipient. The end cost would be the bitcoin transaction fee that is sent to the miners that verify transactions on the blockchain and the fee charged by Bitex.\n“The service allows you to reduce costs associated with international transfers as there are no international banks as intermediaries,” said Banco Masventas.\nDakak noted that one of the initial actions the bank took to streamline the implementation process of bitcoin was to cooperate with the Bitex development team to ensure recipients of bitcoin payments can seamlessly receive cryptocurrency transactions without boundaries. Dakak stated:\n“One of the actions was to contract Bitex as a strategic partner in the implementation of the Bitex platform for payments and collections operations for our clients abroad.”\nThe SWIFT network , which is utilized by the world’s biggest banks and financial institutions, is essentially a messaging network that enables banks to share information. Sending a payment from one bank to another requires a message to be sent on the SWIFT network, which has to be verified manually.\nSending international payments and remittance transactions on the SWIFT network can take at least five business days to three weeks, depending on the size of the payment. Because most international payments processed by banks are large, it often takes more than a week for the payment to be cleared. Source: Shutterstock\nBitcoin is not the most flexible blockchain network and it does not have the biggest capacity. But, it is the most robust blockchain protocol with the longest track record, equipped with one of the most active open-source development groups in the industry. Its transparency and security allow the Bitcoin network to operate as a reliable financial network for international payments.\nMoreover, most international payments sent by banks, as stated above, are often large transactions that cannot be processed by remittance outlets. Although bitcoin transaction fees could be an issue for $1 to $10 payments, for payments above $1,000, the bitcoin transaction fee is a non-issue. Why is SWIFT Still Used?\nThe SWIFT network is not only operated by leading banks by owned by the world’s biggest financial institutions. As such, even though the SWIFT network is outdated and utilizes an inferior technology, banks have the obligation to use it. That is, until minor banks like Bank Masventas opt out of the SWIFT network and begin to leverage public financial networks like bitcoin, which are completely decentralized and peer-to-peer.\nOther banks have started to pilot blockchain protocols like Ripple and Ethereum to process international payments, which could be crucial in demonstrating the potential of cryptocurrency as an alternative to the global finance sector in the long-term.\nImages from Shuttertsock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jose dakak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dakak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "banco masventas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toshi times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T14:32:33.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c7588c1cce41243c157cc05677787a012918df9a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyeRjYGVLJTCICekTbROep9CSzfbvoB1hhlxXk8p7HDAuyxAx2m4n.Q6K2KhANiQniixfmK_J_Y6WvE.Al.OX20nIZFhLkXzxk7Ww.1zBFLY897nvJjJ6RY.A2xKD.MOI-", "site_full": "coinspectator.com", "site": "coinspectator.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["sports", "tech", "adult", "social", "climbing", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "Revolut adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash to its crypto offering - CoinSpectator", "title_full": "Revolut adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash to its crypto offering - CoinSpectator", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c7588c1cce41243c157cc05677787a012918df9a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyeRjYGVLJTCICekTbROep9CSzfbvoB1hhlxXk8p7HDAuyxAx2m4n.Q6K2KhANiQniixfmK_J_Y6WvE.Al.OX20nIZFhLkXzxk7Ww.1zBFLY897nvJjJ6RY.A2xKD.MOI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Revolut Adds Ripple", "published": "2018-05-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Revolut adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash to its crypto offering - CoinSpectator", "text": "Revolut adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash to its crypto offering\nPublished 2 hours ago\nIBS Intelligence via ibsintelligence.com In December last year, Revolut launched a feature that allows its 1.8 million customers to buy, hold and sell Cryptocurrencies instantly from within the app. In addition to Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum, Revolut has today added XRP and Bitcoin Cash to its list of growing Cryptocurrencies. Revolut customers can instantly exchange 25 fiat currencies directly into Cryptocurrency, which can then be securely held and sold directly within the app in seconds, and even allows customers to set up alerts whenever a specific Cryptocurrency hits a certain value.Last week, Revolut launched a new savings feature called Vaults, which allows customer to round up their card payments to the nearest whole number and save up their spare change in Cryptocurrencies. Since then, more than 50,000 customers have set up a Cryptocurrency Vault. The addition of XRP and Bitcoin Cash stems from overwhelming demand from the Revolut community and the fact that major Cryptocurrency exchanges are yet to support these digital currencies.Vlad Yatsenko, Co-Founder & CTO of Revolut said: “We launched this world-first feature in order to offer frictionless exposure of Cryptocurrencies to the mainstream population. “We’ve been asking the Revolut community which Cryptocurrencies they would like to see next, and the demand for both XRP and Bitcoin Cash has been absolutely overwhelming. After months of negotiations and development work, we’re incredibly excited to offer exposure to these two digital currencies to the UK market.” Coin spectator is an automated news aggregation service.

It is the only form of money which can reliably be sent across the world without having to deal with currency conversions or country borders. Argentina’s Banco Masventas has acknowledged this, as the institution now relies on Bitcoin to settle cross-border transactions. Bitcoin and Banking can Work Together\nThere is a good reason why banks have opposed Bitcoin for many years. This form of money is capable of doing something that’s currently impossible to do using the traditional banking system. More specifically, Bitcoin and similar currencies are capable of sending value across borders without any real restrictions, whereas fiat currencies are not.\nEven so, banks around the world are looking for ways to provide this functionality. To that end, innovative features will need to be experimented with. In the case of Argentine bank Banco Masventas , the focus lies on using Bitcoin as a way to complete cross-border payments. That is rather intriguing, as it is the first time that a bank has acknowledged the potential of cryptocurrencies in this regard.\nThis change, which came into effect Monday, was made possible through a partnership with Bitex, a startup focusing on bringing cryptocurrency services to Latin America. This development is interesting for many reasons, including the fact that this solution will compete with the likes of Swift.\nConsidering that consumers have showed increased interest in mobile payment solutions in recent years, incorporating cryptocurrencies makes a lot of sense. It is also a smart move by Banco Masventas, as the company wants to lower its costs and expand its presence in the market. With Bitex on board as a strategic partner, that should be doable in the long run.\nFor customers of Banco Masventas, very little will change on paper. They will go through the same process of sending cross-border transactions, but the service will work very differently behind the scenes. Bitex will conduct cross-border transactions for the bank with Bitcoin, speeding up the process and reducing overhead costs in the process.\nGiven Argentina’s struggles with inflation and financial hardship, embracing cryptocurrencies is of the utmost importance. It is one of the few solutions which can make a positive impact on the country’s financial system. Even so, embracing the likes of Bitcoin for this purpose remains a big risk, as cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile.

Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) The South African teenager who was kidnapped by unknown men demanding a $120,000 ransom in bitcoins has been found alive, police say. Katlego Marite, 13, was taken by three men in a car as he played with two friends near his home in the eastern province of Mpumalanga on Sunday. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed to CNN that Marite had been found but declined to comment further on the circumstances. Kidnappers snatch a 13-year-old South African boy and demand his ransom be paid in bitcoins \"The combined efforts by the police and the community paid off when Marite was found safe and sound. The circumstances under which he was found are a subject of investigation,\" Hlathi said. The police spokesman also declined to comment on whether the bitcoin ransom demanded by the kidnappers was paid. Read More The men had demanded 15 bitcoins, which is roughly equivalent to $120,000 in cash. In the ransom note, the kidnappers asked the boy's parents to pay \"One bitcoin by May 21 and the full amount by May 27.\" The boy's family told police they didn't know what bitcoins were. Bitcoin is a new currency that is not tied to any country or subject to regulation. Bitcoins are traded on exchanges and stored in virtual bank accounts called digital wallets.

Kidnappers had left behind a note demanding ransom be paid in Bitcoin.\nMarite was playing with his two friends outside in eMalahleni, previously known as Witbank. A car pulled up, grabbed Marite and left a piece of paper demanding a payment of Bitcoin.\nSouth African Police Service (SAPS) Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed to the media that the child was found on Thursday and was alone at the time. Hlathi could not reveal whether or not the family paid ransom or how they were tipped off to Marite’s location.\n“While playing, a gold Toyota Corolla with three occupants stopped next to them. One of the men, who was dressed in black, with a green jacket, grabbed the victim to the vehicle (sic) before driving off with him. Katlego’s friends ran to his mom and told her about the ordeal. She, in turn, reported the incident to the police,” Hlathi said after the incident was originally reported.\nFamily and local community members had reviwed nearby CCTV and discovered what they believed to be the same car. Police then took three individuals into custody but no arrests were made at the time.\nThe kidnapping has received a hive of media attention over the ransom note demanding payment in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.\n“This is a kidnapping! We have your child. Your child will not be harmed if the following demands are met:\nDo not involve the police, we are monitoring all your communications and movments.\nWe demand ransom of 15 bitcoins to be paid to the below Bitcoin wallet to secure your child’s safe release,” the ransom note read.\nThe note went on to say that the child would be “hanged and decapitated” if no payments were made.\nAs of Thursday evening, police had still not announced any arrests.
