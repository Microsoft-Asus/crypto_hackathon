The coin refreshed April 12 lows at $7,260 and trimmed intraday losses by the end of the trading day. During the morning hours Friday, BTCUSD licks its wounds in the $7,600 area but remains vulnerable to further losses.\nThis time, the reason behind the latest sell-off was not a technical one. The US Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into price manipulation of large cryptocurrencies like bitcoin , and the market took this news rather painfully, despite the industry has become more immune to regulatory crackdown lately. The ongoing downtrend and quite high volatility exacerbated the negative market reaction to the news. Besides, as long as the regulatory uncertainty persists, long-term and institutional investors will likely remain out of the game, and this fact hurts the industry.\nIn the short term, the coin needs to confirm its recovery above $7,400 in order to resume the upside bias and return to $8,000 and higher. Once the dust settles, we may see further corrective rebound as the pair looks oversold and therefore attractive for opening longs. Should the current recovery attempts fail, the downtrend will gain traction, and the $7,000 figure will be at risk.

It was one of the most important reasons for me to be instantly passionate about the project.\nMr. A , [21.05.18 21:33]\nWhy so you decided to fund with an ICO? Why not the \"general investor market\"\nMr. B , [21.05.18 21:33]\n[In reply to Richard Ettl]\nSo the big thing is the box itself (the hardware) rather than whether it's supported or not on the Blockchain.\nRichard Ettl , [21.05.18 21:34]\n[In reply to Mr. B]\non the pharma side the blockchain is nice to have. on the food side it will enable a business model, where the admin of a box is done by the blockchain and thus much cheaper.\nRichard Ettl , [21.05.18 21:34]\n[In reply to Mr. A]\nWe are raising funds for 2 projects - SMARC (dividnd token) and LOGI (eco system token). I have to admit it is a challenge with 2 tokens. :)\nRichard Ettl , [21.05.18 21:35]\n[In reply to Richard Ettl]\nThe demand in SMARC is strong, but we need to answer a lot of questions from potential investors as all other projects are doing everything not be a security.\nMr. B , [21.05.18 21:35]\nLOGI is the clear case of a utility token/currency as depicted on our own WP.\nMr. B , [21.05.18 21:37]\n[In reply to Richard Ettl]\nYou would expect it being a security would make it more attractive from an investor's POV, as it's linked to a tangible P&L/operation.\nRichard Ettl , [21.05.18 21:37]\n[In reply to Mr. A]\nAgreed.

Don’t forget to join our Telegram channel for Crypto, Business & Technology news delivered to you daily\nHere is the state of play on Friday morning:\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) price is down 0.7% over the period to US$7,560.25 per coin, leaving the world’s largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalisation of US$128.9 billion. The price of Bitcoin fell as low as US$7,330 yesterday after reports revealed that the U.S. Justice Department has launched a criminal probe into price manipulation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nThe Ethereum (ETH) price is down 0.2% since this time yesterday to US$591.66 per token. This means ETH now has a market capitalisation of just over US$58.9 billion.\nThe Ripple (XRP) price has managed to defy the market with a 3.5% gain over the last 24 hours to 63.1 U.S. cents. This lifted XRP’s market capitalisation to just over US$27.4 billion.\nThe Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price is up 2% over the period to US$1,050.88, improving the Bitcoin offshoot’s market capitalisation to US$18 billion. At one stage yesterday the Bitcoin Cash price plunged as low as US$958, meaning it has now recovered by almost 10% from its low.\nThe EOS (EOS) price has been the best performer over the last 24 hours with a 10% gain to US$12.15.

The project is backed by Bo Shen — the founder of Fenbushi Capital and an early adopter of Ethereum — who will serve as both a cornerstone investor and strategic advisor to the team.\nShen said, “The nature of blockchain technology is to take a slice of the pie from vested interest groups, where you are bound to encounter resistance. To get your project off the ground, you must have vast industry and product resources. I invested in ContentBox because it has a strong technical team and a wealth of industry experience, and I believe it will become the first killer app for the digital content industry.”\nFounded two years ago by former Google manager Renee Wang, Castbox allows listeners to find, access and create spoken audio content in multiple languages through virtually any device. The company’s proprietary technology includes in-audio deep search so listeners can customize their audio experiences, and curated podcast recommendations powered by natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. With over 16 million users in 175 countries, the company has raised roughly $30 million in funding from top venture capital firms like ZhenFund, SIG China and IDG.\nSince the days of Napster’s inception, audio content publishers and creators have fought over who should have control in how content is monetized and distributed. Speaking with Bitcoin Magazine, Castbox representative Mark Lee says that the creation of ContentBox was inspired by the ongoing fight against copyright infringement and piracy in the digital content arena.\n“Independent creators and publishers are under attack from all sides,” he said. “Take YouTube as an example. There was once a time when the platform democratized the creation and distribution of user-generated videos. Creators that produced great content were rewarded accordingly, and YouTube quickly became a major player in the entertainment industry.”\nMore than a decade later, smaller, independent creators are struggling to make a living, he noted.\n“They pour their hearts and souls into their work, but these big platforms have taken full control over the way content is handled, leaving the average creator with little to no income, and virtually no ownership over their content. This issue is rampant across all major content platforms. Publishers face the same challenge, as more and more of their content is shared and consumed on third-party channels like Facebook.”\nWang says that the digital media industry was originally built on principles of inclusivity, but that it has also become too top heavy to support independent publishers and creators. In addition, most advertising revenue winds up in the hands of major studios instead of the creators, where it belongs.\nShe says the blockchain can solve this problem by removing middlemen and high transaction fees, while also introducing new streams of revenue like activity-based income (i.e. creators are paid when someone listens to their content) and subscriptions.\n“The digital content industry has remained relatively opaque over the years regarding paid media, and advertisers typically rely on vanity metrics like impressions to determine returns on investments (ROIs),” said Lee.\nHe suggested that the blockchain can allow advertisers to tap into shared statistics and pay via advertisement viewership automated by smart contracts.\n“By decentralizing the podcast industry with a shared content pool, a shared user pool and a unified payout system, this new project creates an open source community that can’t be controlled by a few industry giants.”\nThis is where ContentBox comes in. The system provides listeners with an array of blockchain-based solutions that power a unified payout system for the digital content arena. Users can access content by paying with digital tokens through what’s known as BOX Payout, a secure and borderless payment transaction network.\n“The base asset of ContentBox are BOX tokens which are Ethereum-based and are standard ERC20,” said Wang. “There won’t be an ICO but there will be an airdrop. BOX tokens are the only way to transact within the app but they will be listed on a couple crypto exchanges by early July, so users will be able to cash out to Ether if desired.”\nUsers garner these tokens by sharing content with others, inviting friends and joining the company’s Telegram channel. They are also granted access to digital wallets that manage their rewards.\n“Consumers engage in a wide variety of value-creating activities vital to the growth of the podcast community, like helping to share and create content, but are never financially rewarded,” said Lee. “Blockchain allows listeners to become stakeholders that get rewarded for their contributions. In turn, they can directly reward their favorite podcasters with the tokens they earn, or unlock premium content.”\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .

Ponzi Scheme Head Vanishes A statement on the BTC Global website said: “The admin team cannot locate him. If anyone has ANY information on how we can get in contact with him please get in touch and let us know. Until Steven Twain resurfaces or is found there is nothing the admin team can do.”\nThe statement included a request for threats towards the leaders and admins to stop, suggesting legal proceedings as an alternative. It said that all of the admin staff had funded him independently and that they were missing a week’s worth of pay. It does also acknowledge that the staff had only two ways of contacting him.\nIn an email statement, the police said:\n“Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by BTC Global agents to invest with promises of 2 percent interest per day, 14 percent per week and ultimately 50 percent per month.”\nA ponzi , or pyramid, scheme is a business model that requires a constantly expanding supply of new members. They are illegal in many countries because while they can result in big profits for the founding members, the high numbers of new members lose out when the scheme collapses. Investigation Supports Sceptical Reviews\nMany outside observers were worried about the company after trying to research Steven Twain. Marketing agency SEO Spark reviewed BTC Global and concluded that although the funds manager sounded ‘impressive,’ there was no concrete evidence to back up a single claim.\nThe review predicted: “This turns BTC Global Team into a Ponzi scheme, and as the story goes, the company will shut down and collapse once investment activity inevitably dies down. Once this happens, the anonymous admin(s) will make off with the majority of the earnings, most all [sic] affiliates will lose out, and that’ll be the end of it.” The Hawks have launched an investigation into alleged fraud totalling more than one-billion rand by Bitcaw Trading Company, commonly known as BTC Global, after close to 30-thousand investors suffered losses. #sabcnews pic.twitter.com/xXxNMWq0qo\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\nIn February, security specialist Mike Bolhuis posted on Facebook a report on South African BTC Global that stated: “These guys have not been trading since there is no evidence of trading activities at all.” It continues that: “They have been running a full blown pyramid scheme where payment is accepted in Bitcoin and members are promised revenue that they will never earn.”\nSouth Africa has recently been in the news after a ransom request was demanded in Bitcoin for the kidnapping of Katlego Marite. On Wednesday, NewsBTC reported that three suspects were taken into custody over the kidnapping. The demand was made for 15 Bitcoin, worth around $123,000 at the time it was requested on Sunday.\nSouth Africa’s central bank has also announced they are setting up a self-regulatory organisation for the cryptocurrency space. The aim would be to reduce the risk of scams and malpractice while encouraging innovation. Bridget King, Director of Banking Practice, also expressed her concerns over the anonymity involved in the crypto space even though the majority of projects use public ledgers.

CheapAir ‘Doing Testing’ With BTCPay\nAccording to comments on social media, BTCPay, which offers open-source merchant software, could officially become the new processor for Cheapair after it dropped Coinbase earlier this month.\n“We had a nice run with Coinbase but they are sun-setting their merchant platform next week,” the company wrote confirming the planned switch May 24.\n“We’re looking for an alternative and right now are doing some testing with (BTCPay).”\n— BTCPay Server (@BtcpayServer) May 25, 2018\nCoinbase revealed it was retiring its merchant processing function in April, a move which the cryptocurrency industry condemned for its disruptive consequences.\nBitPay, a processor which along with Coinbase continues to be arguably the best-known option for Bitcoin payments, appeared to miss out on wooing CheapAir, meanwhile, which has offered Bitcoin since 2014 and was the first ever travel agency world-wide to accept bitcoin. BitPay Wallet Rules Cause Doubts\nThe company had originally sought to transfer to BitPay, but for undisclosed reasons instead opted for the open-source alternative. The crux, as CheapAir highlighted in a statement last month, could be wallet support.\n“We have had a great experience with (BitPay) so far and our integration is largely complete. But our one giant concern is that Bitpay does not support “non-payment protocol wallets” (wallets that aren’t BIP-70 compliant),” it reads.\n“So if you do not have a compatible wallet, you would have to get one and use it as an intermediate stage for your Bitcoin payment.”\nA request for user input fielded sixty responses.\nDiscussing the move, an executive wrote on BTCPay’s Twitter account that “It makes me even happier that they were considering Bitpay at first, but changed their mind.\nFeedback on BTCPay’s user experience has been positive from both users and industry figures, with Bitcoin Think editor Beautyon commenting CheapAir represented “what a properly run company looks like.”\nBTCPay has also garnered acclaim from Bitcoin core developer Nicolas Dorier, who told Bitcoinist it held specific advantages over BitPay in December.\nWhat do you think about CheapAir.com using BTCPay for its Bitcoin payments?

But having gained a serious foothold in industries like online betting, and having slowly edged its way into the mainstream consciousness, we can expect Bitcoin to be around for a long time to come.In fact, it’s likely to get a lot bigger in the coming years. Regardless of the future, we can say with certainty that Bitcoin is ‘trending’ in some sectors, one of which is eSports betting.You can bet using Bitcoin on games such as:● Counter-Strike: Global Offensive● Starcraft 2 – Wings of Liberty● Hearthstone● League of LegendsIf you’re interested in betting on CS: GO check out esportbets.se .Betting on Bitcoin isn’t a lot different than betting with any other currency. In essence, you bet at set odds on given outcomes, and you either win or lose.However, there are some pros and cons, or you could call them risks and rewards, to betting on eSports with Bitcoin. Let’s take a look at those now. The Risks of Betting with Bitcoin (1) Sending Money to the Wrong Address If you haven’t already used Bitcoin before, there’s definitely a learning curve involved. It actually turns out to be easier than using traditional payment methods, but it can seem strange at the start.To deposit in an eSports betting site, you’ll have to send Bitcoins to the Bitcoin wallet belonging to the betting site. This will be an ugly-looking series of letters and numbers.Some people have sent Bitcoins to the wrong address due to a typo or error. They can be difficult to retrieve and it’s a major headache, to say the least. (2) The Price Can Fluctuate Wildly Bitcoin is infamous for its volatility. In fact, it’s these wild swings in price that have so many people mystified by Bitcoin. While some see this as an investment opportunity in and of itself, others are understandably put off.Realistically, you could deposit $1,000 of Bitcoin on a Friday and it might only be worth $600 if you wanted to cash it out the following Monday. That’s without even betting it!Of course, it could also increase in value, but the point is there’s just no telling. Some say betting with Bitcoin is double dipping, since holding Bitcoin is sort of like betting in and of itself. (3) Hacking/Hackers A few scary stories have been printed in the media over the last few years about Bitcoin being stolen by hackers.Hackers are pretty clever, but most of the time these stories leave out the fact that the coins weren’t stored securely, to begin with.Keep your Bitcoins on a hardware wallet, or at least a desktop wallet, will significantly reduce your chances of losing them. If you do this, and never give your private keys to anyone, it’s almost impossible for anyone to steal them. The Rewards Of Betting With Bitcoin (1) Faster, Cheaper Transactions Some betting sites take fees, and some credit cards, debit cards, and banks slap on extra fees when you make deposits at online betting sites.Bitcoin is an open-source network. You don’t need permission to use it and no extra fees apply to certain spending categories. There’s a flat fee per transaction, but this will be minuscule when compared to the percentages card providers might take.This also works when it comes time to make a withdrawal. Bitcoin transactions take around 30 minutes and that is when the network is busy. (2) Bitcoin – No Permission Required It doesn’t matter where you are in the world, you can use Bitcoin. You don’t need to fill in an application form to get a Bitcoin wallet, and you don’t need permission from anyone.This makes it handy when you want to circumvent certain restrictive regulations. It’s really important to keep things legal, but there are some grey areas and Bitcoin can help in those cases. (3) The Price Can Fluctuate Wildly Wait, what? Did you just experience Deja Vu? Didn’t I say that this was a potential negative to using Bitcoin?Yes, I did, and the truth is it’s both a risk and a potential reward. While the price could nosedive, it could also skyrocket, leaving you with a lot more currency when you cash out your Bitcoin than you paid for it. Summary Whether or not you feel the risks outweigh the rewards or vice versa, we’ll no doubt continue to see Bitcoin making its presence felt across various industries , eSports included.Whatever you decide to do, may lady luck be with you, and remember – if you do bet on eSports with Bitcoin, always do so responsibly!

Next, the attacker used their dominant computing power to force the rest of the network to accept falsified blocks that reversed their initial deposits and caused these funds to vanish from exchange-controlled wallets.\nAs CCN reported, an address associated with the attacker had sent itself more than 380,000 BTG in a series of transactions consistent with double spending behavior. It’s not clear how many of these transactions resulted in successful thefts from exchanges. In theory, the attacker could have made off with more than $18 million worth of funds, but only if every transaction resulted in a successful theft (again, the attacker’s rate of success has not been verified).\nThe project’s developers blamed the attack in part on the fact that bitcoin gold’s mining algorithm — Equihash — is used by a number of other cryptocurrencies, rendering the pool of available hashpower much larger than the bitcoin gold network’s individual hashpower.\nBitcoin Gold had already planned to move to a new algorithm, a decision the community made after mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain announced that it was accepting preorders for the first Equihash ASIC miner, and the developers said that moving to this new algorithm will render the network “dramatically safer” from future 51 percent attacks.\nThey said that, particularly in the wake of the recent successful attack, they will deploy the new algorithm as quickly as possible:\n“We’ve been working at an incredible pace the past days to put the plan and pieces together, and we expect to upgrade our mainnet approximately seven days after the necessary software is up and running on our testnet.”\n“While it would be better to give all our partners more than seven days to test and deploy to avoid disruption, these attacks have already forced disruption on us all, so we feel it’s best to get the upgrade completed as soon as we possibly can,” they concluded.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin gold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T00:07:52.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "514b72f6d154c240ba54860a8988bbabe1621e01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf33rmrDO.mAs_0CQ9OWIR5ENEjGMX_WZgejEIgxgTu1nnkQt8W6PMhN76yJGQDkQxGgAKeRk02hurhRf51Pr90rw-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "A mini business!

But having gained a serious foothold in industries like online betting, and having slowly edged its way into the mainstream consciousness, we can expect Bitcoin to be around for a long time to come.\nIn fact, it’s likely to get a lot bigger in the coming years. Regardless of the future, we can say with certainty that Bitcoin is ‘trending’ in some sectors, one of which is eSports betting.\nYou can bet using Bitcoin on games such as:\n● Counter-Strike: Global Offensive ● Starcraft 2 – Wings of Liberty ● Hearthstone ● League of Legends\nIf you’re interested in betting on CS: GO check out esportbets.se .\nBetting on Bitcoin isn’t a lot different than betting with any other currency. In essence, you bet at set odds on given outcomes, and you either win or lose.\nHowever, there are some pros and cons, or you could call them risks and rewards, to betting on eSports with Bitcoin. Let’s take a look at those now. The Risks of Betting with Bitcoin\n(1) Sending Money to the Wrong Address\nIf you haven’t already used Bitcoin before, there’s definitely a learning curve involved. It actually turns out to be easier than using traditional payment methods, but it can seem strange at the start.\nTo deposit in an eSports betting site, you’ll have to send Bitcoins to the Bitcoin wallet belonging to the betting site. This will be an ugly-looking series of letters and numbers.\nSome people have sent Bitcoins to the wrong address due to a typo or error. They can be difficult to retrieve and it’s a major headache, to say the least.\n(2) The Price Can Fluctuate Wildly\nBitcoin is infamous for its volatility. In fact, it’s these wild swings in price that have so many people mystified by Bitcoin. While some see this as an investment opportunity in and of itself, others are understandably put off.\nRealistically, you could deposit $1,000 of Bitcoin on a Friday and it might only be worth $600 if you wanted to cash it out the following Monday. That’s without even betting it!\nOf course, it could also increase in value, but the point is there’s just no telling. Some say betting with Bitcoin is double dipping, since holding Bitcoin is sort of like betting in and of itself.\n(3) Hacking/Hackers\nA few scary stories have been printed in the media over the last few years about Bitcoin being stolen by hackers.\nHackers are pretty clever, but most of the time these stories leave out the fact that the coins weren’t stored securely, to begin with.\nKeep your Bitcoins on a hardware wallet, or at least a desktop wallet, will significantly reduce your chances of losing them. If you do this, and never give your private keys to anyone, it’s almost impossible for anyone to steal them. The Rewards Of Betting With Bitcoin\n(1) Faster, Cheaper Transactions\nSome betting sites take fees, and some credit cards, debit cards, and banks slap on extra fees when you make deposits at online betting sites.\nBitcoin is an open-source network. You don’t need permission to use it and no extra fees apply to certain spending categories. There’s a flat fee per transaction, but this will be minuscule when compared to the percentages card providers might take.\nThis also works when it comes time to make a withdrawal. Bitcoin transactions take around 30 minutes and that is when the network is busy.\n(2) Bitcoin – No Permission Required\nIt doesn’t matter where you are in the world, you can use Bitcoin. You don’t need to fill in an application form to get a Bitcoin wallet, and you don’t need permission from anyone.\nThis makes it handy when you want to circumvent certain restrictive regulations. It’s really important to keep things legal, but there are some grey areas and Bitcoin can help in those cases.\n(3) The Price Can Fluctuate Wildly\nWait, what? Did you just experience Deja Vu? Didn’t I say that this was a potential negative to using Bitcoin?\nYes, I did, and the truth is it’s both a risk and a potential reward. While the price could nosedive, it could also skyrocket, leaving you with a lot more currency when you cash out your Bitcoin than you paid for it.\nSummary\nWhether or not you feel the risks outweigh the rewards or vice versa, we’ll no doubt continue to see Bitcoin making its presence felt across various industries , eSports included.\nWhatever you decide to do, may lady luck be with you, and remember – if you do bet on eSports with Bitcoin, always do so responsibly!

At face value, the image is a word cloud of words and numbers taken from Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakomoto’s whitepaper, all different sizes and overlapping each other.\nThe words “blocks”, “transaction,”“attacker” can be seen among dozens of others, with the Bitcoin symbol superimposed on top, creating a white area.\nThe poster, whose Reddit account has no history beyond this post, had this to say about their puzzle:\n“This work is comprised of Satoshi Nakamoto’s famous whitepaper words, scaled by Log N. Disparate ideas inspired Satoshi to create a solution to revolutionize modern socio-economics and industry. The work reflects on the elements that brought this technology to life, and challenges the underlying security model. Hidden in plain sight lies something more: a treasure hunt. 1 BTC is concealed within the work.”\nWhile Redditors will have to depend on the good faith of cryptogreetings upon winning, the poster did link a Bitcoin address containing poster linked a Bitcoin address with 1.00152389 BTC in it, with the extra amount of roughly $12 likely aimed to cover fees.\nRedditors have come together to voice their theories and lament the difficulty of the task, with the top comment in the thread being “I’m better equipped to sell a kidney or $9k.” Another user trying to solve the puzzle with math agreed that this was a sobering thought, and a third chimed in saying “I started the same thing. Then I realized there is millions of possible permutations in the key. It’s actually just as difficult to brute force the encryption.”\nMany other users admitted they had no idea where to start with the puzzle. Not everyone gave up so easily, however, with other users banding together to figure it out. Reddit user Zyntra posted: “Some stuff I noticed so far: Some words start with a capital, when other words dont. Many words and math, but some letters just stand alone. You can find a C, W, M. Some digits are single as well There’s a number crossed out by some icon on the bottom right of the big Bitcoin B. I don’t know if or what that icon means though. There’s quite a bit of open space in the top right corner, given how filled the rest of the image is. Some numbers make sense as a part of math or whitepaper references. But the longer numbers make no sense to me, theyre not dates or references to the whitepaper, like 19981101″\nu/AnotherSmegHead figured out the numbe of times different words were used in the Bitcoin whitepaper and worked with that. “Here are the most frequently used words in the Whitepaper: transaction 69 block 67 hash 33 nod 31 chain 27 attacker 23 network 21 proof-of-work 18 owner 17 work 16 coin 16 one 15 honest 15 public 14 timestamp 14 trust 14 key 13 without 12 new 12 system 11 party 11 ne 11 probable 11 accept 10 value 9 cpu 9 z 9 k 9 longest 8 merkle 8 next 8 catch 8 p 8 header 8 nonce 8 problem 8 time 8 power 7 signature 7 proof 7 verify 7 prev 7 make 7 long 7 node 7 link 7 sender 7 majority 7 payment 7 q 6 If you save the image you get the image name as NdLEoUJCqNLlZFQBKEr7lxTK-PKQjqi5FtBM8k5lqs8 Remember me if you crack this code ;-)”\nAn important clue came from u/cryptogreetings themselves. When u/mishax1 stated that “there are 239 BIP39 seed words in that picture,” the original poster said “you can throw at least half of those out. This is clue #1.” When asked for more clues, u/cryptogreetings was cryptic, saying that perhaps hints could be dropped in the future if the task proved difficult. They also revealed that 1 BTC was the first prize, but not the only one. “There’s also some consolation prizes scattered in there, but let’s not even talk about those for now ;)”\nThis isn’t the first time Bitcoin has been hidden in puzzles to be solved. Artist Marguerite Driscoll collaborated with three others in 2015 to conceal 4.87 Bitcoin in her art, which at the time amounted to about $1150. Her paintings acted as puzzles to be solved by the community, bringing forum users on Reddit and BitcoinTalk together to figure it out.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi nakomoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:16:11.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "80802ecb26b52e163d390ea3b8e3fb4fc0a9989d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS8Igkb1NGFAfP7fhEbXVjNg-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn free bitcoins daily with no investment from internet", "title_full": "Earn free bitcoins daily with no investment from internet", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.161, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "80802ecb26b52e163d390ea3b8e3fb4fc0a9989d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS8Igkb1NGFAfP7fhEbXVjNg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn free bitcoins daily with no investment from internet", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nTo take part in the promo, you need to make public post on your timeline in one of your social networks and keep it live at least before the promo ends.

Aayush Jindal | May 25, 2018 | 4:08 am Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: Can BCH/USD Recover? Aayush Jindal | May 25, 2018 | 4:08 am Key Points Bitcoin cash price found support near $950 and started an upside move against the US Dollar. This week’s crucial bearish trend line with resistance at $1,040 was breached on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is now trading above the $1,020 resistance and it may correct further in the near term.\nBitcoin cash price is recovering nicely from $950 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD could recover further as long as the price is above $1,020. Bitcoin Cash Price Support\nAfter a major slide , bitcoin cash price found support near the $950 level against the US Dollar. The price traded as low as $947.3 where buyers appeared and prevented declines. A fresh upward correction was started and the price moved above the $980 and $1,000 resistance levels. It even succeeded in moving above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,190 swing high to $947 low.\nMore importantly, this week’s crucial bearish trend line with resistance at $1,040 was breached on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. At the moment, the price is trading just above the $1,050 level and is showing positive signs. It has to settle above the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,190 swing high to $947 low to gain momentum. On the upside, there is a strong resistance zone near $1,080 and $1,100. A break above the $1.100 resistance level could open the doors for more gains in the near term.\nLooking at the chart , the price is slowly recovering and it could move towards $1,100 and $1,120. However, any further upsides above $1,100 and the 100 hourly simple moving average won’t be easy.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is slowly moving back in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is now back above the 50 level with positive signs.\nMajor Support Level – $1,000\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,100 Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: Can BCH/USD Recover? was last modified: May 25th, 2018 by Aayush Jindal ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin cas", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "aayush jindal", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T10:50:56.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ef66c911622d097e16984c15edb57d29d56ae26b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7wltKwZ1aiCs6rIVOd7OEU-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.078, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ef66c911622d097e16984c15edb57d29d56ae26b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7wltKwZ1aiCs6rIVOd7OEU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nTo take part in the promo, you need to make public post on your timeline in one of your social networks and keep it live at least before the promo ends.

Will blockchain-based bitcoin or one of its peers supplant fiat (government-managed) currency once the masses decide a truly free-market system is superior? Or, will leaving the world’s monetary system up to a panic-susceptible crowd open the door to far too much volatility to make bitcoin a consistently useful means of storing and conveying value?.Unregulated cryptocurrencies have no creation ceiling, and their creators have every reason to make them as long as buyers are willing to exchange — and this is telling in itself — fiat currency for them. For bitcoin to “work” as a true global currency, there can be no other choices of cryptocurrency. Despite bitcoin’s nine-year existence, most organizations still want to be paid in fiat currency.That reason is (touching on elements of the other characteristics of money), cryptocurrencies are far too volatile to feasibly use as a primary means of doing business. While most governments can and sometimes do it poorly, the value of fiat currency is “throttled” by a central bank with an agenda of stability in mind. Just bear in mind that bitcoin, or any digital currency for that matter, has never been truly tested. Coin spectator is an automated news aggregation service.

Revolut is one of the more forward-thinking firms in this regard, as the banking app is integrating investment support for both XRP and Bitcoin Cash, both of which make a lot of sense. Revolut, a UK-based challenger bank app, is taking a completely different approach in this regard.By adding both XRP and Bitcoin Cash to its list of supported currencies, Revolut now lets its users invest in all of the major cryptocurrencies through traditional means. Earlier on, the company added Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin support. One thing to keep in mind is that Revolut doesn’t allow users to send or receive cryptocurrencies.Nevertheless, for those users who are not looking at cryptocurrency in any serious capacity, this solution will be more than sufficient to keep them engaged. In the end, it is good to see more financial firms paying attention to various cryptocurrencies. After all, there is a lot more to cryptocurrency than just Bitcoin, even though all other currencies are linked to the top dog in every way. Coin spectator is an automated news aggregation service.

As reported by The Guardian , witnesses stated that a gold Toyota Corolla with three occupants had pulled up near the teenager.\nLocal news mentioned that a man, dressed in black with a green jacked quickly grabbed the teenager and dragged him to the vehicle as they drove away. The abducted teen’s friends reported the incident to his mother who informed the police.\n“We are investigating a case of kidnapping that happened on Sunday in Witbank,” said Leonard Hlathi, a police spokesman. “There was a demand that was made that the parents should deposit cash in bitcoins.” Local media mentioned that the ransom note was left at the kidnapping scene. Cryptocurrency Demand First of its Kind in South Africa\nWhile South Africa has experienced an increase in kidnappings, the cryptocurrency ransom demand is the first of its kind. The ransom note mentioned that “this is a kidnapping… we demand a ransom of 15 bitcoins to be paid into the below bitcoin wallet address to secure your child’s safe release – non – negotiable.” Advertisement advertisement\nThe ransom also had deadlines for payment. The first part of the amount was due on Monday, May 21. The kidnappers mentioned in the ransom note that they would murder the teenage boy if the parents were unable to meet the demand. The note also said not to involve the police. A spokesperson for the police department stated that the boy’s parents are “going through trauma.”\n“They don’t even know what this bitcoin is,” said Hlathi. “They’re devastated, and you can see they’re worried and asking themselves: where’s our son?” The boy’s mother pleaded with the kidnappers to “bring back [her] son.”\nUnfortunately, Hlathi could not reveal further details since the matter is currently under investigation. Ransoms Demanding Cryptocurrencies on the Rise\nAlthough cryptocurrencies were worth very little half a decade ago, they now hold a lot of value, especially since bitcoin has become a popular payment method for ransoms over the past few years.\nIn December 2017, Reuters reported a situation where Ukraine kidnappers had released an employee at a UK-registered cryptocurrency exchange after receiving $1 million in bitcoin as ransom.

Batch That!\nMeanwhile, pressure is growing on Bitcoin exchanges, which adopted SegWit to continue improving the efficiency of transactions and reducing fees, as a result, for users by implementing so-called ‘batching.’\nDesigned to minimize the number of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) on the Bitcoin blockchain, batching saved money by inserting multiple outputs into one transaction, data for which would not change in size as a result.\nWhile both network fees and usage has decreased in step with prices since 2017, a fresh examination of batching released this week calls for continued “parsimony” to aid Bitcoin scaling.\n“If a culture of parsimony can be encouraged, Bitcoin will be able to compress more data into its block space and everyday users will continue to be able to run nodes for the foreseeable future,” the research, led by the analyst known as Hasufly.\nWe view this as a very positive development. Members of the Bitcoin community that lobbied exchanges to add support for Segwit and batching should be proud of themselves.\nBitfinex, Binance, and Shapeshift already batch transactions, while Coinbase and Coinbase Pro say they have plans to do so.\nWhat do you think about SegWit’s gain in transaction share?

Wash trading is another technique, which is when there is a false impression of market demand when a trader buys against themselves, prompting others to follow suit. According to the report, prosecutors are working with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), a financial regulator that oversees trading against cryptocurrencies.\nThe crackdown comes amid price swings in value, the hotly debated issue of regulation, and an increasing trend of dubious initial coin offerings (ICOs) that fail to live up to their so-called promises. To highlight the risks that investors face with these types of fundraising platforms, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently launched a fake ICO website – HoweyCoins.com – designed to educate would-be investors on what they should look out for before investing into a scam.\nThese recent market conditions have seen a slump in the price of bitcoin. At the time of publishing, the digital currency is trading below $7,500, at $7,482, representing an 8.43 percent decline in the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap. This drop in price is worrisome as bitcoin faces closing this week below the 50-week moving average. According to Michael Baker, ETX Capital Analyst and Crypto Specialist, the battle is now on between the Bulls and Bears.\n“This is a significant development for bitcoin, we have only seen a few weeks over the last year where the price has dropped below the 50-week SMA,” he said. “Sustained holds and moves further away from $7.6k will no doubt put the jitters in the bitcoin bulls.” TAGS ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cryptocurrency firms as bitcoin price dips - coinjournal uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fca investigates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "financial times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "freedom of information", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conduct authority", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T03:45:15.037+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2e3b32029b03914da4ac1534dea2747c350c2f7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Aq8YInuc3fMvAJfvPYk64DbjFkLdAtMjGReG8pM2ECyHST.C.E0kT36zSo19ph65WI7ZgO2oR5lual.sRZSDpJ7jkq_ZTPNu1hSjPaw7okr1oHIzySmTy6tPnmbg4TDQ-", "site_full": "wnmtradio.com", "site": "wnmtradio.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "South Africa investigates $80 million bitcoin scam | News | AM 650 WNMT", "title_full": "South Africa investigates $80 million bitcoin scam | News | AM 650 WNMT", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://radiocms-images.us1.eldarioncloud.com/resize/1200/https://storage.googleapis.com/media.mwcradio.com/mimesis/2018-05/25/2018-05-25T100123Z_1_LYNXNPEE4O0QA-OUSTC_RTROPTP_3_TECH-US-SAFRICA-CRIME-BITCOIN.JPG?upscale=False", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2e3b32029b03914da4ac1534dea2747c350c2f7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Aq8YInuc3fMvAJfvPYk64DbjFkLdAtMjGReG8pM2ECyHST.C.E0kT36zSo19ph65WI7ZgO2oR5lual.sRZSDpJ7jkq_ZTPNu1hSjPaw7okr1oHIzySmTy6tPnmbg4TDQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Midwest Communications Inc.", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "South Africa investigates $80 million bitcoin scam | News | AM 650 WNMT", "text": "South Africa investigates $80 million bitcoin scam Friday, May 25, 2018 5:01 a.m. CDT FILE PHOTO: Representation of the Bitcoin virtual currency standing on the PC motherboard is seen in this illustration picture, February 3,\nJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African authorities are investigating an alleged cryptocurrency scam that defrauded investors of 1 billion rand ($80 million) with promises of huge returns that never materialized, police said on Friday.\nThe fraud investigation involves a company named BTC Global, which told clients they would earn 2 percent per day, 14 percent a week and 50 percent in a month, the police said.\nA search for the company on the internet showed its services had been suspended.\nThe website lists Steven Twain as the \"primary trader\".

Attackers were able to mine blocks in very quick succession and reap the resulting block rewards.\nThe price of Verge spiked briefly in April after the coin announced it had been added as a payment method at the popular porn site PornHub.\nCritics, however, have expressed serious doubts about Verge’s coding and true privacy levels. One anonymous critic in January posted a list of supposedly exposed Verge transaction addresses. If it's a public blockchain then it's not a privacy-focused currency. The one is the antithesis of the other.\n— Riccardo Spagni (@fluffypony) August 5, 2017\nMembers of the Verge community called the website listing exposed addresses, ‘fake news.’ Verge founder, Justin Valo told Coindesk that the addresses, “are just locations of Tor relay nodes…None of those are our actual users’ home IP addresses.”\nWhen the PornHub partnership was announced, a researcher for rival privacy coin Monero told CoinDesk, “I don’t view their deal with Pornhub as any endorsement or indication of their technical value. It just indicates that you can make a deal with Pornhub if you pay millions of dollars.”\nVerge has downplayed the significance of the attack on Twitter. For about 40 hours after news of the attack became public, the company issued just a single tweet stating that the hack was a mere “ddos attack” on miners.\nYesterday around noon, a marketer tweeted to the “Verge Family” that the attack was short-lived and a matter of growing pains. “The whole attack only lasted for 6 hours and a patch is already on its way. Resolving this issue will only make #Verge and our network stronger!” #VergeFam Verge was under attack 2 days ago. The whole attack only lasted for 6 hours and a patch is already on its way.

All pools and miners suffer from this, the attacker is getting all blocks currently.\n— supr nova *no giveaways* (@SuprnovaPools) May 22, 2018\nThis attack follows another of the same nature endured by the Verge network in early April in which 250,000 coins were stolen.\nCoinswitch has reported that 35 million Verge coins, worth about $1.7 million, were stolen in this latest hack.\nBitcoin Gold, a coin generated as a hard fork of Bitcoin to supposedly resist mining centralization, was hit with a significant “double spend” attack around May 16th.\n“To execute the attack, the miner acquired at least 51 percent of the network’s total hashpower, which provided them with temporary control of the blockchain. Obtaining this much hashpower is incredibly expensive — even on a smaller network like bitcoin gold — but it can be monetized by using it in tandem with a double spend attack,” wrote CCN writer Josiah Wilmoth.\nAs the attack took place, the attacker began depositing stolen BTG back and forth between exchanges and a “hot” (or online) wallet controlled by the attacker. The hacker passed the coins through exchanges by depositing and then quickly withdrawing again while using his or her control of the network to “reverse” earlier transactions and deposit them same coins again at an exchange.\nThe wallet address associated with the attack reportedly received over 388,000 BTG, coins that could conceivably be sold for around $18 million.\nBitcoin Gold tweeted about the attack May 16th and linked to a blog post where they urged exchanges to up the number of confirmations they require to process coins. An unknown party accessing large amounts of hashpower is using \"51% attacks\" to perform \"double spend\" attacks on Exchanges. We have been advising all exchanges to increase their confirmations requirement and to review large deposits. https://t.co/1PAQ1BKM2A\n— Bitcoin Gold [BTG] (@bitcoingold) May 18, 2018\nFinally, Japanese cryptocurrency MonaCoin reportedly suffered an attack last week in which a “selfish miner” managed to co-opt mining on the MonaCoin blockchain by secretly establishing a longer chain.\n“As is standard in most blockchain protocols, the chain with more blocks is considered by the mining network to be the correct chain…when the secret miner makes their longer chain public, it invalidates any and all of the blocks discovered by other miners during the time the secret chain was hidden,” writes Coinswitch.\nAll three of the recently attacked coins use the same energy-intensive system of network processing that Bitcoin does, a system called proof-of-work. Some critics of proof-of-work have used the attacks to cast doubt on that system.\nYesterday, however, prominent Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song blamed the attack not on proof-of-work, but on the fact that Verge code allows adjustments to mining difficulty on its network and too frequently uses five different algorithms. (Difficulty-adjusting algorithms modulate competition in mining networks.) Bitcoin adjusts its mining difficulty only every two weeks.\nHackers were able hijack the algorithm with the lowest difficulty and essentially print Verge rapidly for themselves.\nSong said that attacks like these are a result of incompetent building. “This is why you don’t role you own crypto, kids…You get into edge cases like these that you don’t handle very well.” Sponsored Links by DQ Promote You may also like...

From Japan’s real estate and stock market bubble in 1990 to the dot-com bubble and US housing bubble, each one had dire consequences for the economy and detrimentally impacted millions of people. Whether Bitcoin is destined for a similar fate remains a rife debate among investors and cryptocurrency experts alike.\nThis is according to Sameer Singh, Research Analyst at Old Mutual Wealth Private Client Securities, who says that of all the economic bubbles, none was more infamous than the Dutch Tulip Bubble that gripped Holland in the early 17th century.\n“Tulips, which were seen as a luxury item and status symbol, first boomed in popularity when a virus infected them, causing the petal colours of the flower to suddenly change into multi-coloured patterns. In 1634, speculators began to enter the market and saw how the new rich and middle class in Holland’s Golden Age were willing to pay extraordinary sums of money for a single bulb, and by 1636, stock exchanges were established to trade in bulbs and their future options.\n“Eventually though, in 1637, the market for tulips collapsed as people could no longer afford to purchase even the cheapest bulbs. This saw a tremendous drop in value and sparked a financial catastrophe for many,” explains Singh, adding that while the flower still remains popular in Holland, the story should serve as a reminder that markets can be extremely irrational at times.\nWhile Bitcoin has increased in acceptance, Singh notes that it still falls well short of mainstream fiat currency and the price movement over the recent past makes it quite unpredictable as a store of value. “Perhaps over time it could stabilise and gain mass appeal as a means of exchange. However, for now its volatility makes it more attractive for speculation than for facilitating trade.\nAs such, Singh says that those investing in Bitcoin as a currency should adopt an opportunistic trading strategy, pay attention to price action, analyse momentum indicators and utilise buy/stop orders regularly over short periods of time.\n“The alternative is to hold Bitcoin for the long term with the faith that its price will stabilise, its acceptance (as a means of trade) becomes more widespread and its purchasing power slowly increases over time. This, unfortunately, is still yet to be exhibited,” he adds.\nHowever, Singh believes that purchasing Bitcoin as a collectible because it was the first cryptocurrency, has a slightly better footing and similarities to being used as a store of value, as is the case with gold. “Within its code, Bitcoin was designed to reach a maximum number of units, 21 million Bitcoins to be exact. By most calculations, the total number of Bitcoins will reach their zenith in the year 2140.”\nThis brings about two consequential implications, he explains “Firstly, Bitcoin is scarce and, secondly, as a result, increasing demand should realise a higher value. Additionally, owing to the Blockchain existing outside of the financial system, it could serve as a store of value, a digital gold, for those seeking an alternative to the status quo of central banks, financial regulation and industry middle-men.\n“However, as it stands, the regulatory environment around Bitcoin remains a source of much uncertainty. Critically for purchasers, as with any investment, the price paid will be a defining element of the potential for future returns,” he adds.\nSo what does the future hold? This is the real “million Bitcoin” question, says Singh. “Blockchain as a technology and platform, we believe, is here to stay. There are numerous advantages that the platform maintains over traditional transaction networks which have seen organisations from central banks to private banks utilising the technology and creating their own closed loop networks for internal transactions.\n“These advantages coupled with the increased adoption of artificial intelligence portend an exciting future where, at the very least, the cost to transact (being measured in both time and money) should decrease.”\nSingh says that the future for Bitcoin, however, is somewhat more uncertain. “As we know, there are many more cryptocurrencies in circulation, most are quite similar in nature while others are quite different, such as Ether [1]. The issue for Bitcoin, specifically, is that it is the first cryptocurrency and has benefitted from this advantage.\nHowever, this leaves it open to disruption from new superior entrants, he concludes. “With the state of technology continually in flux and improvements in efficiency and productivity gains being the eternal pursuit, it would be bold to think that Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency to rule them all. Most importantly, when the next evolution of cryptocurrencies rises to the fore, astute investors and traders would be mindful not to get caught up in the hype, understand the critical aspects of the underlying technology involved and manage their expectations accordingly.” Posted on", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sameer singh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "research analyst", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T19:13:59.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "89a22150a630120d410890980aac92fbb39c3b30", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvegbPgjwKU8hfjJPGzl.qtECqF9eR78FizgGw5felNYQqS6dMHZiUnHdNdTEhdHT5SXlT2lKNAT65ZzkGw2hu_TzUijo7dR5lZawVRytCiJZjp6g5IgB3I", "site_full": "mymixfm.com", "site": "mymixfm.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "music", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "South Africa investigates $80 million bitcoin scam | News | MIX-FM", "title_full": "South Africa investigates $80 million bitcoin scam | News | MIX-FM", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://radiocms-images.us1.eldarioncloud.com/resize/1200/https://storage.googleapis.com/media.mwcradio.com/mimesis/2018-05/25/2018-05-25T100123Z_1_LYNXNPEE4O0QA-OUSTC_RTROPTP_3_TECH-US-SAFRICA-CRIME-BITCOIN.JPG?upscale=False", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "89a22150a630120d410890980aac92fbb39c3b30", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvegbPgjwKU8hfjJPGzl.qtECqF9eR78FizgGw5felNYQqS6dMHZiUnHdNdTEhdHT5SXlT2lKNAT65ZzkGw2hu_TzUijo7dR5lZawVRytCiJZjp6g5IgB3I", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Midwest Communications Inc.", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "South Africa investigates $80 million bitcoin scam | News | MIX-FM", "text": "South Africa investigates $80 million bitcoin scam Friday, May 25, 2018 6:01 a.m. EDT FILE PHOTO: Representation of the Bitcoin virtual currency standing on the PC motherboard is seen in this illustration picture, February 3,\nJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African authorities are investigating an alleged cryptocurrency scam that defrauded investors of 1 billion rand ($80 million) with promises of huge returns that never materialized, police said on Friday.\nThe fraud investigation involves a company named BTC Global, which told clients they would earn 2 percent per day, 14 percent a week and 50 percent in a month, the police said.\nA search for the company on the internet showed its services had been suspended.\nThe website lists Steven Twain as the \"primary trader\". A request for comment by Reuters sent to an email address listed on the website as belonging to Twain received no response.\n\"Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by agents of BTC Global,\" the police said in a statement.\n\"Some of the investors got paid in terms of the agreement. However, the payments suddenly stopped.\"\nLocal technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than $50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global.\n\"This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they've lost money,\" police investigator Yolisa Matakata said.\nThe investigation follows a case this week where kidnappers demanded a ransom in bitcoin of nearly $120,000 to release a South African teenage boy.\nOn Thursday South Africa's central bank said it was in the process of determining whether cryptocurrencies complied with its financial surveillance and exchange control regulations.\n(Reporting by Mfuneko Toyana; Editing by Joe Brock/Keith Weir) More From Technology ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "twain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven twain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc global", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T21:02:59.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d51efb59409ccaff65f4ad9db5b950d971c45050", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7dgJ8fVDmQ8rgPQj0Wgh0I-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d51efb59409ccaff65f4ad9db5b950d971c45050", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7dgJ8fVDmQ8rgPQj0Wgh0I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nShare the link to CryptoTab with your friends and get extra earnings in BTC depending on their earnings.

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

He spoke about the technology’s potential to do away with banks, venture capital and governments tied to geographical locations. In an interview on the sidelines of the The Next Web conference, he stuck to his prediction that Bitcoin will reach $250,000 by 2022, arguing that the cryptocurrency will break out of its current lull as spending increases.\nThe most valuable digital coin fell 0.8 percent to $7,491.79 as of 12:38 p.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg composite pricing. The currency is down more than 20 percent from a recent peak three weeks ago.\nDraper has been a consistent cheerleader of cryptocurrencies. In 2014, he bought about 30,000 Bitcoins from a U.S. government auction and has since invested in blockchain startups including Tezos and Bancor.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Justina Lee in London at jlee1489@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors Blaise Robinson at brobinson58@bloomberg.net, Jeremy Herron, Eric J.

More specifically, Money Forward wants to set up a trading platform in the near future.\nIt is always interesting to see more competition among cryptocurrency exchanges . More platforms give users more options and a competitive infrastructure to benefit from. Japan is home to many different trading platforms already, but there’s still plenty of room for growth. Money Forward is planning to make its mark on this industry moving forward. A Smart Move by Money Forward\nMore specifically, the company is currently developing its platform. Money Forward is increasingly popular in Japan as of right now. It allows users to manage financial portfolios in a streamlined manner. Adding cryptocurrency functionality seems to make a lot of sense. However, few people expected the company to launch an actual trading platform in the process.\nIt appears Money Forward has been looking into this matter for some time now. The original plan was devised back in 2017. Given the Japanese FSA’s stance on such trading platforms, the company will need to obtain an official license. It is unclear if the firm has taken the necessary steps in this regard.\nConsidering how Money Forward supports 5 million people, this new venture can make a big impact. There is also a booming cryptocurrency ecosystem in the country as of right now. A lot of competitors are making their mark on this industry right now. MUFG is also looking to get involved in cryptocurrency, albeit through its own native currency\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "binance", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "charts, guides & analysis sponsored", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "money forward", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T05:01:47.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3310a7c18b4c9487e47f3406cd9320588ce8d4bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTD7qWzcTneR3BTQquvtyjinORsNyCs2GiwIG9FR_BpNS6orJ3GZjEBrp1_7.D72syNUCABYGCdH.bx1CDFS61j2xGJvrPk9YC1Bzf6KrJ67wnx6j4Gt66q", "site_full": "www.capitalfm.co.ke", "site": "capitalfm.co.ke", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "S.African trader AWOL in $80 million bitcoin 'scam' - Capital Business", "title_full": "S.African trader AWOL in $80 million bitcoin 'scam' - Capital Business", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "KE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/business/files/2017/01/Bitcoin.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 22539, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3310a7c18b4c9487e47f3406cd9320588ce8d4bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTD7qWzcTneR3BTQquvtyjinORsNyCs2GiwIG9FR_BpNS6orJ3GZjEBrp1_7.D72syNUCABYGCdH.bx1CDFS61j2xGJvrPk9YC1Bzf6KrJ67wnx6j4Gt66q", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Agence France Presse Agence France-Presse Is A Global News Agency Delivering Fast", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "S.African trader AWOL in $80 million bitcoin 'scam' - Capital Business", "text": "S.African trader AWOL in $80 million bitcoin ‘scam’ Yesterday Shares Police said the company had targeted potential investors with promises of two percent interest per day, 14 percent a week and 50 percent per month./AFP\nBy AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE , Johannesburg , South Africa, May 25 – An alleged bitcoin currency scam in South Africa has left speculators with losses of more than $80 million as an investment company admitted Friday its senior trader had disappeared without a trace.\n“This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they’ve lost money,” said Yolisa Matakata of the Hawks police investigations unit.\n“Unregulated, unusual investments at home or abroad come with a high risk that people could lose all their hard-earned pension and other savings,” she warned.\nBTC Global said that its services had been suspended after its primary trader, identified as Steven Twain, had failed to reply to emails requesting payments.\n“We are as shocked and angry as everyone.

The mosque management announced that they are hoping to raise at least £10,000 in donations in the form of cryptocurrency over the month of Ramadan. They will be accepting both Bitcoins and Ethereum in the form of Zakat.\nDr. Muhammad Abu-Bakar of Blossom Finance in Indonesia researched on the functionality of Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies under the strict Islamic definition of money. According to the CEO of Blossom Finance, there are many other fatwahs from Muslim scholars around the world:\nSeveral recent fatwah issued by prominent Muslim scholars offered incomplete or contradictory opinions on the topic. With all the confusion out there, we wanted to offer clear guidance supported by solid research that benefits both laypeople and practitioners of Islamic finance Mathew Martin, CEO Blossom Finance\nThe conclusion of his research was that bitcoin is permissible in principle as it is accepted by a wide variety of global merchants. The bitcoin wallet address used by the mosque to receive the cryptocurrency has so far only received one donation, worth just over £100 at today’s prices.\nIf Muslims, who make up a quarter of the world’s population, hold just 1 per cent of bitcoins – or £1.04 billion – then £26 million in Zakat contributions is due Gurmit Singh, Founder & Advisor Bitcoin Wallet For the Mosque\nIt is likely the actual figure is much higher. Currently, hardly any mosques or Islamic charities accept Zakat in cryptocurrency. They are potentially losing out on millions of pounds.

Sarah Jenn | May 25, 2018 | 4:28 am Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Can It Finally Bounce? Sarah Jenn | May 25, 2018 | 4:28 am\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights Bitcoin price is still inside its symmetrical triangle formation and is currently testing support. A bounce could take it back up to the resistance around $9,000 while a break lower could lead to a test of the next support at $6,500. Technical indicators are showing mixed signals, so the move could mostly depend on market catalysts.\nBitcoin price has sold off to the very bottom of its symmetrical triangle formation, still pending a bounce or a break.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is still to the downside. This suggests that a breakdown is more likely to happen than a bounce.\nThe gap between the moving averages is also widening to show accelerating bearish momentum. Also, price is below the 100 SMA dynamic inflection point to reflect continued selling pressure.\nRSI is heading south to show that sellers have the upper hand, but the oscillator is already dipping into oversold territory to signal exhaustion. Turning higher could draw buyers back in and lead to a bounce back to the resistance. Similarly, stochastic is indicating oversold conditions but has yet to turn higher to signal a return in bullish pressure. BTC/USD Daily Chart\nMarket Factors\nRegulatory fears are being blamed for the recent leg lower in bitcoin price, although this could prove positive for the industry in the longer run. The US Department of Justice is reportedly conducting a criminal probe into price manipulation practices involving cryptocurrencies.\nIt’s worth noting that the dollar has been on weaker footing following the FOMC minutes release and the recent announcements related to North Korea. Trump has cancelled his meeting with Kim Jong-Un for next month, reviving geopolitical tensions but weighing on the US currency. However, bitcoin price has been unable to take advantage of this as it also seems to have been dragged lower by risk sentiment.

Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Launching on June 6\nThe wait for 7nm bitcoin mining products from Japanese internet giant GMO may be nearing to a close, as the company announced Thursday:\nGMO Internet Group will launch GMO miner B2, which is our own high-performance computer for mining (mining machine), on Wednesday, June 6, 2018. We will mass-produce the world’s first mining machine equipped with a cutting-edge 7 nm process based semiconductor chip (7nm mining chip; ‘GMO 72b’), which will be shipped at the end of October 2018. Illustration of GMO miner B2 provided by GMO.\nThe company has been working on research and development of the 7nm mining chip since September last year.\nGMO has been using “store-bought mining computers” for its mining operation launched in December, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported . Now it is ready to start producing its own mining equipment made with this 7nm chip, which GMO will use for its in-house mining operation as well as offer “the others to potential customers who are planning to mine,” the company confirmed.\nWhile GMO has not released images of the real mining hardware, the company has provided some illustrative images of the GMO miner B2 currently in development. Illustration provided by GMO. Interested Customers Can Register Now\n“An information session for potential customers considering the purchase of GMO miner B2 will be held on Wednesday, June 6 in Shibuya, Tokyo, and we will explain the details of GMO miner B2, such as price and performance,” GMO’s announcement reads.\nThere will also be an information session for the company’s cloud mining service on the same day. The sessions will be in Japanese. Registration is open to both interested customers and institutional investors. “Customers who have not registered in advance will be refused admission,” GMO emphasized.\nFurthermore, GMO Internet no longer plans to use an initial coin offering (ICO) for the sale of its 7nm mining boards as announced in October last year. A representative of the company told news.Bitcoin.com, “for this mining machine sales and cloud mining, we don’t plan to utilize ICO.”\nHow powerful do you think GMO’s 7nm miners will be?
