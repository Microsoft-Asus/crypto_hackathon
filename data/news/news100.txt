Tuesday, May 29, 2018 If Bitcoin Is A Fraud, So Too Is The Dow Jones Industrial Average 05/30/18Below is a chart of the ETF that tracks the value of bitcoin, GBTC, and the Dow Jones Industrial average for one year ending 4/29/18. One can easily see the correlation. They are the same chart. Maybe GBTC leads the Dow in direction. If so, GBTC is going lower while the last Federal Reserve instigated rally only turned ugly today with a near 400-point selloff. Let’s review.As I have been writing, America has been stripped of everything including a ‘market’ of stocks and the ability of investors to realize price discovery. The Fed is in charge of that. Forget Elliot Wave or fundamentals or anything else. That stuff only applies to real market behavior. Technical patterns only matter because the Fed manipulates them to keep us playing along. The selloff today will no doubt be met by a strong ‘buying’ surge early Wednesday morning. Clearly the Fed will not tolerate another breach of their self imposed Dikembe Mutombo Line (DML - see past articles for explanation) of 24k on the Dow. So, downside from here is limited.Readers may wonder, how can I be so precise in predictions. I wrote a few months ago that the DML had been established. I followed with the assertion that the Fed’s next target would be Dow 25k as this would give them a ‘higher high’. This way the Fed could say, “Look, we have an uptrend forming.” So forget everything about ‘markets’. They don’t exist anymore in our current police state of complete control. Readers want to know where do we go from here. As of this writing, the Dow is only 361 points above the DML. So, downside risk from here is limited. Next, the Fed has to push the Dow further than the now previous high of 25k. Looking at the charts, it looks like Mr. Powell’s nefarious band of NWO slavemasters would target Dow 25,400 or so. A thousand point rally is nothing for these people.Yes, I know that the yield curve is currently less than 40 bps from inversion. I know that stock buybacks and Fed intervention account for all stock valuation gains. Yes, I know that the SEC has launched an investigation into rather curious activity in the options markets where it appears that someone (cough-Fed) has been manipulating the VIX by buying the most out-of-money contracts in large volumes. So what?Welcome to the new america. Nothing is real. Nothing is true. No one wants to know the truth. It’s all one big con game. Investors are the mark. They are easy. They don’t know anything. Everyone I talk to repeats the same refrain - ‘stock prices always seem to come back up’. Yes, they do don’t they. I wonder why?That brings me to bitcoin. Many people believe bitcoin is a fraud. It has no value. Yet, these same people believe that the Dow is true and represents value. Look at the one-year chart below of the DJIA in gold and GBTC in black. They are essentially the same chart. How is it that one is pure speculation and gambling and the other is not. Charts don’t lie. Governments and banksters do. Notice one thing. Remember the slight Dow selloff in mid-April ’18. Remember the reason? Supposedly the 10-year US Treasury yield was spiking toward 3%. Then in May, the yield went over 3% and stocks rallied to the 25k mark on the Dow. Explanations are all BS. Explanations are given to keep investors, or suckers, playing along. As if, everything has to have a reason. Again, the only reason the Dow even trades is the Federal Reserve Bank uses it as a puppeteer uses strings. So again, look at the chart below and decide which line is a fraud. Hint, both of them. Note that bitcoin has been falling ever since the CBOE began trading bitcoin futures in December 2017. I knew that would be the end of bitcoin. It will never be allowed to compete with the Fed’s fraud paper money.

All of the Bitcoins that will ever exist were created when the genesis block was laid down. Miners don't mine Bitcoin, they mine blocks for the Bitcoin blockchain. In return for releasing a valid block, they are rewarded with an allocation from the initial pool, and they also receive the fees from the transactions they have included in the created block. Is this distinction significant? Well probably not for most users of Bitcoin, but if you are an investor, then I think it is. Comparison with gold, and calculations based on the scarcity of Bitcoin don't take this difference into account. Bitcoin miners create the bags to contain the 'gold' and not the 'gold' itself. A bag that used to be full, but all of the contents has been spent, is still important on the chain, and the spent contents will be included in future bags that have been mined.\nBitcoin price forecasts seem to focus on the cost of mining single Bitcoins, and I believe that this means the whole prediction is flawed.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvqqChy0IYY", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvqqChy0IYY"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T20:33:07.077+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1b4d05a9e16bdeb5f78f683a30ef485fccef1b9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYDQNYkVDmtR7MLE1Nkyr2R1", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp; Finance - 4chan", "title": "A hot chick just asked me how many bitcoins i have", "title_full": "/biz/ - A hot chick just asked me how many bitcoins i have - Business & Finance - 4chan", "published": "2018-05-30T00:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 17, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b4d05a9e16bdeb5f78f683a30ef485fccef1b9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYDQNYkVDmtR7MLE1Nkyr2R1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2018-05-30T00:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "A hot chick just asked me how many bitcoins i have", "text": "I dont have any btc but i do have some link.

I think this promotion way is very negative for Bitcoin. They showed that Bitcoin will be destroyed and their token will become number one.

Because it crosses the lines between commodity/security/currency/asset many countries are unsure of how to deal with it. If it gets classed as an asset in NZ you might be better off declaring your gains there due to the 0% CGT if you hold long enough.\nIt's currently a minefield. Crypto being online and international does you give you massive potential options in the future, just not now. Ronald McDonald never sells to children. He informs and inspires through magic and fun.

Along with this rapid expansion, the number of Bitcoin business opportunities has also grown.\nAlthough somewhat popular, day trading can be stressful and the volatility of the market can confuse even the most experienced crypto investors. Thankfully, even if trading crypto isn’t your cup of tea, there are still plenty of Bitcoin business opportunities that you can get involved with to do your part to further crypto adoption and put some extra Satoshis in your pocket. Bitcoin Volatility via American Institute of Economic Research\nDepending on your budget, you may find that some of these business opportunities are the perfect fit for you. BTC is going mainstream and there’s no shortage of entrepreneurial opportunities available. Below are just a couple profitable ventures to consider. Bitcoin Business Opportunities – Start Mining\nYes, mining BTC is still profitable in 2018 but you will need to make a considerable investment to get your enterprise started.\nDue to the competitive nature of the mining sector, though, you will want to invest in some quality mining hardware such as GPU or ASIC mining chips before you get started. Both of these options will provide you with far better results than attempting the process from your CPU directly, and by joining a mining pool, you can leverage your efforts with other members of the pool to split the profits.\nYou will need to consider the electricity costs in your area as most mining rigs can consume around a 1000W or more of power during operation. This can eat up your profits and make the entire venture a bust. Avoid this scenario by choosing a location with renewable or very low-cost electricity. BTC Merchandise\nThere is a serious demand for BTC-related merchandise . Everything branding the now famous BTC logo is a hot commodity in the market and BTC users can never get enough merchandise to show the world their love for Satoshis’ vision. Artist can create BTC-related shirts, poster, patches, screensavers, etc., and on top of being able to use the BTC logo freely, they can also utilize one of the many blockchain content platforms to offer their products securely. Remittance Payments\nBTC remittance services are seeing huge success globally. Countries such as India depend heavily on remittance payments and depending on where you live, you may find that there is a serious need for this service in your area. The remittance industry handles billions of dollars of commerce and BTC is perfectly suited to help people achieve a higher level of service when compared to the current business model. BTC ATM\nBTC ATMs are considered by many as the missing link in the crypto space. These units are not overly expensive and you can make some serious profit by offering people the ability to purchase their BTC directly from the kiosk. The best part is; most states don’t allow these ATMs to handle fiat currency withdrawals, so you never have to worry about filling the machine with cash. BTC ATM Payment Processors\nAny business owner can get directly involved in the crypto space by adding a crypto payment processor. Crypto processing has become very popular over the last year and most processors give you the ability to accept multiple types of crypto. The best payment processors even allow you to decide to withdraw your funds in BTC or fiat currency. This eliminates any loss of funds due to BTC market fluctuations. HODL\nTo HODL or Hold On for Dear Life, is a phrase that describes the BTC investor who simply purchases BTC and holds it. There is some serious sense behind this strategy. There will only ever be 21 million BTC mined and there are already over 17 million in circulation. This means that the chances are very good that the price of BTC will continue to rise as this scarcity hits the mining sector. BTC Groups\nBlockchain-based investment groups are popping up all over the world. Here, likeminded crypto-investors can meet up and discuss future projects and developments in the marketplace. Organizing a blockchain meet up group can be very inexpensive and the people you meet could end up becoming lifelong business partners should any of your joint ventures succeed. Most blockchain groups charge a small membership fee, which can also add to the overall profitability of this venture. Become a Professional Trader\nIf you are one of those individuals that have seen great success trading in the cryptomarket, then you may want to consider becoming a fund manager. There are a number of crypto platforms that are emerging in the market that utilize blockchain technology to allow anyone to become a fund manager. Users can verify the skill level of their manager via the blockchain. This way, investors can place their funds in the manager’s portfolio with confidence. Bitcoin Business Opportunities Are Everywhere\nAll it takes is a creative mind and a simple understanding of how cryptocurrencies work to find profitable Bitcoin business opportunities in your area. The decentralized market is here to stay and all those who position their investments wisely are sure to reap the rewards as BTC continues to go mainstream.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/", "https://btcmanager.com/indias-legalization-bitcoin-transform-countrys-remittance-market/", "https://coincentral.com/cryptocurrency-minings-drain-on-the-gpu-supply/", "https://allthingsdecentral.com/collections/frontpage", "http://www.the-blockchain.com/largest-blockchain-meetup-groups/", "https://coincentral.com/asic-mining-hardware-the-future-of-cryptomining/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin volatility via american institute of economic research depending", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T01:20:53.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3716de628f219df903cb6e16009d90d96b00b539", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqakB4oaHiZe901c_ZU11WJxGqdcehi6mK3tUhI4fjSbw__8zwo1Xg3BAfICS17eddTq9B8DxT4EFiP8z5i8PS3vLADDYyigFyF", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "How do some people can argue that selling you B-CH when they offer you Bitcoin is not a scam?", "title_full": "How do some people can argue that selling you B-CH when they offer you Bitcoin is not a scam? : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-30T00:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3716de628f219df903cb6e16009d90d96b00b539", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqakB4oaHiZe901c_ZU11WJxGqdcehi6mK3tUhI4fjSbw__8zwo1Xg3BAfICS17eddTq9B8DxT4EFiP8z5i8PS3vLADDYyigFyF", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jumpingcords", "published": "2018-05-30T00:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "How do some people can argue that selling you B-CH when they offer you Bitcoin is not a scam?", "text": "submitted by /u/Jumpingcords\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://gyazo.com/f4d4d00f597c566b759b9436aa35f8cd"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T19:31:54.095+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a92ec43e318711b3311968d365a16831994a64d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkdynKqnkSXb31f1WPWeURTJZEixslHtGj1UuGBIDBvldh7iDqAqX5BT_43hwVRF792A0UppIoh8B60VCL8rLORwod0E9K.5FysnsUXFwZ7SGA--", "site_full": "www.americanbankingnews.com", "site": "americanbankingnews.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/AmericanBankingNews", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "American Banking News", "title": "Bitcoin Scrypt (BTCS) Price Tops $0.0266 on Top Exchanges", "title_full": "Bitcoin Scrypt (BTCS) Price Tops $0.0266 on Top Exchanges", "published": "2018-05-30T00:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/205.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a92ec43e318711b3311968d365a16831994a64d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkdynKqnkSXb31f1WPWeURTJZEixslHtGj1UuGBIDBvldh7iDqAqX5BT_43hwVRF792A0UppIoh8B60VCL8rLORwod0E9K.5FysnsUXFwZ7SGA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ABMN Staff", "published": "2018-05-30T00:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Scrypt (BTCS) Price Tops $0.0266 on Top Exchanges", "text": "\nBitcoin Scrypt (CURRENCY:BTCS) traded up 1.2% against the U.S. dollar during the twenty-four hour period ending at 17:00 PM ET on May 29th.

The aforementioned website is likely to scam you if they are providing such a service in the first place.\nTo address the question, how much will it take to launch a 51% attack;\nFirstly you can check the current compute power (hash rate) and it's $ equivalent.\nhttp://rindex.io/attack-cost gives you the exact cost for a 51% attack at any given point of time.\nIf you compare the calculated hashrate against one of the more popular ASICs on the market, the figure stands at about 2.2 billion. However, this assumes that suddenly half of the network right now goes rogue and decides to attack it. If not, you would need more than 2.2 billion dollars since the hashrate needed has to be 51% of the total hashrate (after the attack starts).\nIts rather resource consuming and it isn't that big of a problem since none of the government really cares that much to spend their budget on attacking a cryptocurrency. You probably wouldn't profit all that much when you attack; doubt exchanges credits more than 2 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin automatically without raising a red flag.\nAlso, If you don't have 51% of the whole network (ie. more hashrate than the others), you don't have a 100% chance of executing an attack. The honest/longest chain still has a chance of overtaking you and you have to acknowledge their blocks. The probability of success decreases with the number of blocks.\nAssuming the attacker decides to do 51% attack by purchase lots of ASIC/GPU, but it's not a really accurate number because:\nThere's no way you could get thousands (maybe millions in the coming future) of ASIC/GPU units easily\nEven if they could, it's obvious that the price of ASIC/GPU will be more expensive due to high demand and low supply (this is already the case with graphics cards, poor gamers!)\nUnless you have a connection, it's highly unlikely you could use lots of electricity and big mining location without ringing any alarms\nNow, what if the attacker wants to hire a pool instead of investing in purchasing the equipment. In the current state where almost all mining power is concentrated within less than ten pools, that's enough to 'buy' a pool admin(s).\nWhy would even mining pools agree to \"rent\" their hashpower? If they actually did that, they would quickly lose their users. I don't really think if there would be many farms interested in this form of attack. Long-term earning is much wiser than trying to cheat and sell as much as possible. The rest of the network would quickly realize that the 51% attack was performed. Just look what is going on with Verge which is/was being attacked. The 51% attack is the reason why there are people who think that banning ASICs and mining only with GPUs is a good way to prevent it from happening.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://rindex.io/attack-cost"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T00:13:10.036+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1c4ff6da5a6c8cb0def761d11e62fb223e3d605c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYdCJqhIShJ7T7Q6req3XtI-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Would you Invest Bitcoin <> Trading bitcoin?", "title_full": "Would you Invest Bitcoin <> Trading bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-29T23:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.787, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1c4ff6da5a6c8cb0def761d11e62fb223e3d605c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYdCJqhIShJ7T7Q6req3XtI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bkrobottc1", "published": "2018-05-29T23:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "Would you Invest Bitcoin <> Trading bitcoin?", "text": "If I predict the trend, I will invest in Bitcoin .

CME Group Bitcoin futures for May (K) contract expired this morning. The Bitcoin Reference Rate settled at $7,493.94 and trading in May futures straddled the theoretical rate by $10 early in pricing period and $5 in last 10 minutes of pricing period. CryptoFacilities publishes the Reference Rate and more info can be found here . Calendar spreads between May and June Bitcoin futures traded in line with theoretical price during the month. Most spreads were legged on our desk because of limited liquidity in the CME Bitcoin futures calendar spread product. Lowlights & Potential Problems Settlement not ready for “Big Time” traders. We followed The Bitcoin Reference Rate settlement process very close the last 2 settlement cycles. The 4 exchanges that represent the settlement index is GDAX, Kraken, Bitstamp and ItBit. I’m concerned around the lack of liquidity and size being traded on the representative crypto exchanges. A small trader with a modest bank line could easily manipulate the settlement price. We are seeing a few “fishy” trades happening on a few of the reference exchanges. Could be coincidence or it could be “market maker” games. Institutional buy-side firms need more displayed liquidity on $CME exchange. Block desks are abundant and liquid but market impact costs on block trades are estimated around 50–75bp per trade — that’s potentially 10–15% annual market impact costs. Profit margins shrinking for market makers and prop traders. Trends More regulation for US cash exchanges. Cash exchanges will have similar regulatory requirements as stock and futures exchanges and OTC platforms. Bad actors will not SURVIVE. Cash exchanges transaction fees are falling fast. A year ago, Bitcoin transaction fees were around10–20 basis points (bp) per notional value of Bitcoin and are now between 5–10bp. CME futures cost around 2bp to trade depending on your Futures Commission Merchant (FCM). Institutions adopting #crypto asset class. Hedge funds active in crypto space is reported around 250 new hedge funds. Estimated assets under management (AUM) is close to $7billion. Crypto trading is maturing and prop trading profit margins falling fast. Suggestions: Futures exchanges should consider a physically settled contract. I think a regulated exchange wallet that is owned by regulated exchanges could be the answer. Use Option Clearing Corp (OCC) or DTCC as blueprint.

The BTC\\/USD pair corrected higher a few points yesterday, but buyers failed to push the price above the $7,350 and $7,400 resistance levels. As a result, there was a downside reaction and the price broke the last swing low of $7,150.

However, the most significant resistance is close to $7,250, which was a support earlier. The stated $7,250 level is also around the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,445 high to $7,048 low. Above $7,250, there is a crucial bearish trend line in place with resistance at $7,300 on the hourly chart of the BTC\\/USD pair.\nLooking at the chart , the price is clearly struggling to move higher above $7,250 and $7,300.

In other words, the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse. The 100 SMA also held as dynamic resistance and the gap between the moving averages is widening to reflect strengthening bearish momentum. \\n\nRSI pulled out of the oversold region but is turning back lower to show that bears refuse to let up. Stochastic also moved back south without even reaching overbought conditions, which means that sellers are eager to stay in. \\n BTCUSD Chart from TradingView \\n\nMarket Factors \\n\nRegulatory concerns and the selling of Mt. Gox bitcoin are two of the main factors being blamed for the recent slide in bitcoin price. There have been no other big industry updates lately, so it’s understandable that most investors are being spooked by the drop. \\n\nTo top it off, risk appetite has been notably weaker on account of geopolitical risks in U.S. and in Europe. In particular, Spain and Italy are likely to undergo elections for its top leadership positions, and the uncertainty is weighing on the appetite for riskier assets and driving traders towards safe-havens like the dollar. \\n\nThe US has the NFP report lined up later this week and stronger tightening expectations from the results could further boost the US dollar. On the other hand, a return in risk-taking on weak data and slower tightening expectations could lead to some profit-taking and a much needed BTC\\/USD bounce. \\n\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Heads Up for this Bearish Breakout!

As more people adopt the cryptocurrency, the digital currency has exhibited cracks in its ecosystem, mainly due to the scalability issues. While the rapid growth of the community is one of the contributing factors, the major issues are said to lie with the Bitcoin Core development team and their inability to rapidly introduce scaling solutions. The conflicting views of the developers and mining community have further exacerbated the situation. \\n\nAs the Bitcoin Core community struggle to score the necessary consensus to improve the protocol, various teams have decided to take the matter into their own hands to preserve the \\u201clegacy\\u201d of Bitcoin by creating improved hard forks of Bitcoin blockchain. Advancing in this sphere is Lightning Bitcoin, a Bitcoin hard fork by the Lightning Team. The Lightning Bitcoin, LBTC, in short, is forked at Block 499,999 of the Bitcoin blockchain and adopts a more efficient Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism instead of the native Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism. \\n\nWith the implementation of \\u00a0DPOS, the platform includes the best of two strong cryptocurrency networks\\u00a0 — Bitcoin and EOS. The use of DPOS, not only increases the security but with 2MB block size, it also increases the speed of transactions and optimizes smart contract support. The DPOS consensus mechanism has already been successfully implemented with BitShares and EOS platforms which has further increased the confidence in LBTC\\u2019s capabilities. \\n\nWhile the POS consensus mechanism has been hailed by many for its various obvious advantages, including the low processing power requirements and cost-efficient minting solution, it has also shown a fair share of vulnerabilities including the susceptibility to attacks and the possibility of node desynchronization with malicious intent. The Delegated Proof of Stake mechanism implemented by LBTC overcomes most of these vulnerabilities, but still being a synchronous network module exhibited potential loopholes. \\n\nTo overcome the issue, the LBTC developers have introduced DPoS consensus mechanism which can not only provide the benefits of a DPoS blockchain but also presents a Byzantine Fault Tolerant protocol which can eliminate the possibility of node dissynchronization due to UTXO. By doing so, LBTC is on its way to position itself as the best cryptocurrency blockchain for not just transactions, but also dApps development. \\n\nMore information about Lightning Bitcoin is available at – http:\\/\\/lbtc.io \\n\nThe post Lightning Bitcoin Implements DPoS, Set to Become the Best Blockchain Protocol appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin core", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lbtc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lightning team", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T15:14:05.038+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "731ecdd15e3570822449186e6466d71c5a6ef5f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUDcXZCDLH5FUFhrFF.dmRHhCPJmNFBar4IRRmPV3E5vNMe_2v0CK3HjRKlNQbcLuarJBfA5N6PWRO0bo897mia", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/daily-forex", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Daily Forex - Barchart.com", "title": "BTC\\/USD \\n\\n Bitcoin fell slightly during the tra", "title_full": "BTC\\/USD \\n\\n Bitcoin fell slightly during the tra", "published": "2018-05-29T23:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "731ecdd15e3570822449186e6466d71c5a6ef5f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUDcXZCDLH5FUFhrFF.dmRHhCPJmNFBar4IRRmPV3E5vNMe_2v0CK3HjRKlNQbcLuarJBfA5N6PWRO0bo897mia", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Christopher Lewis", "published": "2018-05-29T23:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "BTC\\/USD \\n\\n Bitcoin fell slightly during the tra", "text": "BTC\\/USD\nBitcoin fell slightly during the trading session on Monday, but keep in mind that the Americans were away for the Memorial Day holiday. The bitcoin market continues to look very soft regardless, so although it has been low-volume on Monday, it’s just more of the same. We lost roughly a $120 during the day as I record this, so I think we are likely to go down to the $7000 level, and then possibly the $6000 level after that. Rallies at this point are to be sold on signs of exhaustion, but I think that the markets continue to suffer from a simple lack of interest. Quite frankly, I don’t think that anybody is overly excited about the market, which in the end could be a good thing. At this point, I believe we will go looking towards the bottom of the markets, perhaps reaching down towards the $6000 level.\nBTC\\/JPY\nBitcoin fell during the trading session on Monday, breaking below the ¥800,000 level. The market should continue to go a bit lower from here, and I think we will find support down that the ¥700,000 level. That is the bottom of longer-term trading and consolidation, so keep that in mind. However, we have failed it to rally the way that we needed to in order to show signs of life. Because we could not reach the highs again of the consolidation area, that leads me to believe that eventually the sellers will break this thing down. Breaking down below the ¥700,000 level opens the door to the ¥600,000 level eventually. Currently, I don’t have any interest in buying this pair as it looks to be a bit too negative recently.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T15:13:21.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b32a3358091f56c86d77dc01ebebc2926840087", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhNy4hy0zSGQgIeO2vfPqZao-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-29T23:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4b32a3358091f56c86d77dc01ebebc2926840087", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhNy4hy0zSGQgIeO2vfPqZao-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-29T23:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 29, 2018 NEWS 'BCH is Bitcoin ': Rory MacDonald hooks up with Bitcoin Cash CoinGeek MMA champion and outspoken fan of cryptocurrency Rory MacDonald has made his Bitcoin Cash connection public.

The launch of the EOS mainnet, which was originally set for June 2, has reportedly been postponed until the vulnerability is fixed.\nLast week, blockchain venture capitalist Spencer Bogart predicted that Bitcoin will be trading “at least” above $10,000 by the end of 2018. Bogart said he would sell altcoins like Cardano, TRON, IOTA, and NEO, because he thinks they are “over-promising and under-delivering.”\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com

The BTC\\/USD pair corrected higher a few points yesterday, but buyers failed to push the price above the $7,350 and $7,400 resistance levels. As a result, there was a downside reaction and the price broke the last swing low of $7,150.

However, the most significant resistance is close to $7,250, which was a support earlier. The stated $7,250 level is also around the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,445 high to $7,048 low. Above $7,250, there is a crucial bearish trend line in place with resistance at $7,300 on the hourly chart of the BTC\\/USD pair. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the price is clearly struggling to move higher above $7,250 and $7,300.

Massive", "text": "Bitcoin is a notoriously volatile market. Massive price swings occur on a regular basis and cause a fair bit of negative market pressure. One of the main questions is whether or not there is effectively any degree of Bitcoin price manipulation taking place. The proof is in the pudding, but it remains difficult to say for sure. The Wild Bitcoin Price Swings\nOver the past nine years, there have been many debates regarding the Bitcoin price . It is an extremely unstable market, which tends to see ups and downs when people least expect it. To some users, this is a clear sign of market manipulation. Others see it as “another day at the office”. In a lot of cases, the BTC price is fluctuating for no apparent reason at all.\nFinancial markets, in general, seem to be prone to manipulation. It has happened before, and it will continue to happen for some time to come. People with a lot of money to spend will look for any way to improve their portfolio. This is no different in the world of cryptocurrency, which is perhaps even easier to manipulate, to a certain degree.\nMore specifically, all cryptocurrencies have a rather low market cap. Albeit $150 billion sounds pretty steep for Bitcoin, it is a small market compared to traditional assets. Anyone looking to influence cryptocurrency prices will effectively manipulate the markets whenever they see fit. Proving this is done on a large scale, however, will always remain rather challenging. The Manipulation Will not Stop\nThe US Justice Department is looking into Bitcoin price manipulation right now. Whether or not they will find anything out of the ordinary, remains to be seen. Even so, indicting anyone for this manipulative behavior will pose another big problem. Large holders of Bitcoin can effectively influence the market with a few clicks of a button, but that isn’t necessarily nefarious intent.\nVery few people benefit from a lower Bitcoin price. Miners need a specific BTC value to break even, let alone make a profit. Large holders of Bitcoin are not inclined to see their portfolio value drop either. Exchanges have no real benefit from a lower Bitcoin price either. As such, there is plenty of circumstantial evidence regarding cryptocurrency price manipulation. Not enough to effectively change this situation overnight, unfortunately.\nFor the time being, it remains to be seen what the future holds for the Bitcoin price. Rest assured the manipulation will not stop, for better or worse. Those driving the price down will continue to do so until they are satisfied. The ultimate objective of doing so remains a bit unclear at this stage. An uneasy Bitcoin price situation will remain in place for quite some time to come.\n Image from Shutterstock\nThe post Bitcoin Price Manipulation Steers World’s Top Crypto in Difficult Direction appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T15:14:39.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a4f2ff133a66fb822775298af6cb0a3b0936980e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNPxrdtSwVsqRHFOVaACuyx8gew1SiS0pFVV02Njh9j6uVs9WFgPFGbcGfnJ.bc68L85gNVmg1leqr14.RakpY0M8CzZBvr.Xtw--", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/news-btc", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "NewsBTC - Barchart.com", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price is under press", "title_full": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price is under press", "published": "2018-05-29T23:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a4f2ff133a66fb822775298af6cb0a3b0936980e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNPxrdtSwVsqRHFOVaACuyx8gew1SiS0pFVV02Njh9j6uVs9WFgPFGbcGfnJ.bc68L85gNVmg1leqr14.RakpY0M8CzZBvr.Xtw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aayush Jindal", "published": "2018-05-29T23:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price is under press", "text": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price is under pressure and is currently trading below $920 against the US Dollar. \\n There is a short-term bearish trend line formed with resistance at $900 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). \\n The pair may continue to move down and it could soon break the $875 support level. \\n \\n\nBitcoin cash price is in a bearish trend below $1,000 against the US Dollar.

In other words, the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse. The 100 SMA also held as dynamic resistance and the gap between the moving averages is widening to reflect strengthening bearish momentum. \\n\nRSI pulled out of the oversold region but is turning back lower to show that bears refuse to let up. Stochastic also moved back south without even reaching overbought conditions, which means that sellers are eager to stay in. \\n BTCUSD Chart from TradingView \\n\nMarket Factors \\n\nRegulatory concerns and the selling of Mt. Gox bitcoin are two of the main factors being blamed for the recent slide in bitcoin price. There have been no other big industry updates lately, so it’s understandable that most investors are being spooked by the drop. \\n\nTo top it off, risk appetite has been notably weaker on account of geopolitical risks in U.S. and in Europe. In particular, Spain and Italy are likely to undergo elections for its top leadership positions, and the uncertainty is weighing on the appetite for riskier assets and driving traders towards safe-havens like the dollar. \\n\nThe US has the NFP report lined up later this week and stronger tightening expectations from the results could further boost the US dollar. On the other hand, a return in risk-taking on weak data and slower tightening expectations could lead to some profit-taking and a much needed BTC\\/USD bounce. \\n\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Heads Up for this Bearish Breakout! appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T15:00:57.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "41e35b422bdc26339036845f3a91ef9d28219cc6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT6_X5lPbN1GtviPzdts8F3G6I6pbsyej0nF0Mt3ZHc6JQlgR_.9TkCP0vrgkE7VqljJeDM3hZ0RYHjVcI6wB6rX2tojaIl6rDaCg6wpPDbTnQj3pqUgCmXoFX3vWCuRVQ-", "site_full": "www.tickerreport.com", "site": "tickerreport.com", "site_section": "http://www.tickerreport.com/rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Ticker Report", "title": "Bitcoin 21 (XBTC21) Price Down 19.2% This Week", "title_full": "Bitcoin 21 (XBTC21) Price Down 19.2% This Week", "published": "2018-05-29T22:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s3.tradingview.com/tv.js", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "41e35b422bdc26339036845f3a91ef9d28219cc6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT6_X5lPbN1GtviPzdts8F3G6I6pbsyej0nF0Mt3ZHc6JQlgR_.9TkCP0vrgkE7VqljJeDM3hZ0RYHjVcI6wB6rX2tojaIl6rDaCg6wpPDbTnQj3pqUgCmXoFX3vWCuRVQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Stephan Byrd", "published": "2018-05-29T22:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin 21 (XBTC21) Price Down 19.2% This Week", "text": "Tweet\nBitcoin 21 (CURRENCY:XBTC21) traded 1.5% lower against the dollar during the 24-hour period ending at 10:00 AM E.T. on May 29th.

Since then, BTC has recovered to $7,450, but regardless of the newly formed optimism in the market, it is still too early to conclude the start of a new bull market.\nWeak Volume As CCN reported throughout late May, analysts expect the bitcoin price to fall below the $7,000 mark in the near future before rebounding to its mid-term support levels at $10,000 and $12,000. On May 29, BTC came close to reaching below the $7,000 mark as it dropped to $7,040.\nOver the past few hours, BTC rebounded relatively quickly from $7,050 to $7,450, but its short-term corrective rally is not convincing enough based on its volume and price trend to conclude that a new bull rally is forming.\nOne respected bitcoin technical Quote: :\n“Recent price action has taught us that these thin, fast moves up should be treated with some caution. They’re known as liquidity voids and price often, though not always, comes back to fill them in. If price can find support above $7,450 that would suggest a break in market structure & these would be the next logical areas to reach for (shorter-term). If it can’t/fails to close on a higher high, would suggest this thin move was just a stop run of the blue swing high.”\nThe technical analysis of the short-term trend of bitcoin is backed by the shortage of volume over the past 24 hours. The abrupt spike in buy volume which caused BTC to jump by more than $4000 was smaller than the sell volume recorded merely two days ago, demonstrating that the recent price surge of BTC is temporary.\nThe downward trend of bitcoin throughout May has been strong, and it will require a significant bounce from a proper support level for BTC to eye previous levels at $10,000 and $12,000. Investors like Willy Woo see the next major support level at $5,700, while many traders expect BTC to rebound from the lower end of the $6,000 region.\nAs of current, the volume of BTC, which remains just over $5 billion, is not sufficient to initiate a short to mid-term recovery. The trading volume of Tether, a cryptocurrency whose value is hedged to that of the US dollar, is often a good indicator of the short-term state of the market as cryptocurrency traders regularly utilise USDT to hedge the value of cryptocurrencies to the US dollar.\nUSDT’s volume is currently larger than Ethereum and EOS at $2.8 billion and has crossed 50 percent of the volume of BTC, signifying that traders are not confident in the short-term trend of the cryptocurrency market.\nWhere Does the Market go Next? Despite the strong performance of bitcoin on May 29, it is likely that the cryptocurrency market will continue to fall until major cryptocurrencies find a strong support level and bottom to bounce off of. For bitcoin, its short-term bottom will likely be the lower end of $6,000, at least in the short-term.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post Bitcoin Price Rebounds From $7,040 to $7,450 but Bulls Yet to Turn Up appeared first on CCN .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CryptoCred/status/1001443657034162182", "https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-price-rebounds-from-7040-to-7450-but-bulls-yet-to-turn-up/", "https://twitter.com/CryptoCred/status/1001443657034162182&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vRCBna3SgxoEyMEA8JxhFA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjgxO2g9NTc2/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/ebaee1db26281da7d2529134c396aa8e", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kM18g.baOuJvpaW8vGqi1w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/ae00576b606709b56d3a04e6a3ca4275", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vRCBna3SgxoEyMEA8JxhFA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjgxO2g9NTc2/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/ebaee1db26281da7d2529134c396aa8e);", "https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-price-rebounds-from-7040-to-7450-but-bulls-yet-to-turn-up/&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T10:33:13.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a387238afb33aba7f1d1c08b4c75afcf01e43136", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.srWXQxHpKqCS1UCzNJtWSqUG0XlqCOvtLbmtl1oKPVYRgeIsEYnpxI4-", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Complete List - Bitcoin Friendly Countries for Cryptocurrency Businesses in 2018", "title_full": "Complete List - Bitcoin Friendly Countries for Cryptocurrency Businesses in 2018", "published": "2018-05-29T22:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a387238afb33aba7f1d1c08b4c75afcf01e43136", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.srWXQxHpKqCS1UCzNJtWSqUG0XlqCOvtLbmtl1oKPVYRgeIsEYnpxI4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-29T22:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "Complete List - Bitcoin Friendly Countries for Cryptocurrency Businesses in 2018", "text": "Complete List - Bitcoin Friendly Countries for Cryptocurrency Businesses in 2018\n/u/jbuuuush\nsubmitted by /u/jbuuuush\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T22:49:35.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dbafeb1389ac54dc0c44b7958b25fbced09573e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWEsBSwHveWIoFqCsEw9b.E-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Which is more risky?

In our country (coz I'm not sure if this exist in other countries). When you have a large amount on your account they will call you and ask you if you want to invest, minimum of 20,000 Php (or 400 USD). They will propose some investment plans where there is a choice of low, medium, or high risk investment. When you choose the high risk there is a chance to lose or gain 100% of your investment (Medium is 75% and low is 50% if I remember it right). It doesn't make sense to me, it sounds like a scam, they will invest using your money and you don't have any control to it. That is why I like bitcoin more, coz Though it is risky and it's very volatile, you have full control on your investment.\nWhat do you guys think?\nI agree with you. Both are risky, but in bitcoin you have an advantage. You have control on your money, you'll be able to monitor your money. You're responsible if you'll lose your money or make profit with it. Meanwhile in banks, if you invest just like what the author said, you'll lose your money if you go for a high risk investment, and also if you store money for a long period of time, the value will be lower because of the inflation.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T19:35:24.003+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 22208, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=10000", "requestsLeft": 562}
