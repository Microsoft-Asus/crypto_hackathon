A Scottish hospital is treating people who are addicted to trading cryptocurrencies in the UK’s first ever ‘crypto clinic,’ the Evening Standard reported today, May 28.\nCastle Craig Hospital in Peeblesshire, the Scottish Borders, has created a course of residential treatment for those it deems to be crypto addicts.\nExperts told the Evening Standard that crypto trading can become a form of behavioural addiction, with traders obsessively glued to “minute-by-minute” market fluctuations. The devised treatment program is therefore closer to existing methods for treating gambling addictions, rather than to substance abuse programs.\nChris Burn, a gambling therapist at Castle Craig Hospital, was quoted by the Evening Standard as saying:\n\"The high risk, fluctuating cryptocurrency market appeals to the problem gambler. It provides excitement and an escape from reality. Bitcoin, for example, has been heavily traded and huge gains and losses were made. It's a classic bubble situation.\"\nTony Marini, a former gambling and cocaine addict, is leading some of the center’s new treatments. Marini told the Standard that “introducing life structure is key,” adding:\n\"I see cryptocurrency trading as a way for people to escape from themselves, into another world, because they don't like the world they're in. The first stage of treatment is to join other addicts in group therapy and share their life stories. This helps them identify with each other and realise that they're not alone.\" Castle Craig said that there are currently no figures for the number of ‘crypto addicts,’ but “around 13 mln” people worldwide are trading in the system.\nLast year, Cointelegraph reported on a Bitcoin investor who used his home as collateral for a $325,000 equity loan, in pursuit of making a mid-term profit on the cryptocurrency. Crypto community members, evidently viewing his investment mindset as equivalent to gambling , remarked that the move was “almost like a high school chemistry teacher deciding to begin making and selling crystal meth due to a change in life circumstances.”\nFrom another perspective, there has been some discussion in the UK as to whether declaring your crypto trading to be gambling could help to avoid taxes with the British tax authority HMRC, which generally deems crypto profits as subject either to income or capital gains tax laws. ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : cointelegraph.com", "highlightText": "",

He owns the YouTube channel ‘data dash’ has around 300,000 followers and he has occupied a position between Crypto experts like Tom Lee and John McAfee. Mertan tweeted that Bitcoin will go to $50000 in 2018. Crypto Influencer join Bitcoin Bulls Nicholas Merten, has tweeted his opinions and big prediction on bitcoin price to hit $50,000 by the end of year considering its drop downs in the market. However, whenever his shares his opinions or predicts, he can bring changes in trends over his 34,000 followers. On May 27 th , 2018 he predicts on his tweet that Bitcoin is going to hit double of its 2017’s value by 2018. On the note, considering the recent drop downs, Merten has lists four aspects and believes that it will help Bitcoin price up to heights. Further, one among his followers, Sammy Tommy have pointed out on his tweet and said, “interest rates have no correlation with cryptocurrency prices and that though Deutsche Bank is restructuring, there is no way a bank of that size is going under by the end of the year.” However, another follower asked Merten about the prediction by 2018 crypto market cap, he writes that, “in his model it should go to $1 trillion”. Initially, Merten seems to be seen somewhere between John McAfee an individualist in crypto space and others like Tom Lee and Brain Kelly who always brings traditional aspects on market predictions. Other Crypto Expert’s Predictions After concerning the dropping in Bitcoin price after the late last year impressive performance, the research head at Fundstrat Global Advisors, Tom Lee has believed that Bitcoin will experience a major height owing to upcoming consensus conference. Tom Lee has also undertaken the fact by combining bitcoin’s highs and lows situations. It has always given efficient gains during and after previous Consensus conferences. As a result, it is now all set to set for another Bitcoin Rally. He said, “Already one of the largest crypto conferences in the world, attendance this year is up dramatically. The coming at a time when Bitcoin/Crypto is down YTD. Hence, we expect the Consensus rally to be even larger than past years”.\nThe CEO and Founder of digital assets investment fund BKCM LLC, Brian Kelly predict that Bitcoin could attain $25000, a new high by this year. Kelly said in an interview with CNBC. In an interview, Kelly has supported Tim Draper prediction. As he had said Bitcoin hits $250000 by 2022. Meanwhile responding to Draper’s prediction, Kelly said: “it sounds crazy,” when one considers that BTC already had a 4,000 percent return over two years, a 3,000 percent return over four years could be a “continuation of the trend we’ve seen”.

Bitcoin News reported recently that Febraban, the Brazilian Federation of Banks with 126 associated members, has now published tests of its research into blockchain technology. A survey conducted by Febraban in 2017, found that 65% of industry executives in Brazil said their businesses are currently studying blockchain implementation. The digital direction appears to be forward thinking.\nSuch moves are progressive, but McCallan argues that it seems that the “free-flowing nature of Brazilian soccer or salsa dancing” doesn’t translate into the country’s economic policy. Often cited as an economy on the rise, Brazil is one of the most corrupt and economically controlling governments in Latin America, ranking 153rd in the world for economic freedom, according to new Heritage Foundation think tank study. Also, both former and current presidents are facing charges of economic corruption and mismanagement.\nThe decentralized nature of Bitcoin and blockchain is currently allowing some Brazilians to avoid and circumvent prohibitive lengthy government legislation and over-regulation. New technology allows some traders, consumers and business owners to upload encrypted documents backed by blockchain, thereby avoiding lengthy verification processes.\nWriting in Valuewalk , Brazilian author and Youtube star Raphaël Lima laments: “Brazil needs Bitcoin… According to a study by Credit Suisse, Brazil’s productivity has not risen since 1981, and it’s not going to rise if the government keeps banning everything that can make us more productive.”\nIt appears that the Brazilian government is listening. The new ABCB agency, which was started by a fintech Atlas Project, has said that it wants to lead projects based on global cryptocurrency and blockchain advances. ABCB’s management believes that the lack of a legal framework is the main barrier towards Brazil’s further progress in crypto space, and with the World Cup and Brazilian presidential elections imminent, no quick fix is expected.\nWith a wait of 83 days or more for a business permit for anyone wishing to do business in Brazil, it appears that the government isn’t in a hurry.\n Bitcoin Could Be a Brazilian Bureaucracy Breaker 9", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://t.me/bconews", "https://bitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-could-be-a-brazilian-bureaucracy-breaker/", "https://www.valuewalk.com/", "https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom", "https://bitcoinnews.com/febraban-126-member-banking-coalition-in-brazil-test-blockchain-technology/", "https://hackernoon.com/the-humanitarian-side-of-bitcoin-a0edd2dd0490", "https://bitcoinnews.com/", "http://www.febraban.org.br/Arquivo/Quemsomos/english.asp"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ruairi luke mcc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mccallan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hacker noon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "febraban", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazilian federation of banks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazilian association of cryptocurrencies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abcb", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "são paulo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "latin america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T16:22:16.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "99be5cb9c50885073fa65f2209276a7bfaf2b751", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWEsBSwHveWIwK_zXE4caNo-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Which is more risky?

Also, such decision depends on your home country, government's approach toward Bitcoin and the sense of people (if most of them feels it's good then it's good) - and some other criteria. so you need to take all these in mind and consider the best one for you.\nBitcoin is best investment. Nowadays most of the invest in the bitcoin. Bitcoin is any time to use and easy to use any country. It good future saving. It any time to increase the price. So wait for the price increase. Bitcoin is always your hand. It safe and any time to exchange any country currency. If need to exchange first check the price list. If price will be increase then sell it. Bitcoin is save your time and get more profit. So time is important of this process. So time to acct.\nMost of the bank not give the full information and process.

The general cryptocurrency market has been in a consistent downtrend this year – the market cap of the general cryptocurrency market is down 36% YTD. The hype about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies continues to rise and fall as financial analysts try to understand its value proposition on finance and economics.\nHowever, in the technology sector, we are more concerned about how blockchain technology could disrupt the world. Cryptocurrencies are interesting, but they are only one out of the hundreds of possible applications of blockchain technology . This piece looks at how blockchain technology is changing the world, one project at a time, with a review of the most recent blockchain pilot programs. Image Source: Hacker Moon Blockchain-based remittance solution in southeast Asia\nLast week, a consortium of south-east Asian banks revealed that they have successfully piloted a blockchain-powered cross-border transfer in real-time between Thailand and Singapore. Bank of Ayudhya in Thailand using its own blockchain, called the Krungsri Blockchain Ledger successfully remitted money from a domestic bank account in Thailand to a Standard Chartered account in Singapore.\nThe pilot program has the support of MUFG Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, and Mitsubishi Corporation. In the announcement , Thakorn Piyapan, Head of Krungsri Consumer Group and Head of Digital Banking and Innovation Division notes that the international remittance was “successfully completed in a matter of seconds, the technology-based transaction helps enhance their subsidiaries’ financial liquidity toward greater flexibility and efficiency.” Blockchain startup helping people sell solar energy\nPower Ledger is a small Australian Startup that wants to use blockchain technology to promote the shift to renewable energy, especially through solar power. The startup has piloted an app that people who have installed solar panels in their homes can install. With the app, you get to enter a marketplace for selling excess energy to people in your neighborhood and you get to set the price at which you want to sell the energy. Power Ledger believes that distributed energy is the future of energy because its removes power from the grasp of corporation and places it in the hands of consumers.\nInterestingly, some stakeholders in the energy industry don’t agree that blockchain will fix the energy industry. For instance, Dylan McConnell, a Ph.D. researcher at the Australian-German Climate and Energy College observes that “Blockchain is basically a better way of managing settlement between different participants. And that is just not an issue in the electricity sector.” Berkeley City Council to raise funds with blockchain\nEarlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the city of Berkeley, California is starting a pilot program to apply blockchain technology to raise funds for the financing of community projects. In a unanimous vote, the city council agreed to commission the city manager to start a pilot program in which it will leverage blockchain technology to sell municipal bonds.\nThe city plans to launch “micro-bonds” for the issuance of low denomination bonds ranging from $10 to $25 instead of the traditional $5000 minimum that Wall Street sets on municipal bonds. Using blockchain to raise funds will make it easier for average citizens to invest in city projects and it would enable the city to find it much easier to raise funds without the encumbrance of financial gatekeepers on Wall Street.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has hinted that the local university could lose its Federal funding as part of his efforts to pull funding from sanctuary cities. Hence, the city needs to take proactive steps to keep its finances afloat.

And so, it is making moves to create its own cryptocurrency platform. An\nAlthough major traditional financial institutions have long ignored Bitcoin, and the digital currency market in general, it looks like this stubborn resistance of a new and perhaps lasting digital trend might be coming to an end. It seems that the New York Stock Exchange wants in on cryptocurrency, which signifies a greater acceptance on Wall Street in general, most likely. If Goldman Sachs’ entrance into the world of cryptocurrency just a few weeks earlier is any indication, the financial power brokers and the big wigs in the traditional world of money-management are now demanding access to Bitcoin and other online currency platforms. What the heck is this stuff?\nThe main — or at least most popular — cryptocurrencies are known as “Bitcoin,” “LightCoin” and “Ethereum.” These are, quite simply, digital money that is bought online. But that is probably the most simple aspect to it. With these currencies, there are no bills or coins, and they are not based in another asset such as gold. Also, they do not go through any traditional financial institutions such as banks. They are completely decentralized systems that use “blockchain technologies” to track transactions. Wait, wait, wait. Hold up. Blockchain?\nFirst off, blockchain technology can be distributed but not copied . This, you could say, is the backbone, or the motor, of this technology. It is how it got its visibility as such a game-changing and ingenious concept in the first place. It is what is so secure about this technological money-management innovation called cryptocurrency. It was originally devised for the digital currency known as Bitcoin — the first cryptocurrency to gain popular traction — but, interestingly, is now being used for other technologies that could benefit from enhanced transactional security. But here’s a quick breakdown of how it works: Someone requests a transaction and that transaction is then broadcast to a P2P network that consists of “nodes,” AKA computers. The node network — or series of computers — validates this transaction. In other words, the network vets it — as well as the user’s status. This is done through various algorithms. After this process, the transaction is considered complete. As the last step, a new “block” is added to an existing “blockchain” in a way that is permanent, unalterable and virtually unhackable. Now that that’s out of the way\nTo purchase something with Bitcoin, a Bitcoin client — let’s call her Diane — has to log into her “Bitcoin wallet.” To do this, Diane uses a unique combination of letters and numbers. Of course, usually, the transaction would get sent to two banks, one on each side of the transaction (let’s call the receiver Tom). These banks then record the transaction by subtracting from Diane’s account and adding to Tom’s account. However, here, the transaction is not shared with any centralized facilitators, but instead, with everybody in the Bitcoin network. This particular transaction is then added to a shared list of recent transactions (that’s the blockchain we defined earlier. The block is a transaction. And the blockchain is all the recent transactions on the Bitcoin platform). An odd detail\nThis is a bit weird, I know. But after the blockchain is formed, to ensure that each block of transactions on the chain is verified, a subset of the Bitcoin network joins a race to solve a very difficult algorithmic math puzzle. And whoever solves it first gets the honor of having their record of the block of transactions be the official record of the block of transactions. They are also rewarded with some Bitcoins of their own. And the new network gains another block on the chain as a result.\nThat is where this whole “mining” thing you have been hearing about comes from. But instead of mining for rock or precious ore, what is being “mined for” are extremely difficult puzzles. Or technological rock basically. The fact that many computers are competing to verify a block ensures that no single computer can monopolize the Bitcoin market. The puzzle becomes harder when more computers join the race in order to ensure that the race stays fair and equally timed for all competitors involved. Bitcoin protocol says that mining continues until there are 21 million Bitcoins in existence. That is supposed to happen around 2140, if Bitcoin lasts that long. Why 2140, you ask? Who knows. Just go with it. If Bitcoin lasts that long\nThat brings us to the topic du jour. Is Bitcoin picking up some credibility-steam here? Well, it looks that way, considering that the New York Stock Exchange is now working on a Bitcoin-trading platform. It is not exactly the NYSE, but its parent company, that is said to be developing its very own market for Bitcoin. This new online-exchange will be geared toward heavy-hitters in the investment arena. By the way, this is the kind of investment behemoth that the cryptocurrency founders have been waiting for so anxiously. Could this be a big moment in the cryptocurrency history?\nAlthough the whole undertaking could still fall apart, backing from Intercontinental Exchange (The NYSE’s parent company) is a good sign for the currency’s longevity. Or, at least, for its initial success. According to the report, delivered to The New York Times, “the new [online currency] operation at ICE would provide more direct access to Bitcoin by putting the actual tokens in the customer’s account at the end of the trade.” The operation would still be undertaken, however, through a series of “contract swaps” that ultimately deliver Bitcoin to a client’s account.\nDirectly from the NYT’s report:\n“The swap contract is more complicated than an immediate trade of dollars for Bitcoin, even if the end result is still ownership of a certain amount of Bitcoin. But a swap contract allows the trading to come under the regulation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and to operate clearly under existing laws — something today’s Bitcoin exchanges have struggled to do.”\nNYSE’s parent company is endeavoring to introduce a revolutionary element to the cryptocurrency business, not merely planning on just getting involved. It is possible that these swap contracts with have greater appeal with cryptocurrency investors who are looking to eschew the institutional banking’s more entrenched players. Why now? Why?!\nWell, it could be theorized that, after hearing about how Goldman Sachs will be opening up its very own Bitcoin trading operation , the NYSE got a bit antsy — maybe even developed some FOMO. The difference is that the NYSE will be diving in headfirst, instead of merely dipping its toes, like Goldman Sachs has done. Goldman Sachs, however, will be actually be dealing solely with contracts that are linked to rises and falls in the price of bitcoin , and not actually in Bitcoin itself. For Goldman Sachs, the decision to invest in cryptocurrency came as a result of an overwhelming interest on behalf of its clients. Takeaway\nBitcoin has risen to the dizzying height — monetarily speaking — of more than $10,000 a share. And many believe that a regulatory path, paired with major institutional involvement, could really knock the cryptocurrency game up to the next level. Is this the major financial institutional move that cryptocurrency moguls have long been waiting for? Well, first the NYSE’s cryptocurrency market must succeed and thrive before anything can be decided. All this fuss has even raised the question whether the Feds should create a FedCoin!\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/upshot/should-the-fed-create-fedcoin-to-rival-bitcoin-a-former-top-official-says-maybe.html", "http://www.facebook.com/genfkd", "https://www.digitalcitizen.life/what-is-p2p-peer-to-peer"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T22:06:57.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "288ed39205fef5274261a816d7bd1a366806cad2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4nKbDUJCUNHIz.ii7LEBd69Wtf6jADpdiunWMXeZBEuUyRIt1qOzwDkmSgHtIlFbSo69eHWU3cc2dJFzxZwXyGK59sOYCHJo-", "site_full": "www.technobuffalo.com", "site": "technobuffalo.com", "site_section": "https://www.technobuffalo.com", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "TechnoBuffalo", "title": "5 Ways Bitcoin affects the economy", "title_full": "5 Ways Bitcoin affects the economy", "published": "2018-05-28T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 6296, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "288ed39205fef5274261a816d7bd1a366806cad2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4nKbDUJCUNHIz.ii7LEBd69Wtf6jADpdiunWMXeZBEuUyRIt1qOzwDkmSgHtIlFbSo69eHWU3cc2dJFzxZwXyGK59sOYCHJo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kayla Matthews", "published": "2018-05-28T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "5 Ways Bitcoin affects the economy", "text": "5 Ways Bitcoin affects the economy by Kayla Matthews | May 28, 2018 News\nAt one time, very few people thought Bitcoin would ever make a serious impact in the world. Many viewed it as more of an obscure hobby or a pipe dream than a real investment opportunity. Today, the story is quite different.\nNews about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as well as blockchain, is everywhere. Banks, companies, investors and governments have taken a real interest in it.\nWhether they’re looking to get rich or warning of a potential crypto bubble, most people now accept Bitcoin can have a real impact on the economy.\nThe story of cryptocurrencies is just getting started, but it’s already affecting the economy. Here are five ways it’s doing that. 1. Eliminating the need for middlemen in financial transactions\nOne of the primary features of Bitcoin is that it doesn’t require an intermediary like traditional currency does. Rather than a bank or other central institution validating transactions, all users of the currency verify it in a decentralized fashion.\nIt has banks worried, because cryptocurrency eliminates the need for their services. Since they don’t have to pass through multiple hands, transactions take place much more quickly. It also has caused concern because it’s become harder to regulate financial activity, which has especially interesting implications on the international level. 2. Separating transactions from the dollar\nThe U.S. dollar acts as the reserve currency for the global economy , and mainstream financial transactions that take place around the world have their basis in the dollar. That is a primary source of America’s global power and has enabled the U.S., along with other nations, to place economic sanctions on other countries.\nCryptocurrency transactions, on the other hand, don’t need to have any connection to U.S. government-sponsored currency. It provides financial actors another way to participate in the global economy and circumvent U.S. economic policies. Venezuela has introduced a cryptocurrenc y it says is backed by the country’s oil supply as a way to get around sanctions. Other nations have tried similar tactics. Advertisement 3. Removing barriers to entry\nCryptocurrencies have also enabled entrepreneurs to bypass traditional routes of raising capital for crypto- and blockchain-related business ventures. Rather than having to convince venture capitalists and banks to invest in their project, they can bypass the regulation and red tape through an initial coin offering, or ICO.\nAn ICO is similar to an initial public offering, in which a company offers shares in its company for the first time. In an ICO, however, a startup sells a portion of a cryptocurrency to backers to fund the project.\nMany countries have started placing restrictions on ICOs, and the People’s Bank of China has banned them . The Securities Exchange Commission does not regulate ICOs and none have registered with the agency, prompting the SEC to issue a warning about potential risks to investors considering ICOs. The fact that this fundraising approach has gotten so much attention indicates that it’s disruptive. 4. Complicating regulation\nAs we briefly touched on earlier, one potential challenge related to cryptocurrency transactions is that they’re hard to regulate due to their anonymous nature. It’s what facilitated the growth of the Silk Road, the massive anonymous online marketplace where users could buy illegal items without consequence until the FBI shut it down . This anonymity also enabled various scams.\nAnother reason governments are concerned about cryptocurrency is that it makes it easy for people to avoid paying taxes. This fact has caused various countries to consider stricter regulations on crypto and even develop their own government-sponsored cryptocurrencies. 5. Enabling more international transactions\nAround 2 billion people worldwide don’t have a bank account, and in many countries around the world, businesses still cannot accept credit card payments. For people in these typically less developed countries, crypto offers a way to engage with the global Internet economy.\nConnecting to the Internet economy has, in part, enabled many businesses in the United States to thrive even in times of economic slowdown. Bitcoin could have a similar impact for people living in countries around the world with weak economies.\nIt could be especially helpful to migrant workers who send money home to their families while working abroad. Currently, these workers must pay fees that average 9 percent to transfer the money through international financial institutions. If using crypto, they could do it for practically free.\nWhether we focus on the potential harm or the benefits the crypto revolution could have, we can no longer deny Bitcoin and related technologies are impacting the economy in tangible ways.\nThe transformation, however, is just getting started. There are likely many more changes to come.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T16:00:32.030+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2b541f89ed0ace8d39f5538dfb822b17c8aa269f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTCV6nS1w2FZFFIeqCtPlkAF98udxKC3Vx1Q68xoWrxXKSavBmmAgNy0oO6pXOQ.JMuYS04_psi8A7VwV1re1nfP3iBJszddoaGyRnx1l55gw--", "site_full": "ledgergazette.com", "site": "ledgergazette.com", "site_section": "http://ledgergazette.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "The Ledger Gazette", "title": "Bitcoin God (GOD) Hits Market Cap of $0.00", "title_full": "Bitcoin God (GOD) Hits Market Cap of $0.00", "published": "2018-05-28T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/2370.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2b541f89ed0ace8d39f5538dfb822b17c8aa269f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTCV6nS1w2FZFFIeqCtPlkAF98udxKC3Vx1Q68xoWrxXKSavBmmAgNy0oO6pXOQ.JMuYS04_psi8A7VwV1re1nfP3iBJszddoaGyRnx1l55gw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Joyce Ramirez", "published": "2018-05-28T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin God (GOD) Hits Market Cap of $0.00", "text": "Posted by Joyce Ramirez on May 28th, 2018 // No Comments\nBitcoin God (CURRENCY:GOD) traded down 2.8% against the dollar during the one day period ending at 8:00 AM E.T. on May 28th.

Don&s;t put all of your chips on the table at once.\nWhen it comes to Bitcoin, in most cases, you&s;re betting that the cryptocurrency will go up indefinitely. That&s;s the nature of a bubble when speculators dominate.\nBut what if you had a chance to protect yourself on the downside? You can do it with derivatives, contracts that may pay you if the price of something goes down (and up).\nFor example, &l;a href=&q;http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/bitcoin-futures.html&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;the CME Group,&l;/a&g; which runs one of the largest derivatives exchanges offers futures contracts on the reference price of Bitcoin.\n&l;img class=&q;dam-image getty size-large wp-image-865708344&q; src=&q;http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/865708344/960×0.jpg?fit=scale&q; data-height=&q;640&q; data-width=&q;960&q;&g; A visual representation of the digital cryptocurrency Bitcoin. (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)\nA futures contract is an agreement that&s;s linked to a price on a specified date in the future. Let&s;s say you think Bitcoin is going to hit $20,000 by a certain date.\nYou could buy a contract with that &q;strike price.&q; If Bitcoin hits that target, you make money. If not, you lose what you paid for the contract. You could also hedge if the price goes down.\n&q;The new contract will be cash-settled, based on the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR) which serves as a once-a-day reference rate of the U.S. dollar price of bitcoin,&q; the &l;a href=&q;http://www.cmegroup.com/media-room/press-releases/2017/10/31/cme_group_announceslaunchofbitcoinfutures.html&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;CME said in a press release&l;/a&g;. &q;Bitcoin futures will be listed on and subject to the rules of CME.&q;\nNote the CME&s;s mention of&a;nbsp; &q;rules.&q; That means the exchange is careful about tracking what it calls the &q;reference&q; price of Bitcoin and making price disclosure transparent. The exchange is also providing free &l;a href=&q;http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/cf-bitcoin-reference-rate/historical-data.html?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTWpabVptUXlaRGM1WWpZeSIsInQiOiJmTm4yTE9NVlZCalwvanVraEVsb3R4bE54Z3ZkS2w3dlhpRVJLaWJ3MCtKZk1tN282MXIyRlVTcEJ0RWxnMk1YQjdMb3pPWTV3eUZFajNJaWpLcVFUQnNsNGROREs4c21GNkVOd1dyZE56WjFlSTYwNHBYSGpSbnFFSlFtODVWblAifQ%3D%3D&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;historical price data&l;/a&g;, so you can see how volatile the cryptopcurrency has been.\nAlthough the blockchain technology behind Bitcoin isn&s;t exactly transparent — only a few people know exactly how it works or how it originated — getting an exchange to track the price is a positive development. It means an independent body will be watching how the price is set. While this is no substitute for real regulation, it&s;s a good first step.\nThe CME is also monitoring a &q;spot&q; price for Bitcoin, which is what the cryptocurrency is worth at any given moment.\nAlthough nearly any investor can get into trouble with derivatives — they can be caught too long or too short and lose a lot of money — it&s;s essential that you have a way to protect yourself if the market crashes.\nKeep in mind as with any investment, portfolio diversification is a good move. Don&s;t load up on Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. It should comprise no more than 10% of your portfolio.&l;/p&g; This entry was posted in Best Stocks on by admin .

It is expected that bitcoin will be soon offered to their clients and more significant institutionalization is on the way. That can indeed lead to a price increase and overall gain of trust and much-needed transparency. Has the Market Finally Bottomed Out?\nThe leading cryptocurrency, bitcoin, that dominates the market by holding 38 percent of total market capitalization could be finally bottomed out.\nPriced in December 2017 at $19,500 per coin, bitcoin has declined over 50 percent since the start of 2018.\nThat downtrend might be over, as we can see strong support around $7300, preventing bitcoin from falling lower. Bullish signs are being also confirmed positive statements through many bitcoin price speculators as, Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia , Dan Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capital , and Tom Lee , Co-founder of Fundstrat.\nCan the bitcoin fall under the strong support? “Certainly” said Bogart. Nevertheless, it is believed that it will be only a short-term dip, and the coin itself can be seen at higher prices a year from now. Bogart stated that bitcoin should trade at $10,000 and more. If true, that gives an excellent opportunity for investors as the risk to reward ratio is excellent at the moment. Dump the Alts\nNot all cryptocurrencies received the same, favorable opinion. As Bogart stated, they might be overvalued and can receive a significant headwind in the future. While being risky to hold them, they can still bring significant gains.\nBogart said most of the ICOs are over-promising and under-delivering, while only a few of them are excelling in their use cases – bitcoin, being one of them.\nOn the other hand, currencies like EOS, bitcoin cash, ether, and ripple received a neutral opinion, advising the investors to hold them. Investors should also pay most attention to Ethereum, as many of the ICOs have been built on the top of it. If it is more significant projects fail, that would mean bad news for Ethereum.\nIt is worth to mention that statements like that are only pure speculation and every investor is advised to do their research before investing. While the overall bearish trend is still ongoing, a bull run might be just around the corner.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitcoinschannel.com/category/bitcoin/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "spencer bogart date", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spencer bogart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bogart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cardano", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockchain capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc bogart", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T16:26:49.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e70535d4aef051ba0ec2f4687a04b250ba177c54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSstP7shghflF0N6MT.ZvbE2wU6Xb.oJSo3HRBLUhqWiH1YmP7qLxloVjBlyygDA0MxKuZ4hzEnglQfMBcfUl30qyctS2FZPC8-", "site_full": "thenewsunit.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://thenewsunit.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The News UNIT", "title": "BITCOIN BEN is a COMPLETE FRAUD", "title_full": "BITCOIN BEN is a COMPLETE FRAUD", "published": "2018-05-28T15:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e70535d4aef051ba0ec2f4687a04b250ba177c54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSstP7shghflF0N6MT.ZvbE2wU6Xb.oJSo3HRBLUhqWiH1YmP7qLxloVjBlyygDA0MxKuZ4hzEnglQfMBcfUl30qyctS2FZPC8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The News UNIT (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-28T15:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "BITCOIN BEN is a COMPLETE FRAUD", "text": "Bitcoin Ben the BABBLER\nCRYPTOS is the NEW 401K says BITCOIN BEN\nWhat a joke this is!\nThe LIARS and DECEIVERS keep on babbling\nWhat these guys are up to in this TRUTHER & PATRIOT COMMUNITY OF CRYPTO PUMPERS AND DUMPERS is a very complex and rather chaotic consortium of characters in some extended cartel from the gold and silver pump days.\nThese con artists and scammers are still working together to create confusion and more chaos.

Accumulation territories: $6,000. 00, $5,000. 00, $4,000. 00. Bitcoin has been continuously witnessing a downward slide against the US dollar this week. The last time that the pair made a slight high was on May 20. The bears have had a greater advantage on the market over the bulls over the past few weeks. The major critical territory the pair is believed not to easily break remains the immediate accumulation territory of $6,000. 00. The cryptocurrencys price only touched it on February 6. The 13-day SMA has briefly crossed the 50-day SMA. Both moving averages are a bit above the distribution territory of $8,000. 00, whilst price is currently averaging towards the accumulation territory of $7,000. 00. The Stochastic Oscillators have breached past range 20 in the oversold zone suggesting the bearish trend is soon going to end. The market behavior is still expected to see the bears push harder than the bulls. Current possible foundational territories within which strong catalysts can be obtained for a bullish reversal are the accumulation territories of $6,000. 00 and $4,000. 00. Investors can probably lookout for a reversal from the bearish movement to go in, but traders can possibly watch out for a sudden breakout of either the accumulation territory of $7,000. 00 or distribution territory of $8,000. 00 to join in the direction of the breakout trend with the use of fund management rules.

Earlier Bogart predicted that bitcoin's future price could increase to $50,000 in 2018.\nHe also expressed his view saying bitcoin is far from being considered as security and so is highly unlikely to be affected by government crypto crackdowns.\nSpencer Bogart. Source: CNBC\nBogart said that every major bank is trying to do something in the bitcoin space. It is expected that bitcoin will be soon offered to their clients and more significant institutionalization is on the way. That can indeed lead to a price increase and overall gain of trust and much-needed transparency.\nHas the Market Finally Bottomed Out? The leading cryptocurrency, bitcoin, that dominates the market by holding 38 percent of total market capitalization could be finally bottomed out.\nPriced in December 2017 at $19,500 per coin, bitcoin has declined over 50 percent since the start of 2018.\nThat downtrend might be over, as we can see strong support around $7300, preventing bitcoin from falling lower. Bullish signs are being also confirmed positive statements through many bitcoin price speculators as, Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia , Dan Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capital , and Tom Lee , Co-founder of Fundstrat.\nCan the bitcoin fall under the strong support? \"Certainly\" said Bogart. Nevertheless, it is believed that it will be only a short-term dip, and the coin itself can be seen at higher prices a year from now. Bogart stated that bitcoin should trade at $10,000 and more. If true, that gives an excellent opportunity for investors as the risk to reward ratio is excellent at the moment.\nDump the Alts Not all cryptocurrencies received the same, favorable opinion. As Bogart stated, they might be overvalued and can receive a significant headwind in the future. While being risky to hold them, they can still bring significant gains.\nBogart said most of the ICOs are over-promising and under-delivering, while only a few of them are excelling in their use cases – bitcoin, being one of them.\nOn the other hand, currencies like EOS, bitcoin cash, ether, and ripple received a neutral opinion, advising the investors to hold them. Investors should also pay most attention to Ethereum, as many of the ICOs have been built on the top of it. If it is more significant projects fail, that would mean bad news for Ethereum.\nIt is worth to mention that statements like that are only pure speculation and every investor is advised to do their research before investing. While the overall bearish trend is still ongoing, a bull run might be just around the corner.\nThe post \"Buy Bitcoin, Dump Altcoins\": Says Blockchain Venture Capitalist, Spencer Bogart appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T15:39:27.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4be6920a94c7111c36bc8cbd72ec520d94e710ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFhv5aZUTr1YnHdpB05eahuaPScw9ogmtMWpO4eoVwHo0fRVNw2I9TNXVNmRBttBIKkOLWj_5R3gO1WCLRK5Dp96FqqofXCBdnVrw_Jy26_zhiTG4kw4pTTbYJLDykB64UA--", "site_full": "bitcoints.com", "site": "bitcoints.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoints.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoints", "title": "‘Bitcoin Still a Buy regardless of recent losses,’ Say Venture Capitalist Spencer Bogart", "title_full": "‘Bitcoin Still a Buy regardless of recent losses,’ Say Venture Capitalist Spencer Bogart", "published": "2018-05-28T15:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitcoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/8216Bitcoin-Still-a-Buy-regardless-of-recent-losses8217-Say-Venture-Capitalist-Spencer-Bogart.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4be6920a94c7111c36bc8cbd72ec520d94e710ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFhv5aZUTr1YnHdpB05eahuaPScw9ogmtMWpO4eoVwHo0fRVNw2I9TNXVNmRBttBIKkOLWj_5R3gO1WCLRK5Dp96FqqofXCBdnVrw_Jy26_zhiTG4kw4pTTbYJLDykB64UA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-28T15:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "‘Bitcoin Still a Buy regardless of recent losses,’ Say Venture Capitalist Spencer Bogart", "text": " ‘Bitcoin Still a Buy regardless of recent losses,’ Say Venture Capitalist Spencer Bogart\nBogart said that despite the possibility of short-term headwinds in Bitcoin prices, the long-term story is bright as the space is getting largely institutionalized.

On Friday, the Blockchain Capital partner told CNBC’s Fast Money that Bitcoin’s increased number of use cases, coupled with the massive amount of institutional interest, means the market leader is still worth investing in. He explained : Every major bank is trying to do something in the space. Either they’re going to be offering bitcoin to their clients, they’re working on a custody platform or they’re opening up a trading desk. A deeper institutionalization of bitcoin is overall positive. Nevertheless, the dominant cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been hurting this month. After reaching highs of roughly $20,000 late last year, Bitcoin has fallen more than 50 percent in 2018 — and worries remain that the hemorrhaging is far from over. At the time of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $7,220.00, with some analysts fearing prices below $6,000 are likely on their way. Still, Bogart remains bullish on Bitcoin. He told CNBC: But when I look out over the next year, two years, I mean the story is very much materializing. Could bitcoin trade lower? Certainly. But do I think it will be higher a year from now? Absolutely. Altcoins Are ‘Over-Promising and Under-Delivering’ Bogart’s bullish sentiment does not extend to altcoins, however. He told CNBC that the majority of cryptocurrencies available to trade are “over-promising and under-delivering,” adding: Meanwhile, you have a few [cryptocurrencies] that are kind of excelling at their use cases. Bitcoin being one of them. The venture capitalist also told CNBC that he recommends selling fan favorites Cardano (ADA), TRON (TRX), IOTA, (MIOTA), and NEO (NEO). “A lot of those tokens are overvalued,” Bogart explained. “They could be go [sic] up significantly, but they also have significant headwind.” The partner at Blockchain Capital is also cautious in regards to Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and dominant launchpad for initial coin offerings (ICOs). Bogart explained that the sheer amount of ICOs built on top of Ethereum is cause for concern, particularly if those ICOs don’t succeed. On the other hand, Bogart recommends holding the other major players like Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and EOS (EOS) under current market conditions. Do you share Bogart’s belief that Bitcoin is still a strong buy? Do you think investors should be unloading their altcoins, or do you think such a move would be foolish at this point?

Now commuters riding the Prague Metro can purchase digital assets at various locations spread out across the fifth busiest metro system in Europe. Also read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space General Bytes Installs Ten Bitcoin ATMs Across the Prague Metro The Czech Republic-based firm General Bytes has revealed the installation of ten new cryptocurrency ATMs spread out across the Prague Metro. The subway gets more than 1.6 million people in daily foot traffic and is one of the busiest metro systems in Europe. The General Bytes machines are located at Můstek, Nádraží Veleslavín, Dejvická, Florenc, Černý Most, Zličín, Pankrác, Flora, Skalka, and Hlavní Nádraží. Moreover, General Bytes provides a detailed map and description of each location on the website. A map of the ten Prague Metro machines manufactured by General Bytes. The new machines will likely get some use in the region as Prague is considered a booming cryptocurrency hub, as the area is filled with quite a lot of crypto-enthusiasts. For instance, the area is home to the Crypto Anarchy Institute, Paralelní Polis , and a few cryptocurrency businesses including the ATM manufacturer General Bytes. General Bytes Has Manufactured 27% of the World’s Bitcoin ATMs The Czech government is relatively friendly towards cryptocurrencies and politicians haven’t regulated virtual currencies or defined them as a currency or commodity like other nation states. However, the subject is being discussed among tax officials and the Czech National Bank wrote a paper last year called “Don’t be Afraid of Bitcoin.” Last year the well known online retailer, Alza, added cryptocurrency payments and installed two Bitcoin ATMs in the company’s showroom. Just three days ago one of the largest energy suppliers in the Czech Republic, Pražská Plynárenská, announced it was accepting BTC for payments. Czech Republic map of cryptocurrency ATMs. With the ten new machines, the Czech Republic will now have a total of 46 Cryptocurrency ATMs and 27 of those devices are located in Prague. A large majority of the cryptocurrency automated tellers in the region are manufactured by General Bytes. On the General Bytes site where they announce the newly added Prague Metro machines there’s also a video explaining how to use the BATM 2 automated tellers. According to Coinatmradar out of the 3,122 cryptocurrency ATMs, General Bytes now has 858 worldwide.

Such is the case for Bitcoin Cash, a major Cryptocurrency that has taken almost a 10% dip in its value over the past week. This comes as a surprise to many, as Bitcoin Cash got featured on a news segment on CNBC recently, which was expected to improve Bitcoin Cash’s position. Currently, Bitcoin Cash is placed in rank 4, according to coin market cap, with a market cap of $17,850,964,631 USD at the time of writing with a circulating supply of 17143125 BCH tokens. Currently, Bitcoin Cash has declined further with a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.160 (taken from the data feed of Kraken). As of 23/05/2018, Bitcoin Cash is valued at $1.040.10 following two massive dips from a high of $1,301.55 on 21st May to $1,233.70 USD on May 22 nd . As mentioned before, this comes as a surprise to many, as the global cryptocurrency market fared much better comparatively, losing only 5.7% of its value compared to Bitcoin Cash’s 10%. Analysts are still not convinced about the exact factors responsible for this. Bitcoin Cash in the News Last Week Many High profile Crypto-personalities have shown their distrust towards Bitcoin Cash following its erratic behavior. Co-founder and CEO of CryptoCompare, Charles Hayter has called it “all standard noise”, while Jeff Koyen, CEO of 360 Blockchain USA called it one of the most controversial coins in the crypto space, second to Ripple. Marshal Swatt of Swatt Exchange, however, has predicted that the decline of Bitcoin Cash may be attributed to the recent Bitcoin Cash miners meet, where a proposal for rewarding developers have been discussed. Many other market influencers have also been discouraging traders and adding to the negative sentiment around the coin, which caused even further decline. CNBC’s Bitcoin Cash Feature On 22nd May, cryptocurrencies were once again featured on CNBC’s Fast Money, with Bitcoin Cash being the focus this week. Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM LLC was asked to give a detailed analysis of why he has a bullish stance on Bitcoin Cash. Kelly described to his audiences what he called “catalyst factors” which are the main driving force behind a digital asset. Among the factors he mentioned was the aforementioned mining community meet, citing that this latest development would a value booster. In an unexpected turn of events, however, the segment generated a lot of negative sentiment inside the crypto-community, with many accusing CNBC of “shilling” the currency and suspected collaboration. Many analysts think that the negative backlash from this segment further negatively affected Bitcoin Cash’s value over the weekend. Final Thoughts Like with most cryptocurrencies, nothing can be predicted with certainty about future price movements. As Mr. Kelly put it, it all boils down to how the market behaves. Indeed past trends have indicated a similar fate for Bitcoin Cash. Experts noted that the situation is very similar to the incredible highs experienced by most cryptocurrencies in late 2017, followed by a massive price slump at the beginning of the year. In spite of the hurdles faced by Bitcoin Cash at the moment, it is to be noted that Bitcoin Cash has succeeded in the past where many other digital currencies failed. Bitcoin Cash is probably one of the handful of Bitcoin forks that have gained widespread attention and usage. This can be evidenced by Bitcoin Cash’s performance since its launch back in August 2017. According to coin market cap, Bitcoin Cash has held its position in the top ten cryptocurrencies despite price slumps and market movements. Thus, even though situations look bleak presently, the coin is expected to once again rise in value and regain some of its former glory. For the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !

Most will hodl onto their coins for the long-term until Bitcoin reaches an all-time high that would satisfy their goals. Other will sell their Bitcoin when they start to see prices falling below their targeted goal.\nOne thing for sure, is that 2017 has brought us many exciting things for crypto land. Bitcoin and rest of altcoins in existence have risen in value exponentially over the course of the year. Now that 2018 is in its very beginnings, I would like to know what will you do with your Bitcoin (either hodl, buy more, or sell) and will the pioneer cryptocurrency rise further in price?\nWhenever you just hodl your coins over the course of 2018 or sell them, Bitcoin will make many more millionaires. What are your thoughts?\nIn 2018 I will stick to hold Bitcoin until the price is really high then after that I will sell it. I will not sell Bitcoin in the near future let alone the Bitcoin price is still very low. I will try to be more patient waiting for all the beautiful in time.

The goal of the collaboration is to use the research to formulate a better, more cohesive approach to leveraging cryptocurrency for charitable giving. The research will examine the opportunities and challenges of using and converting cryptocurrency within developing economies. BitGive has explored this topic in depth through the 2017 launch of GiveTrack, a blockchain-based donation platform that offers individuals the ability to trace the path of their charitable donations in real time. BitGive unveiled the research collaboration to university researchers and conference attendees at OxChain’s Blockchain and the Global South Conference in London. About the author:\nNews about nonprofit technology includes information and press releases provided by a wide variety of news sources. Connie Gallippi, Founder of BitGive, said: “It’s been incredibly rewarding to see our GiveTrack platform gain unabating momentum since its launch in October 2017. Throughout this process, we’ve discovered numerous opportunities, as well as challenges and barriers, that have helped to shape the development of our platform and helped to define crypto-philanthropy. Using this knowledge, in tandem with the bright minds at the University of Edinburgh, BitGive will be delving into how to overcome the roadblocks to effective crypto-philanthropy and establish how cryptocurrency can best be used to uplift and revolutionise the charitable sector. This research collaboration will help organisations looking to engage in crypto-philanthropy and provide them with the guidelines they need to be successful.”The research collaboration will examine GiveTrack’s past implementations in Indonesia, India, and Kenya to investigate the feasibility, utility, and acceptance of cryptocurrency in these regions. The team will explore how barriers such as regulation, user and merchant adoption, and the influences of local culture and government affect the use of cryptocurrency on the ground.Dr. Claudia Pagliari, Research Partner at the University of Edinburgh, said: “As one of the first organisations to leverage the power of blockchain and cryptocurrency for charitable giving, BitGive is a true pioneer in the crypto-philanthropy sector. Through their experience of planning and delivering projects using the GiveTrack platform, Connie and her team have gained important insights into how cryptocurrency can be effectively used to support humanitarian efforts in developing countries, as well as some of the challenges involved. Through the research collaboration with BitGive, and meeting key stakeholders, we aim to learn as much as we can about the technical and contextual factors that can influence the success of these approaches, so that this knowledge can be used to inform future programmes worldwide.”The GiveTrack platform leverages blockchain technology to provide an unprecedented level of clarity in the donation to deployment phases of allocated funds. Individuals are able to trace the path of their charitable donations on a public platform in real time, letting them see exactly how funds are spent and when they reach their final destination. Charity project results are also shared with the donor to create direct engagement.In a related announcement, GiveTrack will also be supporting several new pilot projects, including one with education-focused nonprofit Open Mind Africa, which is now available on the platform.For more information on GiveTrack, visit https://www.givetrack.org/ .

That’s what the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) is currently looking into as part of a new criminal probe into crypto crimes.\nThe investigation comes on the heels of complaints by crypto critics that crypto markets are being scammed by savvy traders who know how to “spoof” the trading platforms and flood them with fake buy and sell orders.

We turned on the Roku-looking machine in our San Francisco offices and allowed it to do its job. A small fortune was soon amassed, now worth around $100,000. Then, we lost the money. Forever.Here's what happened to WIRED's 13 Bitcoins—and to the millions of others that have faced the same fate. Stefan - Antonowicz - WIRED - Then-head - Engineering Stefan Antonowicz, WIRED's then-head of engineering, set up the miner. Robert McMillan, a former senior writer for WIRED (who now works at The Wall Street Journal), then wrote about it. \"When we received that Butterfly miner, we had a new ethical question: What do you do with the proceeds of a review device that essentially prints money?\" says McMillan.First, it's probably worth explaining how WIRED accrued its six-figure Bitcoin fortune. While fiat currencies, like the dollar, rely on banks and government regulators, Bitcoin runs on a peer-to-peer network monitored by an army of volunteer miners that run specialized software. Every 10 minutes, all the miners in the network race to solve a series of complex cryptographic math problems. The computers that win are awarded a slice of 12.5 new bitcoins. (That number halves every four years; it was 25 when we got our miner.) Usually, the fastest computers in the network solve the problems first. WIRED - Miner - Bitcoin - Math - Lottery WIRED's miner essentially won the Bitcoin math lottery a couple of times, allowing it to generate a little over 13 coins into the network. Then, the staff had to figure out what to do with them. \"We had a very long conversation, over several weeks, about what to do with the money,\" says Michael Calore, a senior editor at WIRED who has been at the magazine since 2006.

Long timeframes here, looking into June for rough timing of this to play out at a best guess. I think we are gonna go to $5500-5700 next, I can't see $7000 holding.

I doubt we’ll see that this time around,” he continued, comparing historical price patterns. “I think we’ll see this center section cut out. Next up cycle will take less time. Q3/Q4 2018 (in my opinion).”\nBitcoin, meanwhile, continues to improve on its status as a “currency,” commentators noting that fees this week are at their lowest in seven years, even beating rival altcoin Bitcoin Cash, which developers tout as a “lower-fee alternative” to Bitcoin. What if I told you that median Bitcoin transaction fees – expressed in Satoshis – have never been lower since around March 2011?

Seems like I’ve been in this damned chair all weekend. (I really have been…)\nFirst remark has to do with Bitcoin – which is down to $7,225.\nWhen you compare the “classic bubble of 1929” with the shape of the Bitcoin blow-off, it’s not very encouraging for the coiners:\nLooking at this in our odd view of things, what we see is a downward trend channel that has been broken to the upside. So we see five complete waves down and the True Believers among the coiners will doubtless point to this as a sure sign the bottom is in.\nWe suspected as much when the break above trend happened, but Bitcoin is FAR from out of the woods. For one, it could be ready to put in a new low – and from there, it would be disaster.\nNot right away, of course. There should be one more rally up to give a C wave, and then back down we can go – again .\nOR, the upward march may resume.\nEven so, if you are a long-term investor, you have to look at the point where Bitcoin gets seriously real . That’s when we move up to a level higher than the all-time high. That would turn the longest-term view into a massive Wave 1 up, this would be the Massive 2 down, and then Wave 3 would fulfill some of the coiner’s wet dreams.\nBUT, if we get one more run up and it fails, then the bearish case builds and any new lows after that and you can get the butter and jam out: Bitcoin will be toast. World Markets?\nThey are (as one would expect) mixed with the U.S. down for the holiday. With the U.S. Navy playing footsie with the large Chinese naval force in the South China Sea, we’re only perhaps days from what could be an international incident of the Archduke Ferdinand-scale….so we keep a nervous eye West.\nAnd, gas prices might be nearing their summer highs: Oil sinks further as OPEC and Russia look to raise output .\nExcept for China (up a bit we expect on muscle-flexing) the rest of the world is essentially asleep. Gold was down $3.70 earlier, but it’s still hanging in the $1,280-$1,320 range. We will try to arrange a wake-up call for you if anything moves.

We're utilizing powerful Ethereum blockchain expertise, our personal Destiny Channels and Enjoyable tokens to make it happen. A great number of begin-ups have efficiently used ICOs to raise funds for his or her tasks. By launching a tokenized platform for energy, Energi Mine plans to decentralize the worldwide energy markets. If you treasured this article so you would like to get more info with regards to echat for mobile mining kindly visit the internet site. Bitcoins and different cryptocurrencies have been legally accepted as cash in Japan since 2014, owing to a authorities decision that acknowledged that there are not any existing laws that can unconditionally ban individuals or firms from receiving cryptocurrencies as fee.Although the first ICO, by MasterCoin (now Omni), was in 2013, this investment automobile has seen an uptick this 12 months. For any crowdsale or an ICO be successful, the promoters of the project must work hard and even spend a small fortune on marketing and promotional campaigns, so that they will construct trust among the group members, who will, in turn, contribute towards the project. Any fluctuation within the prices of tokens and cryptocurrencies will certainly have an impact on the performance of an ICO. KICKICO is a web based blockchain know-how-based platform for reward-primarily based and donation-primarily based crowdfunding, which offers an entry mobile mining to online fundraising tools carried out with the assistance of blockchain expertise and sensible contracts. While chatting with NewsBTC, Engelbrecht expressed serious concern concerning the assault and the damage it might probably trigger not just to Zabercoin but in addition different tasks which could change into his next targets. In change for renting out their gigabytes, users receive Gladius tokens to sell on an open market. To construct a profitable IPO (Initial Public Providing) and ICO (Initial Coin Providing) companies must differentiate their product out there. The report by Atomico, one in every of Europe‘s leading enterprise capital corporations, found European-based entities have raised $1.76 billion through so-known as preliminary coin choices, or ICOs, since 2014, representing forty six% of funds raised globally. Throughout the ICO marketing campaign, each the supporters of the initiative and the enthusiasts will purchase among the out there digital cash with virtual or fiat forex. However ICOs could be for any form of startup - they do not necessarily must be for cryptocurrency corporations. ICOs have opened to most people investments in blockchain ventures. The distinctive function of our mobile mining Seratio Token is the power to capture the financial belongings, microshares and provenance of transactions involving individuals, products, processes, projects and organisations. Hereafter, David Siegel gave the principles for those launching an ICO: set bold objectives (at the least $10 m as the results of the crowdsale); do not scale back token prices; fastidiously behave to traders; attempt to establish a group. A complete useful resource for analysts, journalists, investors and entrepreneurs, our latest analysis database is designed that will help you track and analyze the blockchain token sale and preliminary coin providing motion as it grows and expands. Under you may find the mobile mining newest information on this planet of Preliminary Coin Choices (ICOs). In a nutshell, whereas ICOs have some degree of danger connected to them, that has not prevented the successful ones from having a constructive impression on each the company and the investors. But it surely's a unique story now with ICOs, IPO-like token sales that fund blockchain-primarily based startups and have raised greater than $three billion this year. The demand for BItcoin grew as the South Korean buyers rushed to the token after observing its development potential. In mobile mining most cases, crowdfunding is strictly executed as making donations to a venture whereas ICO supporters derive their motivation from the potential of the project to become successful in the future and thus reap a excessive return on their funding. BEIJING (Reuters) echat for mobile mining - China is poised to additional tighten rules on virtual currencies after regulators on Monday banned mobile mining virtual coin fundraising schemes, Chinese language monetary information outlet Yicai reported citing sources. A function, or perhaps limitation, of the ICO market is that almost all require investment to be paid for in current cryptocurrencies. The larger ICOs in latest historical past have taken full advantage of the platform to launch their thriving firms. The hunt for investments in bitcoin reminds me of the nineteenth century gold rush,\" he added. ICOs have proved to be useful fundraising instruments for buyers since the idea was brought to limelight in 2013. Cryptocurrencies might be designed to be broadly used, as with bitcoin, or to operate inside a web based network just like the Ethereum network that uses ethers to make funds. In July 2017, the company raised some $185 million through its ICO.

A mystery surrounding the creator of the cryptocurrency, who has never been convincingly identified, has burnished its allure, and innovators and speculators now circle the globe attending high-priced industry conferences, many hoping to make their fortune.\nBut bitcoin didn’t just materialize from thin air. The encryption technology that makes it possible—known as blockchain—was developed almost three decades ago, by scientists whose role in the story has not received much attention. Their aim was more idealistic than revolutionizing the world of money: They wanted to find a way to secure the past and safeguard our knowledge of it.\nIn 1990, the physicist Scott Stornetta had a eureka moment while getting ice cream with his family at a Friendly’s restaurant in Morristown, N.J. He and his cryptographer colleague, Stuart Haber, had been thinking about the proliferation of digital files that accompanied the rise of personal computing and the ease with which files could be altered. They wondered how we might know for certain what was true about the past. What would prevent tampering with the historical record—and would it be possible to protect such information for future generations?\nThe sticking point was the need to trust a central authority. But at Friendly’s, an answer came to Dr. Stornetta: He realized that instead of a central record-keeper, the system could have many dispersed but interconnected copies of a shared ledger. The truth could never be typed over if there were too many linked ledgers to alter.\n‘Their ledger, the first of its kind, is now the oldest blockchain in the world.’\nDrs. Haber and Stornetta were working at the time at Bellcore, a research center descended from the legendary Bell Labs. The pair set out to build a cryptographically secure archive—a way to verify records without revealing their contents.\nIn 1991 they explained their find in a paper titled “How to Time-Stamp a Digital Document” in the Journal of Cryptography. The technology is called a blockchain because the distributed electronic ledger stores items of data in time-stamped digital groups called blocks. Each block includes an alphanumeric code called a “hash” summing up its data. The hash of each completed block also appears in the next one in the chain, which means that to alter one block you would have to alter all the ones connected to it. These cryptographic dominos function together to protect against tampering or fraud.\nDrs. Stornetta and Haber went on to publish more papers on the subject and were eventually named as co-inventors on Bellcore’s patent for the new technology. In 1994, they spun off a separate company called Surety, which offered to time-stamp any piece of information—a chemistry lab result, a contract—into a block of transactions. As an additional security measure, Surety started publishing an alphanumeric code summarizing weekly blockchain additions in analog form in the classified section of the Sunday New York Times, under “Notices and Lost & Found.” Their ledger, the first of its kind, is now the oldest blockchain in the world.\n‘Dr. Stornetta calls the connection to bitcoin “pretty cool.”’\nDr. Stornetta stayed on at Surety for three years before moving on to teach high school math and to consult; Dr. Haber stayed for five years before he, too, moved on to other projects. Surety continues to represent clients, which have included pharmaceutical companies and intellectual property organizations. Privately held, the company quietly continues to publish the weekly hash.\nThe patent lapsed for non-payment of maintenance fees in 2004, four years before bitcoin emerged. Drs. Haber and Stornetta, who retained only small stakes in Surety, are philosophical about missing out on the potential financial windfall. As Dr. Haber says of their discovery, “It was an interesting little paper that turned into a company—which I didn’t expect—and then I went back to being a research scientist.” Dr. Stornetta calls the connection to bitcoin “pretty cool” and says that he would have contributed any royalties to nonprofit blockchain development.\nBut there is no mistaking their crucial contribution. When the founding document of bitcoin was published in 2008 under the name “Satoshi Nakamoto”—a pseudonym for one or more scientists—it had just eight citations of previous works. Three of them were papers co-authored by Drs. Haber and Stornetta.\nMore essays\nMy colleague David Yermack of NYU’s Stern School of Business has recently drawn attention to the pivotal role played by the unassuming pair. Preparing to teach his own class on blockchain last spring, Dr. Yermack noticed Bellcore’s Morristown address in the seminal 1991 paper. Dr. Yermack happened to live in Morristown, so he reached out to Dr. Stornetta and met him at what Dr. Stornetta still calls the “Blockchain Friendly’s.” The physicist is now a regular speaker on the subject at NYU.\nThe Nakamoto paper revolutionized the foundational work of Drs. Stornetta and Haber by adding the concept of “mining” cryptocurrencies. It created financial incentives for participation in retaining and verifying parts of the blockchain ledger. But it’s worth recalling that what may become the currency of the future owes its origin to an effort to protect what we know of the past.\n—Ms. Whitaker is an assistant professor at NYU’s Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development and the author of “Art Thinking.”\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/the-eureka-moment-that-made-bitcoin-possible-1527268025\nbe not idiot", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/the-eureka-moment-that-made-bitcoin-possible-1527268025"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T10:50:00.039+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d21626868733a7d3e15c68829061359f10800cef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRtjzeQiF19wksGvH04Lxh4-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why Goverment is not recommending to use digital currency such a bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why Goverment is not recommending to use digital currency such a bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-28T14:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.028, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d21626868733a7d3e15c68829061359f10800cef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRtjzeQiF19wksGvH04Lxh4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jpaul", "published": "2018-05-28T14:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Goverment is not recommending to use digital currency such a bitcoin?", "text": "Most governments have lots of suspicions concerning Bitcoins, they are mainly uneasy with the freedom Bitcoin offers its users and the unknonimity Bitcoin offers its users.

Vertex To Launch Its Meetup Competition Sponsoring 25 Bitcoin Meetups Around The World! #bitcoin # invest #money\nBitcoin meetups are probably the most iconic social activity that cryptocurrency enthusiasts engage in – apart from epic Twitter and Reddit battles. These gatherings of like-minded enthusiasts bring thousands of people together around the world. Their power to attract people transcends borders so much that enthusiasts actually look for these meetups when they fly abroad. Bitcoin and cryptocurrency fans in many cases would rather check the local crypto scene out than go into a museum or go on a guided tour of the city they are travelling to. Vertex knows this, and as a project that is deeply rooted in this sense of camaraderie and community that transcends borders, it decided to launch it very own Bitcoin meetup competition: the Battle of the Meetups! Battle of the Meetups Sponsored by Vertex\nThe Battle of the Meetups is simple. Vertex will go through all the Bitcoin meetups registered on meetup.com and will proceed to do the following: Select 25 meetups to sponsor. Sponsor those meetups throughout a period of 5 months. Give the selected meetups a list of criteria that Vertex will use to select the top 2 meetups over this period. Proceed to give the two winners an amazing prize.\nCriteria to Participate in the Battle of the Meetups\nThe criteria that Vertex established to determine the winner in this Battle of the Meetups is also quite simple. There are 4 vectors along which meetups can score points every time they meet. At the end, a final tally will determine the 2 winners. The following is the point system: The meetup that accumulates the most Facebook likes since the start of the Battle of the Meetups until the end, will be awarded 3 points. The meetup with the second most likes will get 2 points and the meetup that comes in third will accumulate 1 point. Vertex retweets after every meetup will yield 3 points for the meetup that retweets the most, 2 points for the runner up and 1 point for third place. The meetup that brings Vertex the most Telegram introductions will get 3 points, with the second place getting 2 points and the third place getting 1 point. Attendance will allow meetups to compete on how many people they attract each time. Meetups that attract 600 participants or more, will get 3 points each time. Those that gather 400 participants at least will be rewarded with 2 points and those that bring more than 200 participants will gather 1 point.\nThe Prize!\nAfter accumulating all these points over a period of 5 months, the Meetup organizers who win will be able to join Vertex at the Vegas Blockchain Conference in October. The winners will be announced at the Berlin Blockshow. The competition starts on June 11th and it will come to a close by the end of October 2018. Can my Meetup Participate in the Battle of the Meetups?\nTo see if your meetup qualifies for the Battle of the Meetups, just make sure it complies with the following: It has 500 members. At least 30 members attended the last meetup. There is at least one meetup every 2 months.\nTo register, just send an email to Let the Battle of the Meetups begin!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T14:54:30.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3fc69de5259301f037669a32dfe6efa6ad058ec2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR2fv7ieUZS8T.B6DAeO8muYp9xAzK2oy8qAvUlXBTLsTdPmtnPcRg1SPfj3y5SMH91N3MFrRzVjE8kjH9cf.TdoY8rSs9tjmrkxm3VuMB9i57QSVafPbBi", "site_full": "bitcoinkeep.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinkeep.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Moving On - Bitcoin.Cryptocurrency.Drones.Will Revolutionize Finance & Industry ?", "title": "Moving On - Bitcoin.Cryptocurrency.Drones.Will Revolutionize Finance & Industry ? : A Free Treat - Pokemon Go Cheatsheet.", "title_full": "Moving On - Bitcoin.Cryptocurrency.Drones.Will Revolutionize Finance & Industry ? : A Free Treat - Pokemon Go Cheatsheet.", "published": "2018-05-28T14:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3fc69de5259301f037669a32dfe6efa6ad058ec2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR2fv7ieUZS8T.B6DAeO8muYp9xAzK2oy8qAvUlXBTLsTdPmtnPcRg1SPfj3y5SMH91N3MFrRzVjE8kjH9cf.TdoY8rSs9tjmrkxm3VuMB9i57QSVafPbBi", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ivor Vale (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-28T14:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Moving On - Bitcoin.Cryptocurrency.Drones.Will Revolutionize Finance & Industry ? : A Free Treat - Pokemon Go Cheatsheet.", "text": "Moving On - Bitcoin.Cryptocurrency.Drones.Will Revolutionize Finance & Industry ? : A Free Treat - Pokemon Go Cheatsheet. : Because I've been neglecting you for Steemit.

And the capital you spend will return even back many times.\nThe best time to purchase the Bitcoin is to buy this coin in a low market so that the quantity will be more and the savings will be more.

You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The value of currencies may fluctuate and investors may lose all or more than their original investments. Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The leveraged nature of FX trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds and such may work against you as well as for you.

that show the increased focus regulators have placed on companies operating in the cryptocurrency scene and how it can adversely affect clients. FCA revels it is investigating dozens of ventures, and Poloniex tries to reassure legacy clients that their frozen funds are safe.\nAlso Read: Niall Ferguson Tells Bank of England Bitcoin Is Financial System of the Future\nPoloniex Responds to Complaints Poloniex, the cryptocurrency trading platform which was taken over by Circle earlier this year, has finally responded to complaints by its clients about frozen accounts . Stories of legacy accounts getting locked have flooded social media and cryptocurrency forums over the last week. The company now tries to reassure these clients their funds are safe and explain the matter is required by law.\n\"As soon as you submit this information, we will take steps to verify it and re-enable trading and transactions for your account. Please rest assured that your funds remain safe and accounted for while you complete this process – you can verify your holdings on the Balances page of your account throughout. Like all registered money services businesses, Poloniex is committed to compliance with all applicable law requiring identification and verification of its customers.\"\nThe company also claims to have taken steps to increase the speed of the process. \"We are happy to report that in the past 3 months we've seen a 33% increase in customers who are instantly verified, a 77% increase in customers who successfully pass our verification process, and an 85% decrease in customer waiting time for verification.\"\n24 Crypto Ventures Under FCA Investigation Traders that are used to how things were before regulators started focusing on crypto platforms are understandably angry about the new hoops they have to jump to, but there is no doubt that the companies are under scrutiny and pressure to do so from regulators.\nThe UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has revealed it is currently investigating two dozen unauthorized cryptocurrency-related ventures and has also opened seven whistle-blower reports in 2018 alone related to companies operating in this field, according to FT . Responding to a freedom of information request from accountancy and consulting firm Moore Stephens, the FCA said on Friday that the purpose of the investigation is to determine whether these crypto companies might \"be carrying on regulated activities that require FCA authorization\".\nICO Marketing Tragedy Ask.fm, an Irish company with its base of operations in Latvia and Ukraine, has sponsored four cryptocurrency enthusiasts to climb Mount Everest and place a wallet at the summit as part of its ICO marketing campaign. Lama Babu Sherpa, one of the Nepalese natives who helped the climbers, has reportedly been missing since May 14 th and is now presumed dead, according to AFP .\nThe team responded on Saturday: \"We are now aware that one of the Sherpas who assisted our group amongst others, went missing during the descent. We wish to clarify conflicting media reports by stating that at the time of this statement being made we have not had any response from the relevant officials confirming the status of the missing Sherpa, and we are not therefore in a position to confirm if he is safe or otherwise. It would be insensitive to make such assumptions and we await, and urge the media to await, confirmation from the relevant authorities. There is no doubt that climbing Everest is challenging and dangerous…The last official update we received was that the condition and location of the missing Sherpa was unknown and it was not our place to make public statements which could have resulted in false information being circulated.\"\nCrypto Champion And lastly, some happy news. Rory MacDonald, the current Bellator MMA Welterweight World Champion, has shared a clip of himself training in a BCH shirt showing support for bitcoin cash to his hundreds of thousands of followers on social media.\nand another one @Everlast_ #RK #BCH #BitcoinCash pic.twitter.com/duuK4RyghF\n— Rory MacDonald (@rory_macdonald) May 27, 2018\nWhat do you think about today's news updates?
