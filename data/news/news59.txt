According to the article he was Cai Wensheng the founder of a selfie-app called Meitu which is very popular in China. This man is a good sign that bitcoin really is becoming more attractive to big enterpreneurs across the globe.\nTo be honest, with the publication of this news I feel worried about getting heard by the Chinese government which has the potential to drop the bitcoin the umpteenth time. If it's like this, maybe someday bitcoin will fall back, because the Chinese government will intimidate Mr. Cai Wensheng to sell its bitcoin for the reason that BLA BLA BLA (Reasons that aren't rational).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ccn.com/chinese-angel-investor-gathers-10000-bitcoins-during-bear-q1-2018/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T12:38:07.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b0593c2baeb396225f68604a21afeccb4f3caff2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS.rFWx7J3.9hTxIS100htooA2WsmZHVAHUhtdK0tWxN9tZHpVc1qPafM2Z_su0Te.07gLR2H8Ltjsu3Uszu_dRpD6A7pcid55YwElibD4S4M-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Coinbase", "title": "I use coinbase to transfer bitcoin to my trading account : CoinBase", "title_full": "I use coinbase to transfer bitcoin to my trading account : CoinBase", "published": "2018-06-03T04:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "https://www.redditstatic.com/icon.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b0593c2baeb396225f68604a21afeccb4f3caff2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapS.rFWx7J3.9hTxIS100htooA2WsmZHVAHUhtdK0tWxN9tZHpVc1qPafM2Z_su0Te.07gLR2H8Ltjsu3Uszu_dRpD6A7pcid55YwElibD4S4M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "roguefreezemission", "published": "2018-06-03T04:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "I use coinbase to transfer bitcoin to my trading account : CoinBase", "text": "what kind of nonsense am i going to encounter when transferring it back into coinbase, selling it and getting it into my bank account...I just have a feeling something isn't going to work or a pain in the ass...can anyone shed any light on this...the only thing i've ever done on CB is adding funds and transferring them to my trading broker", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T03:22:13.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e3086ac6ebecff227203fac5426a24298596b202", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY.xq.QO_VjS8zcVyBBWVBrh1sOzUZsgI6EPho2B7pytC1zJe7nOo7cRCWkXHi0vzSA--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Cryptocurrency Investors Say Bitcoin Screaming a Buy from Technical Charts", "title_full": "Cryptocurrency Investors Say Bitcoin Screaming a Buy from Technical Charts", "published": "2018-06-03T04:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e3086ac6ebecff227203fac5426a24298596b202", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY.xq.QO_VjS8zcVyBBWVBrh1sOzUZsgI6EPho2B7pytC1zJe7nOo7cRCWkXHi0vzSA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-03T04:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cryptocurrency Investors Say Bitcoin Screaming a Buy from Technical Charts", "text": "Despite the ever-plunging prices of cryptocurrencies since their mammoth rise in December 2017, Pantera Capital's Dan Morehead maintains a favorable view, and believes that bitcoin should be bought \"while still cheap.\"\nActual Belief or Selfish Benefits? While the San Francisco-based investment firm deals only in cryptocurrencies , Morehead lent insight into his long-term price targets of bitcoin on CNBC :\n\"All cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now, it's much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally as it goes.\"\nThe pioneer cryptocurrency traded at $19,000 in December 2017 and then declined to a low of $5,900 in March 2018, registering a 68 percent decline over three months. Bitcoin trades at $7,500 at the time of writing. However, the cryptocurrency investor believes that the volatile digital asset may have reached its bottom and prices can only go up from here.\nWithout a doubt, some of the most telling features of cryptocurrencies remain their volatility and the largely unregulated nature of the digital asset sector. But, Morehead thinks that this aspect can help early-adopters and investors, by effectively giving them a head start.\nThe investor added that institutional investors and quality-regulated custodians are already taking positions in cryptocurrencies, while \"buying the rumor\" of crypto-friendly SEC regulations and \"selling the fact.\"\nDespite his rather obvious statements, Morehead gave a single technical tip to investors: purchase a digital asset when its 230-day moving average is breached, sell after a year, make an average of 239 percent profit. While the claim remains untested, Morehead referred to the blue line as shown in the chart below:\n( Source : TradingView )\nWhile Morehead did not include a timestamp for the chart, BTCManager used a daily candlestick pattern to test his strategy. As it stands, if one were to purchase a single bitcoin on January 1, 2017, at $984, and sell on January 1, 2018, at $13, 718, the total percentage gain would be 1,294 percent, a figure much above Morehead's average. He added:\n\"That's the essence of this trade: It rarely ever gets cheap to its long-term average. So today is a good day to be buying.\"\nInstitutional Trader Echoes Morehead's Thoughts While the Pantera Capital founder has vested interests in the price of bitcoin, Robert Sluymer of Fundstrat Global is neutral in that sense as Sluymer's company is a traditional finance investor house. However, the Fundstart executive agreed with Morehead's bitcoin prediction of having reached the bottom. Sluymer, the head of technical strategy at Fundstrat, said :\n\"We think Bitcoin is starting to bottom off some very key support around $7,000 and we think it's going to start a recovery process here.\"\nIncidentally, bitcoin danced around the $7,000 level in the last week of May 2018, before recovering to its current price of $7,500 at writing.\nUnlike Morehead, Sluymer referred to the relative strength index ( RSI ) on a bitcoin chart, which showed an \"oversold level\" on May 28, 2018, indicating a \"bottoming phase taking hold.\"\n( Source : TradingView )\nThe RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and rate of change of an asset's price movements, typically over a 14-day market cycle. Sluymer concluded:\n\"We think the setup is very attractive here. If you're short we think you should be very careful and reducing your short exposure. I think if you're looking to be long this is where you start adding here to your long exposure.\"\nThe post Cryptocurrency Investors Say Bitcoin Screaming a Buy from Technical Charts appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "morehead", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan morehead", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "morehead", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T04:35:41.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bf847db19cda9054be36872a3dbbd2082fd659a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg91AAFr2hsw6Xdb9mCvH4a7X04CH9a3hJLqPaIuVmWN04J91tksxfylzlG.lDRai21qrVAqlBPEEpInuRSih_9.RJdIwt7I2p9QkRtTzX1x0f.uzaX6PiMa1s0bpo7IsJ3d97KMZCN4IlXPymk7F05VW2vP8ov6zIplk5PQtQwCDw--", "site_full": "www.digitaljournal.com", "site": "digitaljournal.com", "site_section": "http://www.digitaljournal.com/rss/?feed=top_news", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "RSS Feed - Top Digital Journal News", "title": "Bitcoin climbing through mid-range between $7,000 and $8,000", "title_full": "Bitcoin climbing through mid-range between $7,000 and $8,000", "published": "2018-06-03T04:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.digitaljournal.com/img/1/0/4/8/0/9/3/i/3/8/1/p-large/4003e5fa92f3268d687cc27dbae935105f840d95_1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 25058, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bf847db19cda9054be36872a3dbbd2082fd659a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg91AAFr2hsw6Xdb9mCvH4a7X04CH9a3hJLqPaIuVmWN04J91tksxfylzlG.lDRai21qrVAqlBPEEpInuRSih_9.RJdIwt7I2p9QkRtTzX1x0f.uzaX6PiMa1s0bpo7IsJ3d97KMZCN4IlXPymk7F05VW2vP8ov6zIplk5PQtQwCDw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-03T04:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin climbing through mid-range between $7,000 and $8,000", "text": "By Ken Hanly yesterday in Technology May was not a good month for bitcoin's price but today it is recovering from recent lows and has risen above the $7,500 levels. However, the monthly chart is bearish according to a recent CoinDesk analysis. The gloomy month of May for bitcoin An analysis by CoinDesk yesterday shows that the 5-month moving average (MA) has been pushed below the 10-month moving average for the first time since way back in June of 2014. This bearish indicator confirms the view that the long-term bull market has ended and bitcoin could be in for further losses. In May, the price of bitcoin dropped by 19 percent despite a rally at the end of the month. There are other bearish indications as well. Going by the monthly chart only the BTC price could drop down as far as the support of $6,000, the February low. The decline could go even further towards $4,384 the Fibonacci retracement. The Fibonacci retracement is explained here and on the You Tube video below. However the short term duration chart shows there could be a rally up to $7,800 in the short term before the long term bearish signs come to pass. The 4-hour chart shows another higher low when the price recovered from the $7,414 low yesterday. The 50 candle MA has now shed its bearish bias and the relative strength index (RSI) is also above 50 a bullish sign. Bitcoin created another higher low (bullish pattern) as it recovered from the low of $7,414 yesterday. The 50-candle MA has now shed bearish bias and the RSI is above 50.00 (bullish territory) and rising. There is scope for a rally as high as $7,818. The CoinDesk outlook The CoinDesk analysis concludes: \"The 5-month and 10-month MA bearish crossover has boosted the odds of a drop below the February low of $6,000. In the short-term, bitcoin could rise to $7,818, while a high-volume break above the falling trendline hurdle would open the doors to $8,310 (5-month MA). However, only a convincing move above $9,990 (recent high) would revive the long-term bullish outlook. Bearish scenario: Bitcoin could drop below $7,000 over the weekend if the cryptocurrency closes (as per UTC) below the descending (bearish) 10-day MA, currently located at $7,419.\" Present situation On June 2, Saturday the BTC price opened at $7,518.24. The high was $7,6683.20 and the low $7,463.13. At the close it was $7,636,19. It is now June 3 in UTC 01:09 and the price of BTC is at about the high for the day so far at $7,652. The present price can be found here. So far there is no bearish trend and the price is still not up to the $7,818 level. It remains to be seen if there will be a downward trend later in the day which the technical analysis indicates as probable.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fibonacciretracement.asp", "http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "https://www.coindesk.com/price/http://", "https://www.nvestopedia.com/terms/f/fibonacciretracement.asp", "https://www.coindesk.com/this-long-term-indicator-could-complicate-bitcoins-price-recovery/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ken hanly", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "coindesk", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T05:16:26.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d7887489582e6ec5c84abf323b484c5174ef6c5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfVtyYPOfbQjRAh7yOdc5bU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why people are still buying Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why people are still buying Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-06-03T04:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d7887489582e6ec5c84abf323b484c5174ef6c5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfVtyYPOfbQjRAh7yOdc5bU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "emrah0406", "published": "2018-06-03T04:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why people are still buying Bitcoin?", "text": "They are think bitcoin did not to reach real value and everybody hope to rich in future thats a train nobody catch to it .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T02:46:00.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9eaba765ab83bac31456245a3cbe81a24ab98daf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.sjPEi3chFlKjoBniUN7vcBsv0IFegLbQz4bRCC2XLQ_PfiTliKDGjkhI_D8Q6KhCkA--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Fundstrat Strategist Believes Bitcoin Could Be Bottoming (aka -

One is constructed from the blockchain itself, by reading the blocks on disk and updating with any new blocks that are broadcasted. This set is saved to disk, and can be reconstructed from the blockchain data if erased.\nAnother UTXO set is the mempool itself. Each output in the mempool is considered a valid UTXO, unless it is already spent by another mempool tx. Moreover, any outputs consumed by mempool transactions from confirmed transactions are considered spent in the other UTXO set. This mempool UTXO set is not saved to disk, and only exists when there are transactions in the mempool, while the node is running.\nYou can see existing CPFP transactions by calling getrawmempool with the verbose option .

It is necessary to understand that free bitcoins and other virtual currencies do not happen, so that they need to spend certain resources. This does not mean that you will have to use personal funds to get bitcoins. Typically, such resources are the user's personal time spent on various tasks, for example, e-mailing, advertisements, and others. If such an introduction to the article did not undermine your interest in the question \"how to get bitcoin for free?\", Let's consider the main current ways of earning Crypto-currency without investments.\nMicro earnings of bitcoins\n In this niche is the easiest to get, but earnings here is one of the most time-consuming occupations. Users have to perform various tasks that require a lot of free time and effort. As for payment, it is often insignificant. In addition, on most sites that provide the possibility of such earnings, there are viruses and malicious applications, so you should use caution to click on links.\nPTC (Paid-to-Click) - online services that pay money for clicks\n On such sites, you can earn a bit of bitcoins for viewing advertisements and transitions to other sites (up to $ 0.40 per hour). One of the best such services is ads4BTC. Here, users are given the choice between ads that need to be viewed for 5, 10 or 20 seconds. If you view 20-second ads for 24 hours, it was possible to do in 0.0216BTs, at the moment I do not know what should be sampled\nBitcoin taps (approximately $ 0.05-0.08 per hour)\n Despite the fact that the use of cranes can be quite a profitable occupation, this type of earnings is not too common. Bitcoin cranes are online services that pay out a small amount of virtual currency at regular intervals. In fact, these are services where you can get free bitcoin. For example, on the Bonus Bitcoin website, up to 5000 Satoshi (0.00005 bitcoins) are issued every 15 minutes. But if you calculate, in 24 hours you can earn no more than 0.00288 bitcoins. And many other resources pay even less.\nRotator bitcoin of cranes\n This method appeared relatively recently and greatly simplifies the receipt of funds from numerous bitcoins-cranes, which are literally full of Internet. It involves the use of a personal site with a fairly simple interface that allows you to quickly switch between bitcoins, without opening a new tab each time in the browser.\n Rotators significantly increase profits, but have several drawbacks:\n  For the use of the script, developers take away part of the user's profit in the form of interest;\n  Many free bitcoin cranes are fighting against the use of rotators, so the latter need constant updating.\n To start earning you must have your own website. It can be created for free with the help of online constructors or available CMS and write to free hosting. Then add the rotator script and start making a profit. Users of the rotator are given the opportunity to edit the list of bitcoin-cranes. It is recommended to use those services that distribute free bitcoins on the machine, - cranes with instant payment.\nPerforming small tasks\n In the global network, there are many online services that provide the opportunity to earn bitcoin for performing small tasks. A good example is the Coinworker website. Here there are tasks of various complexity, the essence of which lies in posting news on social networks, testing web applications, and so on.\nWriting articles for news sites and blogs\n If you have enough knowledge, you can make your own contribution to the development of bitcoin technology, writing articles for blogs and news sites. Many sites are desperately looking for authors of articles, because to maintain their positions in search results, a daily publication of a certain number of posts is required. When working through different stock exchanges, earnings are significantly lower than when working directly with the customer, and can range from $ 0.85 per 1000 characters or more, depending on the complexity of the topic chosen. Being one of the authors of the \"untwisted\" portal about bitcoin, you can get from $ 1.7 to $ 3.5 for 1000 characters or more.\n Knowledge of English will be a huge advantage for the author, because you can earn bitcoin faster on foreign services. Usually the cost of such orders is determined by the number of words, not symbols. For 1000 meaningful words about the crypto currency you can get from 35 to 80 dollars.\nProvision of funds in debt\n This method is suitable for those people who already have some amount of money in bitcoins, which I would like to increase. In the network, there are many projects related to bitcoin, which need funding. Being an investor of one of them, you can make a profit in the form of interest from the amount given out.\n However, such activities are associated with certain risks. Some people who received money on loan can not return them. Therefore, you should carefully consider the selection of projects in which personal finance can be invested.\n To date, the best online services for crediting Bitcoin are Biterest, BTCJam, Bitbond, Loanbase, Pure Central and Bitlending. Biterest BTCJam services are most targeted at citizens from the countries of the former CIS.\n It is worth noting that lending to bitcoin is a rather risky enterprise, which will cause losses rather than bring profit. Therefore, this way of earning is hardly suitable for beginners.\nMining of bitcoins\n Mining can not be attributed to methods that allow you to receive free bitcoins. In order to establish the process, it is necessary to take the time to become aware of this area and purchase suitable equipment. You can use a standard PC for mining, but simple calculations show that earnings per day will not exceed 0. 968 bitcoins. The costs of paying electricity supplier bills will exceed the profit from mining.\n To calculate the profitability of mining, even special calculators were invented. Their algorithm is based on a formula that takes into account factors such as the cost of the equipment used, the number of kW of electricity consumed, and others.\n Since the reward in the form of bitcoins for the created block is approximately halved every 4 years, by 2020 it will amount to only 6.25 biticoins. Probably, since that moment, the mining of bitcoins will be expedient only for large companies that have expensive equipment.\nAn alternative to classic mining is cloud mining. This method is less expensive, but it also allows you to earn good money with minimal investment.\nTrading\n To date, there are many ways for trading. But to start trading bitcoins, you need to have the appropriate knowledge. The main types of trading are:\n  Intraday, involving the purchase and sale of virtual currencies for one day. The benefits of such transactions depend on short-term price fluctuations.\n  Investments in the asset class without real ownership (CFDs or contracts for difference). The purchase is made through brokers, so instead of buying real money a user can purchase a contract for them. When approaching the right moment (the course jump), the contract can be profitable to sell and earn bitcoin.\n  Binary options are a form of trade in which participants perform forecasting of a course of a crypto currency. For the correct forecast, the user is awarded a reward, otherwise he incurs losses.\n In fact, binary options can be considered a form of gambling, which received an attractive name. Nobody can accurately predict what the cost of crypto currency will be. Otherwise, everyone would become billionaires.\nGames that do not require initial fees\n Unlike gambling, you can play in bitcoin games for free, getting a reward for it. In fact, such games are bitcoin-cranes, thanks to which it is possible to spend interesting and useful time. Among such gaming applications for mobile devices can be identified Chopcoin, Coinbrawl and Bitcoin Aliens.\nGetting bitcoins for answering questions\n More recently, the Bitfortip service appeared on the Internet, where you can receive a monetary reward for the correct answer to the question posed. The idea is that someone places a question, for the best answer to which a monetary reward is awarded. For the answer it is necessary to search the information on the Internet. For example, the questions could be:\n  How much does the cheapest mobile phone cost?\n  What is the best Bitcoin advertising platform?\n The amount of remuneration is determined by those who posted the post with the question. The disadvantage of the service is too low traffic. New questions appear only 1-2 times a week. Perhaps in the future, its owners will be able to attract enough users to make it a good place to earn bitcoin.\nSites for investing in bitcoin (should be avoided at all costs!)\n Recently, on the Internet, especially in runet, there are many sites on which they promise super-high daily profits. You can often find such offers as \"get 1 bitcoin free\" or similar. To do this, participants need to provide their personal funds in bitcoins. Judging by the numerous reviews of real people, the owners of such sites are scammers and scammers. Their real activity is to collect the maximum amount of funds from investors, after which they simply disappear. Therefore, this way of earning bitcoins can result in the loss of all your funds.\nFinally\n As you can see, getting bitcoin absolutely free is almost impossible. To do this, you will need to spend your personal time or money. Even to get an acceptable profit from bitcoin-cranes you need a special online application - a rotator, for the use of which you need to pay. But most importantly, you should beware of sites that offer users to receive bitcoin for free every hour. Most often their owners are scammers who want to be enriched by trusting people.\nthe original is taken:https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@muhammadharis93/how-to-get-1-bitcoin-for-free-without-attachment-complete-guide", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@muhammadharis93/how-to-get-1-bitcoin-for-free-without-attachment-complete-guide"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T04:45:13.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "62b2a05961193b71758180c052ad8b96c1974f9c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfxzEJ4gE0C5R8hUJ9QCw1o-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Factors that affects the value of bitcoin...", "title_full": "Factors that affects the value of bitcoin...", "published": "2018-06-03T03:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.098, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "62b2a05961193b71758180c052ad8b96c1974f9c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfxzEJ4gE0C5R8hUJ9QCw1o-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Daseento", "published": "2018-06-03T03:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "Factors that affects the value of bitcoin...", "text": "The value of Bitcoin depends on demand and supply just like every other currency.

Robert Sluymer, Managing Director and Technical Strategist at Fundstrat seems to be joining the company’s growing group of cryptocurrency bulls. Promising Signs for Bitcoin?\nOn CNBC’s “Futures Now” segment , Sluymer stated:\n“We think Bitcoin is starting to bottom off some very key support around $7,000 and we think it’s going to start a recovery process here.”\nSluymer also noted that he has a three-phase technical analysis process that allows him to try to predict future price movements of cryptocurrencies. The first phase, which is the deceleration or bottoming out of momentum indicators, may be just starting.\nSluymer pointed out that the first phase seems to be in effect when he said:\n“While it is premature to conclude the correction is over, there was a positive technical development this week suggesting the first stage of a three-stage bottoming process is developing. Short-term momentum indicators are beginning to bottom.”\nFor the past week, Bitcoin has been hovering around the low to mid $7000s, in a low volatility state, as shown by the bottom most indicator in the chart below.\nVolatility has become a key characteristic often attributed with the price of cryptocurrencies and seeing a slowdown in volatility might leave some market players in a confused state. I personally would attribute this decrease in relative volatility to the increased institutional involvement in the industry.\nHowever, take volatility with a grain of salt in this case, as volatility levels we are currently residing at were seen just before the crypto boom of 2017.\nBut some have begun to believe that this is a promising sign, as they believe that Bitcoin is consolidating before the eventual retesting of ATHs. $6500 Triple Bottom. Is it Possible?\nHowever, Bitcoin is still over $1000 away from 2018’s low, which amounted to around $6500 back in early April. The low in April was actually a double-bottom, with Bitcoin reaching similar price levels back in February after December’s $20,000 Bitcoin. This has led some analysts who are more critical of Bitcoin’s price, to think that a triple-bottom could occur in the future. However, even if Bitcoin was to revisit those prices levels, past indicators show that there is a large amount of support at $6500.\nDespite fears of a triple-bottom at $6500, the relative strength indicator (RSI) has been trending upwards (as seen by the chart above), finding a bottom of around 30 earlier this week. This RSI indicator, which is still located in the ‘oversold’ zone, may show that Bitcoin is prepared for upwards price action.\nOver the course of this year’s price drops to $6500, RSI indicators often went as low as 30, with run-ups in price and positive indicators quickly following the aforementioned price drops. If historical values and patterns are of any merit, as they often are, this means that we could see a rapid Bitcoin run-up in the near future.\nHowever, Sluymer believes that before that Bitcoin breaking past $7800 will have to be a precursor to the run-up which many have been waiting for.\nDespite the potential for Bitcoin’s short-term success, Sluymer believes that the largest cryptocurrency may lose some dominance as some players like EOS and Tron (TRX) may outperform Bitcoin in the near future. He also mentioned that other cryptocurrencies residing in the top-40, such as IOTA, 0x, and WaltonChain have shown that they may also begin to encroach on Bitcoin’s 38% market share.\nBut Sluymer made it clear that he is still adamant about his belief that Bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, will begin to see some upward price action very shortly.\nHe put it best when he said:\n“If you’re short we think you should be very careful and reducing your short exposure. I think if you’re looking to be long this is where you start adding here to your long exposure.”\nCharts from Tradingview.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sluymer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T17:03:29.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "db08c47a992f2d892a38ac9d1b2794c8eaac62c1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.EGwBRyVD4M0Dus0Hv4C.PGacjx6M3C.ccXhSBYurpiHXQIw88h6CYGaYmevgbMlicRDkfNeQM4CudZuRdZqGM.0JzoRWGiXyPfd87p0FfuEqMOYtB3OLRyJze1n0YoUb8xU4Yv6kZzfgqR9cFSjk8DCWkZpYA4I_SHdExmBKYvKIl2ou1aw1d", "site_full": "www.blockchainassociation.it", "site": "blockchainassociation.it", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "", "title": "Blockchain Media Company Acquires the Beyond Bitcoin Documentary at Cannes Film Festival - BLOCKCHAIN ASSOCIATION ITALIA", "title_full": "Blockchain Media Company Acquires the Beyond Bitcoin Documentary at Cannes Film Festival - BLOCKCHAIN ASSOCIATION ITALIA", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IT", "spam_score": 0.066, "main_image": "https://source.unsplash.com/320x240/?bitcoin,blockchain,cryptocurrency,ethereum,litecoin,smartcontract", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "db08c47a992f2d892a38ac9d1b2794c8eaac62c1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.EGwBRyVD4M0Dus0Hv4C.PGacjx6M3C.ccXhSBYurpiHXQIw88h6CYGaYmevgbMlicRDkfNeQM4CudZuRdZqGM.0JzoRWGiXyPfd87p0FfuEqMOYtB3OLRyJze1n0YoUb8xU4Yv6kZzfgqR9cFSjk8DCWkZpYA4I_SHdExmBKYvKIl2ou1aw1d", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Autore", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Blockchain Media Company Acquires the Beyond Bitcoin Documentary at Cannes Film Festival - BLOCKCHAIN ASSOCIATION ITALIA", "text": "Contact Blockchain Media Company Acquires the Beyond Bitcoin Documentary at Cannes Film Festival\nBlockchain media company Slate Entertainment Group revealed its 'seven figure deal' on acquiring rights for a documentary about blockchain during … read more … Autore wp_6326125 Pubblicato il ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cannes film festival - blockchain association italia contact blockchain media company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockchain media company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cannes film festival blo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "slate entertainment group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T11:01:41.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3f24f97d85290c83d7546d349878bbbfd9baa9a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7qCL5XL7adLKG9kgKy0Z3g-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "title_full": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3f24f97d85290c83d7546d349878bbbfd9baa9a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7qCL5XL7adLKG9kgKy0Z3g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nEarn Bitcoins while using Mozilla Firefox!

With it’s meteoritic rise in value in 2017, where at its peak, 1 BTC (Bitcoin) equaled 17,900 USD, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have been in everyone’s radar for the past year. From obscurity to fame; Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are a regular topic in major news organizations such as CNN, BBC and more while a year back, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies were largely ignored. This meant that except for tech enthusiasts, the large masses were largely unaware of bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and blockchain in general.\nBefore I tell you how to start a bitcoin exchange, let me first iterate what happens in a bitcoin exchange. We have two separate identities: a buyer who tries to sell bitcoins at the lowest price possible while a seller tries to sell bitcoins the the highest price possible. These buy and sell orders are entered into an order book, where if the price dictated by the buyer and seller matches, then the order is automatically executed. The exchange keeps a small percentage of the trade as a commission.\nThis is where your profit as the one who started the bitcoin exchange. You get to deduct a commission from every transaction that happens on your bitcoin exchange. While this commission is quite low so as to garner more customers, a large enough volume in trading means you can be earning thousands upon thousands just with your commission. So this is the profitability of bitcoin exchanges.\nHowever, starting a bitcoin exchange should be more than just its profitability. Bitcoin and Blockchain (the technology behind Bitcoin and all cryptocurrency) has vast potential behind it. Imagine you are in a foreign country, with blockchain you do not have to pay currency conversion fees, or if you get a loan with minimal interest fees, that would definitely be a better life right? With cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, this future is within our grasp. This is the reason why governments and banks are so against cryptocurrency and the recent pop ups of bans all over the world, all in order to curb this growth. Starting a bitcoin exchange helps open the technology up to the public and helps revolutionize the world.\nAlso read, Bitcoin jumps 7% amid massive market sell-off\nNow, in order to start a bitcoin exchange, of course, you will need to get your hands dirty with the gritty and nitty part of technological and programming part. You will need to build your own codes or acquire a exchange script , have an user interface where your customers can trade (either a trading website or a trading app) and have extensive marketing strategy to acquire as much consumers as possible.\nHowever, with this article, I wish to explore the correct way to go about starting your own bitcoin exchange.\nIn case you need more information regarding the coding part of the exchange, you will need a team of programmers or a dedicated developer team who will do the heavy lifting for you. You can also purchase white label bitcoin exchanges, or you can download them for free on an open source. You can also visit sites like bitexchange.systems, where you can download their source code for free and additionally you can purchase their numerous modules that can be seamlessly added to a new or existing bitcoin exchange. These modules are great features sure to brighten up your consumer’s day.\nFirst and foremost, you will need to do extensive research. Do not limit yourself to just learning about the technicalities of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, you should also research on your competition. Try to analyze why some exchanges are as successful as they are today and what differentiates them from those that are not as successful. However, do not conform to the norms. Bitcoin is the the very definition of innovation and currently these very innovations fuel Bitcoin. Be brave and be bold.\nSecondly, you need to find your targets. You cannot cater to everybody, you will need to research and find a niche to fill. When you know your target, you will be able to easily determine the kind of bitcoin exchange you wish to create as well as find the proper marketing strategy to stand king of the hill in your niche. A strong foundation enables future scaling of your business.\nAlso read, BITCOIN PRICE – LIVE UPDATES: CRYPTOCURRENCY VALUE CONTINUES TO RISE\nLastly, determine the type of bitcoin exchange you wish to create. Don’t just imagine, visualize your dreams and work out how you want your bitcoin exchange to look like. Aesthetics and designs are important, however don’t forget that ultimately your bitcoin exchange has to be security. Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published.

There was a break above a crucial bearish trend line with resistance near $980 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is now above the $1,040 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours).\nBitcoin cash price is gaining bullish momentum above $1,000 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD has to move above $1,100 to accelerate gains in the near term. Bitcoin Cash Price Trend\nThis past week, there were mostly range moves below $1,040 in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price was struggling to gain pace above the $1,020 and $1,040 resistance levels. Finally, there was an upside break and the price settled above the $1,040 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). During the upside move, the price broke many hurdles, including the $1,000 barrier.\nMoreover, there was a break above the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,323 swing high to $871 low. More importantly, there was a break above a crucial bearish trend line with resistance near $980 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair is now placed nicely in a positive zone above $1,040. At the moment, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,323 swing high to $871 low at $1,096 is acting as a resistance . A break and close above $1,100 is needed for more gains towards $1,200.\nLooking at the chart , the price action is positive above $1,000. On the downside, the broken resistances at $1,040 and $1,000 are likely to act as supports if the price moves down.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n4-hours MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now well above the 60 level.\nMajor Support Level – $1,000\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,100 Bitcoin Cash Price Weekly Analysis: BCH/USD Gaining Upside Momentum was last modified: June 3rd, 2018 by Aayush Jindal ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "newsbtc bitcoin cash price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin cash price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T10:41:18.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "19013dbc499e7b8eba6ab640c6c69bf8ac56675d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVvhvNiQ8cRsEQa9NOmAndzN.qsAU.TL72Zu6G2KSFnix569E_OVLtxEzCfpL14JUIAXk_Hy7BFS0Jcu8Y_EIN4w--", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Huobi Creates Its Own Cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Huobi Creates Its Own Cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ETF.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "19013dbc499e7b8eba6ab640c6c69bf8ac56675d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVvhvNiQ8cRsEQa9NOmAndzN.qsAU.TL72Zu6G2KSFnix569E_OVLtxEzCfpL14JUIAXk_Hy7BFS0Jcu8Y_EIN4w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Avi Mizrahi", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Huobi Creates Its Own Cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) - Bitcoin News", "text": "1 Huobi Creates Its Own Cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)\nWhy wait for Wall Street to launch exchange traded funds following the crypto markets? Huobi, the Singapore-headquartered cryptocurrency exchange, has decided to create its own ETF style instrument based on its recently launched index of ten digital assets.\nAlso Read: This Week in Bitcoin: Digital Money Makes the World Go Round Huobi Index Tracker Fund\nThe company says that the Huobi 10 index tracker product, HB10, will allow retail investors to attain exposure to the digital assets market with a relatively small capital outlay while diversifying risks. It is also meant to attract more institutional investors, by reducing the impact of institutional entry and exit on a single coin. Investors may purchase HB10 shares exclusively with UDST, BTC, ETH and Huobi’s own HT. The minimum purchase for each account is 100, or 0.01 BTC, 0.2 ETH, and 50 HT.\nHuobi only announced launch of the benchmark index less than two weeks ago, explaining at the time it is meant to reflect the market performance of Huobi Pro in terms of USDT. The assets in it are divided into four categories: Coins, Platforms, Applications and Physical Assets tokens, depending on the transaction volume value of the previous quarter. Right now the index’s components include HT at 29.3%, BTC at 23.1%, EOS at 17.3%, ETH at 10.9%, BCH at 5.2%, XRP at 4.1%, IOST at 3.1%, LTC at 3%, ETC at 2.3%, and DASH at 1.5%. $93 Million Crypto VC Fund\nIt was also revealed on Friday that Huobi has joined forces with Chinese VC New Margin Capital and Korean online brokerage Kiwoom Securities to jointly launch a 100 billion won ($93 million) investment fund. It will invest in blockchain startups in both China and Korea, and is meant to help collaborations among the two Asian ecosystems. According to China Money Network , Korean banks including Korea Development Bank and Industrial Bank Of Korea will be investing in the fund as limited partners. And Mirae Asset Financial Group, an independent financial services group headquartered in Seoul, is also joining the fund as an investor.\nBesides Huobi’s new ETF, enabling people to invest in multiple coins as once has been a focus in the industry recently. Last month, Circle, the Goldman Sachs-backed Boston-headquartered company, announced a new feature called “Buy the Market,” allowing users to buy seven assets in one click, including BTC, BCH, ETH, ETC, LTC, ZEC and XMR.\nWhat do you think about this new investment instrument?

June 3, 2018 10 Views Toju Omet · June 2, 2018 · 11:00 pm\nBy now every crypto trader has experienced the anxiety of sending funds from one wallet address to another. You first copy paste the long string of letters and numbers, then double check five times to make sure you don’t send it to the wrong address and gift a random stranger with a nice weekend present.\nThe all-too-familiar problem of Bitcoin address format is now being challenged by a simple solution: human-readable addresses.\n“One of the main problems facing mass adoption of cryptocurrency usage is the difficult nature of making token transactions,” says Isabella Dell, Founder, and CTO of IOV (Internet of Value) . “When it comes to actual end-users, blockchain platforms have failed to solve the user experience problem around wallet addresses in particular.” G lobal Decentralized Blockchain Address Registry\nIOV has created a blockchain name service application (BNS) that allows users to input their public keys and register a human-readable value address.\nEssentially IOV envisions addresses changing from this:\n28fh17fvY9Co2kja9fl24DbFX57j803gw5\nTo this:\njohn*iov.value\nThese new addresses will be shorter and easier to manage for non-technical people getting into the crypto space as they look similar to email addresses, which everyone is already familiar with. Blockchain Wallet Interoperability\nIOV plans to make things even easier for cryptocurrency adopters by solving the problem of Blockchain wallet interoperability (managing multiple cryptocurrencies across different Blockchains).\nThe majority of Blockchains currently exist in silos, where you can only interact within a blockchain ecosystem by sending your cryptocurrencies to a centralized exchange, trading them for another coin, and then sending those funds to a new wallet that supports said coin.\nThis process usually requires at least three transactions, which means more fees, time, as well as greater risk of human error.\nUsing cross-chain atomic swaps , IOV aims to make the movement of funds from one blockchain to the next a truly peer-to-peer experience.\n“With a cross-chain atomic swap, we actually have the transactions in the chains, yet they are only claimable by the two parties,” Dell explained.\nDuring the process of claiming the tokens, certain information is revealed that allows the other party to claim the transaction. Throughout this process, the middleman is removed and the chain becomes the escrow, so crypto holders don’t have to give coins to an exchange or someone they don’t trust. Ahead of the Curve\nIOV’s impressive work earned them first place at this years TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield Europe event.\nBy introducing BNS and cross chain atomic swaps, the team is laying the foundation for a future where thousands of currencies that each serve a unique purpose within their ecosystem will exist, and people will be free to switch between cryptocurrencies as seamlessly as we can currently switch between browser tabs.\nWould a new address format improve your crypto experience?

BTG Has an Online Wallet!", "text": "Saturday, June 2, 2018 How to Get Bitcoin Gold Online? BTG Has an Online Wallet!\nThe late 2017 was rightly termed as the Forks season, witnessing a range of junk copies of the mainstream currencies as well as successful forks like Bitcoin Gold (BTG ). The BTG fork minimizes the impact of big miners like Bitmain, on the network and in general, is called \"the backup copy of Bitcoin\". And one thing about the forks, is that people who have been holding tokens on main chain, can also get equal number of tokens on the forked blockchain as well. So, those holding Bitcoin before the BTG fork can claim an equal number of the new tokens. And, if you have not received your free BTG – this article is for you!\nThough Bitcoin Gold carries the popular word \"Bitcoin\", it works using a completely different algorithm called Equihash. This algorithm is also used to mine another mainstream coin i.e. Zcash.\nGetting Bitcoin Gold\nLike most hard forks of popular coins, the developers of Bitcoin Gold also announced that the Bitcoin community members would receive BTG tokens, equal to their BTC holdings as of October 25, 2017. While that's public knowledge, many Bitcoin holders still don't know how to split the BTG from their Bitcoin wallet.\nExtracting Bitcoin Gold from the eligible Bitcoin holdings is a simple process. It can be done using btgonline.info — an online service that allows people to extract BTG and then exchange it for Bitcoin or just hold it. To do that, they will have to include their Bitcoin wallet's passphrase or private key and let the tool do its job*.\nChoosing a Bitcoin Gold Wallet\nUsers are free to decide which wallet they would like to use, based on their requirements. However, it is worth keeping in mind that this cryptocurrency has no problems with support and software, so supporters of any platforms can choose the appropriate application. The wallets are available as a usual desktop, and mobile, online or even hardware solutions.\nGetting a BTG – Step by Step The process starts with the authorization in the wallet. Go to the middle tab \"SEND/RECEIVE BITCOIN GOLD\" From the drop-down list on the left page corner, select your wallet type where your bitcoins were stored, for example: Blockchain.info. In the next field, enter the passphrase that was given to you when opening a crypto-currency wallet. If, in paragraph 2, you chose, for example, \"WIF Private key\", then instead of the passphrase you will be asked to enter the Private key; Click the orange \"Next\" button. Done, you are already in your Bitcoin Gold wallet and you can see your balance, which already should be same as the number of coins received from the hard fork.\nExchanging BTG Made Easier\nTransacting with btgonline.io is a straightforward procedure. Sending BTG is now convenient and simple, all transactions also are immediately visible on the BTG network.\nJust type the transfer amount, then paste the recipient address in the field \"Bitcoin Gold Address\" and send your transaction. That's all!\nExchanging BTG to BTC\nAt first, go to the third tab \"Exchange BTG to BTC\". Log in by selecting the wallet type and entering a passphrase or Private key. By the button \"Next\" we pass to the next tab, where you will see the balance of your wallet. Click \"Send to BTC\". After that, actions are the same as sending BTG in the previous section: You specify the address to which you want to get bitcoin and select the type of commission. When you click on the \"Send\" button, our BTG will be converted to BTC and sent to the specified account.\nThe btgonline.io service is the only way to get and store BTG coins in the browser, and the easiest way to change them to bitcoin. If you still have not received BTG, then it's the most convenient online service that allows you to do this in a minute.\nTo learn more about the service, visit https://btgonline.io/\n*Users are urged to transfer the existing bitcoin balance to another wallet before entering the existing wallet's passphrase or private key on ANY online tool.

Bentley", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The New Age of Bitcoin Business Opportunities – THE LIBERTARIAN VINDICATOR", "text": "\nOriginally Published on Coin Central as a partnership with The Libertarian Vindicator\nThere is Way More than Day Trading\nEver since the world was first introduced to Bitcoin 9-years prior, the cryptomarket has experienced astonishing growth. Along with this rapid expansion, the number of Bitcoin business opportunities has also grown.\nAlthough somewhat popular, day trading can be stressful and the volatility of the market can confuse even the most experienced crypto investors. Thankfully, even if trading crypto isn’t your cup of tea, there are still plenty of Bitcoin business opportunities that you can get involved with to do your part to further crypto adoption and put some extra Satoshis in your pocket.\nDepending on your budget, you may find that some of these business opportunities are the perfect fit for you. BTC is going mainstream and there’s no shortage of entrepreneurial opportunities available. Below are just a couple profitable ventures to consider. Bitcoin Business Opportunities – Start Mining\nYes, mining BTC is still profitable in 2018 but you will need to make a considerable investment to get your enterprise started.\nDue to the competitive nature of the mining sector, though, you will want to invest in some quality mining hardware such as GPU or ASIC mining chips before you get started. Both of these options will provide you with far better results than attempting the process from your CPU directly, and by joining a mining pool, you can leverage your efforts with other members of the pool to split the profits.\nYou will need to consider the electricity costs in your area as most mining rigs can consume around a 1000W or more of power during operation. This can eat up your profits and make the entire venture a bust. Avoid this scenario by choosing a location with renewable or very low-cost electricity. BTC Merchandise\nThere is a serious demand for BTC-related merchandise . Everything branding the now famous BTC logo is a hot commodity in the market and BTC users can never get enough merchandise to show the world their love for Satoshis’ vision. Artist can create BTC-related shirts, poster, patches, screensavers, etc., and on top of being able to use the BTC logo freely, they can also utilize one of the many blockchain content platforms to offer their products securely. Remittance Payments\nBTC remittance services are seeing huge success globally. Countries such as India depend heavily on remittance payments and depending on where you live, you may find that there is a serious need for this service in your area. The remittance industry handles billions of dollars of commerce and BTC is perfectly suited to help people achieve a higher level of service when compared to the current business model. BTC ATM\nBTC ATMs are considered by many as the missing link in the crypto space. These units are not overly expensive and you can make some serious profit by offering people the ability to purchase their BTC directly from the kiosk. The best part is; most states don’t allow these ATMs to handle fiat currency withdrawals, so you never have to worry about filling the machine with cash. Payment Processors\nAny business owner can get directly involved in the crypto space by adding a crypto payment processor. Crypto processing has become very popular over the last year and most processors give you the ability to accept multiple types of crypto. The best payment processors even allow you to decide to withdraw your funds in BTC or fiat currency. This eliminates any loss of funds due to BTC market fluctuations. HODL\nTo HODL or Hold On for Dear Life, is a phrase that describes the BTC investor who simply purchases BTC and holds it. There is some serious sense behind this strategy. There will only ever be 21 million BTC mined and there are already over 17 million in circulation. This means that the chances are very good that the price of BTC will continue to rise as this scarcity hits the mining sector. BTC Groups\nBlockchain-based investment groups are popping up all over the world. Here, likeminded crypto-investors can meet up and discuss future projects and developments in the marketplace. Organizing a blockchain meet up group can be very inexpensive and the people you meet could end up becoming lifelong business partners should any of your joint ventures succeed. Most blockchain groups charge a small membership fee, which can also add to the overall profitability of this venture. Become a Professional Trader\nIf you are one of those individuals that have seen great success trading in the cryptomarket, then you may want to consider becoming a fund manager. There are a number of crypto platforms that are emerging in the market that utilize blockchain technology to allow anyone to become a fund manager. Users can verify the skill level of their manager via the blockchain. This way, investors can place their funds in the manager’s portfolio with confidence. Bitcoin Business Opportunities Are Everywhere\nAll it takes is a creative mind and a simple understanding of how cryptocurrencies work to find profitable Bitcoin business opportunities in your area. The decentralized market is here to stay and all those who position their investments wisely are sure to reap the rewards as BTC continues to go mainstream.

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $7,716.\nMeanwhile, student loan rates are rising and those indebted are taking on larger loans. The new loan rates will take effect on July 1, with undergraduates paying an interest rate of 5.04% on new Stafford loans instead of 4.45%. The rate adjustment for graduate students taking on direct loans is 6.59%, up from 6%. For parents who help their children, the rate will be 7.59%, up from 7%. Caps have been set for all three types of loans at 8.25%, 9.5% and 10.5%, respectively.\nThe rate hikes are spurring Millennials to question bankers who raise rates. They’re also considering the sustainability of an economic structure that is leaving them broke.\nSays Jeremy Gardner , a managing partner at Ausum Ventures, “As a millennial, I personally put much greater faith in scarce digital assets that are determined by math and auditable code, rather than a group of bankers at the Federal Reserve.”\nThe total US student loan debt now stands at $1.48 trillion, spread out among 44.2 million Americans. Towering over the $1.03 trillion balloon created by credit card debt, the student loan crisis has gripped the country’s Millennials with an average payment of $351 per month for borrowers aged 20 to 30 years.\nWhen Millennials look at one another – the class branded as ‘entitled slackers’ – they’re staring at a group of people on the cusp of their careers, with college and graduate degrees, saddled with debt.\nThe delinquency rate for borrowers who are 90+ days late on their payments or who have defaulted on their loans stands at 11.2%. The burden is rippling out in a number of ways. When nearly 5 million borrowers are unable to make their payments on time – and for every borrower who is honoring payments – economic ease, financial freedom and security become non-existent. Hard work ethics and long hours aside, and despite how individuals are coping with mile-high debt, Millennials are delaying traditional milestones like buying a first home, getting married and having children.\nBut they’re investing in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, as digital assets that can show long-term returns and are unable to be manipulated by the Federal Reserve.\nA recent study by Finder reveals that Millennials are the leading generation for interest in cryptocurrencies. Finder commissioned a survey of 2,001 American adults. Of the adults surveyed, 7.95% reported the purchase of a cryptocurrency.\nWho owns crypto?

They’ve moved from being fringe investment opportunities and currency options for “preppers” and anarchists to being accepted by the mainstream as powerful investment tools that offer significant opportunities for growth. In addition to being used as an investment tool, cryptocurrencies are being more readily accepted by retailers and manufacturers, and they can be used to purchase goods and services from many different companies today. Now, the state of Arizona might be taking things a step farther, by allowing residents to pay income taxes with bitcoin. The Legal Situation\nAt the time of this writing, residents of Phoenix Arizona cannot use bitcoin to pay their taxes, but things are in motion that could ultimately allow them to do so. A bill was adopted by the state senate that would allow bitcoin or another state-recognized cryptocurrency to be used to pay for taxes. The bill has yet to pass in the house, though. A second bill is also being voted on that would recognize cryptocurrencies (and an included list of preferred options) as legal tender.\nSupporters of the bill point out that allowing state residents to pay their taxes with bitcoin would offer significant flexibility and freedom. It would enable the payment of taxes at any time, from anywhere with an Internet connection. That could include while on the road, or just sitting on the sofa at home.\nAccording to David Z. Morris, writing for Fortune magazine, “Accepting payment of income taxes in cryptocurrency has profound symbolic and practical significance. Historically, the use of government-issued currencies for the payment of income tax has helped guarantee those currencies’ widespread adoption as a payment medium.” Potential Fallout\nWhile there are quite a few benefits to be gained by allowing the use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, there are some potential drawbacks. Detractors of the idea point to the incredible volatility of the cryptocurrency markets. The major value losses that marked most of the major currencies at the beginning of 2018 were prime examples of what these individuals fear will happen. If payments are accepted in bitcoin, and then bitcoin’s value plummets by thousands of dollars, how will that affect the state’s financial situation?\nOne safeguard that is being put in place is a requirement for the state to convert all tax-related cryptocurrency payments into US dollars within 24 hours of the payment being made. Ostensibly, this would mitigate the potential value loss, at least to some extent. However, it does not go far enough for many residents, who point out that bitcoin lost massive amounts of value in less than 24 hours in early 2018, and that a repeat of that loss could cripple the state financially.\nSupporters of the bill state that the impact would be largely negligible, as they do not expect a significant percentage of residents to pay their taxes with cryptocurrency. Most residents are expected to continue using US dollars, largely due to the high entry price of bitcoin and other very popular cryptocurrencies. There is also the fact that currency conversion would require additional staff and payroll in an agency already dealing with massive budget cuts. A Sign of Things to Come\nWhether Phoenix Arizona ultimately passes a law allowing residents to pay their taxes with bitcoin or not, this is a sign of things to come. As cryptocurrencies in general become more widely accepted, fears will be allayed and more people will come to see the value and utility offered by a currency that is not backed by a national government, and that can act as more than just a static store of value.

According to media reports, Russian Railways is planning to implement blockchain applications, smart contracts and ticket sales in crypto. Both company officials and independent experts have spoken about the advantages for logistics and transportation services.\nAlso read: Russian Duma Adopts Three Crypto Bills on First Reading RZD Aims at 5,000 Smart Contracts a Month\nAccording to several publications in recent months and this week, the huge state-run enterprise is seriously considering to embrace crypto-related applications such as smart contracts and blockchain technologies, and may even start selling tickets for cryptocurrency. Russian Railways, which is proudly calling itself “The Strongest Link in Eurasia,” is ranking among the top three railway systems in the world. The adoption of these innovations by RZD would be a strong boost for the Russian crypto sector.\nWhat stands in the way is the lack of regulations, a situation that is about to change soon. The State Duma, the lower house of Russia’s parliament, has supported on first reading three draft laws aimed at legalizing the crypto industry in the country. The bills – “On Digital Financial Assets,” “On Attracting Investments Using Investment Platforms” and “On Digital Rights” – hit the house floor last week and should be adopted by the end of June.\n“In view of the forthcoming adoption of the drafts, which entail the possibility to exchange digital financial assets with rubles and [foreign] currencies, OAO ‘RZD’ plans to introduce decentralized storage of data based on blockchain technology and implement ‘smart contracts’,” said Pavel Tarentyev, an independent IT expert. Speaking to Fedpress , he explained that this could lead to full automation of RZD’s contractual relations and fulfillment of contract terms using cryptocurrency. Russian Railways intends to issue up to 5,000 smart contracts a month, he added. Introducing Crypto Payments\nPavel Tarentyev also said that in the future transactions related to passenger travel can be processed through cryptocurrency, as an alternative to traditional payment methods, like cash and electronic transfers. Crypto payments and the decentralized data storage would provide anonymity to passengers and their travel plans, he noted. RZD also hopes to use blockchain technology to store important information related to cargo transportation and significantly reduce the cost of its logistic services.\nEarlier statements by company officials indicate these are serious plans. In March, the head of RZD’s IT department, Evgeniy Charkin, said that Russian Railways intends to implement blockchain technology, smart contracts and start using cryptocurrency in its accounting after the relevant legislation is adopted. And, according to Director General Oleg Belozerov, the company is already digitizing many processes. During the Gaidar Forum in January, he expressed hope that the implementation of blockchain technologies would ensure cheaper transportation. Railways Going the Crypto Way\nRZD is not the only railway company fascinated by the ongoing crypto revolution. The fully state-owned Swiss Federal Railways has been selling cryptocurrency to its passengers for almost two years now. Bitcoin can be bought at any of its 1,000 ticket vending machines. Schweizerische Bundesbahnen is providing the service in partnership with Sweepay, a company based in the canton of Zug, dubbed the crypto valley of Switzerland. SBB offers “simple top-ups at ticket machines using QR codes” for any amount between 50 and 500 CHF, and even informs travelers on its website about locations accepting bitcoin.\nWhen the service was launched in 2016, passengers were not able to obtain tickets with cryptocurrency, as news.Bitcoin.com reported . Unfortunately, bitcoin is not among the available payment options yet. However, thanks to platforms like Destinia , train tickets are already sold for crypto around the world, regardless of whether railway companies accept digital coins or not. Destinia currently offers tickets for the railway systems of Spain, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the UK, France, Portugal, Canada, and the US. That includes companies like Renfe and Amtrak.\nHave you purchased train tickets with cryptocurrency?

Unlike many of the new startups creating their own blockchains, Hodl Hodl is doing these complex transactions on the bitcoin blockchain, countering the narrative that bitcoin is only good as a store of value.\nThe exchange platform debuted in March, and within weeks it garnered more than 5,300 registered users in over 30 countries, all transacting directly through either the bitcoin or litecoin blockchain by using what’s known as a multi-signature smart contract.\nHodl Hodl never touches bitcoin deposits or traditional fiat payments. Rather, it simply provides listings for people to connect, plus an interface to help users apply smart contracts directly to bitcoin.\nThose contracts rely on multisig wallets, where one key belongs to the exchange and the other to the seller. The seller’s keys are generated on the front end, in the browser, never stored on the company’s server or database.\nBecause of that setup, Hodl Hodl CTO Roman Snitko said:\n“Even if the exchange is hacked, the hacker only gets access to one key, whereas the other belongs to the user and the funds cannot be moved.”\nThis paved the way for a disparate real estate platform by the same team, called Househodl, which is set to launch in July with similar multisig contracts in lieu of the banks and lawyers who typically hold funds in escrow.\n“It’s better than dealing with banks and being unreasonably scrutinized time and again for every penny, even though your money is clean,” Snitko told CoinDesk.\nThis underscores the reasons why Snitko and CEO Max Keidun chose to work directly with the bitcoin blockchain rather than build a platform in parallel. They wanted a simple solution that didn’t require the startup to take on all the compliance responsibilities of a bank, the way some might argue exchanges like Coinbase have.\nHodl Hodl’s private key is useless by itself – a relief to traders spooked by the long history of multimillion-dollar thefts of user funds held at traditional crypto exchanges. Their verification process varies by jurisdiction, staying as hands-off as they can be within local regulations, to give users more responsibility and freedom. Unlike Coinbase, Hodl Hodl gives users their own private key.\n“No single party controls the funds on that address,” Snitko said. “That, in turn, means increased security, but also that we’re not exactly money transmitter from a regulatory point of view.”\nBy coupling compliance with decentralized security features, the Hodl Hodl team strives to show that bitcoin itself can also be leveraged for peer-to-peer business transactions. The team’s upcoming platform, Househodl, will take that idea even further by applying it directly to real estate purchases.\n“Because it’s safer,” Snitko said about why they chose bitcoin. “I do think it is the only secure, decentralized blockchain that stood the test of time.” Bitcoin’s security perks\nFirst and foremost, Hodl Hodl’s interest in bitcoin derives from its security.\nAccording to the founders, it’s much harder for intermediaries to misappropriate money frozen in this transparent, multi-sig escrow process, because no one has complete custody and all the parties involved can look at the blockchain to see what’s going on.\nAs such, multisig on a public ledger represents an upgrade to the centuries-old practice of depositing funds with a third party until a future condition is met.\nApplying this exchange’s smart contract to real estate first occurred to the Hodl Hodl team when a friend tried to sell her apartment to buy more bitcoin. The transaction took months because there were numerous bureaucratic intermediaries, from bankers to real estate agents.\nSnitko said:\n“It’s a whole mess that could be avoided if there was a platform for selling and buying real estate with bitcoin. That’s when we realized there is a demand on both sides of the equation.”\nThe team realized the a multisig process in Hodl Hodl’s flagship business could also offer a more transparent escrow system for buying property with bitcoin. Such transparency is lacking in traditional escrow processes, a situation often exploited by the intermediaries buyers trust the most.\nFor example, according to the New York Law Journal , the Lawyers’ Fund for Client Protection paid $10 million in 2017 to victims of lawyer misconduct that included the theft of escrow funds. In March of this year, another New York attorney was disbarred for hiding client funds in his personal escrow account, veiled behind the trappings of bank paperwork.\nEven if such conduct is rare today, the fact that it can happen suggest that there’s room for improvements that reduce reliance on trusted third parties. “I think real estate is the best use case for bitcoin payments right now,” Snitko added, “Because it’s relatively huge amounts of BTC that are being transferred so even if transaction fees go up, they would still make sense.” On-chain advantages\nUnlike the flagship exchange’s pure P2P model, Househodl contracts will require a third cryptographic key held by a neutral third party, such as a lawyer, plus more paperwork and identification than online currency swaps on Hodl Hodl.\nFunds only move if everyone cooperates, which would prevent the type of lawyer misconduct seen in New York. Yet, all of this still happens directly on the bitcoin blockchain, thanks to the exchange-tested workflow.\n“You will even be able to sign all the papers remotely on our [Househodl] platform, a one-stop-shop,” Keidun told CoinDesk.\nSeveral American real estate agents have already expressed interest in signing up for Househodl, Keidun said. But, due to the unclear regulatory landscape in the U.S., Househodl will probably launch in blockchain-friendly Dubai first, then steadily expand to Europe and North America.\nIn the meantime, new confidential trading options might give Keidun’s small startups a competitive advantage over other P2P platforms, both exchanges and blockchain startups in the real estate industry.\nMany P2P platforms broadcast all live offers to all participants, the same way CraigsList organizes listings by category. So Hodl Hodl allows private offers, which are only visible if the seller sends a direct link to the buyer, or vice versa. This is one advantage Hodl Hodl has over its competitors. And the users don’t even need to sacrifice transparency for privacy, since the transactions are still on-chain, it’s just that they aren’t broadcasting the details a stranger would need to find them.\nIn addition, neither Hodl platform requires the user to cash out, the way incumbent P2P exchange LocalBitco ins does. Yet again, that points back to the fact that the escrow takes place on the blockchain itself.\n“That’s one difference we have from LocalBitcoins, where your funds are essentially held on LocalBitcoins,” Snitko told CoinDesk.\nCome summertime, Househodl will also offer such private listings for buying or selling real estate directly with cryptocurrency.\n“The idea is that you don’t need to cash out into a fiat currency to buy property,” Snitko said, touching on the broader issue of balancing compliance with the bitcoin community’s cypherpunk ethos by adding:\n“The most important challenge, I think, is to guarantee that the purchase is 100 percent legal and there are no legal loopholes to exploit.”\nKeys image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

This incorporated the burglary of Tokyo-based cryptographic money trade Mt Gox , at the time the world’s biggest virtual cash agent, which lost 650,000 bitcoins in 2014. Following this, trade Coincheck lost more than $530 million in January 2018, with the burglary of in excess of 500 million NEM tokens.\nHowever, though such terrible news stories have seen China and Korea bracing down, Japan has stayed dynamic and has rather gained from its initial encounters to make a structure for control.\nJapan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) made corrections to the Payment Services Act in 2016, some time before the Coincheck heist, to present enlistment necessities on virtual cash trade specialist co-ops – or virtual money representative merchants – and furthermore set up directions for client assurance and client ID.\nThe FSA revealed that these moves were incited by the across the board utilization of virtual cash by speculators; as an approach to counter illegal tax avoidance and psychological militant financing; and as a response to the Mt Gox hack.\nThis was trailed by advance FSA direction available in March 2018, including a rebuff for a few administrators, which should be enlisted with the FSA.\n“Under current laws and regulations certain tokens fall under the category of virtual currencies in the Payment Services Act. Therefore, exchange service providers of such tokens need to register with the FSA,” the controller revealed.\nAdditionally, contrasted and other Asian markets, Japan doesn’t appear to take the brakes off ICO dispatches. The FSA revealed that ICOs falling under the class of virtual cash go under the Payment Services Act, so need to enlist.

It has up to this point entered into partnerships with more than 100 banks, and counting. However, this has not reflected in the value of Ripple (XRP), mainly because it is highly correlated to bitcoin. A good percentage of ripple trading is done in bitcoin, which means that ripple has been dropping despite all the good news that have come its way in the last few months. Even Ripple CEO Brad recently made the same observation . He noted that,\n“There’s a very high correlation between the price of XRP and the price of bitcoin, but ultimately these are independent open-sourced technologies.”\nHowever, this will change in the near future. That’s because more exchanges are pairing altcoins with fiat, and this will see in the correlation between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies drop. For instance, Bittrex, one of the largest exchanges in the world, with over 3 million clients, announced that they are introducing fiat crypto trading for select client in the U.S . They intend to roll this out to all clients in the future. Binance too has announced the pairing of ripple (XRP) with Binance coin and true USD.\nThe biggest news pointing to the decoupling of ripple (XRP) from bitcoin (BTC) is the upcoming SBI virtual currency trading platform. This much awaited crypto exchange has only put ripple (XRP) on their webpage. There is no mention of any other cryptos. That’s an indicator that ripple will be the primary crypto that they will be listing, something that will give ripple (XRP) huge value outside of bitcoin.\nIt is clear that as altcoins decouple from bitcoin, ripple will be one of the biggest beneficiaries simply because it has a wider use case than any other blockchain project in the market. As Brad, the ripple CEO puts it, the market is still young and irrational. Over time, investors will pivot more towards projects that are fundamentally strong, and on this end, ripple is unrivalled. Going by the high levels of adoption that ripple has had up to this point, Brad is right! Ripple just recently announced a partnership with the largest bank in Kuwait. This follows similar deals in the UAE, and many more all across the world. These are deals that have pretty much cemented ripple as the crypto of the future.\nWith all these factors at play, it is clear that ripple (XRP) is about to blow up big time. A savvy investor would be looking to accumulate as much ripple as possible at current prices. This is a technology that is changing the finance industry as we know it. Its rate of adoption is making even people who have always hated ripple change their minds about it. Ripple is the future, and once it completely decouples from bitcoin, ripple (XRP) could easily hit a valuation of at least $10 in 2018.

Bitcoin trades at $7,500 at the time of writing. However, the cryptocurrency investor believes that the volatile digital asset may have reached its bottom and prices can only go up from here.\nWithout a doubt, some of the most telling features of cryptocurrencies remain their volatility and the largely unregulated nature of the digital asset sector. But, Morehead thinks that this aspect can help early-adopters and investors, by effectively giving them a head start.\nThe investor added that institutional investors and quality-regulated custodians are already taking positions in cryptocurrencies, while “buying the rumor” of crypto-friendly SEC regulations and “selling the fact.”\nDespite his rather obvious statements, Morehead gave a single technical tip to investors: purchase a digital asset when its 230-day moving average is breached, sell after a year, make an average of 239 percent profit. While the claim remains untested, Morehead referred to the blue line as shown in the chart below: ( Source : TradingView )\nWhile Morehead did not include a timestamp for the chart, BTCManager used a daily candlestick pattern to test his strategy. As it stands, if one were to purchase a single bitcoin on January 1, 2017, at $984, and sell on January 1, 2018, at $13, 718, the total percentage gain would be 1,294 percent, a figure much above Morehead’s average. He added:\n“That’s the essence of this trade: It rarely ever gets cheap to its long-term average. So today is a good day to be buying.” Institutional Trader Echoes Morehead’s Thoughts\nWhile the Pantera Capital founder has vested interests in the price of bitcoin, Robert Sluymer of Fundstrat Global is neutral in that sense as Sluymer’s company is a traditional finance investor house. However, the Fundstart executive agreed with Morehead’s bitcoin prediction of having reached the bottom. Sluymer, the head of technical strategy at Fundstrat, said :\n“We think Bitcoin is starting to bottom off some very key support around $7,000 and we think it’s going to start a recovery process here.”\nIncidentally, bitcoin danced around the $7,000 level in the last week of May 2018, before recovering to its current price of $7,500 at writing.\nUnlike Morehead, Sluymer referred to the relative strength index ( RSI ) on a bitcoin chart, which showed an “oversold level” on May 28, 2018, indicating a “bottoming phase taking hold.” ( Source : TradingView )\nThe RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and rate of change of an asset’s price movements, typically over a 14-day market cycle. Sluymer concluded:\n“We think the setup is very attractive here. If you’re short we think you should be very careful and reducing your short exposure. I think if you’re looking to be long this is where you start adding here to your long exposure.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "morehead", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan morehead", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "morehead", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T09:22:39.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "614aea0896aca9cd001adce05cf931a732aae32d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS_ptGajyMRkmYFu4ZcZGe2o-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "title_full": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "614aea0896aca9cd001adce05cf931a732aae32d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS_ptGajyMRkmYFu4ZcZGe2o-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nThe number of referral network levels will be reduced for all newly registered users shortly!
