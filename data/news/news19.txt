Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

cryptocurrency miners so that it can continue to fulfill its obligations to supply electricity to the entire province.\nCanada’s biggest electric utility is facing “unprecedented” demand from blockchain companies that exceeds Hydro-Quebec’s short- and medium-term capacity, according to a statement Thursday. In the coming days, Hydro-Quebec will file an application to the province’s energy regulator proposing a selection process for blockchain industry projects.\nHydro-Quebec has been courting cryptocurrency miners in recent months in a bid to soak up surplus energy from dams in northern Quebec. Power rates in the province are the lowest in North America, both for consumers and industrial customers.\nRegie de l’energie, as the provincial regulator is called, will be instructed to reserve a block of energy for cryptocurrency miners and to set a specific rate for the industry while considering issues including peak winter demand. Quebec wants to make sure Hydro-Quebec can maximize revenue while ensuring economic benefits such as job creation.\n“The blockchain industry is a promising avenue for Hydro-Quebec,” Eric Filion, president of Hydro-Quebec Distribution, said in the statement. “Guidelines are nevertheless required to ensure that the development of this industry maximizes spinoffs for Quebec without resulting in rate increases for our customers. We are actively participating in the Regie de l’energie’s process so that these guidelines can be produced as quickly as possible.”\nStrong Demand\nChief Executive Officer Eric Martel said in a February interview that the utility had received “hundreds of applications” from bitcoin miners in the previous weeks, which would need more than 9,000 megawatts of energy -- about one-quarter of the utility’s total generating capacity of 37,000 megawatts.\nBitcoin miners active in the province include Backbone Hosting Solutions Inc.,a Quebec-based company also known as Bitfarms that’s in the process ofexpanding its operations locally.\n“We understand that Hydro-Quebec wants to welcome the most serious players in this emerging industry, and we definitely are part of that group,” BitfarmsPresident Pierre-Luc Quimper said in an e-mailed statement. “Other places in Canada offer rates that are as competitive, if not more competitive, than those of Hydro-Quebec.”\nCryptocurrency mining pales in comparison with other industries in terms of job creation, according to a February study prepared by KPMG for Hydro-Quebec.\nUnidentified projects submitted to Hydro-Quebec in recent months could create as few at 0.4 direct job per megawatt used, and as many as 1.2 jobs, KPMG said. Data centers, by contrast, create between 5 and 25 jobs per megawatt, KPMG said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "hydro quebec", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hydro-quebec", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quebec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T00:21:40.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e634bb5ec582b0cdafb3f735c5d2c9d7713b3d00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JiI33rCgHUNQ35ltdGg.lWvemn7YaayAbZMmPv0ClfXZfURhn9xz2YqyHJtnjpkKyPCbp24J9Ui61ssrgqiC7Dm5VhEOemecXqhZBH8t.ZtKwEw2AU8eNIqVmoW0E0ql8-", "site_full": "ezquickstore.com", "site": "ezquickstore.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Miner Aspires to Launch Largest Crypto Mining Facility in the U.S. - Crypto News & Info", "title_full": "Bitcoin Miner Aspires to Launch Largest Crypto Mining Facility in the U.S. - Crypto News & Info", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://ezquickstore.com/wp-content/uploads/coinmint.width-800.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e634bb5ec582b0cdafb3f735c5d2c9d7713b3d00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JiI33rCgHUNQ35ltdGg.lWvemn7YaayAbZMmPv0ClfXZfURhn9xz2YqyHJtnjpkKyPCbp24J9Ui61ssrgqiC7Dm5VhEOemecXqhZBH8t.ZtKwEw2AU8eNIqVmoW0E0ql8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Miner Aspires to Launch Largest Crypto Mining Facility in the U.S. - Crypto News & Info", "text": "Bitcoin Miner Aspires to Launch Largest Crypto Mining Facility in the U.S. Bitcoin Miner Aspires to Launch Largest Crypto Mining Facility in the U.S. coiner Crypto Flash News Spread the love\nCoinmint , a cloud mining service provider, has confirmed it will go ahead with its proposed plan to open a cryptocurrency mining plant in an abandoned smelter previously used by Alcoa, in Massena, New York.\nIn a statement published online , the company said it will repurpose the 1,300-acre, 435-megawatt site into the biggest cryptocurrency mining plant in the world. The move, which was approved in February , will see the mining service invest up to $700 million and the creation of 150 jobs in the coming months.\nThe company remains unfazed by the slump in bitcoin prices, which has seen a drop of almost 50 percent this year, according to data from Coinmarketcap .\nIn correspondence with Bitcoin Magazine , Coinmint CTO Prieur Leary said, “Current bitcoin prices affect the value proposition. That being said, we are very comfortable with current metrics, given our technology and infrastructure.”\nCoinmint sees upstate New York as the perfect environment for them to set up shop. Operations have begun at the complex through Coinmint’s wholly owned subsidiary North Country Data Center Corporation, and the facility is expected to be at full capacity within 12 months.\nThe company believes this move will impact the crypto industry in a positive way. Leary went further by saying that “given the current concentration of digital currency data centers in Asia, launching the largest of such facilit[ies] in the U.S. makes a bold statement that the West is active within the industry and is a driver of growth and innovation within the space.”\nNew York is not known for being friendly to crypto companies or to miners, but as Steven O’Shaughnessy, Massena’s town supervisor, remarked in a local interview , “Our main marketing point is that we have cheap, reliable power.”\nMining is a power-hungry activity that has been getting a lot of attention lately.\nIn May, an expert panel met at a mining conference to discuss the implications of high energy consumption among miners worldwide, where they refuted the notion that energy devoted to proof-of-work operations is a wasteful by-product of cryptocurrency mining.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .

Sure they are all just bug-ridden trash, other than the outright scams. So why not make money off of that?\nGuido Vranken, a software security auditor (white-hat hacker) from the Netherlands, has earned a cool $120,000 in just one week of hunting for bugs on the EOS code. He reported 12 vulnerabilities, for $10,000 each. As the EOS ICO brought in a whopping $4 billion, and evidently no shortage of bugs, this seems like a great way to fatten your wallet if you are willing to do the work. You can find their bug bounty program policy here to see what they cover and what not. Thank you. A couple more waiting to be rewarded. I think the final tally was $120K but I lost count. Took me about a week.\n— Guido Vranken (@GuidoVranken) June 4, 2018 Ledger Wallet for Desktop Is Coming Soon Ledger, the producer of the popular hardware wallet Nano Ledger, has announced that the release date of the new version of the Ledger Wallet desktop edition is now scheduled for July 9 th , 2018. It will be available as native desktop application, supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux, so that users won’t require accessing the wallet via Google Chrome or Chromium anymore. Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes?\nBlock Broker is the latest ICO to fall off the map, deleting all its social media presence and leaving investors to wonder if it was all an exit scam from the start. What makes this case interesting is that it was meant to “completely eliminate ICO fraud by creating a 100% safe investment environment.” The project promised a decentralized ICO investment platform to “ensure that fraudulent ICOs don’t get an opportunity to tarnish the booming industry.” Of course if you are going to trust a “team of experienced professionals” to somehow safely handpick investments for you in a decentralized way, you better make sure they aren’t scamming you first. Strong Demand for Chinese Ghosts And speaking about dishonest ICOs, reports from China indicate that there is still high demand for ghostwriters to produce Chinese whitepapers, despite the ban on the practice in the country. In fact, there are also many people advertising their services as ICO writers in China, offering a whitepaper for an average of 15,000 yuan (about $2,350), according to Securities Daily .\n“One 20-page whitepaper in Chinese will cost 15,000 yuan, and the one that has 45 to 50 pages will cost 40,000 yuan,” one provider reportedly said. “An additional 7,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan will be charged for an English version. The service usually takes 7 to 10 days to complete,” the whitepaper provider added. Virtual Crypto Technologies’ New Two-Way ATM NetoBit ATM\nVirtual Crypto Technologies Ltd. (OTCQB: VRCP), an Israeli tech startup dedicated to making cryptocurrencies accessible to the public, announced that it will launch its bitcoin ATM at the Tech Crunch Tel Aviv event today. The Neto Bit ATM is a two-was machine that enables users to both buy and sell cryptocurrencies with fiat money.\nAlon Dayan, CEO of Virtual Crypto, commented: “We continue to set standards for the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. Our proprietary algorithm reduced the typical transaction time from [between 10 and 60 minutes] to [only] several seconds. At this stage, Neto Bit ATMs combine that speed with the convenience of an ATM, giving customers the ability to buy and sell bitcoin with fiat money. The result is a vastly improved trading experience for customers, which we believe will be attractive to our business partners as well as consumers.” Bitcoin Cash on Money Week\nDominic Frisby, Money Week’s commentator on gold and commodities, and the author of ‘Bitcoin: the Future of Money?’ has written in the UK magazine yesterday about his impression of meeting BCH developers when looking for sponsors for his financial game-show. “I was deeply impressed with the ambition of the enterprise. They are really pushing this thing. In the coming weeks there are big deals for payments with major international merchants to be announced. They are building an enormous and ambitious payment infrastructure across all six continents. Owning the coin is like owning shares in the network, a network which is rapidly growing and well marketed. They want bitcoin cash to be used as widely as possible as a means of payment: to make sure it is actually used.”\nAdvising his readers if they should get BTC or BCH, he added that: “Bitcoin cash is more volatile and the downside risk is greater, but if you ask me which of the two is more likely to go up ten times from current prices, I’d have to say bitcoin cash.”\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates?

Proposes New Protocols to Decentralize Bitcoin Mining » Into Crypto News - IntoCryptoNews.com", "text": "80 Copyright on text and image: CCN.com\nBitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo has published a draft of a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that aims to further decentralize bitcoin mining through the adoption of a new mining protocol.\nPublished by Corallo — perhaps better known by his social media handle TheBlueMatt — on his personal GitHub repository this week, the “ BetterHash Mining Protocol(s) ” seeks to address one of the many “pressures” in bitcoin mining that push the ecosystem toward centralization: Stratum , the most widely-used mining protocol.\nAs Corallo explains, deficiencies in the design of Stratum, combined with the fact that most bitcoin miners point their hashpower toward mining pools, limit the diversity of block templates used across the network. This, he claims, gives pool operators undue influence over network upgrades and reduces Bitcoin’s censorship resistance.\n“Difficult to implement and poorly documented, the design of the Stratum protocol requires pool operators to build and distribute block templates to their clients. Without a diverse body of miners constructing block templates, the network’s censorship resistance is jeopardized (e.g. pool operators may use their position of power to restrict the flow of protocol upgrades).”\nCorallo seeks to replace the Stratum protocol with a new system that divides block construction and payouts into two protocols — Work and Pool — collectively known as BetterHash. This will allow individual miners to select the transactions they include in blocks, rather than letting mining pool operators make that choice for them, while still benefiting from the stable payouts that connecting to a pool provides.\nAt present, miners who want to use their own block templates must either solo mine or connect to small decentralized mining pool p2pool, which increases their autonomy at the cost of being unable to receive stable payouts.\nUnder BetterHash, pool operators would not be able to use their position to tell miners whether to adopt particular network upgrades. Moreover, giving miners more control over block templates also helps mitigate the risk of a government ordering a locally-operated mining pool to censor particular types of transactions.\nNotably, BetterHash does not force miners to construct their own block templates if they do not want to, but it does give them the option to utilize the Work protocol to connect to another pool’s block template — even if they want to direct their hashpower somewhere else.\nIn addition to decreasing centralization within the bitcoin mining ecosystem, BetterHash also introduces some performance improvements over Stratum.

The two recorded an interview with CNBC yesterday in which they once again outlined their stance. Jamie Dimon on Bitcoin: “Just Beware” The two staunch Bitcoin critics appeared on CNBC’s ‘ Squawk Box .’ Naturally, being both united in their dismissal of cryptocurrency, it wasn’t long before the subject was raised. Despite having plenty to say about Bitcoin on several previous occasions, Dimon told the reporter: “I don’t want to be a Bitcoin spokesperson.” Fortunately, there is absolutely no risk of this being the case since the JPMorgan CEO represents exactly what many members of the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency community despise – centralised finance. Dimon then added a somewhat cryptic warning to those involved in the space: “Just beware.” Dimon famously enraged fans of digital currency last September when he senselessly referred to Bitcoin as a ‘fraud”. He has also stated that he would fire any of his employees that were found to be trading Bitcoin. It was later discovered that JPMorgan was one of the most active buyers of a Bitcoin tracker fund called Bitcoin XBT. He was subsequently accused of market abuse, as we reported last year. In January, Dimon said that he regretted saying what he had about Bitcoin because it was all that people wanted to talk to him about. Clearly, he’s ready to hear more about why the public think he’s entirely wrong about Bitcoin as he is once again openly discussing it. At one point during the interview recorded yesterday, the reporter put the question to her guests, “which of you hates Bitcoin more?” The reply from Warren Buffet was: “I set a high standard, I don’t know whether Jamie can top me.” Buffet is certainly more creative than Dimon when it comes to badmouthing Bitcoin. His famous outburst about the digital currency was to state that it was ‘probably rat poison squared.’ In response to this, a Bitcoin mining firm claimed to have installed a billboard across the road from Buffet’s offices. The message it conveyed was: “Warren: You said you were wrong about Google and Amazon. Maybe you’re wrong about Bitcoin?” The Berkshire Hathaway CEO also appeared on a CNBC segment last month. He was joined by fellow Bitcoin naysayers Charlie Munger and Bill Gates. During this interview the 87-year-old billionaire stated: “If people react when you criticise their investment, if they get mad, they’re gambling… If they really like what they own, what difference would it make? If I criticise their wife or something, they don’t get all upset about it [laughs].” Featured image from Shutterstock.\nFull details at www.newsbtc.com/2018/06/07/surprise-surprise-jamie-dimon-and-warren-buffet-still-dont-like-bitcoin/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "warren buffet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie dimon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T02:09:59.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "32b8a9c869d7ea9ae1047d3f91af77fa8a7cec39", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSmCL_6f2hFu2tP1ohupIVFqIbV_.4C7c8_Z8ePAeR291A._UcqKfolij6HW2XHzcYWVmiPpC6yrfBZl.J2OtQyDedgHb9wcfJdDZ5Tuf5ySRFpEzSFa7Lx4fnwuI02B9Sl6z5BbKMoYLEaGczSfK_X1LEj3eVWeBm21Lbk.dXDYvYK9xX5r8lU5b8beFN98XwRwA8FFxtqc_HNKYu8wt5t8fdjFlG3ChG3MBTXVRaNGDZWsvDuk.KJW9nbKr97L.prs8Fjoj.BbBGa5odfmT1lLMH6p3uK8pZbaKVe6pisNg--", "site_full": "www.cryptocoincache.com", "site": "cryptocoincache.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "New Bitcoin Spellings Cause Confusion: Биткоин, Биткойн, Біткоїн, Биткојн – CryptoCoin Cache", "title_full": "New Bitcoin Spellings Cause Confusion: Биткоин, Биткойн, Біткоїн, Биткојн – CryptoCoin Cache", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.cryptocoincache.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/13032-thumb.jpg?fit=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "32b8a9c869d7ea9ae1047d3f91af77fa8a7cec39", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSmCL_6f2hFu2tP1ohupIVFqIbV_.4C7c8_Z8ePAeR291A._UcqKfolij6HW2XHzcYWVmiPpC6yrfBZl.J2OtQyDedgHb9wcfJdDZ5Tuf5ySRFpEzSFa7Lx4fnwuI02B9Sl6z5BbKMoYLEaGczSfK_X1LEj3eVWeBm21Lbk.dXDYvYK9xX5r8lU5b8beFN98XwRwA8FFxtqc_HNKYu8wt5t8fdjFlG3ChG3MBTXVRaNGDZWsvDuk.KJW9nbKr97L.prs8Fjoj.BbBGa5odfmT1lLMH6p3uK8pZbaKVe6pisNg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "New Bitcoin Spellings Cause Confusion: Биткоин, Биткойн, Біткоїн, Биткојн – CryptoCoin Cache", "text": "by admin · June 7, 2018\nThe addition of “биткоин” (bitcoin) to the Russian spelling dictionary is “well grounded,” according to an important official from the Institute of Russian Language – another recognition of the cryptocurrency. Transliterating English words into a Slavic language written in Cyrillic, however, is not always a straightforward process. Two spelling forms have gained popularity in Russia, but which is the correct one? Other Slavic nations face a similar challenge. Besides, each one of them seems to have its own idea of how to write bitcoin with Cyrillic letters.\nAlso read: Russian Railways Eyes Crypto for Tickets, Blockchain for Cargo Биткоин, Биткойн, Біткоїн, Биткојн – Bitcoin\nTransliterating words from one language into another can sometimes spawn a number of spellings with none of the alternatives being a true original. This is often the case with borrowed terms describing new inventions that have to be written in a script different from the one they originated from. The word “bitcoin” is no exception – it is an invention, and it is a new term. Its introduction into Slavic languages using the Cyrillic alphabet has produced many spelling variations, with almost each nation “inventing” its own bitcoin, or биткойн I should say.\nBulgarians , who liked and adopted the Cyrillic script a millennium ago, have decided, unofficially, to spell bitcoin the way it is pronounced in English and in their Slavic language – “биткойн.” Their closest linguistic relative, the Macedonians, write it “биткоин,” true to their commitment to be different. The short unstressed i-vowel “й” (as in /aɪ/ or /kɔɪn/) is missing from their version of the Cyrillic alphabet. No worries, we can still read it.\nUkrainians , who probably have more “i”-s than just about any other Slavs (и, й, і, ї,) have chosen to use two or three of those in their spellings of bitcoin – “бiткойн” and “біткоїн.” That adds a little Latin flavor, although truth be told, the “dotted i” was indeed part of the early Cyrillic alphabets and they have kept it to this day. Belarusians also write it “біткойн.” Serbs, who use a Latin script alongside the Cyrillic, spell it “биткојн” in. Gosh, now there is a “j” in it… Bitcoin Making its Way into the Russian Spelling Dictionary\nRussia , by far the largest Slavic country and most famous user of the Cyrillic script, has a dilemma. Both “биткоин” and “биткойн” are used to refer to the cryptocurrency in Russian media and by the local crypto community, although “биткоин” is more popular. The question about the correct spelling has sparked multiple discussions in Russian crypto forums. The rule applied to other English loanwords says bitcoin in Russian should be spelled with the short “й” in the second syllable. But as it often happens with living languages, people prefer the incorrect “и” version.\nA high-ranking representative of the Institute of Russian Language, under the Russian Academy of Science, has recently spoken in favor of adding “биткоин” to the Russian Orthographic (spelling) Dictionary, local media reported. “The question of including the word “биткоин” in the dictionary seems to me well-grounded,” Oksana Grunchenko, senior researcher and head of the referral service at the Institute, told the Moscow News Agency .\nGrunchenko expressed regret that bitcoin didn’t make it into the Russian Explanatory Dictionary. Its “Б” (B) volume went out without it. “But since the word “биткоин”, or “биткойн”, represents a spelling challenge too, I think it will find its place on the pages of the orthographic dictionary,” she added indicating that both spellings may be accepted. “If both are included, we can talk about variability of the norm,” she explained, noting that there are other examples of that in Russian.\nI don’t want to say that but maybe we, the Slavs writing in Cyrillic, do need some central authority to sort things out… Although, that has never really worked well here. Besides, it’s not just bitcoin – I am pretty sure we have the same issue when spelling “core” and “cash.”\nDo you think adding bitcoin to a dictionary is a recognition of its importance?

Raj Kundra’s name cropped up after Amit Bharadwaj‘s interrogation. Amit was arrested on the 5th of April this year.\nKundra -- the husband of Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty -- had appeared before the ED office in Mumbai on Tuesday. According to some media reports (not by IANS), he was reportedly grilled for several hours by the ED investigators.\nbccl \"I was summoned by the ED merely as a witness. An enquiry is underway by the concerned regulatory authorities and I stand committed to extend all my cooperation to the law enforcement agency,\" Kundra said, clearing the air on the issue in a statement.\nA businessman with interest in sports, this is not Kundra's first brush with law. In the past, he had appeared before different authorities on his investments in the Rajasthan Royals IPL team. Some members of that team were also embroiled in the cricket spot-fixing scandal.\nreuters Don't Miss After Arbaaz Khan Confesses To IPL Betting, Two More Bollywood Producers Have Been Named In... 10.3 K SHARES In his statement here vis-A-vis the media speculation of his grilling, Kundra said, \"I am terribly disappointed by the irresponsible reporting carried out by some sections of the media. Clarity on the issue should have been sought before carrying such headlines.\"\n\"The authorities, summoned me merely as a witness, as the accused Amit Bharadwaj happens to be an acquaintance and some introductions were made hence there is a certain protocol being followed by the agencies,\" said Kundra. He added that Bharadwaj was intending to buy a team in his Poker League and had entered into a contract with them for the same.\n\"However, he was expelled on account of non-payment of fees and I was called as a witness in this connection. While we continuously strive to keep taking steps to improve our reputation, these type of unconfirmed, baseless, reports severely dent our market perception and erode investor sentiments,\" he said.\nafp \"Notwithstanding what has happened, at Viaan Industries, we shall continue to focus on growing our gaming and media vertical. We remain excited about the company's future and strive to keep adding shareholder value,\" he said.\nIt may be recalled, the ED, sometime back, had registered a criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against a bitcoin-based investment website GainBitcoin, its founder Amit Bhardwaj and eight others.\nThe ED had alleged that about 8,000 investors lost around Rs 2,000 crore funds by transacting in this scheme.

Despite their centralized nature, consumers and speculators rely heavily on these platforms on a daily basis. For Bitfinex users, there was a slight scare on Tuesday when trading was halted for a short while. Another Issue for Bitfinex\nAlthough cryptocurrency exchanges have seen their fair share of issues throughout the years, it seems some problems will persist. In the case of the Bitfinex trading platform, its popularity is also the root cause for some of the problems the company has had to deal with. Addressing these issues will not be easy by any means.\nOn Tuesday, the company was forced to suspend all trading activity for a while. As one would expect, this decision sparked a lot of debate and confusion regarding what was going on exactly. In most cases, such developments mean the trading platform in question has run into major issues of some kind.\nThankfully, it seems this particular incident was not linked to a hack or other mishap affecting the company. Instead, its servers were the target of another DDoS attack. Anyone who has kept close tabs on the cryptocurrency industry will know how common DDoS attacks are, especially when it comes to specific exchanges. Bitfinex is currently under extreme load. We are investigating the issue and will keep you all up to date as we learn more.\n— Bitfinex (@bitfinex) June 5, 2018\nOne of the Bitfinex infrastructure service providers had to deal with a denial of service attack, but it seems the issue was resolved fairly quickly. The attacker’s identity remains unknown at this time, and it’s also unclear why this provider was attacked in the first place. While trading on Bitfinex was suspended, the Bitcoin price fell by slightly over 2%, further confirming the feeble state of this market today.\nIt is important to note that this DDoS attack did not disrupt Bitfinex accounts or user balances whatsoever. It only impacted the trading operations themselves, which is why the company was forced to suspend all trading for a brief while. Thankfully, it seems all users can now trade on Bitfinex once again without any major problems, although this may not necessarily be the last DDoS attack against a cryptocurrency firm, either directly or indirectly.\nIt will be interesting to see how Bitfinex and its service providers address issues like these moving forward. Centralized exchanges will always remain a critical problem in this industry until decentralized cryptocurrency trading becomes the new normal. Until then, cryptocurrency trading platforms will need to beef up their DDoS protection, among other things.

Cue-in Mia Aesthetics and Dr. Sergio Alvarez out of Miami, Florida. Dr. Alvarez’s practice is the first in Florida (and one of the first across the United States) to start accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment for various procedures, and his clients (both celebrity and local/international patients) love the idea and travel to his offices because of this “additional payment method”. We sat down with Dr. Alvarez for an exclusive Q&A to learn more about his passion for helping people feel their best, and why patients using Bitcoin has been worth it for them and their cosmetic procedures… What were your original motivations for getting into the medical field? After seeing my first open heart surgery at the age of 10, I knew then that there was nothing else I wanted to do than to be a surgeon. The ability to know what I wanted in a career at such a young age gave me the ability to focus and achieve my goals by the age of 32. Plastic surgery got my attention during medical school due to the fact that it was not only the most competitive specialty to get into and the surgeons training me were revered as “the best”, but it was the ability to work on every part of the body and really focus on the “art form” that captured me. It was the finesse that it required that captivated me. How long have you been practicing and in what specific areas of concentration? I have been working for 9 years, concentrating on cosmetic plastic surgery. Are most of your patients local to Miami, or are there many who travel from out of town seeking your services? Approximately 90 percent of patients travel from out of town. This ranges from the west to east coast but we also have international patients from Europe, Asia, and South America. What constitutes the “perfect patient”? I’m not sure there is a “perfect patient”, but the best patients are those interested in feeling better about their bodies, how they feel in their clothing, and how they express themselves with their new self-confidence What is the best advice you have been given in your journey to being a successful board-certified doctor? I think the best advice I got was from my father: “Do what you love and be the best you can be!” When did you first become aware of cryptocurrency? I was introduced to the cryptocurrency market by my anesthesia provider about 1 year ago. He became fascinated with its potential and it was something we spoke about during surgery day in and day out. When did you start accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment for the medical services you provide? We started offering Bitcoin as a payment option about 6 months ago. We have started to definitely get a lot of interest in this form of payment. I think people in this industry are seeing the potential of investing not only in this form of currency but as a way to use it to make their cosmetic procedures cheaper as Bitcoin continues to appreciate. How does it feel to be one of the first practices in Florida to do so? We are always seeking to be ahead of the curve so it’s always interesting to see the growth in all aspects of our business. It’s definitely a good feeling to be at the forefront of not only our industry but to expand our footprint into other industries. How has the response been since first allowing this form of currency? We continue to get a lot of inquiries about this method of payment and are sure to continue to grow this aspect of the business. What main services of yours do people usually use Bitcoin as a form of payment for? Most people use Bitcoin for surgical services but before long we will see people using it for accessories and ancillary services. Do you feel in the future more medical practices will start accepting it? I think this is the future and before long it will be the norm for most practices and industries. Outside of work, do you trade cryptocurrency personally and follow it? I do. Since I got into it I started trading different currencies and now I’m always looking for opportunities in ICO’s. And finally, are there any plans to start accepting other forms of cryptocurrency? Eventually yes. As the market becomes more accepting we hope to widen the coins accepted.

The New York-based ETF issuer said it's partnering with fintech company SolidX to launch physically-backed bitcoin ETF.\nThe ETF will be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (40-Act). VanEck was the first ETF issuer to file for a 40-Act bitcoin fund, having done so last August.\nPrevious efforts at bitcoin ETFs have been met with resistance by U.S. regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission. It has been several years since the Winklevoss brothers filed for the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, but that fund has yet to come to market.\nBitcoin futures debuted on the CBOE in December and CME Group launched bitcoin futures later that month, moves some industry observers believed would facilitate the debuts of bitcoin ETFs. Soon after bitcoin futures debuted in the U.S., however, the SEC requested several ETF issuers, including VanEck, to withdraw plans for related ETFs.\nThe VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust will attempt to address one of the issues concerning regulators: the theft of bitcoin. VanEck said the fund will be insured to guard against theft. SolidX will be the fund sponsor while VanEck will provide marketing services.\nAssuming the ETF comes to market, it will debut with a $200,000 share price, meaning it will be focused on institutional investors. Bitcoin traded around $7,650 in U.S. trading Wednesday. A share price of $200,000 would put the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust in rarefied company as just four stocks in the S&P 500 have share prices north of $1,000.\nShares of the trust will only be issued in one or more blocks of five shares, according to a filing with the SEC.\n“VanEck has also, through its MVIS subsidiary, created several comprehensive digital asset indices designed to provide a measurement of both individual digital assets and various baskets of digital asset exposures,” according to a statement.\nVanEck and SolidX plan to work with regulators to get the new fund approved. If the fund comes to market, it will trade on CBOE under the ticker “XBTC.”\nSolidX has been involved with the cryptocurrency space since 2011 and has been trying to launch a bitcoin ETF since 2015. The New York-based company “develops cryptography products and services with a focus on software applications and capital market,” according to the statement.\nRelated Links:\nBig Internet Names In A New ETF\nYoung ETFs Rise To The Occasion\n© 2018 Benzinga.com.

The campaign will comprise a minivan boldly donning the bitcoin logo embarking on a road trip across Argentina and Latin America with the goal of spreading knowledge and fostering bitcoin adoption. Latin American NGOs Team Up to Launch Bitcoin Awareness Campaign\nNon-government organizations Bitcoin Argentina and Bitcoin Americana have begun ‘ Bitcoineta ‘ – a minivan tour across Argentina designed to bolster bitcoin awareness and adoption.\nThe tour will see the van visit numerous Argentine villages and small cities, with the tour seeking to emphasize the use-cases for bitcoin at a grassroots level. After traveling across Argentina, Bitcoineta then hopes to embark on an awareness campaign across Latin America.\nThe project seeks to target disparate social demographics that can benefit from greater cryptocurrency adoption. Gabriel Kurman, one of the founders of the Bitcoineta project, stated, “It’s a dream to bring bitcoin and blockchain technology to Latin America to those people who do not have access to knowledge. The [goal] of ​​Bitcoineta is to reach every small town and city in Argentina, and then the rest of America, teaching people how they can benefit from this technology.”\nThe two organizations purchased the minivan together, and equipped the vehicle with necessary amenities, and installed a projector that will be used to screen educational films. Sowing the Seeds of Bitcoin Adoption\nThe Bitcoineta van began its journey on June 1st. The first destination for the campaign is Chascomús, a small city located 123 kilometers (approximately 76.4 miles) south of Argentina’s capital of Buenos Aires. After Chascomús, Bitcoineta is then scheduled to visit Las Toninas, Tandil, Necochea, Tres Arrollos, Villa Ventana, Bahía Blanca, Pergamino, Junín, Chacabuco and Chivilcoy in Buenos Aires, and various destinations in the provinces of La Pampa, Santa Fe, and Córdoba.\nJulian Drangosch, a university professor from the National Technological University of Argentina, offered praise to the Bitcoineta project, stating, “The first times you hear about these technologies, it is difficult to understand all the implications that you have today and in the future, and to start sowing this blockchain seed in the different communities will allow us to collect the fruits in a few years.”\nDo you think that bitcoin will see widespread adoption across Latin America in coming years?

Transliterating English words into a Slavic language written in Cyrillic, however, is not always a straightforward process. Two spelling forms have gained popularity in Russia, but which is the correct one? Other Slavic nations face a similar challenge. Besides, each one of them seems to have its own idea of how to write bitcoin with Cyrillic letters.\nAlso read: Russian Railways Eyes Crypto for Tickets, Blockchain for Cargo Биткоин, Биткойн, Біткоїн, Биткојн – Bitcoin\nTransliterating words from one language into another can sometimes spawn a number of spellings with none of the alternatives being a true original. This is often the case with borrowed terms describing new inventions that have to be written in a script different from the one they originated from. The word “bitcoin” is no exception – it is an invention, and it is a new term. Its introduction into Slavic languages using the Cyrillic alphabet has produced many spelling variations, with almost each nation “inventing” its own bitcoin, or биткойн I should say.\nBulgarians , who liked and adopted the Cyrillic script a millennium ago, have decided, unofficially, to spell bitcoin the way it is pronounced in English and in their Slavic language – “биткойн.” Their closest linguistic relative, the Macedonians, write it “биткоин,” true to their commitment to be different. The short unstressed i-vowel “й” (as in /aɪ/ or /kɔɪn/) is missing from their version of the Cyrillic alphabet. No worries, we can still read it.\nUkrainians , who probably have more “i”-s than just about any other Slavs (и, й, і, ї,) have chosen to use two or three of those in their spellings of bitcoin – “бiткойн” and “біткоїн.” That adds a little Latin flavor, although truth be told, the “dotted i” was indeed part of the early Cyrillic alphabets and they have kept it to this day. Belarusians also write it “біткойн.” Serbs, who use a Latin script alongside the Cyrillic, spell it “биткојн” in. Gosh, now there is a “j” in it… Bitcoin Making its Way into the Russian Spelling Dictionary\nRussia , by far the largest Slavic country and most famous user of the Cyrillic script, has a dilemma. Both “биткоин” and “биткойн” are used to refer to the cryptocurrency in Russian media and by the local crypto community, although “биткоин” is more popular. The question about the correct spelling has sparked multiple discussions in Russian crypto forums. The rule applied to other English loanwords says bitcoin in Russian should be spelled with the short “й” in the second syllable. But as it often happens with living languages, people prefer the incorrect “и” version.\nA high-ranking representative of the Institute of Russian Language, under the Russian Academy of Science, has recently spoken in favor of adding “биткоин” to the Russian Orthographic (spelling) Dictionary, local media reported. “The question of including the word “биткоин” in the dictionary seems to me well-grounded,” Oksana Grunchenko, senior researcher and head of the referral service at the Institute, told the Moscow News Agency .\nGrunchenko expressed regret that bitcoin didn’t make it into the Russian Explanatory Dictionary. Its “Б” (B) volume went out without it. “But since the word “биткоин”, or “биткойн”, represents a spelling challenge too, I think it will find its place on the pages of the orthographic dictionary,” she added indicating that both spellings may be accepted. “If both are included, we can talk about variability of the norm,” she explained, noting that there are other examples of that in Russian.\nI don’t want to say that but maybe we, the Slavs writing in Cyrillic, do need some central authority to sort things out… Although, that has never really worked well here. Besides, it’s not just bitcoin – I am pretty sure we have the same issue when spelling “core” and “cash.”\nDo you think adding bitcoin to a dictionary is a recognition of its importance?

Betting Bitcoin - The definitive Bitcoin Betting guide", "text": "0 Using hardware to help your GDPR password compliance\nGDPR compliance is a huge area for many businesses. Especially those firms who hold sensitive data and have a number of remote staff. Many small businesses fall down in simple areas of IT security as they don’t have the resources to cope with the latest cyber threats. Staff are vulnerable to phishing attacks, social engineering or malware such as keyloggers.\nA member of staff may not even have realised they’ve been hacked, and their password usually becomes the focal point of any data breach. In small businesses it’s unlikely that data is segregated on a permissions basis and that may mean that they entire scope of the companies data is vulnerable to a breach.\nIn order to prevent these attacks many small businesses are taking a more stringent approach to data protection and passwords have been identified as a high risk area . Many businesses have been implementing new password structures with greater strength to brute-force attacks or phishing. These are generally complicated alphanumeric passwords which are case sensitive often including special characters. Changes like this can often leave staff annoyed and confused, especially when using characters such as the “top hat” ^ .\nA robust measure would also reset the passwords regularly with a 3 month period not uncommon. Such changes may also be met with resistance and it would not be uncommon to see staff writing these down on pen and paper and sticking them by their machine. Such actions clearly make the data protection worse not better! A potential solution?\nAs we access the majority of our data through a web browser and many other businesses will do so where they operate a remote desktop environment, password managers have been a solution. Services such as lastpass have been used extensively but they offer a significant single point of failure, the master password. This may eliminate the need for remembering multiple complex passwords, but the onus is still on the user to remember and regularly update this master.\nAll online passwords are vulnerable to hacking, but hardware wallets are not. Originally designed to store cryptocurrency, the Trezor device was built and designed to ‘be your own bank’. That level of security is now used to protect passwords and could be the ultimate way to manage your password security, whilst removing the burdensome memory exercises. How does it work?\nWhen you setup your wallet you are given a secure 24 character seed word and create a pin number. Once your wallet is created it’s time to configure your password manager . This links your Trezor to a dropbox or google drive account, this is where your Trezor will store your encrypted passwords. The level of encryption means that even if someone else gains access to that data, it is completely useless to them. Secure.\nYou will create and store your passwords as required and from the password manager screen you can login to any services you require. In order to access the password manager you must have your Trezor plugged in & have entered your pincode. A manual button push is then required when logging into the service, the hardware device confirming that you are happy to decrypt that part of the data.\nYour Trezor acts as a manual key to your online world and it will only work if you they know the pin code. It’s a fantastic, easy piece of security. What if I lose my Trezor?\nRemember the 24 character word we mentioned at the start? You store this offline and usually use something robust to protect this data such as a Billfodl . This is your recover method and with that data you can recreate the account on any other Trezor.\nThis physical aspect of a digital world removes a great deal of risk & offers a great deal of protection, especially when the fines for a data breach are so punitive. As the devices can be reconfigured and transferred to new members of staff the costs of setting up and maintaining this security program are miniscule, with the hardware (including the backup solution) costing less than £200 per person.

Wu told the publication that the company raised $2.5 billion in revenue last year, a figure somewhat lower than estimates from industry analysts but nevertheless quite impressive.\nAccording to other estimates, Bitmain controls as much as 80 percent of the manufacturing market for application-specific integrated circuit ( ASIC ) mining devices, which — once developed for a specific mining algorithm — quickly replace miners powered by general-purpose GPU chips.\nCanaan Creative, whose devices account for roughly 15 percent of the ASIC market, recently filed for a Hong Kong IPO that is expected to raise $1 billion.\nWu has said that he believes Bitmain is worth $12 billion, while other estimates have put the company’s valuation closer to $8.8 billion. Bitmain brought in 12 times as much revenue as Canaan during 2017, which — depending on the success of Canaan’s offering — could lend credence to Wu’s valuation.\nNo matter the precise figure, however, Bitmain is undoubtedly one of the most valuable companies in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and the dearth of public cryptocurrency companies could lead investors to pay a premium for its shares.\nHowever, as CCN reported , Bitmain has gradually been expanding its product line beyond mining, even as it seeks to take this part of its business global.\nTo wit, the company is leveraging its expertise in ASIC development to carve out market share in China’s artificial intelligence (AI) industry — where the government favors domestic projects and has effectively blackballed Western giant Google.\nBitmain’s burgeoning AI business is more than just a hedge against a decline in the cryptocurrency market. It is also, unlike mining, an industry with explicit government approval.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jihan wu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "asic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T19:57:03.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "736bb1039f2dfc9e4918f85566425cc7cec3adec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwHmDOGL26Bf67FS53j93lU-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin wallet.dat", "title_full": "Bitcoin wallet.dat", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.05, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "736bb1039f2dfc9e4918f85566425cc7cec3adec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwHmDOGL26Bf67FS53j93lU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin wallet.dat", "text": ".-----------------.-\nSelling blockchain account with 50 bitcoins (or just private key from this wallet).\nScreen: https://gyazo.com/bd8fe40e8a82e5376cbe75c3db11965a\nEmail me with your offer nxnteam@gmx.com\n.-----------------.-", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T12:58:27.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ed21297f51129c5b30d38206f60b46c67104c618", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwqkVoqvgE1gYQtwKYqHc3A-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Get free bitcoins from my refer", "title_full": "Get free bitcoins from my refer", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ed21297f51129c5b30d38206f60b46c67104c618", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwqkVoqvgE1gYQtwKYqHc3A-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Get free bitcoins from my refer", "text": "https://www.startminer.com/1917150", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T13:19:11.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "112684d589caa83427fe9baf5f075c10fa1d1905", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS5apxHUWCU0TptIIfSJ5ahc-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "112684d589caa83427fe9baf5f075c10fa1d1905", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS5apxHUWCU0TptIIfSJ5ahc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInvest your time and effort inviting new users and you will guarantee a high passive income for yourself for a long time.

Ripple price is gaining bullish momentum and it may well test USD 0.70. Aeternity, Siacoin and Skycoin are up more than 8% today with positive signs.\nBitcoin price formed a decent support base around USD 7,500 and started an upward move. It broke a major hurdle near USD 7,650 to place itself in a bullish zone. Similarly, major altcoins gained traction and are currently slowly moving higher. It seems like the crypto market is setting up for more gains in the near term considering the current sentiment remains intact.\nBitcoin Bitcoin price traded higher and cleared a couple of important resistances such as USD 7,650 and USD 7,700. BTC/USD traded close to the USD 7,800 level before retreating to USD 7,710. On the downside, supports are seen near USD 7,650 and USD 7,600, followed by the all-important USD 7,500. On the upside, the USD 7,750 and USD 7,780 levels are short-term resistances. A push above this last could clear the path for an upside acceleration above the USD 7,800 level to test the USD 8,000 barrier.\nEthereum Ethereum remained stable above the USD 600 handle with positive signs. It seems like ETH/USD is currently consolidating above USD 600 (GMT 9:00 AM) and is preparing for the next major break. Should the price settle above USD 620, there could be a test of the USD 650 resistance. On the flip side, a downside break below USD 600 may perhaps call for a larger bearish correction toward the USD 570 level.\nBitcoin Cash and Ripple Bitcoin cash price is slowly grinding higher and is currently up more than 1% to USD 1,150. BCH/USD is likely to continue higher towards the USD 1,180 and USD 1,200 resistance levels. On the downside, supports are seen near the USD 1,120 and USD 1,100 levels. Ripple price is performing really well, and it might soon test the USD 0.70 resistance. A break above the stated resistance will most likely set the pace for a test of the USD 0.75 barrier. Supports on the downside are at USD 0.665 and 0.650.\nOther Altcoins Market Today Most small cap coins are in the green zone today, including Aeternity, Siacoin, Skycoin, NEM, Nano, WTC, ZIL and Augur. The current market sentiment is very positive and if bitcoin price continues to stay above the USD 7,500 pivot level, there could be upsides in the near term.

Market visualization from Coin360\nBitcoin (BTC) is comfortably holding above the $7,600 threshold and inching to a new price point of $7,700, trading at around $7,690 at press time. The leading cryptocurrency, up almost 2.3 percent over a 24-hour period, saw an intra-weekly low just above $7,400, but has since stemmed its losses.\nYesterday’s official clarification from the chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) that Bitcoin is categorically not considered to be a security under U.S. law may have gone some way to bolster market confidence.\nBitcoin’s regulatory status is evidently more clear-cut than major altcoins Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), both of whose representatives have emphatically rejected security classifications, although their regulatory status in the eyes of the SEC remains unclear . Bitcoin price chart from Cointelegraph’s Bitcoin Price Index Leading altcoin Ethereum (ETH) has seen a slightly lower gains of just over 1.3 percent on the day, trading around $606 to press time. Having recovered from its low of $571 earlier this week, the coin has for now reclaimed its ground above the psychological price point of $600. Ethereum price chart from Cointelegraph’s Ethereum Price Index Most of the top ten coins by market capitalization are showing minor fluctuations of within a 2-3 percent range over a 24-hour, as data from CoinMarketCap shows. Of the top ten coins, only Cardano (ADA) is in the red, down less than 1 percent, trading at about $0.21 to press time. Altcoin EOS is seeing the most growth of the top ten coins over the past 24 hours, up over 4.5 percent on the day, trading at $14.20 a coin at press time. EOS is currently ranked in fifth place on CoinMarketCap, with a market capitalization of over $12.7 bln. Yesterday, stock analytics firm Trefis announced they have lowered their Bitcoin year-end price forecast from $15,000 to $12,500, according to their analysis of fundamentals of supply and demand in BTC markets. Trefis pointed to significant recent losses in total BTC transaction volumes across crypto exchanges, and attributed a surplus in supply and subsequent drop in price to Mt. Gox dumping BTC onto exchanges earlier this spring. As of press time, CoinMarketCap data indicates BTC trade volumes of 4.69 bln, down from 7.41 bln one month ago. While markets remain sluggish, institutional actors are making significant headway with their foray into the crypto sphere. Yesterday, one of the largest financial firms in the world, Susquehanna International Group, revealed it would be opening cryptocurrency trading to its clients, initially in the form of Bitcoin futures. The week has also seen news of significant advances among major crypto industry players to bring their operations under the purview of financial regulators. Yesterday, peer-to-peer payments platform Circle Internet Financial Ltd., revealed it is pursuing both a federal banking license and registration as a brokerage and trading venue with the SEC. The news followed hot on the heels of leading U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase initiating its own process to become a fully SEC-regulated broker dealer, through its acquisition of three financial firms.\nOverall market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is $346 bln to press time, up about $10 bln on the week.\nPublished at Thu, 07 Jun 2018 17:18:40 +0000\nBitcoin ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cointelegraph", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T03:48:31.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eda30b521b7f65ac50df42ce5f469acbd8f934cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RkeXyWwa2NebdwDnoZzVQqJ0.3yf89hQgUUzWcQ5oaoM0j_1sW7Qzeq1lYrzP1FXemYbsmu26RM5UkUIs2NwaziQJNCCe0F_1MZ7ynJ8k6cVJDs9khY80OA.e4GJEK863vZ9rL6p6n.JJc4K5bdwZtuAguEi43lSvVVCnlytUT_PcU94g_WMP5JdCuKUNOi9v0Y3zXU1UiGkfy_AR1nhgxXg7xbD9K1YThl3eobOYyYr_VeAQ1IC7dJIFLiS5BvzHSQsVxGDgoYJ2aAE5TKIvlyOIJmhMBe0I70lwnkAqWVem4xwQYPmt4QbaWbp5ZnWj06xV30yNpqpSUiSghn1eIS9PGjBHPr0AeTOp.5O8qF9Rzg96Akk9aI-", "site_full": "www.marketwatch.com", "site": "marketwatch.com", "site_section": "http://www.marketwatch.com/rss/financial", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "MarketWatch.com - Financial Services Industry News", "title": "Bitcoin has gone 173 days without hitting an all-time high — its longest stretch in about 2 years", "title_full": "Bitcoin has gone 173 days without hitting an all-time high — its longest stretch in about 2 years - MarketWatch", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GA689_bitcoi_ZG_20171222064610.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 900, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "28926d58dcbaaa4f4e4a388af6b5b3cde45941e7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RkeXyWwa2NebdwDnoZzVQqJ0.3yf89hQgUUzWcQ5oaoM0j_1sW7Qzeq1lYrzP1FXemYbsmu26RM5UkUIs2NwaziQJNCCe0F_1MZ7ynJ8k6cVJDs9khY80OA.e4GJEK863vZ9rL6p6n.JJc4K5bdwZtsfMOikPorwdQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mark DeCambre", "published": "2018-06-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin has gone 173 days without hitting an all-time high — its longest stretch in about 2 years", "text": "Bitcoin prices rose Thursday, but the cryptocurrency hung below $8,000, highlighting a fallow period for the asset that has traversed its longest stretch without marking a fresh record in two years.\nAccording to Charlie Bilello, director of research at Pension Partners, 173 days have passed without bitcoin reaching an all-time high , which it last accomplished in mid-December. Since then it has tumbled by about 60%. As the chart below indicates, that marks the longest stretch without a fresh record since the 1,176-day period that ended in the late summer of 2016.\nStill, some market participants have taken heart in increased regulation and institutional interest in the nascent digital-asset market, with Coinbase on Wednesday announcing its plans to purchase securities dealer Keystone Capital , a move that would place the cryptotrading platform under more direct oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a broker-dealer.\nIn the spot market, a single bitcoin BTCUSD, -0.27% was trading higher at $7,651.98, up about 1.7%, compared with Wednesday’s closing level on the Kraken platform as of 5 p.m. Eastern.\nMeanwhile, Jan van Eck, CEO of investment firm VanEck, discussed on CNBC the company’s plans to join with SolidX in a third attempt to launch the first bitcoin-focused exchange-traded fund.\nVan Eck explained that the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust would be set up to own physical bitcoins rather than being pegged to the futures markets as an earlier version was.

While that’s true, there is also a deeper meaning behind everything. For now, all you have to know is that a new religion is forming in America and it runs on Bitcoin. THE DONALD GLOVER RELIGION TAKES SHAPE: BITCOIN BACKS IT\nIf you’ve somehow escaped the clutches of Donald Glover’s “ This is America ” video, then consider yourself lucky. Since releasing just a few short weeks ago, the video took off in ways no one thought was possible. Is the song itself really that good? Sure. It’s a decent song but it’s not the song people are so crazy about. It’s a new religion that Glover created. Hidden in the video are dozens of messages, all telling a different story about America. In many ways, it’s creating a new philosophy. A new way to interpret this very life around us. So where does bitcoin fall into this? THE DONALD GLOVER RELIGION FUNDED BY BITCOIN\nAmerican history has never seen something like this Donald Glover video. It’s caused such an uproar. Moreso than any religions these days. So, in theory, Glover really could create a new religion with this following. Seeing as all of his followers are the millennial type. Internet savvy people. Hence, Bitcoin would be the perfect medium in which to fund his church. Yes, this is just a crazy idea for now but it’s a possible future. THE FUTURE OF DONALD GLOVER RELIGION AND BITCOIN\nJust think about it. Celebrities are already treated like gods. They already have a following of people that would do what they say. In the future, every celebrity can tokenize themselves, and sell their tokens to fans. Fans could then exchange these coins on decentralized exchanges like Kelvin . The more popularity a celebrity is, the more powerful their token becomes. Celebrities will compete for wealth, power and popularity. Religion won’t even exist anymore. That is the future.

Brad also says that Ripple is focused on solving cross-border payment problems making it massively efficient for corporates to use XRP as a part of that flow.\nBrad continues to say that the Ripple has signed up with around 100 banks which uses xCurrent. He says:\n“The first problem Ripple focused on is engaging with banks to solve the real world problems for them, so we have been successful in signing up over 100 banks using a product called xCurrent, and xCurrent allows 2 banks to settle in fiat and basically in real time.”\nHe further adds:\n“Today that takes days and is very expensive and has very high air rate, as high as six percent. So that works when there are two banks working together already have fiat, if we wanted to go to the third bank where we don’t have liquidity or where we don’t have pre-funded account, thats what product like xRapid comes into play. xRapid uses XRP to fund real time liquidity so no longer do I have to prefund.”\nHe even says that there are around trillions of dollars parked around the world which is pre-funded between banks and corporates. By making those trillions of dollars efficient, Ripple will be making the entire global financial ecosystem more efficient.\nWhen asked about when XRP will begin to be more useful towards institutions, Brad replies that Ripple launched xRapid as a beta product in late Q3 and early Q4 last year and launched their first customer on xRapid in late Q4 which continued by six more customers in Q1 this year.\nThe customers include big names such as Western Union, Money Gram, and Mercury FX which move a lot of money. Ripple has found that xRapid is saving the customers 40-70 percent compared to the existing tool from managing and spreading the liquidity around.\nThe CEO of Ripple says:\n“So xRapid is doing exactly like we have thought, we expect to go into production without product at beta production at very very shortly, we have continue to move from a beta product to a production product to see more more banks, more more other financial institutions to get onboard and XRP will be used to facilitate this process.” .

The bitcoin ‘whale’ – as the cryptocurrency community calls investors with enough of an asset to make a big splash in moving market prices – has been slowly and steadily accumulating the leading cryptocurrency by market cap since March 25, 2018. In total, 93,947 BTC have been transferred to the whale’s wallet, or roughly $722.5 million dollars at bitcoin’s current price at the time of this writing. The wallet address 1KAt6STtisWMMVo5XGdos9P7DBNNsFfjx7 currently has 85,947 BTC, or nearly $661 million, indicating an 8,000 BTC sale or trade has occurred. The China-based, award-winning blockchain media firm BABI Finance has been following the whale’s movements for some time. BABI notes that the account in question has mostly been buying bitcoin when the price falls, but rarely sells. BABI followed 20,000 of the bitcoins back to their sources: popular Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges Huobi and Haobtc. Another 67,000 BABI says are from “wholesale transfer[s] of fourteen ‘single accounts.’” BABI also notes that some of the ‘single accounts’ can also be traced back to Huobi and Haobtc. The remaining 7,800 bitcoins are “small transfers” from “multiple accounts.” BABI concludes that the whale is likely “a long-term investment institution”, while other speculation points to a potential exchange setting up a cold wallet . Due to bitcoin’s pseudo-anonymous design, tracing the bitcoins back to the investor has proven too difficult for BABI. BABI claims “an unnamed people ( sic ) in wholesale digital currency industry” states that its a large agent in Dubai buying the bitcoin for an unknown client. What is known, though, is that this client – or Chinese bitcoin whale – now owns the sixth largest stack of BTC, with the top five wallets belonging to top cryptocurrency exchanges Bitfinex, Binance , Bittrex, Huobi, and Bitstamp, respectively.

The popular alt coin now has a market capitalisation of US$26.1 billion.\nThe Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price has dropped almost 3.5% over the last 24 hours to US$1,110.25 per token, reducing the Bitcoin offshoot’s market capitalisation down to under US$19.1 billion.\nThe EOS (EOS) price has been the worst performer amongst the major coins and is down 4% over the period to US$13.53. This leaves EOS with a market capitalisation of US$12.1 billion.\nOutside the top five it has been a similar story over the last 24 hours. Litecoin (LTC) is down 1.8%, Cardano (ADA) is off 3.9%, Stellar (XLM) has fallen 0.8%, IOTA (MIOTA) has plunged 5.5%, and TRON (TRX) is 2.9% lower.\nWhy are the cryptocurrencies sinking lower again?\nRecent reports of lower levels of Google searches for cryptocurrencies and a significant slowdown in Bitcoin wallet growth has been weighing heavily on sentiment this week.\nIn addition to this, a criminal probe into the price manipulation of cryptocurrencies in the United States hasn’t helped matters and is likely to put off would-be traders from entering the market and supporting prices.\nIn light of this, I see little reason to believe that the market is going to go meaningfully higher in the near-term. It may therefore be prudent to stay well clear of cryptocurrencies for the time being and focus on other investment opportunities.\n7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market\nOne of our investors has recently returned from a research trip to Silicon Valley... and has a warning for fellow investors:\nBecause he works for an organization dedicated to spreading great investing ideas, his video report is free today... so you can see it and decide for yourself.\nDon't miss your chance click here to learn about this warning and how you might be able to profit!\nMotley Fool contributor James Mickleboro has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The show described how cryptocurrencies could “revolutionize the way we spend money”, but that they’re also far from perfect.\nIt’s yet another example of cryptocurrencies reaching mainstream audiences. Over the past year, we’ve seen bitcoin and cryptocurrencies play major roles on shows like The Big Bang Theory and Silicon Valley . Now, viewers of Explained can get caught up on the surging industry.\nThe first season of Explained features five episodes covering a range of topics. “ Cryptocurrency ” is the first episode. The episode launched with the following description:\n“Cryptocurrency has made people billionaires, but is digital cash the next revolution? Learn about this anonymous currency and why it’s so coveted.”\nNetflix is heavily promoting Explained across its platform. Many users report seeing Explained in the coveted headline advertising slot on the Netflix homepage, for example. When you click “Play” to watch Explained, you’re taken directly to the “Cryptocurrency” episode (it’s the first episode of the first season). This could be huge for introducing new users to cryptocurrencies.\nThe other four episodes in Explained are titled, “K-Pop”, “Monogamy”, “Designer DNA”, and “The Racial Wealth Gap”. Note: it appears the episodes are displayed in no particular order. For some users, “Cryptocurrency” is the first episode, while other users see it as the fourth episode in the season.\nVox, which creates the Netflix show Explained, also published an article explaining their findings from the “Cryptocurrency” episode.\nVox plans to publish new episodes of Explained every week. Future shows will explore topics ranging from gene editing to the stock market. If you’re familiar with Vox’s existing online videos at Vox.com, then you’ll find Explained has a similar feel.\nSome aspects of the episode may rub cryptocurrency fans the wrong way. Calling all cryptocurrencies “ anonymous ”, for example, is a little bit misleading. It facilitates the myth that bitcoin is exclusively for drug deals and dark web purchases online.\nVox compounds this issue further by describing bitcoin as\n“anonymous, untraceable digital cash that you can spend freely, without interference from the government, a corporation, or big banks.” Vox goes on to explain that “anyone can use it [bitcoin] just by signing up online and entering credit card information.”\nSimplifications aside, it’s good to see bitcoin and cryptocurrencies getting their time in the limelight. 2017 was the year the general public heard about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies for the first time. Maybe 2018 will be the year that the general public understands how cryptocurrencies really work .

This follows a 10-month investigation on allegations that the exchange provided gambling services through its crypto margin trading program.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Coinone’s Investigation Concludes\nSouth Korea’s Cybercrime Investigation Unit of the Southern Provincial Police Department announced on Thursday, June 7, its plan to bring charges against Coinone over the exchange’s margin trading service, local media report.\nCoinone, which opened in August 2014, is the country’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, after Upbit and Bithumb. Its 24-hour trading volume is $34,342,088 at the time of this writing, according to Coinmarketcap.\nThe police are reportedly recommending that the prosecutor’s office charges three of Coinone’s executives, including CEO Myunghun Cha, as well as 20 members. The former will be charged with providing illegal gambling services and the latter with illegally gambling.\nIn South Korea, gambling is a crime under Chapter 23 of the Criminal Act.\nThe investigation of Coinone “on allegations that the exchange provided gambling services for margin trading” began in August last year, the Kyunghyang Shinmun wrote, elaborating:\nThe police concluded that the ‘margin trading’ service of the virtual currency exchange is gambling.\nAccording to the police, “The case was the first investigation related to the operation of a virtual currency exchange and it took considerable time to review the law,” Yonhap conveyed on Thursday. Crypto Margin Trading vs Gambling\nCoinone and its executives have been accused of providing cryptocurrency gambling services through its margin trading program from November 2016 to December last year. The exchange “allowed members to trade up to four times the amount of the deposit (margin) and to pay commission in exchange for the transactions,” the news outlet described, adding:\nMargin trading is similar to the credit trading technique of the stock market, but it was based on gambling because it was not authorized by the authorities and that it was targeting virtual currencies instead of stocks.\nThe investigation reveals that 19,000 Coinone users, between ages 20 and 50, had been using the exchange’s margin service. Most of them are either office workers, unemployed, or self-employed. In particular, 20 members traded over 3 billion won [~US$2.8 million]. The news outlet noted that gambling “can be used to collect criminal proceeds, and therefore interest in coins and margin users will be widened according to the results of the trial in the future.” Coinone Denies Charges\nThroughout the investigation, Coinone and its executives denied the charges and maintained that they “did not know it was illegal because there is a similar service in the stock market.” An employee of the exchange was quoted by the news outlet saying:\nWe do not think it is illegal because it [the service] has been legally reviewed by lawyers before [we started] the margin trading service.\nWhat do you think of South Korean charging Coinone for offering gambling services through margin trading?

Because of Coinbene’s confidence in RecordFarm’s stable and pre-existing platform, the listing will take place despite the fact that the company has not yet completed its initial coin offering (ICO).\nThe blockchain music and social media platform rewards users through an intuitive payout system, which analyses listener’s activities such as how they vote on content, in contrast to a traditional central royalty collection basis which most existing music platforms use.\nHaeyong Shin, CEO of RecordFarm, claims the reward-based model is “no-brainer” considering the company’s philosophy of transparency and fair payouts. advertisement\n“While paying the right amount to artists is paramount, listeners who create life around the music, by voting and commenting, should also be recognized; after all, they’re an indispensable element to a sustainable entertainment ecosystem,” Shin said, in a statement\n“This project is not a simple whitepaper-pipedream, it has grounded itself as a reverse-ICO. Having a working product attracted support from musicians, notably, the British label, PLATOON.”\nIn addition to its high number of active users, the stability and popularity of RecordFarm’s existing online music platform, which it is now combining with blockchain technology, is underscored by the awards it has garnered, including MWC Top 3 Asia Music App, Facebook FbStart member and winning “best project” by the Korea Data Agency.\nThe company is midway through an ICO for its /RCD tokens and has previously expounded on its business model to disrupt the music industry with an alternative to problems with copyright, royalty payments and artist agreements.\nRecordFarm currently has close to half a million active users, primarily in Korea, and is now looking to expand further afield.
