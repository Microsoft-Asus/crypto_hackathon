The company is aiming to give AWS customers an \"easy button\" to get into the same technology that underpins bitcoin.\n\"They can focus on their scenario and they don't have to become PhDs is cryptography, we give them a simple platform to build their company on blockchain,\" said Steve Cerveny, one of the founders of Kaleido.\nPLAY VIDEO\nBlockchain technology records transactions on a public, distributed ledger, which advocates say gets rid of the need for a third party in many cases. The technology is touted as faster and more secure by advocates.\n\"Introducing Kaleido to AWS customers is going to help customers move faster and not worry\nabout managing blockchain themselves,\" Amazon Web Services said in a statement. It is the first Blockchain SaaS solution available on the AWS Marketplace and will help them rapidly advance their blockchain projects.\"\nAmazon Web Services is a subsidiary of Amazon that offers a paid subscription for cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments. AWS is using a partner-led strategy instead of building from the ground up.\n\"They've been looking for partners to help get blockchain into their customers' hands,\" Cerveny told CNBC. \"They're putting it in the marketplace will accelerate what their customers are going to do with it.\"\nThe founder of the Ethereum blockchain platform, which is what Kaleido and AWS will be using, said this is the biggest move yet by the tech giant to get into blockchain.\n\"This is a heavy duty, full stack way of getting the company into blockchain solutions,\" said Joseph Lubin, founder of Ethereum.\nBlockchain can help Amazon in other arms of the ever-expanding business he said, using supply chain as one example. Lubin said Consensys, which oversees more than 50 blockchain projects, has seen a major increase in interest around the technology.\n\"Three years ago we were getting calls from companies trying to spell blockchain and trying to order one in a color because their boss told them they should get a blockchain,\" Lubin said. \"At this point there are tens of thousands of companies around the world that have real sophistication around this.\" Click to expand...

But while that acquisition is still awaiting regulatory approval, that isn’t stopping BitGo from bolstering its offerings.\nBitGo head of product Tracy Olsen indicated that the launch – which finds BitGo stratifying its service into three offering tiers – is about framing the company as a full spectrum provider of security solutions, one that can now scale from consumer to institutional needs.\nOlsen told CoinDesk:\n“We’re definitely seeing a lot of bigger names interested in digital currencies. But there are other customers like smaller hedge funds, they just don’t want to have to hold custody themselves. They’re looking to have the security and compliance and storage solutions that they can outsource to, and that’s what BitGo is really delivering.”\nThe three services tiers include “qualified custody,” in which BitGo offers secure storage and custody through Kingdom Trust; “institutional custody,” a solution that enables clients to manage wallets connected and disconnected from the Internet; and self-managed custody.\nAs such, Olsen positioned the full offering as one that can appeal to the risk-tolerance of all types of clients, from those who want to set up and manage wallets themselves, to those that want others to manage the sensitive cryptographic keys required to access funds.\n“These are really targeted at different market segments. The market is really demanding these three different solutions,” Olsen continued.\nAs for customer details, Olsen indicated that BitGo would not reveal the total value of the assets it helps custody, though she said 15 percent of bitcoin transactions now occur through the company’s wallet offerings. Multi-asset upgrade\nStill, that’s not to say there isn’t work to be done on BitGo’s offering.\nOlsen indicated that BitGo now provides its custody solutions to over 20 cryptocurrencies, but that the company is “absolutely” looking to increase that number in 2018.\n“We see a lot of demand of customers for a wide variety of coins. We evaluate each of them for viability in the market and then we prioritize them accordingly,” he said.\nWhile BitGo primarily started as a bitcoin-only firm, it steadily increased the number of coins it supported over 2017 in line with a jump in the number of crypto hedge funds, as well as wallet and exchange providers that began moving to support multiple protocols.\nNotably, however, Olsen hinted that interest at larger institutional firms mirrors this trend, with many indicating an interest in the wide variety of crypto assets on the market today.\n“They see it as a compelling asset class and want to diversify their portfolios with ethereum, ripple and other digital currencies,” she said. Wall Street ambitions\nOverall, the announcement also serves to potentially recast BitGo as a rare cryptocurrency startup ready to appeal to those seeking to do business on Wall Street.\nPropelled by announcements such as Goldman Sachs’ coming launch of a dedicated crypto trading desk, others are entering the market. Still, investment in security and custody has arguably lagged over the years, as evidenced by the fact that there are only a handful of such providers today.\nAmong them are Ledger and Coinbase, two companies that have also sought to raise big funding rounds to serve custody products to an institutional clientele.\nHowever, as Olsen indicated, the nascent state of the market today means that all entrants are competing against the sometimes negative perception of the technology.\nOlsen concluded:\n“There’s a reputation out there for digital currencies that they may be associated to the underworld, but I believe they are coming around and are seeing the value in investing in this asset class.”\nBank deposit boxes via Shutterstock\nBitGoWall StreetWalletsConsensus 2018 For ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "palo a", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tracy olsen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olsen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coindesk", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kingdom trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T10:20:34.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e94cb22aab759dec5be4e5546004fe5b879a0d9a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9GpoK49ucKkRXWUnl5lOwQ.lA8pKylV72CHS6cE56cd106wvJqYZglOEAHRmQdQoeUCzY16TBx5c.nUplORS2HCC.Q_7_FjxQ-", "site_full": "www.bitcoin.name", "site": "bitcoin.name", "site_section": "http://www.bitcoin.name/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News", "title": "Bitcoin Wallet Released on Huawei App Store", "title_full": "Bitcoin Wallet Released on Huawei App Store", "published": "2018-05-15T10:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e94cb22aab759dec5be4e5546004fe5b879a0d9a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9GpoK49ucKkRXWUnl5lOwQ.lA8pKylV72CHS6cE56cd106wvJqYZglOEAHRmQdQoeUCzY16TBx5c.nUplORS2HCC.Q_7_FjxQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "adminbtc", "published": "2018-05-15T10:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Wallet Released on Huawei App Store", "text": "Leave a reply\nHuawei has developed a partnership with BTC.com to offer new smartphone owners access to a mobile cryptocurrency wallet, giving Huawei customers the ability to use Bitcoin for commercial transactions.\nHuawei has continued to maintain its place as a leading global smartphone manufacturer with a massive stake in the Chinese market. This is a large and influential market, with mobile devices used extensively to access the internet in China, with substantial online commercial activity.\nHowever, it is currently very problematic for many Chinese residents to access cryptocurrency wallets with no access to apps in the Google Play store. There was also a complete ban on ICOs and cryptocurrency exchanges by the Chinese authorities. The addition of a Bitcoin wallet to Huawei phones is potentially the first chance many Chinese people will have to interact with cryptocurrency.\nThe Huawei app store, known as AppGallery, will provide access to BTC.com’s Bitcoin wallet for new smartphone customers. This will enable them to use the wallet to send, receive, and store the cryptocurrency.\nBTC.com is a leading digital wallet for cryptocurrency users. It is part of the now well-known Bitmain Group headquartered in Beijing in China. The Group offers a suite of successful crypto-technologies with extensive involvement in cryptocurrency mining.\nDr Jaime Gonzalo, vice president of Huawei Mobile Services, commented, “We expect to see massive growth in global cryptocurrency adoption habits in the near future. That is the reason why Huawei selected BTC.com as our recommended quality app to manage digital currencies.”\nBTC.com is offering an additional incentive to the new owners who may feel some reticence about taking advantage. Ganzalo confirmed, “In addition to being simple and secure to use, BTC.com offers an exclusive reward to all AppGallery users by gifting a starting amount of cryptocurrency.”\nThe BTC.com wallet is recognized as a secure Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash wallet. It is suitable for new and advanced users. It ensures users can securely store their private keys and provides them with complete control of their cryptocurrencies.\nAlejandro de la Torre, vice president of Business Operations for BTC.com stated, “BTC.com is democratizing Bitcoin by breaking down barriers to entry and ensuring new users can access Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash in a simple, secure and trusted environment.”\nConsumers who buy a higher end model of the new Huawei or Honor smartphones will find the Huawei app store already installed on their device with access to the BTC.com wallet. Phone owners with earlier models will get access to AppGallery in the future.\nChina has become one of the largest users of cashless mobile transactions. As commercial and user acceptance of cryptocurrencies continues to grow across the globe, there is an opportunity for them to become the currency for many transactions. BTC.com and Huawei have provided a new opportunity to expand this activity, and it will be interesting to see the outcomes.\nImage Source: Flickr – Kārlis Dambrāns\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews\nThe post Bitcoin Wallet Released on Huawei App Store appeared first on BitcoinNews.com .

The law published in the National's Royal Gazette defines cryptocurrencies as \"digital assets and digital tokens\" and passes them under the jurisdiction of the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nThailand's media quotes finance minister Apisak Tantivorawonga, who claims that the new measures are not intended to prohibit cryptocurrencies or ICOs. The position of the Minister of Finance replicates the position of the SEC, which is widely supported by the ICO, provided that they are regulated.\nAfter the royal decree has become effective, sellers of digital assets or tokens must register with the SEC within 90 days. Failure to do so requires a penalty of twice the value of an unauthorized digital transaction or at least 500,000 baht (approximately $ 15,700). Sellers who do not comply can also be sentenced to imprisonment for up to two years.\nThe Ministry of Finance and the SEC extend the legal framework and demand from all national cryptographic exchanges, as well as independent brokers and cryptographic dealers, registration in the relevant authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Royal Decree.\nMinister Tantivorawong stressed that these activities are focused on the protection of investors, as well as on preventing the use of cryptocurrencies for criminal activities, money laundering and tax avoidance.\nThis decree has been subject to several changes since its presentation in the form of a project in March. The uncertainty caused by the waiting for regulations caused that the Central Bank of Thailand banned domestic banks from cryptocurrency transactions and investments in February this year. In the same month, regulatory uncertainty also caused the Thai digital stock market (TDAX) to temporarily suspend ICO transactions and registrations. At the end of March, the Ministry announced the long-awaited final version of the tax framework for cryptocurrencies.\nLet's now take a look at the Bitcoin technical picture at the H4 time frame. The price has been trying to bounce higher again, but the golden trend line still hasn't been violated yet. The market made a new local high at the level of $8,850, just below the technical resistance at the level of $8,931. Only a sustained breakout above the trend line might result in a test of the wave b high at the level of $9,320. Otherwise, the price will fall again towards the level of $8,132 or below as the wave 2/B is still being considered uncompleted.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "apisak tantivorawonga", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national's royal gazette", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "finance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of finance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thai securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "thailand", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T12:22:03.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "63d15bb9cbc0f8605cedd6e1bf08caec6ddc7d60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3Ebkq4DFLEugm.fyyuPtlOPx0j5kzJuObvhuP25PjpJ4rq6kfCnnReJDikFW_M9vjFV_m9XJOjYzLhaUL60t_9gOFbEAma44ThKivF8dA2cFtQ3ZHwNbWQ--", "site_full": "okchances.com", "site": "okchances.com", "site_section": "http://okchances.com/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Okchances", "title": "Florida Tax Collector to Accept Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash Payments", "title_full": "Florida Tax Collector to Accept Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash Payments", "published": "2018-05-15T10:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "VN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://okchances.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2017/09/1_69442.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "63d15bb9cbc0f8605cedd6e1bf08caec6ddc7d60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3Ebkq4DFLEugm.fyyuPtlOPx0j5kzJuObvhuP25PjpJ4rq6kfCnnReJDikFW_M9vjFV_m9XJOjYzLhaUL60t_9gOFbEAma44ThKivF8dA2cFtQ3ZHwNbWQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-15T10:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Florida Tax Collector to Accept Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash Payments", "text": "14 24 Views\nA Florida county tax collector has partnered with bitcoin payments processor BitPay to accept cryptocurrency for a variety of services.\nSeminole County Tax Collector Joel Greenberg said in a statement Monday that his office will take bitcoin and bitcoin cash for payments associated with driver licenses and ID cards, automobile tags and titles and property tax.\nThe office decided to accept the cryptocurrencies in an effort to streamline fee collection, reduce the potential for fraud and identity theft and increase the transparency and accuracy of payments. Greenberg’s office added that it does not perceive any “price volatility or risk to the County” in accepting the cryptocurrencies.\nGreenberg said in the statement:\n“The aim of my tenure in office is to make our customer experience faster, smarter and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st century and one way is the addition of cryptocurrency to our payment options.”\nThe collaboration with the Seminole County Tax Collector marks BitPay’s first government partnership. Head of compliance Jeremie Beaudry said the company was launched because “we recognized the potential for blockchain to revolutionize the financial industry, making payments faster, more secure and less expensive on a global scale.\n“With the Seminole County Tax Collector’s office, we have engaged our first government agency to accept bitcoin and bitcoin cash by making it easy and seamless for them,” he added.\nHowever, Greenberg’s office is not the only local government entity that has entertained the idea of accepting cryptocurrency for taxes.\nArizona and Georgia lawmakers both proposed bills this year that would allow citizens to pay their state tax liabilities in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, though neither bill made it through their respective legislatures.\nCalculator image via Flickr\nBitPaytaxesSeminole CountyConsensus 2018 For ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joel greenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "seminole county tax collector", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seminole county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T10:20:39.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "912349c91e7b00829d0ff7879c2be65016bd54a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.sgMFwJQW8veCwE3vhWnoskNB0B9AHuUQ_jeQHq_Y7Q7_.RyLSQ_WyWv6eevtjm3c4g--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Netherlands' Biggest Crypto Exchange Removes Bitcoin Cash Before Hard Fork - Bitcoinist.com", "title_full": "Netherlands' Biggest Crypto Exchange Removes Bitcoin Cash Before Hard Fork - Bitcoinist.com", "published": "2018-05-15T10:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "912349c91e7b00829d0ff7879c2be65016bd54a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.sgMFwJQW8veCwE3vhWnoskNB0B9AHuUQ_jeQHq_Y7Q7_.RyLSQ_WyWv6eevtjm3c4g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-15T10:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "Netherlands' Biggest Crypto Exchange Removes Bitcoin Cash Before Hard Fork - Bitcoinist.com", "text": "Netherlands' Biggest Crypto Exchange Removes Bitcoin Cash Before Hard Fork - Bitcoinist.com\n/u/SgtLincolnLazarus\nsubmitted by /u/SgtLincolnLazarus\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T10:08:43.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4ae397be25d7131bda7738a990a3c41587144a57", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ46uQgX_wN53cO4gLEkT7CjFw--", "site_full": "programadores.esforos.com", "site": "esforos.com", "site_section": "http://programadores.esforos.com/./viewforum.php?f=24", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Juegos - PROGRAMADORES", "title": "That is why Bitcoin crashed...", "title_full": "That is why Bitcoin crashed... - PROGRAMADORES", "published": "2018-05-15T10:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4ae397be25d7131bda7738a990a3c41587144a57", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ46uQgX_wN53cO4gLEkT7CjFw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JanetFub", "published": "2018-05-15T10:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "That is why Bitcoin crashed...", "text": " software complex for breaking any Captcha\nearn money by captcha , Alarm!

Safein CEO Vladas pitched the Safein product 4 times to the crowd and the jury, ultimately winning the competition for $250,000 worth of prizes! May 15th, 2018, Vilnius, Lithuania: Hundreds of people gathered in Limassol, Cyprus for the great quality programme and networking events. Among the audience were startup founders, experts from a range of industries as well as prominent investors in the sphere. iCoinSummit organised a pitch battle where 18 select token events were able to present their projects to the audience and the jury, and Safein was one of them.\nFollowing the first day battles where each of the 18 project founders took the stage for 5 minutes for a concise overview of what their projects are aiming to deliver, Vladas secured Safein a confident 2nd place. The next day, an intense series of pitches took place, whereby the founders had the opportunity to present in more depth their vision and ambitions, token metrics and utility, and further delve into product peculiarities to win the confidence of the audience.\nThe Final Eight Already in the round of Final 8, which was primarily about product roadmaps of the participating projects, Safein where quite sure Vladas would take the platform to the very end of the battles. Indeed, during the pitch it really showed that Safein CEO knew exactly where he is planning on taking Safein, and that reflected in the pitch result – Safein was number one.\nSafein In the Semi-finals\nSafein then moved on to the semi-finals where 1-on-1 battles took place, and the focus points were the current state of the product and token metrics. Safein were one of the only competitors to have an already developed Minimal Viable Product, Safein confidently progressed to the final round securing 65% of the votes.\nThe Final Round The finals were quite informal and did not have a specific theme to cover, but the final round opponent was a really capable contender with a great vision, and they also beat us by 1% in round 1 – a shout-out to Grapevine! Ultimately, however Safein identity management solution emerged victorious over Grapevine’s healthcare data sharing platform!\nFollowing the battles, Vladas and Lukas had the chance to meet with a number of investors from iCoinSummit’s so-called Shark Tank. Safein where awarded with $250,000 worth of marketing services, and we will surely make good use of them with our upcoming token sale!\nThe Safein Token Sale Continued\nThe Safein main event will begin on the 31st of May and end on the 30th of June.

The reaction on social media, particularly twitter was fast and furious.\nTyler Winklevoss responded with this tweet that pointed out that @BillGates could short bitcoin using the CBOE futures contract. The CBOE's contract specifications clearly state that you could be net short or long up to 5,000 contracts. There don't seem to be any restrictions on who can be short (I have to check my notes, I thought at one time there were limitations on who could short - though that may have been at the clearing level - or before bitcoin dropped from almost $20,000 to under $9,000 and hasn't had a parabolic increase since late November and early December (not coincidentally, in my opinion, right as futures launched).\nSo my initial reaction was - sure you can Bill (I did meet him once when I was an intern in the 1980s at Microsoft, and I still think that was pretty cool to this day - but that's another story).\nBut the more I have thought about this statement, which on the surface seems wrong, the more I think he is on to something.\nFirst, at 5,000 contracts at $8,700 that total short would be $43.5 million. That is hardly going to move the needle for a man of his net worth. Even if he was right, he probably makes or loses more every few hours on his existing stock holdings.\nSo the first conclusion is that maybe Mr. Gates can short Bitcoin, but it isn't worth it to him - but the rest of us mere mortals can.\nBut can we?\nThe current front contract has open interest of 3,115 contracts or a notional of $27.1 million.\nThe entire front contract short interest is $27.1 million. We can check out the CME contract, but for all I know, there is an arb where people are long one and short the other, but the total amount short bitcoin is minuscule relative to its size and relative to the amount of time and effort spent supporting it.\nIf there ever was a market ripe for squeezing shorts - bitcoin futures has to be high on the list.\nThe real issue, contrary to what @tylerwinklevoss implies, is it is very hard to short bitcoin other than 'as a trade'. Yes I have seen that some exchanges offer ways to short bitcoin, but it is still small relative to the size of the market. I didn't even consider GBTC, the Bitcoin Trust as a way to short, as the constantly seems like a disaster waiting to happen as shorts get squeezed, with period relief when the trust issues new 'shares'.\nSure, we can take a stab that $8,700 is too high and short it, but it is hard to make the bet that both Mr. Gates and Warren Buffet seemed to make in the interview - that the market cap of bitcoin is absurd.\nThis is what is nagging at me.\nThere is no way to short bitcoin in meaningful size. At the same time, there is a virtual machine to support the bitcoin behemoth - at least in terms of trying to convert new users and shower praise on bitcoin and come up with eye-catching targets for bitcoin in 6 months, 1 year, or whatever time frame seems most appealing at the moment.\nI am no more fond of those who relentlessly bash bitcoin without taking any time to understand what it does (and yes, I understand that by posting this negative piece on bitcoin, I will be lumped into that group).\nSo, my bottom line, and growing concern is that bitcoin isn't rallying more despite the inability for real short interest to develop when the 2nd rule of bitcoin plays so heavily in Bitcoin's favor.\nMy medium-term view is now more bearish than it has been since I became almost constructive a month ago . It took a week to sink in why - but I think what started as one billionaire's off the cuff remark, that didn't seem particularly true - has set me on a path where I think the bulls are failing, and it won't take much of a nudge to know the price down more.\nFrom a short-term trading standpoint, would I short some futures tomorrow? No, but that, at least, I know I can do!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://cfe.cboe.com/cfe-products/xbt-cboe-bitcoin-futures/contract-specifications", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/07/bill-gates-i-would-short-bitcoin-if-i-could.html", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/XBT?src=hash"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bill gates short bitcoin", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "bill gates", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "tyler winklevoss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T05:06:02.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4471880f8dc1ef496f603e8fa440f83364305d62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va73OrXztFQRSXLHtR3WBLFJTljDqfFjnYDEEEZyTzcWYYxyAIMWsYtoM4WI79LztjqQ--", "site_full": "bitcoin.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Bitcoin Stack Exchange", "title": "creating json-rpc apis for bitcoin", "title_full": "creating json-rpc apis for bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-15T09:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/bitcoin/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=462e8b9b382b", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 179, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4471880f8dc1ef496f603e8fa440f83364305d62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va73OrXztFQRSXLHtR3WBLFJTljDqfFjnYDEEEZyTzcWYYxyAIMWsYtoM4WI79LztjqQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "rahul123", "published": "2018-05-15T09:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "creating json-rpc apis for bitcoin", "text": "0xuser 1 2 bitcoin wallet only allows one user for a single node, i am not getting how to enable my node so that anybody having privete key and address can connect and do transactions through my node. – rahul123 7 hours ago is there any javascript library like web3 .js for ethereum in bitcoin so that we can do transaction directlly without connecting with any wallet. – rahul123 7 hours ago In my opinion, the easiest way is to: 1) Use explorer to check balances and to get inputs and outputs of transactions 2) Use bitcoin-js-lib to generate new addresses, to build and sign transactions 3) Use command line on your server to broadcast transactions to the network (bitcoin-cli sendrawtransaction <hex>) – 0xuser 4 hours ago", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://github.com/phramz/php-bitcoin-api", "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42224107/php-execute-shell-command-asynchronously-and-retrieve-live-output", "https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_reference_(JSON-RPC)", "https://github.com/bitcoin-abe/bitcoin-abe"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "php", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T10:06:40.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6856d9df5519cea1eb06a3588224ab76f2f4f6a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZTNoJLWRs9JUrCbK.oupEos8TFTDCuAnF7kCg0zdGTlnWTmdR84Bh_C", "site_full": "www.merkle.press", "site": "merkle.press", "site_section": "https://www.merkle.press/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Merkle News", "title": "Dubai Bitcoin Exchange Halts Fiat Withdrawals Due to Bank ‘Issue’", "title_full": "Dubai Bitcoin Exchange Halts Fiat Withdrawals Due to Bank ‘Issue’", "published": "2018-05-15T09:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6856d9df5519cea1eb06a3588224ab76f2f4f6a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZTNoJLWRs9JUrCbK.oupEos8TFTDCuAnF7kCg0zdGTlnWTmdR84Bh_C", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Satoshi (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-15T09:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Dubai Bitcoin Exchange Halts Fiat Withdrawals Due to Bank ‘Issue’", "text": "Advertisement Join our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nDubai-based exchange BitOasis has suspended UAE Dirham/BTC trading, citing issues with the bank servicing the exchange itself. A communication was sent to BitOasis users yesterday that starting Tuesday, no more dirham can be withdrawn from the exchange, leaving users with today only to move their balance elsewhere or top it up with more dirham if desired. Users wishing to make credit card deposits can do so at the discounted fee of four percent until June 16. According to BitOasis, the issuing bank of the exchange is the only problem, and the normal trading of cryptocurrencies such as BTC, BCH, ETH, XRP, LTC, XMR, and ZEC will continue as usual, as will cryptocurrency withdrawals from the exchange into private wallets. Arabian Business quotes the statement as informing BitOasis users the following:\n“If you decide to leave your fiat balances the only way for you to withdraw your funds at any time after May 15th would be to convert it to cryptocurrency and send it to an external wallet”\n“If you choose to keep your AED fiat balances after May 15th, currently we do not have any date on when we will be reactivating AED fiat withdrawals, but we are hard at work to provide our customers with this service.”\nThere is no date as of yet for the reactivation of dirham withdrawals and deposits by wire transfer, although BitOasis have said it should be soon.\nThe exchange, which operates in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait, has suspended withdrawals in the past as well, halting transfers to and from Emirates NBD, Noor Bank and Mashreq bank accounts in 2017 for a short time Gulf News reported that customers experienced delayed withdrawals while new verifications were also suspended and that the issue was due to regulatory pressure from within the UAE at the time.\nEntrepreneur Ola Dudin of Jordan founded BitOasis in 2014 as a hybrid wallet/exchange, and the exchange has been active since then, listing Zcash as recently as April 23, 2018. According to the website, BitOasis plans to be the first digital assets company in MENA to be registered in a major technology center in the region.\nThe company has not yet updated the blog regarding the new constraints on the use of the dirham currency on the exchange.

The bulls will strongly defend the support zone between $7,900 to $8,400 because if this cracks, a fall to $7,000 will be on the cards. If the support zone holds, the cryptocurrency will stay range bound between $7,900-$10,000. The 50-day SMA has been flat for the past few days while the 20-day EMA has become flat in the past week. This shows that the BTC/USD pair will soon enter a period of consolidation. The resistance of the range is well established at $10,000, but the supports are still unclear. It will either be $7,900 or $6,700. Hence, we suggest waiting for a couple of days before clarity emerges. ETH/USD The dip in Ethereum below the 20-day EMA was aggressively purchased on May 14, resulting in a move back to the overhead resistance of $745. Currently, the ETH/USD pair is looking strong as it is holding above the $700 levels. This increases the possibility of a break out of $745 levels once again. Aggressive traders can take a very short-term long position above $750 with a close stop loss. The target is $838, but this is a very risky trade, hence, should be attempted with only about 30 percent of the usual position size. On the downside, the critical support levels are $637, $600 and the 50-day SMA at $570. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash bounced back sharply from the lows on May 12, but it is struggling to sustain above the 20-day EMA and break out of the small downtrend line. The BCH/USD pair may form a very short-term head and shoulders pattern, which will complete on a breakdown and close below $1,270 levels. This bearish pattern has a target of $650, but it is unlikely to be a straight fall because the digital currency has strong support at $1,221, then at the 50-day SMA at $1,100 and finally at $800. If the neckline of the H&S pattern doesn’t break down and prices break above $1,520 levels, Bitcoin Cash can rally back to $1,800 levels. Traders should wait for prices to break and close (UTC) above the downtrend line before buying. XRP/USD Ripple broke below the 50-day SMA on May 11 but found strong buying support at $0.632 levels on May 12. Currently, it has climbed back above the 50-day SMA. On the upside, it will face a strong resistance at $0.76, which was previously the support of the range. The 20-day EMA is just above this level, which will also act as a resistance. If both these levels are crossed, the XRP/USD pair will become positive, and the probability of a rally to $0.9377 levels increase. If the bulls fail to scale above the overhead resistance, the cryptocurrency can slide to $0.56-$0.58 levels. XLM/USD Stellar bounced off the 50-day SMA on May 12, but the pullback is facing resistance at the 20-day EMA. If the bulls break above the 20-day EMA, a rally to $0.45 levels is possible. If the XLM/USD pair turns down from the moving average but takes support at the $0.334 levels, it will be a positive sign and we can expect a break out of the 20-day EMA within a couple of days. However, a break below the 50-day SMA will increase the possibility of a head and shoulders pattern, which can sink the digital currency to the $0.20 levels. Therefore, traders should wait for buying to emerge before establishing long positions. LTC/USD Litecoin broke below the 50-day SMA and the horizontal support on May 11 but quickly rebounded from the lows on May 12. Currently, the bulls are trying to sustain above the $141 levels, which is a positive sign. Any up move in the LTC/USD pair will face resistance between $167 and $173 levels. The 50-day SMA has still not turned up and the 20-day EMA is also turning down. Hence, we don’t anticipate a break out above the downtrend line. On the downside, a break below the $132.163 level opens up a downside target of $115. As we don’t find any buy setups, we are not recommending any trade on it. ADA/BTC Cardano plunged below our second stop loss on May 12 but took support at the 50-day SMA and the trendline. The ensuing up move is facing resistance close to the 20-day EMA. Currently, prices are again sliding towards the trendline support. If the ADA/BTC pair breaks the trendline support, it can decline to 0.000025 levels, which is a strong support. On the other hand, if the trendline holds, Cardano will again try to scale above the 0.00003445 levels. There are no reliable buy setups, hence, we are not proposing any trade on it. IOTA/USD IOTA is currently sandwiched between the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. The bulls are defending the horizontal support at $1.63 while the bears are defending the 20-day EMA. If the IOTA/USD pair climbs above the 20-day EMA and the overhead resistance at $2.2117, it will become positive. Though there is a minor resistance at $2.6977, we believe that it will be crossed if the digital currency closes (UTC) above $2.2117. We should wait for the breakout before suggesting any long position. EOS/USD On May 12, EOS bounced off the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement and the bottom trendline of the descending channel. For the past three days, it has been facing resistance at the $15.1390 levels. On the upside, the EOS/USD pair will face resistance at the 20-day EMA and the top trendline of the descending channel. A breakout and close (UTC) of the channel will be a bullish sign and can be purchased by keeping a stop loss below the May 12 lows. If the price fails to rally above the overhead resistance it can again decline to the 50-day SMA. A sustained move below $12.4810 will weaken the digital currency.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

I mean, Its clearly that selling drugs, guns, explosives, doing money laundry is speacially easy to do with bitcoins, since its anonimity and zero transaction fees. The examples may be a little extreme, but you what I mean.\nIs there any really solutions for this? Im doing mining and i already made \"real money\" with bitcoins, but i cant just ignore this. Do we really want this kind of uncontrolled business going on everywhere?\nThis is something that cryptocurrencies have in general, which is their decentralized nature. Most of the countries nowadays are prohibiting the use of cryptocurrencies in their respective countries as they are having difficulties controlling the criminality rate. They believe that once they implement the use of such, this will worsen their situation, ultimately affecting the general public and the economic as well.\nDespite some prohibitions, some countries in Asia still accept the utilization of it as the benefits it provides to the public outweighs the negative implications.

The warning comes as regulators worldwide grapple with how to respond to the boom in so-called cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, which lure investors with the promise of high returns but are not backed by any central banks and can fall prey to scams. Virtual currencies “are not money” and their influence on the real economy remains limited, Mersch insisted.“But this can change,” he admitted. US banking giant Goldman Sachs announced plans in March to start trading bitcoin futures, in what could be a step towards giving the notoriously opaque cryptocurrency market more legitimacy. Several smaller financial players have already taken the plunge. In Switzerland, Falcon Private Bank offers asset management services for a range of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ethereum, while financial and trading services group Swissquote offers trading in five virtual currencies. Underscoring the high risk that comes with betting on virtual currencies, Mersch noted that the price of bitcoin had plunged from almost $20,000 (16,700 euros) to below $7,000 between December and February. Bitcoin trading is still in its infancy, Mersch said, with some 200,000 bitcoin transactions carried out globally each day compared with 330 million retail payments in the euro area. But if the use of cryptocurrencies spreads, “a crash could affect the stability of the wider financial system if big banks were to hold huge unhedged exposures to VCs”, he warned. at", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yves mersch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mersch", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "afp banks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european central bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T09:21:40.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0f684583764ecfe57e00556aec005a40100b201f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhKNVZn16rS4ec.Tym2yne0Y-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-15T09:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0f684583764ecfe57e00556aec005a40100b201f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhKNVZn16rS4ec.Tym2yne0Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-15T09:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 15, 2018 NEWS Bitcoin cash is expanding into the void Financial Times That was the opening line from nChain CEO Jimmy Nguyen -- whose company wants to make bitcoin spin-off bitcoin cash (BCH) the cryptocurrency of ...

Prices dipped to USD 8,300 levels at one point with the markets taking consideration for several hours. Ultimately, there was a sizeable upward spike that moved prices to a recovery but the sustainability of such levels comes into question. The day’s signals Prices were moving slightly below USD 8,800 earlier through the trading session. A large selloff made markets touch the bottom at around USD 8,300 levels, with traders taking consideration for several hours. An upward spike pushed prices to USD 8,700 levels again with markets seemingly exiting the bearish breakout.\nBTC/USD charts showcase the extent of the day’s volatility. Bitcoin prices went through some wild swings in the course of today’s trading session. Ultimately, prices might have returned to levels similar to the ones prior to the day’s selloff, but selling pressure certainly showed its capabilities. Traders might be building up more cautiousness now that the market’s sentiment showed itself to be capable of allowing a breach down to USD 8,300 price levels. Resistance for upward movements following the recovery is apparent as markets currently appear uneasy with further price rises.\nOKEX BTC/USD weekly future charts display a lack of exaggeration in price movements. Futures traders didn’t mirror the selloff to its fullest extent but also didn’t seem to be firm believers in a potential recovery. It’s likely the potential of such price levels being sustained came into question. With uncertainty reaping the markets along with volatility, futures traders are likely trying to play it safe. It’s worth mentioning that with live markets taking consideration amid lower volumes, prices might be prone to another crash.\nAll in all, traders might be pleased with the fact that BTC/USD markets didn’t breach below USD 8,300 levels. Afterall, the resistance observed in live markets could also be another contributor to the current mood of the market. If a further crash can be avoided, trades could eventually start working on breaking resistance levels.\nimage source: https://www.flickr.com/photos/jenny-pics/2539753594 – jenny downing\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://t.me/bconews", "https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin price analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T10:02:31.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "41ed94e76a3b4fedcbe3fe8826b28addeebb726b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSPohZHWo_jBIXDABXWCoHcpeObpP6xpil8Hs7nwSLHzpz4MvcMVEWi4As3qlAFrX5l233V.CRQEOv2pFpnCUd_KkSEPCpuqKqp0C7bicmwvaI4DXI98RjFCfkL.5psLN6", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "newest submissions : reddit.com", "title": "[uncensored-r/CryptoCurrency] ICON and LINE co-found ‘Unchain’ to build LINE's blockchain network : noncensored_bitcoin", "title_full": "[uncensored-r/CryptoCurrency] ICON and LINE co-found ‘Unchain’ to build LINE's blockchain network : noncensored_bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-15T09:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "41ed94e76a3b4fedcbe3fe8826b28addeebb726b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSPohZHWo_jBIXDABXWCoHcpeObpP6xpil8Hs7nwSLHzpz4MvcMVEWi4As3qlAFrX5l233V.CRQEOv2pFpnCUd_KkSEPCpuqKqp0C7bicmwvaI4DXI98RjFCfkL.5psLN6", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "censorship_notifier", "published": "2018-05-15T09:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "[uncensored-r/CryptoCurrency] ICON and LINE co-found ‘Unchain’ to build LINE's blockchain network : noncensored_bitcoin", "text": "The following post by Nullifics is being replicated because the post has been openly removed.\nThe original post can be found(in censored form) at this link:\nnp.reddit.com/r/ CryptoCurrency/comments/8jhrjt\nThe original post's content was as follows:\nLine launched in Japan in 2011, reaching 100 million users within eighteen months and 200 million users only six months later.

May 15, 2018 167 What Are the Potential Benefits and Impacts of Bitcoin Donations on Charity?\nBitcoin donations are an excellent way for charities to encourage more donors to participate. For donors, sending funds in Bitcoin is easy, as long as the charity has an online wallet set up. And for charities, they can receive funds from around the world, from a modern type of donor, who prefers this payment method.\n“ Bitcoin is an exciting, new digital currency that allows for global payments to happen 24/7, 365 days a year with nominal fees,” says Christopher Moussa, Chief Investment Officer at Crypto Capital Investments. “Charities are beginning to realize the many potential benefits in accepting Bitcoin donations. Being at the forefront of accepting Bitcoin donations opens your organization up to a new community of donors that prefer to deal exclusively with Bitcoin.”\nSounds awesome, right? And it is. But, like anything else in life, you should read the fine print first. If you’re a charity, and you want to accept Bitcoin donations, there are a few things you should know . You don’t let issues such as tax compliance, volatility, and security of your bitcoin donations put you off. But do your research first.\nOnce you’re aware of the possible risks and know how to process bitcoin donations correctly, accepting this type of funding can have major benefits for your charity. Let’s take a look at a few of them here. A Wider Donor Pool\nCharities are up against some pretty stiff competition when it comes to attracting donors. Not only do they have to convince donors to hand out money from their own pockets, but they have to compete with thousands of other causes as well.\nIn the United States alone there are 1.5 million registered nonprofits. Convincing donors to choose yours over the rest is no easy feat.\nAccepting Bitcoin donations not only opens up the potential donor pool, but it gives you a leg up on the competition who don’t accept cryptocurrency. It’s easier for international donors to send money as well. And for donors who prefer complete anonymity, sending Bitcoin is an added incentive.\nJust think about the Pineapple Fund that donated $55 million worth of Bitcoin to charities anonymously. That wouldn’t have been possible without Bitcoin.\nNonprofit consultant , Paul Lamb points out, “One clear benefit is that, as more and more individuals become aware of and comfortable using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the greater the ability of charities to capture new funding streams.” Appealing to the Millennial Demographic\nStartup charities have it particularly hard trying to catch donors’ attention. They usually don’t have the funds to market themselves and aren’t well known to the public. When most people donate, it’s to the biggest charities and the go-to names they’re used to seeing in the media.\nAppealing to millennials should be part of any charity’s priorities. Millennials are more passionate about causes and more altruistic than generations before them (the average millennial donates almost $600 a year to charities). Millennials also happen to be the most active generation using Bitcoin. They’re willing to donate to your cause if you make it as easy for them as possible.\nThere are several crowdfunding platforms that make it easier for small charities to make themselves known, including bitgive and bithope . Once you get your charity in front of the right audience and make it simple for them to donate by accepting Bitcoin, you widen your appeal.\n“Millennials are the demographic most actively using Bitcoin,” says Lamb, “and as charities attempt to recruit younger donors, cryptocurrency is an unpre cedented and growing fundraising opportunity area. Also, the ability to accept Bitcoin carries with it a kind of ahead-of-the-times cache, which can capture the attention of the modern and more innovation-oriented donor.” A Substantial Global Revenue Stream\nIn March, Ripple donated $29 million to DonarsChoose.org so that they could donate to every teachers’ request on the site. This is just one example of cryptocurrencies getting more proactive in philanthropy .\nIt’s not only beneficial to charities but helps blockchain companies address some of the negative press around cryptocurrency and the accusations that most people in it are criminals or only out for personal gain. Charities are primed to take advantage of this goodwill to drive more donations. Getting the Whole Benefit of the Donation\nWhile charities accepting donations through traditional means, such as credit card or PayPal, are subject to fees, with Bitcoin donations, those can be substantially reduced. While transaction fees still exist, they are significantly lower.\n“This allows the nonprofit to realize the full benefit of the donation and it significantly cuts down the processing time,” Moussa explains. “Donations with Bitcoin can be accepted from individuals around the world. The benefits of Bitcoin donations are that the transactions happen quickly, usually within 15 minutes.”\nAccepting bitcoin donations means that you don’t have to pay capital gains, which allows charities to get the whole benefit of the donation–so long as charities understand the volatility of Bitcoin value and the potential tax implications.\nThe main takeaway is that you must be compliant. So don’t accept donations and then recklessly HODL. “ For charity organizations,” Moussa advises, “it is important to note that holding Bitcoin donations as an investment may require them to pay unrelated business income tax on any income that may be realized. Tax professionals are increasing their focus on Bitcoin taxation and will be able to help organizations navigate this new frontier.”\nJeromy Spence, Director of Finance at iComply Investor Services Inc. adds, “In the U.S. where capital gains use the first in first out method, it would be beneficial to donate sooner rather than later so that they could get a tax receipt on their most taxable crypto. There are extra benefits for first-time donors which should also be noted.”\nHowever, he concludes that “ Ultimately charities should be excited and learn how to market to those interested in crypto-donation so that it can be a win-win for the donor and the charity.” Closing Thoughts on Bitcoin Donations\nThere are plenty of benefits from accepting Bitcoin donations for your charity. Especially if you want to widen your donor pool and make it as easy as possible to give.\nAccepting Bitcoin gives your charity greater possibilities, which can have untold impact on the work you do. Be smart about it, be compliant, and open the door to more funding and a brighter future.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://coincentral.com/mainframe-airdrop/", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/28/ripple-donates-29-million-after-donorschoose-org-founder-dared-himself-to-ask.html", "http://icomplyico.com/", "https://cryptollc.capital/", "https://www.manonamission.biz/", "https://coincentral.com/what-should-charities-know-before-accepting-bitcoin-donations/", "https://coincentral.com/pineapple-fund-donor-says-farewell-after-donating-last-of-funds/", "https://www.dunhamandcompany.com/2017/05/millennial-donors/", "https://bithope.org/", "https://www.bitgivefoundation.org/", "http://grantspace.org/tools/knowledge-base/funding-research/statistics/number-of-nonprofits-in-the-u.s"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christopher moussa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto capital investments", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T09:49:41.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8717127e3e90bd345ca2a51727b39f2a7f618035", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Idk8fTCQoN_eDsoc59NBQyU4kvLf.uIKChpisvvVxbSMaxqZIqyzR", "site_full": "www.thetruthseeker.co.uk", "site": "thetruthseeker.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?feed=rss2", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The Truthseeker", "title": "Bitcoin is US Dollar 2.0 Created by CIA | Kaspersky Co-founder", "title_full": "Bitcoin is US Dollar 2.0 Created by CIA | Kaspersky Co-founder", "published": "2018-05-15T09:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8717127e3e90bd345ca2a51727b39f2a7f618035", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Idk8fTCQoN_eDsoc59NBQyU4kvLf.uIKChpisvvVxbSMaxqZIqyzR", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "wmw_admin", "published": "2018-05-15T09:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin is US Dollar 2.0 Created by CIA | Kaspersky Co-founder", "text": "Behind the headlines - conspiracies, cover-ups, ancient mysteries and more.

Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The leveraged nature of FX trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds and such may work against you as well as for you. Past results are no indication of future performance. Information contained this web site is intended for informational purposes only and was obtained from sources believed to be reliable.

Actually I believe it will be an alternative crypto-currency. The initial development of Bitcoin, like all things, had inherent flaws and possible improvements. These improvements made by alternative crypto-currency's are at times vastly superior to that of Bitcoin. An example is LITECOIN, which has 81,000,000 in potential circulation vs Bitcoins 21,000,000. Other developments include increased privacy, central fund, etc. Right now, I believe the main concern is Government intervention. We are all unclear about their views and potential actions, with many considering that Governments will ban or limit it's use. (Using 'Black Market' arguments to stem its progression.) Once Authority's views are quite clear, me say see further market involvement by those that are on the sidelines.

One of them is risk. Investors usually associate stocks with higher risk than other assets like stocks and gold. Another explanation is demographics—the aging of the American population, which makes bonds and CDs more suitable for older investors.\nAnd there’s ignorance and unfamiliarity when it comes to investing in stocks, and especially in new investment vehicles like Bitcoin.\nGallery The World's 10 Most Powerful Executives 2018 Launch Gallery 10 images", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://news.gallup.com/poll/233294/stocks-trail-real-estate-preferred-investment.aspx?g_source=link_NEWSV9&g_medium=NEWSFEED&g_campaign=item_&g_content=Stocks%2520Still%2520Trail%2520Real%2520Estate%2520as%2520Preferred%2520Investment"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bonds", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gallup", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T05:05:30.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "94ecedcc9af2f9af79e0ff7ceb28d3d700d326b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXMHByspZAVzIxR__.zseA_IlKTssuQs81EsNO55PsUNkuay5UArZzsdMZ5vIryyN2vCdvQfcTyGwC.4j0BW40tZBWrPYfbTrUQpS8PQt_.2koDMhOU9LgY.nRe7l.Tz5KZV0XSxn7TGKVCCyOeGKt.ulPtj3M2WYL1uFZyOjp8JOHfvlWBXyBjJX9JIoRZJ6be.4_eEFRyw--", "site_full": "www.forbes.com", "site": "forbes.com", "site_section": "http://www.forbes.com/business/rss.jhtml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Forbes - Business", "title": "Bitcoin, Gold, Stocks, Bonds, Or Real Estate: Which Is The Best Investment To Build Wealth?", "title_full": "Bitcoin, Gold, Stocks, Bonds, Or Real Estate: Which Is The Best Investment To Build Wealth?", "published": "2018-05-15T08:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F42358320%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 196, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 126, "comments": 0, "shares": 126}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "94ecedcc9af2f9af79e0ff7ceb28d3d700d326b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSXMHByspZAVzIxR__.zseA_IlKTssuQs81EsNO55PsUNkuay5UArZzsdMZ5vIryyN2vCdvQfcTyGwC.4j0BW40tZBWrPYfbTrUQpS8PQt_.2koDMhOU9LgY.nRe7l.Tz5KZV0XSxn7TGKVCCyOeGKt.ulPtj3M2WYL1uFZyOjp8JOHfvlWBXyBjJX9JIoRZJ6be.4_eEFRyw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Panos Mourdoukoutas", "published": "2018-05-15T08:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin, Gold, Stocks, Bonds, Or Real Estate: Which Is The Best Investment To Build Wealth?", "text": "Building wealth is everybody’s financial goal.

REUTERS/Bobby Yip Canaan Creative has applied to the Hong Kong stock exchange for an IPO while Zhejiang Ebang Communication has started working with advisers on a Hong Kong float, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.\nWhile the price of bitcoin BTC=BTSP has tumbled 35 percent this year and Beijing has tightened its grip on trade in the virtual currency, equipment makers are still hungry for capital to fund growth and to meet still robust demand for their machines.\nBoth are seeking as much as $1 billion, IFR said, which would dwarf other known listings for crytopcurrency firms.\nCanaan Creative declined to comment. Ebang could not be immediately reached for comment.\nFILE PHOTO: A token of the virtual currency Bitcoin is seen placed on a monitor that displays binary digits in this illustration picture, December 8, 2017. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic//File Photo Canaan estimates it supplies a quarter of the world’s bitcoin blockchain computing power, according to a Reuters interview last month with co-chairman Jianping Kong, who also expects China’s push to promote its domestic chip industry to help drive growth for the company.\nEbang delisted from China’s National Equities Exchange and Quotations, also known as the New Third Board, this year after announcing in January that it would seek a Hong Kong listing.\nWhile many companies promote links to bitcoin and, more commonly, blockchain - the distributed ledger technology that underpins bitcoin - few that focus on the cryptocurrency have listed publicly.\nIn Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014 when it merged with Macro Energy, an investing group in a deal which raised A$9.1 million ($6.8 million). The company later changed its name to DigitalX ( DCC.AX ) and switched its focus from bitcoin to fintech software.\nAnother miner, Bitcoin Group, withdrew its Sydney listing plans in 2016 after the local regulator questioned whether it would have sufficient working capital to be a going concern.\nIn Canada, Leeta Gold, a mineral exploration company, renamed itself Hive Blockchain ( HIVE.V ) last summer and partnered with Hong Kong-based Genesis Mining on a bitcoin mining facility in Iceland. It has a market capitalization of $333 million.\nCanaan was valued at about $500 million in mid-2017 according to one source cited by IFR. The valuation for its IPO has yet to be set due to a lack of companies to compare it to and fluctuating prices of cryptocurrencies, IFR Quote: d sources as saying.\nCredit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Canaan’s float, IFR added.\nCredit Suisse and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The other banks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBitcoin mining equipment makers make computers with special chips that mine the coins more efficiently than more mainstream chips made by companies such as Intel.\nReporting by Fiona Lau at IFR and Jennifer Hughes; Additional reporting by Sijia Jiang, Alun John and Julie Zhu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Edwina Gibbs\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ebang", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ifr", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "ifr fiona lau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national equities exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomson reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhejiang ebang communication", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T08:52:50.100+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "36e7869143c1143233c8f34d6c8f5fca9ee435b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.BAZVzBqOx15N0cJjmZTzTASYBRpxse0Garuwd4Hx9SrLHpkssRV4nwMTYIMX3whPDzEjAan02Qz_F6dDWtCu4xL0mZGSElYI-", "site_full": "www.aus-city.com", "site": "aus-city.com", "site_section": "http://www.aus-city.com/ubbthreads/ubbthreads.php?ubb=postlist&Board=58&page=1", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Science and Technology | AUS-CITY Message Forums", "title": "Winklevoss bitcoin exchange wins NY approval to expand, offer Zcash | Science and Technology", "title_full": "Winklevoss bitcoin exchange wins NY approval to expand, offer Zcash | Science and Technology | AUS-CITY Message Forums", "published": "2018-05-15T08:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.056, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "36e7869143c1143233c8f34d6c8f5fca9ee435b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.BAZVzBqOx15N0cJjmZTzTASYBRpxse0Garuwd4Hx9SrLHpkssRV4nwMTYIMX3whPDzEjAan02Qz_F6dDWtCu4xL0mZGSElYI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Webmaster", "published": "2018-05-15T08:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Winklevoss bitcoin exchange wins NY approval to expand, offer Zcash | Science and Technology", "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) -

Inputs refer to previously created UTXOs, while outputs generate new ones. Therefore, when creating a transaction each input spends a UTXO and each outputs creates one.\nOutputs structure\nOutputs is what contains the so called locking script, or how it is normally referred in a transaction, the scriptPubKey . Such an script contains the condition required to spend such a UTXO.\nInputs structure\nInputs contain references to previously created UTXOs (through the prev_tx_id and prev_out_index fields). Moreover, inputs contain the so called unlocking scripts, or how they are normally referred, scriptSig . Such scripts require the proof of fulfilment of the conditions specified in the UTXO each input is trying to redeem.\nExamples\nThe most commonly used transactions in Bitcoin, and therefore the most common example of this, are Pay-to-PubKey-Hash (P2PKH) transactions, or transactions that pay to a Bitcoin address. A script \"paying to a Bitcoin address\" will require that you can proof to be the \"owner\" of such an address. Let's see how this works:\nP2PKH transaction\nA transaction creating a P2PKH UTXO will have a scriptPubKey looking as follows:\nScriptPubKey = OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <hash160(pubKey)> OP_EQUAL OP_CHECKSIG\nWhereas a transaction tying to redeem such an UTXO as an input, will have a scriptSig looking as follows:\nScriptSig = <sig><pubKey>\nIf we put both scripts together in a stack, like Bitcoin will does, what we get is the following script:\n<sig><pubKey> OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <hash160(pubKey)> OP_EQUAL OP_CHECKSIG\nIn order to analyze the script you should have two things in mind. There are two types of clauses, opcodes and data (represented between <> ). Moreover, scripts are read left to right, and data is used as input to opcodes.\nThe execution of the script will first duplicate the public key (since is the first operation of the script), and compute the hash160 of it.

Than go down to 8'300 (and lower).\nThe short term looks to be developing so that the B wave (blue) is in progress. B waves always have three subwaves (red abc). The blue C wave is what might cause some fear as it could bring the price down to $7,800 or so. However, there is a scenario for the price to dip even lower than where it is which means blue wave A is not done yet. Still his main scenario remains a bounce of 7'800.\nThis morning the waves show a potential for blue wave 2 being in progress already! He sees us going down to the area of 8'400 - 8'000 and considers this a buy opportunity. For Wave 3 he sees a potential of minimum 14'000.\nSince finding support at 8'200 bitcoin has regained 250. For rest of the weekend he expects further sideways activity.\nIf bitcoin moves below 8'367 (daily close) he expects 7'770.\nIf bitcoin moves above 8'643 (daily close) he expects that we see 9'460.\nTodays trend is neutral. Expected trading for today is between 7'770 and 9'050.\nWe see a massive rejection at 10'000 range and have now hit a 0.618 golden ratio fibonacci retracement level. I do not believe it'll hold and we can see 9'050 to 9'150 range. If that doesn't hold we go for 8'200 to 8'620 range.\nIf the preferred bullish count is to remain in place, bitcoin could go down as low as 7'887, which is a 0.618 fib retracement of the entire bullish advance from lows printed on April 9th. Short-term trend is down, and the 9'577 level is “key” upside resistance. If crossed we will see a short-term move above the recent print high of 9'948. If 9'577 holds we will see further downside consolidation before next bullish run higher.\nSummary of targets/support/resistance\nDefinition light blue highlighted = all content that changed since last update. sentiment = how in general the analysts see the current situation (bearish = lower prices more likely / bullish = higher prices more likely) target = the next (short term) price target an analysts mentions. This might be next day or in a few days. It might be that an analyst is bullish but sees a short term pull-back so giving nevertheless a lower (short term) target. support/res(istance) = Most significant support or resistances mentioned by the analysts. If those are breached a significant move to the upside or downside is expected. bottom = -> now renamed and moved to long term table. Low 2018 low/top 2018 = what is the low or the top expected for 2018?

The 200 SMA also lines up with the downtrend line to add to its strength as a ceiling.\nHowever, the gap between the moving averages is narrowing to signal a potential upward crossover or return in bullish momentum. The 100 SMA might also be able to hold as dynamic support. If so, a move past the trend line, swing high and $9000 mark could confirm that an uptrend is taking place.\nRSI is turning lower to show that sellers have the upper hand. Stochastic has also made its way out of the overbought zone and is heading south, so bitcoin price might follow suit. The 38.2% extension is at the $8400 area and the 50% level is close to the swing low. Stronger selling momentum could take bitcoin price to the 78.6% extension at $7913 or the full extension at $7650.\nBTC/USD 1-hour Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin price seems to be off to another shaky start for the week as another failed attempt at breaking past $9,000 has drawn more selling pressure and spooked some bulls. However, positive updates in the industry are still popping up and could ultimately allow the climb to resume.\nAt the moment, what’s keeping investors on edge is the possibility that Mt. Gox will short another set of bitcoin to pay off its creditors. An estimated 8,000 coins are still up for selling, so this could have a huge weight on price.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T15:33:12.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "01dda1cfe81180921ebe71bc18e53408f158f7a6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTYqHl8Pgxbii.5dx3atwgzb1zZNYpimbcKA.qKSicQ8W_gdY4UCvW1fU3NCVlVqSD_11z4L1dNXrzxah07nCdG", "site_full": "anuntul-gratuit.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://anuntul-gratuit.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Anuntul-Gratuit - AnuntulZero.ro", "title": "Bitcoin Gratis", "title_full": "Bitcoin Gratis", "published": "2018-05-15T07:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "RO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "01dda1cfe81180921ebe71bc18e53408f158f7a6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTYqHl8Pgxbii.5dx3atwgzb1zZNYpimbcKA.qKSicQ8W_gdY4UCvW1fU3NCVlVqSD_11z4L1dNXrzxah07nCdG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "dany (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-15T07:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Gratis", "text": "https://freebitco.in/?r=12166087\nDetalii: Bitcoin Gratis\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T07:49:29.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4393b0b995f68575ee25db325ea135b536b19dd6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9cAvseD0_zSw1pDnFswq5jHsorsVuabObsUuysL1kyLbX4fnrAQt2YylZhDOyZ11gsHukySA72zx.gOGkT6Hq95I0W_608X2q0J_WYslKMRxpdHn2R9lfrFLkQl3.1Fc-", "site_full": "btcmanager.com", "site": "btcmanager.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoinschannel.com/feed", "site_categories": ["tech", "business"], "section_title": "Bitcoins Channel", "title": "Greek Authorities Crushed a Murder Plot Against Alleged Bitcoin Fraudster", "title_full": "Greek Authorities Crushed a Murder Plot Against Alleged Bitcoin Fraudster", "published": "2018-05-15T07:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitcoinschannel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image1-300x179.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4393b0b995f68575ee25db325ea135b536b19dd6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9cAvseD0_zSw1pDnFswq5jHsorsVuabObsUuysL1kyLbX4fnrAQt2YylZhDOyZ11gsHukySA72zx.gOGkT6Hq95I0W_608X2q0J_WYslKMRxpdHn2R9lfrFLkQl3.1Fc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "writer", "published": "2018-05-15T07:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Greek Authorities Crushed a Murder Plot Against Alleged Bitcoin Fraudster", "text": "OldTwitter Murder Plot Not Connected to Special Services\nSources close to the case firmly believe that Vinnik’s murder attempt isn’t connected to special forces of any nation, noting that the murder attempt is linked to the underworld as many were not happy about Vinnik’s blocked extradition to the United States.\n“It all began after Vinniks’s extradition to the United States was blocked. There [are] people who are extremely interested in him not coming to Russia. The assassination was ordered by some unknown person from Russia,” the source noted.\nThough sources have said simple criminals orchestrated the murder plot, that claim may not be one hundred percent correct. Notably, Vinnik wrote an “acknowledgment of guilt” in Russia, stating that “he knows about crimes committed in the sphere of financial technologies ,” adding that “he is ready to give testimony in Russia and assist the investigation.”\nIn essence, there is a chance that Vinnik has some vital information that could lead to the arrest of some heavyweights in the cryptosphere, hence the suspected attempts to poison him, in a bid to silence him forever.\nSince Vinnik’s arrest on July 26, 2017, there have been many unanswered questions concerning his involvement in the Mt.Gox hack. Amidst this backdrop, the US government and its law enforcement agencies requested the extradition of Vinnik to the States in a bid to solve the puzzles, but their efforts proved futile as the suspect’s lawyer explained that Vinnik would appeal the extradition ruling at the European Court of Human Rights.\nIn October 2017, BTCManager reported that the Russian Foreign Ministry had condemned Vinnik’s extradition to the United States. Boris Zilberman , a Russian analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, reiterated that:\n“[Vinnik’s] only bargaining chip is to turn over what he knows. And nobody knows what he could say. Was he purely a lone actor? Does he know the wider chart of people involved across these currency spaces conducting this type of behavior? Can he flip on others?” he also continued by saying:\n“Everyone is worrying about the unknowns. And the murkiest questions is – the $4 billion that he was laundering – who and what were involved? If you’re taking the more conspiratorial viewpoint, you ask, are the Russians afraid of Vinnik turning that information to the U.S.?”\nToo many unanswered questions indeed and the puzzles could remain unsolved for many years to come.
