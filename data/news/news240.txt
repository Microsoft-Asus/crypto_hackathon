Remember that it's only the beginning of bitcoin era.\nWell do not compare Bitcoin with other crypto currency Bitcoin has a life time demands and the other currency they just make little markets and whenever there is a drop in the value, the never recover and burst like a bubble and Bitcoin have potential to gain its original position again.

(i.e. escrow agent can't steal the funds)\nI realize that in order for this to work the custom locking script of the escrow transaction somehow has to reference the money destination 's address and provide some mechanism such that when the escrow transaction 's locking script is unlocked it checks that the transaction it is being used in is in fact going to the money destination .\nIt seems that one cannot directly reference the output address of the spending transaction when the spending transaction is being verified. The only way it seems to have the output address be part of the verification is indirectly via CHECKSIG (since the data being signed include the output address of the spending transaction ) But in order for this to work we would need to sign the spending transaction and include that signature in the escrow transaction , but that creates a circular dependency: the escrow transaction includes a signature of the spending transaction which includes the hash of the escrow transaction (since the escrow transaction is an input to the spending transaction ). And so this would be impossible. I wish there was a hashtype that allowed you to only sign the output side of the transaction and not the inputs at all.\nI'm pretty new to bitcoin, so maybe I'm missing something. But it seems that designing an escrow with the properties I described at the beginning of this question would be impossible, and the only way to do escrow is a standard P2SH 2 of 3 multisig.\nThe reason I don't want to do a standard multisig is that in order for it to work in a trustless way. the money source and money destination have to exchange their addresses directly (i.e. the escrow agent can't give the other 2 parties the appropriate addresses, because he could give out the wrong addresses). This way when the escrow agent signs the txn and gives it to the other party to sign they can verify that the escrow agent signed it to go to the right place.\nI'd like the escrow agent to be the point of contact for the other 2 parties so that they don't need to do an address exchange prior to working with the escrow agent but can still not have to trust the escrow agent", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T05:47:38.085+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4f37ce88d9e2121bef6de9909ae8c48945c8b982", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS7QckQncnd5tFXxyOPsVBP61mSz7t1kScQFQwX4QffnebV5Ucm3O4.LqFSfKn4AUtRcLRwstPHWm0HUmrezLreEpnUFczOVTV3dgLANhGjiTnjrClUZGpgXmR.HgP69Ag-", "site_full": "theenterpriseleader.com", "site": "theenterpriseleader.com", "site_section": "https://theenterpriseleader.com/feed/atom", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Enterprise Leader", "title": "Bitcoin Red (BTCRED) Tops 1-Day Trading Volume of $155.00", "title_full": "Bitcoin Red (BTCRED) Tops 1-Day Trading Volume of $155.00", "published": "2018-05-17T05:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/2093.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4f37ce88d9e2121bef6de9909ae8c48945c8b982", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS7QckQncnd5tFXxyOPsVBP61mSz7t1kScQFQwX4QffnebV5Ucm3O4.LqFSfKn4AUtRcLRwstPHWm0HUmrezLreEpnUFczOVTV3dgLANhGjiTnjrClUZGpgXmR.HgP69Ag-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Maurice Goldstein", "published": "2018-05-17T05:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Red (BTCRED) Tops 1-Day Trading Volume of $155.00", "text": "Posted by Maurice Goldstein on May 16th, 2018 // No Comments\nBitcoin Red (CURRENCY:BTCRED) traded 0% lower against the dollar during the 1 day period ending at 22:00 PM Eastern on May 16th.

Then it will boost the shop or the store's income and the tax of that store will go up too and it will help the country to have a better income which will help itself to improve its system and economy\nIt can either boost the economy, or break the economy. I agree with you, bitcoin can boost the economy because people will earn a lot of money when the price rise, they can buy expensive things at the store that will cause a great circulation of money, and income also in the country. But at the same time, it can break the economy, because the price of bitcoin is not very stable. We can't really predict if it's gonna boost, or break the economy system because it is volatile.\nNo, at the begin, you do not understand the nature of cryptocurrency market and the Bitcoin value. You have a profit from an order bought Bitcoin at the low price and sold that amount at the high price. It is the truth. But, the person bought that amount at that price can have the profit if the price of Bitcoin decreases after you sold for this person??? Of course, never! So, the cryptocurrency market is simply a place to \"exchange\" money.

The price of one bitcoin peaked in December to almost $20,000 and has since dropped to less than half that.\nDorsey, a known bitcoin enthusiast, said he believes the internet will have its own “native currency.” He said he hoped that would be bitcoin. “I am a huge fan,” he said.\nA spokesman for Square told Reuters that the company does not have figures to share on Dorsey’s bitcoin and cryptocurrency holdings.\nDorsey said wider acceptance of bitcoin could help Square expand globally.\n“If we were able to use it as a currency today (…) we could release our apps in every app store around the world,” he said.

Kotadiya along with others inlcuding 10 cops had allegedly hatched conspiracy to abduct a businessman Shailesh Bhatt seeking Bitcoins in ransom.\nAdditional sessions judge Pratik Tamakuwala while allowing the plea of the prosecution issued the warrant under section 70 of Criminal procedure code (CRPC) on Thursday against Kotadiya and considered the CID’s argument that the accused BJP leader has not been cooperating with the probe.\n\"There is material and evidence regarding substantiating the allegation and it has also emerged from the record that though summons were issued twice and Kotadia himself has assured to remained present and thereby has not cooperated with the investigating agency and so the warrant is required to be issued as prayed by the investigating officer,\" said the court in its order.\n\"With a warrant under section 70 of the CrPC, CID can notify Gujarat police and other agencies and seek help from police and investigating agencies from outside the state to find and arrest Kotadiya,\" a CID official said.\nCourt also observed that the paper on records substantiated Kotadiya’s involvement in the offence.\nKotadiya, the former MLA from Dhari in Amreli district, is accused in the Bitcoin (cryptocurrency) extortion case in which several police officials, including a superintendent of police and an inspector of the local crime branch, have been arrested.\nAdvocate Sudhir Brahmbhatt on behalf of CID submitted before the court that it had issued summonses to Kotadiya under section 160 of CrPC, asking him to appear before it on two occasions, but he had failed to do so.\n\"Police teams have not been able to find Kotadiya, despite going to his residence and a place where he was believed to be hiding at.

Although the block size increase is quite a feat, BCH developers have also expanded the network’s default data-carrier-size to 220 Bytes and re-enabled some old Satoshi OP_Codes that were previously removed from earlier codebases. Now over the past 24-hours, lots of people have been playing around with the new BCH features.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Cash Upgrade Milestone Complete: 32MB and New Features Experimenting With the New Bitcoin Cash OP_Codes\nLots of BCH community members have been discussing the new OP_Code features and the additional space added to the network’s default data-carrier-size. The first signs of people messing around with the new features came from the Memo and Blockpress developers as both platform’s increased posting character limit from 79 to 217. Both Memo and Blockpress (featured above) now have 217 characters.\nThis means users of both social media applications can now post more content and everything is saved on-chain. Then shortly after the fork, another OP_Code feature was shown to the community by Openbazaar developer Chris Pacia. The First Tree Signature on the Bitcoin Cash Blockchain\nPacia built the first tree signature on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain by utilizing the OP_CAT functionality — which creates a more efficient multi-signature combination. The Openbazaar programmer explains for addresses with a large number of keys, a tree signature can use less data. “For addresses with a large number of keys a tree signature can use less data. And unlike normal OP_CHECKMULTISIG, it doesn’t require you to expose the keys that were not used in the signing,” Pacia explains to the BCH community on May 15. Moreover, Pacia shows his demonstration via a block explorer URL which indicates it was a 1 of 8 multi-sig tree signature. Chris Pacia’s multi-sig tree.\nMany individuals were very impressed with the new multi-sig operation that shows innovation in multi-signature technology, and one that could add more BCH privacy in the future. Pacia details his example is a subset of MAST — which stands for ‘Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees.’ MAST could improve BCH privacy because certain multi-sig scripts could be kept hidden.\n“This is like a subset of MAST,” Pacia explains.\nMAST is more general but can’t be done with the current opcodes as far as I know — If we had OP_EVAL then we could I think. An OP_Code Puzzle With a Message in the Script\nAfter the tree signature our Chief Technology Officer, Emil Oldenburg, also experimented with the Satoshi OP_Codes and created a ‘transaction puzzle.’ When the puzzle is solved it contains a secret message within the hashed script.\n“I made a fun little transaction puzzle with one of the new OP_Codes,” Oldenburg explains .\nThe puzzle is solved with the string “BCH is the best Bitcoin”. The script is <String1><String2> OP_XOR OP_HASH256 <hash1> OP_EQUAL. It’s solved by finding the secret String1 that when XORed with String2, after hashing should be equal to hash1. Etching the Bible’s 23,000 Verses Into the Bitcoin Cash Blockchain\nLastly, another anonymous user is pushing the ‘arbitrary data spam debate’ to the ultimate level. The Twitter handle UK Cryptocurrency showed the cryptocurrency community that a BCH address is currently writing the first testament of the King James Bible to the Bitcoin Cash blockchain at 1sat/Byte. Looking at the Bitcoin Cash transaction ID its Memo states:\n1 In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth.\nTransactions following this continue to be written in the BCH chain with each verse that’s found in the King James Bible. This address is etching the entire Bible into the blockchain.\nUK Cryptocurrency estimates that the entire Bible may cost around $100 USD (0.08 BCH) and add around 8MB to the BCH chain. Of course, many Bitcoin Cash fans were excited to see the many OP_Code developments unfold so fast and expect more innovative ideas will sprout down the line.\nWhat do you think about all the OP_Code experimentation over the past day? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments below.\nImages via Shutterstock, Reddit, the Bitcoin.com Block Explorer, and Blockpress.\nWant to see all those Memo posts and OP_Codes in the BCH Chain?

But estimating exactly how much electricity the Bitcoin network uses, necessary for understanding its impact and implementing policy, remains a challenge. In the first rigorously peer-reviewed article quantifying Bitcoin’s energy requirements, a Commentary appearing May 16 in the journal Joule , financial economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries uses a new methodology to pinpoint where Bitcoin’s electric energy consumption is headed and how soon it might get there.\n“We’ve seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I’m hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research,” said de Vries, who works at the Experience Center of PwC in the Netherlands and is the founder of Digiconomist (@DigiEconomist), a blog that aims to better inform cryptocurrency users.\nHis estimates, based in economics, put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland. A single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. By the end of this year, he predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts–as much as Austria and half of a percent of the world’s total consumption.\n“To me, half a percent is already quite shocking. It’s an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,” he said.\nIf the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, de Vries believes the network could someday consume 5% of the world’s electricity. “That would be quite bad.”\nBitcoin is dependent on computers that time-stamp transactions into an ongoing chain to prevent duplicate spending of coins. Computers in the network perform calculations continuously, competing for the chance, once every ten minutes, to be appointed to create the next block of transactions in the chain. The user of the computer that wins is awarded 12.5 new coins–a process known as “mining” Bitcoin. But all the time, even the users that don’t win are expending computing power. ”\nYou are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you’re using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there’s a big incentive for people to increase how much they’re spending on electricity and on machines,” de Vries said.\nIt’s figuring out when that incentive stops paying off that is at the heart of de Vries’s estimation method. Economic principles suggest that the entire Bitcoin network will eventually reach an equilibrium where the costs of the hardware and electricity used to mine equal the value of the Bitcoin being mined. And that information can approximate the total amount of electricity that the network will use at said equilibrium.\nOther researchers have used the fundamentals of this method before, but de Vries goes farther. He uses production information about Bitmain, the biggest manufacturer of Bitcoin mining machines, to estimate both how much of a miner’s costs are associated with hardware rather than electricity and when this equilibrium might be reached. And while he does have confidence in his estimates, the problem with this method is that these manufacturers are extremely secretive.\n“Sometimes the best information we’ve got is really shaky eyewitness accounts. That’s the stuff we have to work with,” de Vries said.\nStill, de Vries believes that getting a good estimate is important in determining the sustainability of cryptocurrencies moving forward and in helping shape policy around them. Some states in the U.S. have already started to put restrictions around Bitcoin mining.\n“But you need to base your policy on something. And I think that my method is important in that regard, because it’s very forward-looking. It’s focused not on the now, but on where we’re headed. And I think that’s something you really need to know if you’re going to draft policy about it,” de Vries said.\nDe Vries also pointed out that there is plenty of room for discussion of his method.\n“I think everyone agrees on the minimum energy consumption. But the future estimate? That’s actually quite debatable. We don’t really have a common approach to getting to a future estimate of electricity consumption right now, which is why I am hoping to get this conversation started. I’m doing this research, but a lot of people should be doing it,” de Vries said.

After climbing from around $3,000 in September to around $7,850 more recently, the price of the currency fell back, reaching as low as $5,600. It’s since recovered some of its lost ground but for anyone with large bitcoin holdings, the movements have been large enough to strike some serious fears. It wouldn’t be the first time. Between June 11th and July 16th, the price of bitcoin fell by a third from just over $3,000 to a little under $2,000. At the start of September, it was worth about $5,000; two weeks later, you could buy a bitcoin for $3,226. So when the price of bitcoin takes a dive the first thing to remember is that this is normal. Investing in a cryptocurrency isn’t like buying a government bond. There are no guarantees and no regulations. The price moves all over the place–and just as it can drop like a rock, it can also rise like a rocket. And often in quick succession. The second thing to do is to look for the reason for this movement. The fall in mid-November came after a specific event. A group of developers and miners called off a plan to hard-fork the currency again. Segwit2x would have created a new form of bitcoin that allowed for larger blocks. In effect, it would have created faster and cheaper transactions. When the plan failed, some people moved their money into Bitcoin Cash, a faster form of bitcoin created from a previous fork. The coin shot past Ethereum to hit a market capitalization of $30 billion. The value of Bitcoin Cash doubled in 24 hours. That’s a good reason for a decline. Bitcoin Cash has some advantages that bitcoin lacks. Some investors would have been holding out for the fork so when it went through they bought what was available. Analysts expected the price of bitcoin to flatten out at around $5,000 . There’s no way to know whether they’re right, of course. No one can predict which way the market will go–no matter how well-versed they are on cryptocurrencies–so you just have to make your own predictions. Deciding whether to stick or bail, or even buy and hope that the market rises again is always going to be something of an intelligent gamble. Once you’ve found the reason for a sudden price drop, you’ll have to decide whether you think that reason has a price floor or whether it’s fatal enough to send the price even lower. There are no easy answers when investing in bitcoin. Just understand that the ride is always going to have some scary moments, and when those moments strike, ask yourself whether a ride this rough is really for you. If you’re prepared to hold on through those dips, and if you can afford to lose your investment, then don’t sweat the falls any more than you should get too excited about the sudden rises. But if you do need that cash, you might want to look at those dips as a warning to find somewhere more stable to keep your savings.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share", "http://inc.com/joel-comm/what-bitcoin-gold-means-for-you.html", "http://inc.com/joel-comm/5-reasons-bitcoin-is-both-less-free-more-secure-than-you-think.html", "https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-drops-6000-will-find-floor/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin falls may tweet bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T01:22:00.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4789a6787daf87e53ccfcece06e0152c92f9a11e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS_7zgJLo.SVbrHiBI__CyzHOhQ2x9QUAq7Xfx0EpgJ77STByajn4tp3lfrEBMsLdnrosQZ5kC08A--", "site_full": "22ticks.com", "site": "22ticks.com", "site_section": "https://22ticks.com/feed", "site_categories": ["mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "22TICKS LIFESTYLE BLOG", "title": "Bitcoins next move will tell us a lot", "title_full": "Bitcoins next move will tell us a lot", "published": "2018-05-17T04:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://22ticks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ElLgHG.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4789a6787daf87e53ccfcece06e0152c92f9a11e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS_7zgJLo.SVbrHiBI__CyzHOhQ2x9QUAq7Xfx0EpgJ77STByajn4tp3lfrEBMsLdnrosQZ5kC08A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-17T04:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoins next move will tell us a lot", "text": "வாயு தொல்லை உணவுகளும் தீர... வாயு தொல்லை உணவுகளும் தீர்வும் - Gas Trouble reason an... 10 views Gonorrhea Symptoms | Gon...

Every investment and trading move involves risk; you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. St. Louis Fed president James Bullard said that Bitcoin could emerge as a possible competitor to the US dollar in the future. He also did not rule out the prospects of the FED launching its own cryptocurrency, though he said that there was no plan at the moment. Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the fifth largest bank in the world by assets, is exploring options to launch its own cryptocurrency, known as MUFG Coin . It plans to test it by the next year. The existing cryptocurrencies are gearing up for a likely competition by introducing upgrades that can improve operations. Additionally, the crypto exchanges are launching new products targeting the institutional investors. All of these point to the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies and the acceptance that the blockchain technology can be a game changer. The long-term investors should welcome any fall in prices as it offers an opportunity to buy the digital currencies at a discount. Let’s see if we find any buy setups today. BTC/USD Bitcoin has broken below the 50-day SMA after holding it for the past four days, which is a bearish development. The only major support now is $7,941.68. If this level breaks, a drop to $7,000 is likely. If the $7,941.68 level holds, the BTC/USD pair might enter a period of consolidation between $7,941-$10,000. Once the range is confirmed, we shall try to trade it by buying close to the support and covering the position at the resistance. Currently, there are no buy setups, hence, we suggest waiting until a reliable pattern develops. ETH/USD Ethereum failed to break out of $745 on May 14 and turned down from there. It has broken below the 20-day EMA today. The small neckline of a possible head and shoulders pattern is providing a strong support level. Today, prices have rebounded sharply from it. The ETH/USD pair might consolidate between the neckline of the bearish pattern and $745. A break above the overhead resistance will be a positive move. Therefore, we suggest long positions above $750 with a close stop loss. The immediate target is a move to $838. This is a risky trade, hence we recommend traders to take a small position (about 30 percent of usual). If the bears succeed in breaking and closing below the neckline, the bearish pattern will complete, giving it a target of $418. However, we believe that $600, which is the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level and the 50-day SMA will act as strong support on the downside. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash has broken down of the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. If it closes (UTC) below the neckline, it will have a pattern target of $650. However, the bulls are unlikely to give up without a fight. The levels to watch out for on the downside are the horizontal support at $1221 and the 50-day SMA. We anticipate a bounce from either of these two levels. However, it is difficult to predict whether the rebound will sustain or fail. Though the 20-day EMA is turning down, the 50-day SMA is still trending up. Hence, we believe that the BCH/USD pair is unlikely to sink to $650. If the $1221 support holds, a range bound action is probable. It is not clear whether the digital currency will go up or down from the present levels. Hence, we would prefer to watch from the sidelines. XRP/USD Ripple could not scale above the $0.76 levels on May 14, resulting in a slide below the 50-day SMA. The next support on the downside is the May 12 lows of $0.632. A break below this will sink the digital currency to the $0.562 levels. If the XRP/USD pair manages to stay above the $0.63 levels, the bulls will again try to break out of the overhead resistance at $0.76. The 20-day EMA is turning down while the 50-day SMA is flattening out. As prices are quoting below both the moving averages and are some distance away from the critical support of the large range, we shall not propose any long positions. XLM/USD Stellar turned down from the 20-day EMA as higher levels lacked buyers. Currently, prices are back at the 50-day SMA, which is critical support. If this level breaks, the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern is the final support. The bearish pattern will complete on a breakdown and close (UTC time frame) below the neckline. The pattern target of such a break is way lower at $0.2. If the XLM/USD pair either holds the neckline or the 50-day SMA, a range bound action will ensue. Any more above the overhead resistance of $0.47766719 will be very bullish because it will invalidate the bearish pattern. We shall look for buying opportunities above $0.373 levels. LTC/USD The recovery in Litecoin hit a brick wall at the 20-day EMA on May 14. Currently, prices are again back below the horizontal support at $141. A break below the May 12 lows of $132.163 will open a downside target of $115. Both the moving averages are turning down. This increases the probability of a drop to the critical support levels of $115, which is expected to hold. If this support breaks, the LTC/USD pair will complete a bearish descending triangle pattern on a breakdown below $107, which will be very negative. The digital currency is showing weakness; hence, we have no buy recommendations. We shall change our view if the bulls manage to hold the May 12 lows and break out of $170. ADA/BTC Cardano is unable to find buyers at a higher level. The bounce off the trendline and the 50-day SMA on May 12 did not even break above the 20-day EMA. Prices are again back at the supports, increasing the chances of a breakdown. The 0.000025 levels had held up nicely from April 13 to April 15. So, if the ADA/BTC pair breaks the trendline, it can drop to this level. The 20-day EMA will continue to act as resistance on any up move. The digital currency will pick up momentum after scaling 0.00003445 levels. IOTA/USD IOTA has not done a great deal in the past five days. It is stuck between the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. On the upside, immediate resistance is at the 20-day EMA and once this level is crossed the next hurdle is at $2.2117 levels. On the downside, supports exist at the 50-day SMA and $1.63. Both the moving averages are flattening out, which increases the possibility of a range bound action. We don’t find any buy setup on the IOTUSD pair, hence, are not suggesting any trade on it. EOS/USD EOS continues to correct. It is currently at the 50-day SMA, just below the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally. This is a critical level and should hold. The subsequent bounce will face resistance at the 20-day EMA and the top trendline of the descending channel. If the EOS/USD pair breaks below the 50-day SMA, it can decline to the next support at the bottom trendline at $10. The digital currency has lost momentum and is likely to remain range bound for a few days before starting a new trend. We shall revisit our view if it breaks out and sustains above the descending channel for a couple of days.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

astonishing amount of energy and it’s only getting worse Wednesday, May 16, 2018 · 8:59 pm · 22 Comments “It takes a lot of electricity to mine bitcoins, and as more miners try to cash in on the crypto craze, the amount of energy required to win new coins increases accordingly,” George Dvorsky reports for Gizmodo. “New research suggests the entire bitcoin network could consume as much as 7.7 gigawatts of electricity by the end of this year—enough to power a country the size of Austria. But the new analysis is not without its critics, who say there are many other factors to consider.”\n“By the end of this year, bitcoin could use half a percent of the world’s electric energy, according to research published today in the science journal Joule ,” Dvorsky reports. “What’s more, if bitcoin’s value rises as high as some experts predict, the network could eventually consume upwards of five percent of the world’s electricity.”\n“That’s shocking, to say the least, if not completely absurd. If true, it means bitcoin in its current state is grossly inefficient, completely unsustainable, and an environmental menace,” Dvorsky reports. “But as critics of the new study are quick to point out, the new paper is predicated on several shaky assumptions, insufficient evidence, and an eye towards the status quo in terms of how new technologies and regulations might alter the situation.”\nRead more in the full article here .\nMacDailyNews Take: And the planet was literally consumed by greed.\nSEE ALSO:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://gizmodo.com/alarming-study-suggests-bitcoin-consumes-an-astonishing-1826075745"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "george dvorsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gizmodo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dvorsky", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T15:58:10.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "86f2cfb5b5d0b5a738beef2d0c99c58a5a768bf6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaAhp8JzFssLAxMAId006H3TDZgGkVCDknm4iaCz3qAkxisizgqGqW1nhSdnx7JOHSsAGqu.nbYoQRHCko5OydTIM1eIHaJGu5", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "BITCOIN: Countries or governments cannot really ban BITCOIN, all they can do is pass regulations...", "title_full": "BITCOIN: Countries or governments cannot really ban BITCOIN, all they can do is pass regulations... : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-17T03:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "86f2cfb5b5d0b5a738beef2d0c99c58a5a768bf6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaAhp8JzFssLAxMAId006H3TDZgGkVCDknm4iaCz3qAkxisizgqGqW1nhSdnx7JOHSsAGqu.nbYoQRHCko5OydTIM1eIHaJGu5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "DeepBlueMachine", "published": "2018-05-17T03:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "BITCOIN: Countries or governments cannot really ban BITCOIN, all they can do is pass regulations...", "text": "submitted by /u/DeepBlueMachine\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/can-india-really-ban-bitcoin-is-it-possible-at-all-to-do-so/articleshow/64191614.cms"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T23:03:54.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "951b92b60fc6d6a9344a41ea63f469ac528994e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8U8nILRnMzuniZkJE_6gXXml_I7KjTUsJjdMMVD6GYjDPHR8JkimEdGVMoykdS8huOqriqlr7Tuhp1vQpsAwI_RzSYWrF4GKq9k0ahu5YVsMcdfvp9voCcWz00WE98OV8-", "site_full": "www.toptechnicalsolutions.com", "site": "toptechnicalsolutions.com", "site_section": "http://www.toptechnicalsolutions.com/feed", "site_categories": ["pc_support", "tech"], "section_title": "Top Technical Solutions", "title": "Bitcoin Cash News | Network Updates and Support From Roger Ver", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash News | Network Updates and Support From Roger Ver", "published": "2018-05-17T03:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cryptocurrencynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/Bitcoin-Cash-News-678x381.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "951b92b60fc6d6a9344a41ea63f469ac528994e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8U8nILRnMzuniZkJE_6gXXml_I7KjTUsJjdMMVD6GYjDPHR8JkimEdGVMoykdS8huOqriqlr7Tuhp1vQpsAwI_RzSYWrF4GKq9k0ahu5YVsMcdfvp9voCcWz00WE98OV8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Caroline Harris", "published": "2018-05-17T03:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash News | Network Updates and Support From Roger Ver", "text": "by Caroline Harris\nBitcoin Cash (BCH), ranked as the fourth largest cryptocurrency, is down today — as with the rest of top-ten coins, though. This may come as a surprise to some, considering there was some major Bitcoin Cash news circulating yesterday. Specifically, news regarding Roger Ver and his bullish stance on Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Daily Chart\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently selling for $1,282.43. This puts BCH down 6.40% in the past twenty-four hours. Source: CoinMarketCap\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) has a market cap of $21.97 billion, putting it below Ripple (XRP) and ahead of Litecoin (LTC). Bitcoin Cash News | May 16, 2018\nYesterday, Roger Ver, sometimes referred to as “Bitcoin Jesus,” reiterated just how bullish he is about Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Last week , Ver stated that he believed Bitcoin Cash (BCH) would generate enough gains to surpass Bitcoin (BTC). This week, he’s still on the Bitcoin Cash train, but this time, he’s comparing BCH to the likes of Bitcoin core. Note that Bitcoin is being written as Bitcoin core in this article, in order to differentiate it. Bitcoin Cash works as money. Bitcoin Core does not. #dealwithit https://t.co/jErvlieH8J\n— Roger Ver (@rogerkver) May 15, 2018\nIn an interview with CNBC, Ver, who was one of the first individuals to invest in Bitcoin (BTC), stated that the Bitcoin core software has become “slow,” as well as “unreliable,” and “expensive.” As a result, Ver recommended Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to the public. The early investor added that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is on the right economic path, and that’s why he is as bullish about it as he was about Bitcoin seven years ago. There are multiple Bitcoins, just like there are multiple blockchains but only #BitcoinCash conforms to the version of Bitcoin described by Satoshi in his white paper. pic.twitter.com/dXSqPO5ePA\n— Roger Ver (@rogerkver) May 15, 2018 More Bitcoin Cash News\nAside from Roger Ver’s statements, yesterday saw more news surface regarding Bitcoin Cash. For instance, Bitcoin Cash created a new blockchain yesterday. How? By using block size limits of 32 MB. Unfortunately, however, this news was not as positive as the comments of Mr. Ver. BCH’s value dropped roughly 5% following the upgrade.\n— Bitcoin Cash (@BITCOlNCASH) May 15, 2018 Bitcoin Cash Community Response\nSo, what’s the BCH community saying on social media? Does the community agree with Ver? The consensus seems to be a little scrambled. While people have a love for BCH, not everyone agrees with Ver; some even called him a scammer.\nWhat do you think? Let me know. On the 15th of May, I’ll be popping the champagne, not to celebrate high fees, but to celebrate continued low fees, privacy enablements, smart contract capabilities, and PayPal level throughput capability. #BitcoinCash\n— Eli Afram (@justicemate) May 12, 2018 Well known scammer Roger Ver is obviously paying corrupt news broadcast CNBC, cause nobody calls him bitcoin Jesus anymore after he’s gone mad and bcash started to poison his mind.\n— Koen Rouwhorst ⚡️ (@KarmosKoen) May 16, 2018 There is a more fitting moniker: ‘Bitcoin Judas’ pic.twitter.com/02oJx63aBR", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cryptocurrencynews.com/daily-news/bitcoin-news/roger-ver-eth-bch-reigns/", "https://twitter.com/BITCOlNCASH/status/996448841741168640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/KarmosKoen/status/996626210196279299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/dXSqPO5ePA", "https://t.co/02oJx63aBR", "https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/996391780487606279?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/justicemate/status/995235914291990528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/#charts", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/dealwithit?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/996508719549562880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/jErvlieH8J", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BitcoinCash?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roger ver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caroline harris bitcoin cash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin cash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin jesus", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin cash news | network updates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ltc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinmarketcap bitcoin cash", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T04:00:38.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5718de40b9d4864d7a1286712cd9d0aaa5fc9a7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0aoz30jzwY2Mi_mIF7i4KSm8oNAotvqhIoYDXdKQY3xFSATmgVSHdGubsUmHVa5nQ--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "(BitMain’s Main Competitor is Planning for a $1 billion IPO) Bitcoin (BTC) Technical Analysis", "title_full": "(BitMain’s Main Competitor is Planning for a $1 billion IPO) Bitcoin (BTC) Technical Analysis", "published": "2018-05-17T03:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5718de40b9d4864d7a1286712cd9d0aaa5fc9a7a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0aoz30jzwY2Mi_mIF7i4KSm8oNAotvqhIoYDXdKQY3xFSATmgVSHdGubsUmHVa5nQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-17T03:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "(BitMain’s Main Competitor is Planning for a $1 billion IPO) Bitcoin (BTC) Technical Analysis", "text": "Regardless of the slow price action and dip in prices, Bitcoin is still king of cryptocurrencies and many altcoins anchor their moves on it.

Now, after periods of consolidation between those two highs, what stands out for me is the week ending February 4 candlestick which asserts the bear trend and week ending April 1 candlestick confirming this assertion.\nSo, with this in mind and the fact that the general trend is bearish, selling on resistances or retests would be akin to aligning trades with the trend. From this technical development, our first level of support is at $7,800. Any break below that means our $6,000 target is likely to be hit. This would be case especially if there are high volumes accompanying a consolidation bear break out.\nDaily Chart Bitcoin Daily Chart by Trading View\nSo, like the weekly chart, Bitcoin prices are still trading inside a range but with a bearish skew. See those lower lows and most importantly the reaction from $6,000 in line with the current trend? That is important in our analysis and what is drawing my attention is May 11 candlestick.\nTrade volumes are high relative to previous days and there is a mid-range push below $10,000-a region of minor support. Follow through bull candlesticks have been short on volumes. On May 15 we saw relatively high volumes confirming the bear pin bar at $9,000.\nAggressive traders can short now while aiming for $7,800 and $6,600. On the other hand conservatives can stay out of this trade and watch till prices are out of this consolidation.\nThe post (BitMain's Main Competitor is Planning for a $1 billion IPO) Bitcoin (BTC) Technical Analysis appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "börse stuttgart", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T03:48:47.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee8f03a7a3eb8937c269990c51421caa0ba71938", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9PVrPalxhKEXcGCfRz3ko49rC1f9185NC8xa6BD5blllWEdclCml1SWptP.SzOhcR5S0GyICwoqCj3z8NqnMJS8bL5gzoozhk-", "site_full": "www.hdphotos4u.com", "site": "hdphotos4u.com", "site_section": "http://www.hdphotos4u.com/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "HD Photos", "title": "Bitcoin set to be the world’s DOMINANT currency?

What do you think? Is it smart to hold Bitcoin as a long-term investment, or are there better choices among the ALT coins like Ethereum or Litecoin?\nRather than any coins, bitcoin is tge best coin to hold for a long term investment.

While we remain hopeful of future recoveries, it is likely that the past few days’ price appreciation is but short coverings. Notice that there is a clear failure to march past $9,000 since volumes are low and half below March 11 bear spike. I recommend shorts in lower time frames with targets at $6,800 in the short term. From the News\nIn less than five months, traders all over the world shall gain access to a crypto trading app backed by a traditional exchange, Börse Stuttgart . Bison is the name of the app and it has one main objective: make crypto trading as easy as possible. In fact in the spirit of accessibility, registration and verification time would be done in minutes all thanks to the survey done by the company as they tried to pick pain points in customer crypto experience.\nAfter an internal audit, UpBit is now free of damaging accusations of fraud and money laundering . Within a 12 hour span, close to $50 billion in market cap evaporated following news of a search warrant from the South Korea’s Intelligence Unit against UpBit . This was ironical because shortly before this directive, UpBit CEO was on the front line asking investors to report any form of ICO scam in exchange for cash reward. Among some of the accusations UpBit is not clear from include accusations of insider trading, trading using customer funds and money laundering. According to UpBit, the whole thing was a simple misunderstanding and at any time, as per the audit findings, they have never traded any coin(s) they never own.\nIronically, the world second largest Bitcoin mining hardware producer, Canaan is planning on listing at the Hong Kong stock exchange.

Besides, they are now venturing into cryptocurrency mining as well as creating innovative home appliances that mine coins in the back ground. Bitcoin (BTC) Technical Analysis Bitcoin Weekly Chart by Trading View\nIf we were to simplify, then we would say Bitcoin is moving within a $6,000 range defined by February 2018 high and low. Now, after periods of consolidation between those two highs, what stands out for me is the week ending February 4 candlestick which asserts the bear trend and week ending April 1 candlestick confirming this assertion.\nSo, with this in mind and the fact that the general trend is bearish, selling on resistances or retests would be akin to aligning trades with the trend. From this technical development, our first level of support is at $7,800. Any break below that means our $6,000 target is likely to be hit. This would be case especially if there are high volumes accompanying a consolidation bear break out. Daily Chart Bitcoin Daily Chart by Trading View\nSo, like the weekly chart, Bitcoin prices are still trading inside a range but with a bearish skew. See those lower lows and most importantly the reaction from $6,000 in line with the current trend? That is important in our analysis and what is drawing my attention is May 11 candlestick.\nTrade volumes are high relative to previous days and there is a mid-range push below $10,000-a region of minor support. Follow through bull candlesticks have been short on volumes. On May 15 we saw relatively high volumes confirming the bear pin bar at $9,000.\nAggressive traders can short now while aiming for $7,800 and $6,600. On the other hand conservatives can stay out of this trade and watch till prices are out of this consolidation.

CEO Jack Dorsey expressed optimism about cryptocurrency’s role in the future of payments, saying that “the internet deserves a native currency” and “it will have a native currency,” Bloomberg reports May 16.\nAt the Consensus conference on Wednesday, Dorsey shared crypto enthusiasts’ vision that virtual currencies are the future of a legitimate means of global payment. He said that he doesn’t know whether it will be Bitcoin (BTC), but “I hope it will be.” Dorsey said:\n“This technology is a fundamental shift to our world and can have so many positive outcomes. We have to do the work to educate regulators and educate the SEC why this technology is important.”\nSquare, a developer of payment and financial services solutions, allowed merchants to accept BTC in 2014 and made BTC trading available for almost all users of its Cash App in February of this year.\nNot everyone at Square shares Dorsey’s enthusiasm however. He said that “this was a pretty contentious move in the company,” adding that there are still debates and fights over the topic. According to Dorsey, some of the company’s board of directors are also resistant to the idea of cryptocurrency.\nIn the beginning of May, Square reported low profits from BTC trading in the first quarter, which only amounted to around $200,000. While BTC trading constituted a 5 percent overall revenue of $34.1 mln, the company spent $33.9 mln to purchase the tokens.\nDorsey’s recent speech reaffirms previous comments that Bitcoin will become the world’s “single currency” within a decade. He said:\n“The world ultimately will have a single currency, the Internet will have a single currency. I personally believe that it will be Bitcoin.”\nDorsey noted that, at the moment, Bitcoin is “slow and costly,” which makes it difficult to use as a medium of exchange. He added that “as more and more people have it, those things go away.”\nfrom Cryptocracken Blogger https://ift.tt/2IMwKew\nvia IFTTT ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global payment  twitter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter and square inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T03:13:26.052+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b24733727a3b6f7ad8a7ee850cf54cb5b3aeff67", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhLkgkn2K0ziwifAMjw_ttrU-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-17T03:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b24733727a3b6f7ad8a7ee850cf54cb5b3aeff67", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhLkgkn2K0ziwifAMjw_ttrU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-17T03:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 17, 2018 WEB Canaan, the world's second-largest maker of bitcoin mining hardware, files for an IPO in Hong ...

As an added benefit, it should also make hackers' lives more difficult should they target said exchanges and wallets.\nOf course, nothing is stopping European citizens from using cryptocurrency exchanges outside the reach of EU authority. Nevertheless, the world's major cryptocurrency markets are moving in the same direction, with South Korea having already imposed KYC regulations on its exchanges and the United States expected to follow suit eventually.\nThough many in the cryptocurrency space aren't particularly fond of KYC barriers, such data collection undoubtedly lends significantly more legitimacy to cryptocurrency than previously existed.\nOne should also not take the EU's new KYC requirements as an indication that the political and economic union is negative towards cryptocurrency. Rather, the continent's alliance has been pushing to legitimize cryptocurrencies' underlying technology in recent months.\nOn April 10th, 22 countries in the European Union signed a Declaration on the Establishment of a European Blockchain Partnership , which is aimed at cementing Europe as a world leader in the development and launch of blockchain technologies.\nThe international partnership claims to be \"a vehicle for cooperation amongst Member States to exchange experience and expertise in technical and regulatory fields and prepare for the launch of EU-wide blockchain applications across the Digital Single Market for the benefit of the public and private sectors.\"\nWhat do you think about KYC requirements?

Home Finance Bitcoin Price Watch: Currency Falls to $8,300 Bitcoin Price Watch: Currency Falls to $8,300 May 17, 2018 0\nAnother drop is in the books. After falling to $8,500 yesterday from its previous mark of $8,800, bitcoin is once again stumbling down the staircase and is now trading for $8,300 – just a sliver above last week’s low of $8,250.\nThe Coindesk Consensus Conference – which potentially gave bitcoin a boost over the last 72 hours – ends today, and it appears the hype it garnered for cryptocurrency is ending with it.\nNo doubt, most investors are annoyed with bitcoin’s lack of strength against its newfound resistance. Many analysts now wonder if the currency will drop back down to the $7,000 range, which it last skimmed in March.\nOne of the alleged reasons for the recent drop may be Bing’s recent ban of cryptocurrency ads. Powered by Microsoft, Bing is the world’s second-largest search engine behind Google, and apparently doesn’t see safety in cryptocurrency usage. The platform made the announcement on its Bing Ads blog, and expects the ban to be fully integrated by either late June or early July.\nAdvertising policy manager for Microsoft Melissa Alsoszatai-Petheo explained:\n“Because cryptocurrency and related products are not regulated, we have found them to present a possible elevated risk to our users, with the potential for bad actors participating in predatory behaviors or scamming consumers. To help protect our users from this risk, we have made the decision to disallow advertising. We are always evaluating our policies to ensure a safe and engaging experience for our Bing users and the digital advertising ecosystem.”\nFacebook made a similar ban last January. Representatives explained that they could no longer promote unregulated financial options as they potentially put investors and their money through unsafe conditions. Company product management director Rob Leathern later commented, “We want people to continue to discover and learn about new products and services through Facebook ads without fear of scams or deception. That said, there are many companies who are advertising binary options, ICOs, and cryptocurrencies that are not currently operating in good faith.”\nGoogle took a similar route in March, explaining that all cryptocurrencies would be banned from its AdWords platform given that they were not regulated, and investors were offered no guarantees that digital currencies or ICOs operated in a clean or decipherable manner.\nAccording to one source , bitcoin is the victim of weak “technical setup.” It’s explained that bitcoin is back to the diamond formation it had escaped last week, and the price could potentially fall as low as $7,850 or $7,800 in the coming days. The source did say, however, that if bitcoin broke above $8,500, it could develop newfound resistance levels. Perhaps $9,000 isn’t far off the mark after all…\nAnd still, many analysts remain bullish towards the coin. Jeremy Liew and Peter Smith – a Snap venture capitalist and the CEO of Blockchain, respectively – believe that the currency could hit the half-a-million mark by the end of 2030. Granted we still have 12 years to wait, but both men believe bitcoin adoption will explode in the coming years, and that bitcoin transactions will account for roughly half of the world’s non-cash transactions, pushing the price to new heights.

You might also think of commodities, currencies and whatnot. But strolling into a mutual fund manager’s office and mentioning Bitcoins would probably get you an odd look, assuming he or she is not an avid reader of TechCrunch.\nIntroduced in 2009, the electronic currency Bitcoin is exchanged through its own payment network. The Bitcoin can be stored in a virtual wallet and has been described as a cryptocurrency; a decentralized, peer-to-peer currency which relies on cryptography to facilitate currency generation and transactions. To prevent double-spending, computers known as “miners” receive transaction fees and free Bitcoins in exchange for running a proof-of-work system.\nIf you’re just looking on how to invest in Bitcoins, sign up with Coinbase and get started. By using THIS LINK you’ll get $10 in bitcoins after you buy $100 in Bitcoins.\nNow, if you’re looking to become a Bitcoin millionaire, keep reading.\n“Do You Take Bitcoins?”\nThe Bitcoin is essentially a speculative vehicle for geeks. Basically, do not eat out and expect to pay for the meal with Bitcoins. Not long ago you could have bought illicit drugs with the currency, but the FBI closed down “Silk Road” earlier this year, which allowed people to buy illegal substances anonymously.\nSome legitimate vendors have taken to Bitcoin, allowing customers to purchase real products and services with the digital currency. Richard Branson of the Virgin Group has even decided to accept Bitcoins through his Virgin Galactic. Reddit allows you to use Bitcoin to buy Reddit Gold. Yes, you can’t buy your everyday groceries with Bitcoins, but you can buy a trip to space. While some everyday vendors have looked into accepting Bitcoins too, most of the demand for the currency has been fuelled by speculators, rather than early adopters.\nIf you’re looking to use Bitcoin to pay for stuff, you need a Bitcoin wallet like Coinbase. It’s a simple website/app that allows you to securely store your Bitcoins and sell them.\nWith so much volatility, using Bitcoins in everyday life would be extremely risky anyway. Coinbase is one of the major Bitcoin exchanges, which allows you to buy and sell Bitcoins as you please. You sign up, deposit real-world money and exchange the currency with relatively low fees.

Decentralized Tool to Enhance User Privacy\nMicrosoft’s first notable announcement to create a decentralized digital identity came through a blog post released by the company on February 12, 2018. The blog post, titled “Decentralized Digital Identities and Blockchain – The Future as We See It,” announced that Microsoft had joined the ID2020 Initiative to bring the project to life.\nApplications and services on the platform are required to seek user permission before accessing any sensitive data explicitly.\nInstead of providing identity details to several applications, Microsoft reasoned that it would be much easier for the user to store all his data in a secure, decentralized hub. Users can then access and offer rights to this data as and when required. Decentralized Identity Hub\nAnkur Patel, Principal Program Manager at Microsoft Identity Division, said, “Each of us needs a digital identity we own, one which securely and privately stores all elements of our digital identity. This self-owned identity must be easy to use and give us complete control over how our identity data is accessed and used.”\nThe launch of the decentralized third-party data repository was confirmed by Lead Microsoft Developer, Daniel Buchner, who tweeted , “I was introduced to Bitcoin in early 2011 by a good friend at Mozilla. That year I started working on a proposal called Firefox Handshake, a vision for decentralized apps/comms based on Bitcoin-anchored decentralized IDs. Now, in May 2018, we’re at the tipping point of inevitability.”\nDaniel Buchner also confirmed some technical details of the project. For instance, Microsoft will use Chainpoint to anchor to bitcoin. Chainpoint is an open standard for creating a timestamp proof of any data, file or process. It links a hash of the user data to either the bitcoin or ethereum blockchain and returns a timestamp proof.\nThe technology giant has been participating in the Decentralized Identity Foundation ( DIF ) for developing Decentralized Identifiers, Identity Hubs, Universal DID Resolver , and Verifiable Credentials, of which are all critical components of the decentralized identity ecosystem. To make the DID accessible to everyone and so that it can manage a large number of transactions, the DID needs to use a second layer protocol like Chainpoint or the Lightning Network . The Significance of Microsoft Adopting Blockchain Technology\nThe Bitcoin blockchain is widely expected to be the technological backbone of the decentralized identity platform since this network is the market leader regarding second layer protocol implementations. A generally held view is that bitcoin will gain significant traction when it finds a suitable application. Microsoft, in using the Bitcoin blockchain to develop a decentralized secure digital identity repository, could prove to be that critical step.\nMicrosoft isn’t the only technology company announcing its blockchain plans at Consensus 2018.

Price has yet to break past the neckline around 2.1000 to confirm the potential climb.\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to suggest that the path of least resistance is to the downside or that the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse. However, IOTA has also moved past the 100 SMA dynamic inflection point to reflect a pickup in buying pressure.\nOn the 1-hour chart, RSI is moving up to show that buyers have the upper hand but is also closing in on overbought levels. Similarly, stochastic is pointing up but dipping into overbought territory, so selling pressure might return soon.\nOn the 4-hour time frame, IOTA is still above the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. This signals that further losses are due, especially if price breaks below the neckline at 1.8000.\nThe 100 SMA looks ready to cross below the longer-term 200 SMA on this time frame to signal a return in bearish momentum.\nRSI is still heading north, though, so price could follow suit and lead to a move past the SMA dynamic inflection points. Stochastic is just turning higher and has plenty of room to climb so buyers may stay in control for a bit longer.\nThen again, dollar demand has been mostly supported for the past few days so there may be a stronger chance of seeing a break lower than a double bottom upside break. This head and shoulders pattern spans 1.8000 to 2.6000 so the resulting drop could be of the same height.\nFor now, it might be best to see how price reacts to the double bottom pattern on the 1-hour chart and a break below the bottoms could be enough to confirm that the head and shoulders signal is validated.

Consensus conference failed to boost prices to the disappointment of many.\nBitcoin is marginally unchanged since the start of the day, trading at $8,322 at the time of writing. The coin came close to $8,400 handle during early Asian hours, but the momentum was not strong enough to push it higher.\nBitcion has been trading well below $9,000 since May 11, despite all the fuss and buzz about Consensus conference with Lambos parked at New York Hilton in Midtown NYC.

As I warned readers two weeks ago, there comes a point where support turns into stalling. That is what happened here,” explains Jani Ziedins from Cracked Markets\n“I’m skeptical of BTC at these levels and it needs to recover $9k as soon as possible to prove me wrong. Otherwise, expect nervous selling to return and push us back under the $6k lows.”\nBitcoin's technical picture\nTechnically, BTC/USD is moving within a large triangle pattern with the upper line currently at $9,700 and the lower boundary at $6,900. These are long-term reference points for Bitcoin traders, that will define the long-term bias. Meanwhile, the short-term resistance is created by $8,400 and followed by $9,000. The support is seen at $8,100 and $8,000.\nBEST BROKERS TO TRADE CRYPTO\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

REUTE\nBy Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Ethereum is the top public blockchain in the cryptocurrency space, while that of bitcoin, the original virtual currency, is ranked 13th, according to the Chinese government's first monthly Global Public Chain Assessment Index released on Thursday.\nThe index was created and released by the China Center for Information Industry Development, part of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in Beijing. It evaluates the technological capability, usefulness of the application, and innovativeness of the project.\nBlockchain, the system powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet.\nEthereum, whose currency is called ether, garnered an overall score of 129.4. It has the become the foundation for many initial coin offerings, in which start-ups create their own digital currencies and sell them to investors to generate financing for their projects.\nBitcoin, founded nearly 10 years ago, had a rating of 88 and came in at No. 13.\nBlockchain projects Steem, Lisk, NEO and Komodo took second, third, fourth, and fifth place, respectively, with scores of 115.9, 104.8, 103.0 and 101.5.\nThe index, which has 28 blockchain projects with their corresponding cryptocurrencies, will be updated monthly.\nThe sector currently has more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies, with total market capitalization of nearly $380 billion, according to digital currency tracker coinmarketcap.com .\nBitcoin, the largest of the digital currencies, last traded at $8,153.39 on the BitStamp platform. Ethereum was down 1.4 percent at $689.62.\nChina in general sees blockchain technology as an active area of innovation and expects public blockchains and decentralized applications to become significant parts of the future economy. In the second half of last year, though, the Chinese government started to crack down on illegal initial coin offerings.\nChina was the most active filer of blockchain patent applications last year, according to data collated by Thomson Reuters' Practical Law from the World Intellectual Property Organization database.\n(Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Leslie Adler) More From Business ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gertrude chavez-dreyfuss", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ministry of industry and information technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china center for information industry development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global public chain assessment index", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T00:13:37.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "524e7c028fe4a10a1e902e1b65dad66c241177ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2L_VLzvGar_Vs6UaUDGDbXgwL3q8c1MmgBaEQZ3_er_s7f0qyxUC4HsZQqU_G96HkVcvSdDoQG9SB_hc4MQJTFtZ.VtzKeAQ52ZBt7JNPoA5boM4rikqw_.XkIULS_AawRnKSoMfGu38CoEfc5sCh", "site_full": "btc-investor.net", "site": "btc-investor.net", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Chinese Govt.

Undertaken by the Ministry’s CCID Research Institute, the ratings evaluated 28 currencies, judging them on criteria that examined fundamental technology, applicability, and innovation.\nComing in at the top of the grade, Ethereum earned a total index score of 129.4. It’s followed by Steem (115.9), Lisk (104.8), NEO (103), and Komodo (101.5). Meanwhile, Bitcoin (88.1) comes in at 13th, wedged between BitShares (90.8) and Verge (88.1). Bitcoin’s low mark comes despite it earning the highest score for innovation, a grade it garnered for being the industry’s pioneering currency. 4/ Detailed scores of the first crypto ratings by CCID Research, China’s Ministry of Industry & Information Technology pic.twitter.com/7LiJIWokge\n— cnLedger (@cnLedger) May 17, 2018\nThese ratings come four months after the Weiss Ratings Agency unveiled the world’s first index of cryptocurrency grades. Measured with alphabetical ratings, many of Weiss’ original top picks align with the Chinese government’s own, including Ethereum, Steem, and NEO, all of which received B or B- grades. Weiss also gave Bitcoin one of the lower ratings on their initial report with a C+, a move that elicited skepticism from the community at large. As China’s index follows Weiss’ precedent, Bitcoin’s rating is likely to disgruntle Bitcoin maximalists and other blockchain die-hards, while the placement of other currencies–or lack thereof–will no doubt be met with scrutiny by their fan bases, as well.\nUnlike Weiss’ ratings, however, where full access is only available through subscription, the Chinese government’s ratings are publicly accessible, the first ever for the industry. According to domestic reports , the Chinese government believes this transparency will be healthy for future innovation and for properly evaluating each coin’s development.\n“It is reported that the index released this time is the world’s first technology-focused public chain assessment index, which will be issued periodically on a monthly basis. The issuance of this index will help to fully grasp the status quo of global public-chain technology development, timely track the direction of public-chain technology innovation, and help promote the innovation and application of blockchain technology,” Chinese outlet CEN writes.

Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I'm hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research,\" said economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries, who works at PwC in the Netherlands.\nThe estimates, based in economics, put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland.\nA single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. By the end of this year, he predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts - as much as Austria and half of a per cent of the world's total consumption.\n\"To me, half a per cent is already quite shocking. It's an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,\" he said.\nIf the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, de Vries believes the network could someday consume five per cent of the world's electricity.\nBitcoin is dependent on computers that time-stamp transactions into an ongoing chain to prevent duplicate spending of coins. Computers in the network perform calculations continuously, competing for the chance, once every ten minutes, to be appointed to create the next block of transactions in the chain.\nThe user of the computer that wins is awarded 12.5 new coins - a process known as \"mining\" Bitcoin. However, all the time, even the users that don't win are expending computing power .\n\"You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you're using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there's a big incentive for people to increase how much they're spending on electricity and on machines,\" de Vries said.\nIt is figuring out when that incentive stops paying off that is at the heart of de Vries's estimation method. Economic principles suggest that the entire Bitcoin network will eventually reach an equilibrium where the costs of the hardware and electricity used to mine equal the value of the Bitcoin being mined.\nThat information can approximate the total amount of electricity that the network will use at said equilibrium.\nGetting a good estimate is important in determining the sustainability of cryptocurrencies moving forward and in helping shape policy around them, de Vries said.
