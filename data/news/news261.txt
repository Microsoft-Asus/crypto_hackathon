A quelques encablures des 10 000$ en début de mois, la plus célèbre des cryptos a, depuis, fait preuve d’un regain de faiblesse. BTC, plombé sous les 10 000$\nLes déclarations de quelques grands noms de la finance n’ont pas aidé : Warren Buffett a qualifié le bitcoin de « mort-aux-rats » (sic), et Bill Gates a déclaré que le bitcoin « n’avait pas de valeur ». De quoi plomber les cours, vous en conviendrez.\nDe même, le bitcoin a encore été éclaboussé par une nouvelle affaire de piratage/fraude (autour, cette fois, d’une des plus célèbres plateformes d’échanges sud-coréenne, Upbit) et Nvidia (NVDA-Nasdaq), qui est LE fournisseur mondial de processeurs graphiques ultra-performants utilisés dans le minage des coins , a dévoilé des perspectives très prudentes.\nLe géant américain s’attend en effet à une baisse de deux tiers de ses ventes liées au minage de cryptomonnaies ce trimestre. Attardons-nous d’ailleurs sur ce troisième aspect. Fin de l’âge d’or pour Nvidia ?\nLes concepteurs de cartes graphiques que sont Nvidia et AMD ont profité du boom du minage des cryptos ces derniers mois. Mais, comme AMD avant lui, Nvidia se montre désormais prudent. En cause, l’arrivée d’un concurrent de taille sur ce segment : Bitmain, un fabricant chinois de puces Asic qui va se positionner sur l’Ethereum, l’une des principales cryptos.\nPour rappel, le GPU (pour « Graphics Processing Unit » ) est un circuit intégré présent sur les cartes graphiques. Jusqu’à présent, l’algorithme d’extraction d’Ethereum était résistant aux Asic et n’était déchiffrable que par cartes graphiques (par l’intermédiaire d’un processeur graphique traditionnel de type « GPU »), mais l’arrivée de puces compatibles Asic, notamment avec l’algorithme Ethash (le nom de l’algorithme utilisé pour miner notamment sur la blockchain Ethereum), pose désormais un risque clair pour AMD et Nvidia. Crédit : Nathan11466 / CryptoCurrency 360\nLes Asic sont en effet nettement plus puissantes et surtout spécialement conçues pour le minage de cryptomonnaies, donc mieux adaptées à celles-ci, à la différence des GPU qui visaient initialement aussi – et surtout – les joueurs de jeux vidéo.\nBref, un newsflow plus mitigé.\nConséquence : le bitcoin n’a pas validé le passage des 10 000$. Le bitcoin ne passe pas le test des 10 000$\nRegardez le graphique suivant : on voit bien que le cours de BTC évoluait dans un canal haussier depuis son point bas de début avril. Eh bien, raté : il est sorti par le bas de ce canal.\nGraphiquement, nous sommes désormais un peu entre deux eaux. Globalement, le BTC évolue entre le support des 6 000$, testé avec succès le mois dernier (et les 10 000$ en résistance à la hausse. Certes, c’est un écart de grande amplitude, mais pour pouvoir retrouver les 12 000 / 13 000$, il faut déjà s’affranchir du test des 10 000$.\nCertains experts sont résolument optimistes et pensent même que revoir les plus hauts de la fin 2017 (on se rappelle que le bitcoin avait touché les 20 000$) ne constituera qu’une simple étape. On citera ici le cabinet de conseil Fundstrat, qui voit le bitcoin franchir ses sommets de la fin 2017 et potentiellement atteindre les 64 000$ d’ici fin 2019, estimant que les principaux « vendeurs naturels » de bitcoins sont les mineurs eux-mêmes et qu’ils sont donc moins enclins à vendre quand le cours est faible. (Nous avons aussi notre expert, James Altucher, qui est plus que confiant sur le bitcoin… mais notamment sur cette autre crypto, qu’il voit exploser à la hausse pour rattraper son retard. Je vous laisse découvrir de quelle crypto il s’agit ).\nCela se tient, mais comme dans tout marché, je pense qu’il ne faut pas occulter le revers de la médaille. En effet, ces mêmes mineurs pourraient bien avoir une certaine « pression psychologique » si les cours venaient à enfoncer leurs plus bas annuels sous la pression de « grosses mains » : que ce soit pour les actions, le Forex, les obligations ou les cryptos, la logique reste la même.\nSi vous êtes mineur et que vous avez sorti du bitcoin alors que le cours valait 10 000$, vous le conservez en ayant en tête un retour sur les plus hauts de 2017 autour de 20 000$. Sauf que vous le voyez ensuite tomber à 8 000$, puis à 6 000$ avant qu’il ne plonge à 4 000$…\nVous avez des sueurs froides et vous commencer à compter vos billes perdues… et à envisager de vendre avant que le bitcoin ne retombe à zéro (qui sait ?) Pour Fundstrat, non. Personnellement, à moins que les mineurs ne soient pas avant tout des hommes et n’aient aucun coûts fixes dans leur activité, j’en suis moins convaincu.\nCe type de raisonnement n’est même à mon avis pas si éloigné que cela de ce qui prévalait sur la plupart des valeurs Internet au début des années 2000…", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://pro.publications-agora.fr/m/936236"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mathieu lebrun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nvidia", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "upbit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T12:54:51.073+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4e3f571db87c299ea44acff399cbea51e652071e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_gnkhwwu0uPSSUjIPCG5xltfcM0GbeVnjkbXqbX0i9hRsqDSrOZyiq3fsbsITxRpQ-", "site_full": "www.newsfiber.com", "site": "newsfiber.com", "site_section": "http://www.newsfiber.com/p/s/r?rv=2&amp;lang=eng&amp;r=10&amp;a=0&amp;dl=-1&amp;i=1&amp;v=Epo%2FjnW6JYUs%3D+wUecO6rnVoM%3D&amp;y=", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "News - NewsFiber", "title": "This app lets you trade Bitcoin without an internet connection – but there's a catch", "title_full": "This app lets you trade Bitcoin without an internet connection – but there's a catch", "published": "2018-05-15T12:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.newsfiber.com/thumb/20180515-F2741945C88DA882-0-1-2733BC2B-61E81571247CC271.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 95447, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4e3f571db87c299ea44acff399cbea51e652071e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_gnkhwwu0uPSSUjIPCG5xltfcM0GbeVnjkbXqbX0i9hRsqDSrOZyiq3fsbsITxRpQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-15T12:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "This app lets you trade Bitcoin without an internet connection – but there's a catch", "text": "This app lets you trade Bitcoin without an internet connection – but there's a catch If you're a cryptocurrency trader and often find often find yourself dealing with a spotty internet connection or none at all, there's now a way to make transactions offline. goTenna, a decentralized communications startup based in New York, has partnered with Samourai Bitcoin Wallet to create an app that lets you trade Bitcoins even when your device isn't connected to the web.

For one, you will need to have a goTenna mesh device that costs $179. The device pairs with your phone to create a mesh network with other goTenna users, allowing you to transmit information over a long range without cellular data or Wi-Fi, using UHF frequencies.\nThe app, named TxTenna, works by creating a channel between the Samourai Wallet and the goTenna mesh device.\nThe users create a standard bitcoin transaction on their Samourai Wallet as usual, but without requiring internet access. The transaction information is passed to the TxTenna App, which broadcasts it to nearby mesh nodes via the paired goTenna mesh device.\nEach goTenna device will relay the transaction information to further devices, until it reaches one that’s connected to the internet and also running the TxTenna app. When that last device syncs with a phone, it’ll send your transaction info through to the Bitcoin network.\nThis setup can come in handy when you’re traveling or stationed in a remote area without stable internet connectivity or cellular coverage.\nIf you find yourself in a remote location, you’ll need intermediary mesh devices — one per three miles, at least – between you and another goTenna gizmo that’s connected to the internet.\ngoTenna also notes that its device will “obscure who you are and where you’re at when making these transactions,” which implies that you can make trades without compromising on privacy.\nThe exploration of alternative broadcasting methods for Bitcoin transaction is not new.\nBlockstream launched broadcast satellites in August last year to allow increased access to the Bitcoin’s Network, even for people who do not have access to the internet. Nick Sazbo also explored the possibility of sending Bitcoin over radio.\nSamourai Wallet says it was inspired by the predecessors to create an alternative Bitcoin broadcast method that further improves security features and tackle network outages and censorship.\nIt’s nice to know that cryptocurrency traders have an alternative to internet access when they need to make transactions from remote areas, but it will require mass adoption for the mesh network to be able to work effectively.

However, the mining costs are not similar in all countries. Venezuela is the cheapest country where it could cost a little over $500 to mine bitcoin. South Korea is reckoned to be the costliest with a figure of over $ 26,000. Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin mining is the most talked about a topic not only in the business circles but even at homes. People are curious to learn how bitcoin works. Though the value did dip a little in the early months of 2018, it has again recovered and continues to generate interest among the people. How does it work: Bitcoins are built when a miner (node) on the bitcoin network is able to complete a block faster than the other miners and add it the bitcoin’s blockchain. A node is a powerful computer running the bitcoin software (which can be downloaded free) and it contributes to keeping the bitcoin running by partaking in the relay of information. It requires a lot of electricity and storage space on the PC. The bitcoin transactions are spread in the network by the nodes. The mining nodes i.e. the miners solve complex mathematical puzzles which are within the bitcoin program. The solution to the puzzle is a number. The speed of the machine plays a decisive role in the success of a miner. The first miner that gets the correct hash announces its success which enables the other miners to stop working on that block and start a new block. Why is it so high in cost? The bitcoin mining prices can vary from one to another since a lot of factors are taken into consideration while calculating the costs. The foremost factor is the cost of a computer and other infrastructure. The mining rigs need to be updated with new technologies as the mining difficulty grows harder. Another factor is the energy consumed. Every time an answer is guessed, energy is consumed. The more time the system is on, the more is the heat generated. The system requires cooling solutions. This again increases the cost. Then the electricity costs. They vary from one region to another which again is an influencing factor when calculating if bitcoin mining is lucrative or not. Miners were very happy in the last quarter of December 2017 as clear profits were being experienced with bitcoin nearly touching $20,000. However, it slid to $8000 in January 2018 and is hovering around that since then. Recently, Elite Fixtures had conducted a survey in 115 countries to find out the bitcoin mining prices. It used certain standards compiling data from 3 mining rigs and average electricity as on January 2018. It is gathered bitcoin mining in South Korea is the most expensive costing $26,000 while it is most profitable in Venezuela with the cost as low as $530. Hardware costs too rise steeply: With cryptocurrency mining increasing, miners look for the best hardware to beat the competition. This has increased the need for computer components that had more power to mine better while consuming low energy. Suppliers are unable to match the demand in delivering the components. But those using the graphics cards face the issues of shortage. Miners need powerful rigs and the shortage is creating an increase in the costs. This again has an impact on bitcoin mining prices. Specially designed ASIC mining rigs are being used as they are powerful and energy efficient but costs are high. Cloud mining: Customers that wish to invest and earn in bitcoin mining without investing in the high-cost hardware can consider cloud mining. The benefits of the cloud are many and the same benefits apply to bitcoin cloud mining. It is a system of using shared processing power that is run and managed in remote data centers. The users only must invest on a PC with internet connection. In addition to nil investment on infrastructure, users save on electricity costs since mining is done elsewhere. The technical aspects including maintenance are the responsibility of the cloud mining provider. The risks of selling and upgrading on hardware will not be there. The miners will need to pay a processing fee to the service providers.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.hashgains.com/cryptocurrency-mining", "https://www.hashgains.com/bitcoin-mining"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "hashgain mining bitcoin cloud mining bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T12:57:19.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f8c4a43e1d0cc83eb941e7a15c234631d58e6b83", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9.x.9Qdk_x3gFvUMzvKuCBZBgfvgEoDPecBjKePPoL9Tp4r1qFGNl.ncQs2shpqtw.S3HdGF6qozKm5lPGjh9ix6c42IlMEP1Fj0Vvzru9ZUsZUBuw0C6q", "site_full": "www.talkmarkets.com", "site": "talkmarkets.com", "site_section": "http://www.talkmarkets.com/rss/blogs", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Blogs - TalkMarkets", "title": "Bitcoin: Tide Might Have Turned", "title_full": "Bitcoin: Tide Might Have Turned", "published": "2018-05-15T12:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f8c4a43e1d0cc83eb941e7a15c234631d58e6b83", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9.x.9Qdk_x3gFvUMzvKuCBZBgfvgEoDPecBjKePPoL9Tp4r1qFGNl.ncQs2shpqtw.S3HdGF6qozKm5lPGjh9ix6c42IlMEP1Fj0Vvzru9ZUsZUBuw0C6q", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-15T12:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin: Tide Might Have Turned", "text": "By Mike McAra of Sunshine Profits 9:20 AM EDT Bitcoin stabilized, went up, went down and now is going up again. The ride has been wild and the opinions on the outlook in the market have been shifting. We hold a steady course and strive to filter out all the noise to give you the most relevant information. An there’s rarely a more important time than now for that. The tide might have turned and we’re on the lookout for a confirmation of the trigger. Such a confirmation could increase the profits on our hypothetical position. The South Korean government moved to raid the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the country. On Reuters, we read : South Korean prosecutors raided the country’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, on Thursday and Friday on suspicion of fraud, Yonhap news agency reported. The agency did not give details. Neither Upbit nor the financial investigation team of the Seoul Southern District public prosecutors’ office was immediately available for comment. Upbit sent a note to its clients that it is co-operating with the prosecutors and that it can guarantee that all its clients’ assets are secure. Four executives from two other South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges were detained in April in connection with the alleged embezzlement of billions of won. It is important not to panic at this moment. The government is not out there to get your bitcoins. The action of South Korean prosecutors is most likely an extension of their usual activities. The only special thing about the whole situation is that it involves Bitcoin. For the government, it doesn’t really matter if potential fraud is committed with checks, credit cards or Bitcoin. Sorry if this doesn’t quite sound as exciting as a conspiracy theory involving malicious activities on the part of the South Korean authorities. But we would rather give you a story which is true than one which is exciting but false. The one thing to keep in mind as a Bitcoin trader is to always conduct your own due diligence before committing funds to any particular exchange. Review the legal standing of the exchange, check the opinions of its users and so forth. However, even if a specific exchange doesn’t do anything inherently illegal, it is still possible that the regulator doesn’t have a full grasp of the concept of cryptocurrencies and might overreact to Bitcoin exchanges. It might be wise to diversify between Bitcoin exchanges in order to not have all your funds locked into one specific platform.

Greenberg. Bitcoin core (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH) can now both be used for tax payments, beginning this summer. County residents can pay in crypto for driver licenses, ID cards, and even property taxes.\nAlso read: Coinbase Remains the Most Successful and Important Company in the Crypto Industry\nBitpay Allows Enthusiasts in Seminole County, Florida to Pay Taxes in Crypto File under: bitter sweet. Joel M. Greenberg, Seminole County Tax Collector, explained, \"We live in a world where technology has made access to services on demand, with same-day delivery and the expectation of highly efficient customer service and we should expect the same from our government. The aim of my tenure in office is to make our customer experience faster, smarter, and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st century and one way is the addition of cryptocurrency to our payment options.\"\nMr. Greenberg Cryptocurrency isn't necessarily moral nor immoral. It is an amoral technology, a tool. It can be used for terrorism, vacation getaways, housing, and, now, taxes. As governments are wont, they're usually immune from innovation. But when it comes to revenue collection they're surprisingly spry, alert, on it. Paying taxes by credit or debit has been a thing for a while, but always involved processors taking a heavy cut. The advent of crypto and the Bitpay Visa does away with a great many previous frictions, making the expropriation experience win-win: enthusiasts don't have to do yet another conversion, and governments save in fees.\nHolding Noses, Simplified Head of Compliance at Bitpay, Jeremie Beaudry, detailed, \"Bitpay was started because we recognized the potential for blockchain to revolutionize the financial industry, making payments faster, more secure, and less expensive on a global scale. With the Seminole County Tax Collector's office, we have engaged our first government agency to accept bitcoin and bitcoin cash by making it easy and seamless for them.\"\nAnd though the broader crypto community has its issues with funding governments, making paying them shouldn't be any more cumbersome than need be. Bitpay and Seminole County teamed to allow bitcoin cash and bitcoin core for pretty much everything: car tags and titles, licenses, even property tax.\nThe county tax collector gets their money settled by the following business day, paid directly to the account in fiat. The local government is spared notorious price volatility and the usual risk associated with crypto. As Bitpay's press release insists, through a \"push transaction, the user sends the exact amount of bitcoin or bitcoin cash needed to pay the bill. This eliminates traditional credit card fraud and identity theft risks associated with credit cards.\" The company's fees are also better than merely competitive, as 1% per approval is way below market rate. And for those wishing to pay their taxes, the processor can be accessed through traditional computers or smartphones.\nIs the ability to pay taxes with crypto a good way to increase overall adoption?

The nature of cryptocurrency transactions makes them the currency of choice for money launderers and other criminals, seriously undermining global efforts to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism,” the central bank said.\nMany Zimbabweans are trading in cryptocurrencies which have given them quick yields, but RBZ also warned that anonymity surrounding deals made it difficult for law enforcement agencies to trace transactions.\nIt added that any instrument or platform that resulted in the flow of foreign currency or value into and out of the country or between residents and non-residents was subject to approval in terms of the law.\n“The anonymity of transactions in respect of virtual currencies has the potential to result in exchange control circumvention as the transfer would not be effected and reported by an authorized dealer in foreign exchange,” it said.\nA local company recently introduced an ATM in Harare which it said would be loaded with U.S. dollars and would be used to transact Bitcoins.\nThe central bank said it would continue monitoring regional and global cryptocurrency development in order to inform policy direction.\nBut in the mean time, the bank has urged the public to stay away from the virtual currencies.\n“Any person who buys, sells or otherwise transacts in cryptocurrencies, whether online, or otherwise, does so at their own risk and will have no recourse to the Reserve Bank or to any regulatory authority in the country,” it said.\n-Xinhua", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reserve bank of zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rbz", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T12:13:26.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f96e0fabf453e8dd6bb19535d5404396e450ee6f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvcIM99duwIPlFbCRbswfuJaddLNHX3AJvy2rIZr.gQko_hFS8Uhv4iNqTUIpB1U61l_cDSzOngjREghePCdoOA3Grl5IIQ_zDqIIDhSVNNCPWB822H1UEjCmgWQcP9GjjamIlSW_TF8t6HYTynzcfCXdiXJ4Aois-", "site_full": "www.benzinga.com", "site": "benzinga.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.benzinga.com/benzinga/press-releases", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Press Releases", "title": "Sharps Pixley Offer to Convert Gold Back into Bitcoin with BitPay", "title_full": "Sharps Pixley Offer to Convert Gold Back into Bitcoin with BitPay", "published": "2018-05-15T12:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 23263, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f96e0fabf453e8dd6bb19535d5404396e450ee6f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQvcIM99duwIPlFbCRbswfuJaddLNHX3AJvy2rIZr.gQko_hFS8Uhv4iNqTUIpB1U61l_cDSzOngjREghePCdoOA3Grl5IIQ_zDqIIDhSVNNCPWB822H1UEjCmgWQcP9GjjamIlSW_TF8t6HYTynzcfCXdiXJ4Aois-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "PRNewswire", "published": "2018-05-15T12:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Sharps Pixley Offer to Convert Gold Back into Bitcoin with BitPay", "text": "May 15, 2018 5:00am Comments Share: Sharps Pixley Offer to Convert Gold Back into Bitcoin with BitPay PR Newswire LONDON, May 15, 2018 LONDON , May 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Sharps Pixley announced today that they are now officially allowing customers to convert their gold directly into bitcoin via leading payment processor BitPay.

Until this year, there was only one way to celebrate this unofficial holiday: order a pizza, pay with Bitcoin, and enjoy. This year, however, we will also see Bitcoin Cash Pizza Day. It is a bit more difficult to find merchants accepting BCH, but that is where the BCHPizza website will prove to be a valuable resource. BCHPizza is an Interesting Project Even though people all over the world have celebrated Bitcoin Pizza Day for many years now, it is not necessarily easy to find merchants that accept Bitcoin payments these days. The world’s leading cryptocurrency has lost a fair amount of appeal in this regard, but it is still possible to use websites such as Takeaway.com for this purpose. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts who wish to celebrate Bitcoin Pizza Day with Bitcoin Cash, the situation becomes a bit more complicated. Thankfully, a dedicated directory has been created to keep track of places accepting Bitcoin Cash payments in exchange for pizza. There is also an incentive offered by the platform . Anyone can post a Bitcoin Cash bounty to get a certain pizza shop in a particular city to accept BCH as payment. As soon as the location officially enables BCH payments, the individual responsible can claim the bounty. Getting such businesses to stick with Bitcoin Cash will be rather challenging, as Bitcoin has seen similar struggles in this regard. Even so, it is an interesting initiative which will certainly be appreciated by community members. So far, the website lists various locations throughout the US, Canada, Europe, Central and South America, and elsewhere. It is evident that a lot of businesses are rather interested in supporting Bitcoin Cash payments, although those locations are rather spread out, especially in Europe. There is a surprising number of businesses in Venezuela, Mexico, and Israel which will sell you pizza in exchange for Bitcoin Cash. All of this goes to show that acceptance of Bitcoin Cash is growing steadily. Although buying pizzas with BCH is not necessarily the use case that will make this altcoin go mainstream anytime soon, it indicates that things are evolving in the right direction. There is still a lot of work to be done before Bitcoin Cash can rival Bitcoin, but at least users will be able to celebrate Bitcoin Pizza Day with their preferred version of Bitcoin. While no one will deny that Bitcoin Cash is a very successful and popular altcoin, there is still plenty of work to be done. Celebrating Bitcoin Cash Pizza Day may become a trend in the near future, which can only be considered a good thing.

The aim of my tenure in office is to make our customer experience faster, smarter, and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st century and one way is the addition of cryptocurrency to our payment options.” Mr. Greenberg\nCryptocurrency isn’t necessarily moral nor immoral. It is an amoral technology, a tool. It can be used for terrorism, vacation getaways, housing, and, now, taxes. As governments are wont, they’re usually immune from innovation. But when it comes to revenue collection they’re surprisingly spry, alert, on it. Paying taxes by credit or debit has been a thing for a while, but always involved processors taking a heavy cut. The advent of crypto and the Bitpay Visa does away with a great many previous frictions, making the expropriation experience win-win: enthusiasts don’t have to do yet another conversion, and governments save in fees. Holding Noses, Simplified\nHead of Compliance at Bitpay, Jeremie Beaudry, detailed, “Bitpay was started because we recognized the potential for blockchain to revolutionize the financial industry, making payments faster, more secure, and less expensive on a global scale. With the Seminole County Tax Collector’s office, we have engaged our first government agency to accept bitcoin and bitcoin cash by making it easy and seamless for them.”\nAnd though the broader crypto community has its issues with funding governments, making paying them shouldn’t be any more cumbersome than need be. Bitpay and Seminole County teamed to allow bitcoin cash and bitcoin core for pretty much everything: car tags and titles, licenses, even property tax.\nThe county tax collector gets their money settled by the following business day, paid directly to the account in fiat. The local government is spared notorious price volatility and the usual risk associated with crypto. As Bitpay’s press release insists, through a “push transaction, the user sends the exact amount of bitcoin or bitcoin cash needed to pay the bill. This eliminates traditional credit card fraud and identity theft risks associated with credit cards.” The company’s fees are also better than merely competitive, as 1% per approval is way below market rate. And for those wishing to pay their taxes, the processor can be accessed through traditional computers or smartphones.\nIs the ability to pay taxes with crypto a good way to increase overall adoption?

As a result of the Zcash rate has just exploded and has risen by 45 percent. In addition, Gemini has also obtained the approval for the listing of Litecoin and Bitcoin and Cash.\nZCash (ZEC). according to Eric Winer, Vice President of Engineering for Gemini Saturday, 19 May be deposits on the Gemini accounts. The trade on Tuesday, the 22. May, 15:30, German time. Zcash will be only the third crypto-currency that is listed by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss on Gemini. The following trading pairs and the services to be offered:\nWiner explains in the Medium of the Post that Gemini was thought of as a platform on which customers, many crypto-currencies can trade. Zcash was “a friendly fork of the Bitcoin source code, and thus a member of the Nakamoto Family Tree” and, therefore, a logical extension of the stock exchange.\nThe listing of Zcash comes after the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approval for trading of the Privacy Coins Zcash has been granted. The approval makes Gemini the first licensed Zcash-exchange in the world. There is also the NYDFS but at the same time for the first authority in the world, and Zcash “” can monitor.\nZcash supports two types of addresses: non-shielded (shielded) addresses beginning with “t” (“T-addresses”) and shielded (unshielded) addresses beginning with “z” (“Z-addresses”). Deposits withdrawals are made from two types of addresses, first of all, however, only non-shielded, Z-addresses is possible. In the future, also Z but can be used addresses. From this, the Exchange operates according to its own information.\nThe fact alone that the NYDFS – an American regulatory authorities have allowed the exchange of Zcash explicitly, from our point of view very remarkable. After in the last few months, Privacy Coins is a contentious issue in connection with the keywords crime, and money laundering, among other things, Coincheck Monero, Dash, and Zcash from its stock exchange had been deleted, the decision of the NYDFS, in our view, quite surprising and very positive for the market as a whole.\nGemini said (freely translated):\nRegulation, safety and supervision are crucial for the promotion of innovation and the protection of the consumer and we are pleased to provide our customers with a safe, secure and regulated platform for the purchase, sale and storage of Zcash. We are proud to support this new and incredible technology and the economy of the next Generation and the future of money. Zcash-Price Rally\nThe Zcash-price rally was held immediately after the announcement that Gemini had to offer to obtain the approval of ZEC. The crazy thing about the price increase is not, in our view, ZCash, is once again in Gemini tradable. Once again, it shows that the market is strongly driven by expectations and speculation.\nThe Zcash rate was before the announcement, less than 210 euros. Currently Zcash for around 300 euros traded and can a rate increase of about 44 percent within the past 24 hours.\nIn addition to the approval for the trading with Zcash, the NYDFS Gemini has granted the permits to trade Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash, as Forbes reported.\nDisclaimer: — trading in crypto-currencies carries a large financial risk, and can be up to a total loss of the invested capital.

Bing GO Cryptocurrency poses an elevated risk to users, it says May 15, 2018 08:23 Microsoft has recently announced that it would start blocking cryptocurrency advertising on Bing due to the “elevated risk” that it poses to users. The software giant explains that cryptocurrency is sometimes used for shady campaigns that expose users, and blocking ads that help malicious actors do this is one way to protect customers. “We are always evaluating our policies to ensure a safe and engaging experience for our Bing users and the digital advertising ecosystem,” Microsoft explained in a statement . “Because cryptocurrency and related products are not regulated, we have found them to present a possible elevated risk to our users with the potential for bad actors to participate in predatory behaviors, or otherwise scam consumers.” Facebook and Google also banned cryptocurrency ads Starting in June, Bing Ads will no longer allow advertising for cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency related products, and unregulated binary options. “Bing Ads will implement this change to our financial product and services policy globally in June, with enforcement rolling out in late June to early July,” Microsoft explains. Facebook announced that it would ban cryptocurrency ads back in January, while Google released a similar announcement in March. Google’s new policy blocks ads for cryptocurrency exchanges, wallets, and even gambling, with the search giant pointing to the risk that unregulated financial products pose to customers. “As consumer trends evolve, as our methods to protect the open web get better, so do online scams,” Google’s director of sustainable ads, Scott Spencer, said. “Improving the ads experience across the web, whether that’s removing harmful ads or intrusive ads, will continue to be a top priority for us.” Microsoft itself encourages advertisers to reach out to the company for more information ahead of the June target in order to make sure that the content they are promoting on Bing complies with the updated policy.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/post/may-2018/bing-ads-to-disallow-cryptocurrency-advertising"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bing", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bing microsoft", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T12:45:12.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b42d05fb3c0e0d857c69a16a152560908b577fe0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTEr3NS2jgVqwU70_pqLqGk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=159.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Announcements (Altcoins)", "title": "[ANN] (BTCi) Bitcoin Incognito | 1:1 Airdrop | POW/POS | Masternodes | Zerocoin", "title_full": "[ANN] (BTCi) Bitcoin Incognito | 1:1 Airdrop | POW/POS | Masternodes | Zerocoin", "published": "2018-05-15T11:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b42d05fb3c0e0d857c69a16a152560908b577fe0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTEr3NS2jgVqwU70_pqLqGk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "carlosherbert", "published": "2018-05-15T11:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "[ANN] (BTCi) Bitcoin Incognito | 1:1 Airdrop | POW/POS | Masternodes | Zerocoin", "text": "nice project", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T17:33:40.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc49844938529b265b27016a28a42eaaa9b404df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2eRCTFln.i_ZKYUln37JOIYwDV_Vxfsd4hAi_5M4LaK466YXpvcI9JAmx.bpoIDKuf2l9dShng--", "site_full": "www.godlikeproductions.com", "site": "godlikeproductions.com", "site_section": "http://www.godlikeproductions.com/feeds/forums/1", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "Godlike Productions - General Discussion", "title": "Did the NSA Create Bitcoin?

That's classified [ link to www.zerohedge.com (secure) ] - 5/12/2018 -- Bitcoin is now the talk of the town (Wall St.) and yet we don't know who created it. There's lots of theories, but we haven't seen any documented evidence. Having experience in this business looking at the FX markets melt down over the last 10 years in a fraud climax, we wrote Splitting Pennies and explained the world isn't as it seems. That was before Bitcoin. Because like for any investment you want to do your due diligence, we started peeling back this onion and wanted to start from inception - and find out who created this (as just like with any investment analysis, it's another data point). What we found was astonishing - nothing! No documents, no photographs, no reports, from Satoshi. Whoever it was created a real pseudonym in order to mask their real identity. But why? Now the value of Satoshi's original coins would be in the tens of billions - why not claim them? It is our logic that it can only be someone or some group connected to the US Government, an employee perhaps - not necessarily that Bitcoin is the brainchild of the government, although that is possible as NSA has the best mathematicians in the world. We compiled this research into our leading hypothesis in an article here: EXPOSED: The real creator of Bitcoin is likely the NSA as One World CurrencyOur point is not that we know 100% that this is the case, simply that it's the most plausible story, and we haven't uncovered any evidence to the contrary. Lots of people have different opinions, but they haven't produced any document proving otherwise. So we wrote the NSA and asked them, did you create Bitcoin? Hey, we are taxpayers. They work for us.

I believe this not just because the hash codes and some key technology of Bitcoin, the first successful blockchain application, used crypto technology NSA developed. Not just because he or she or they had skills and information that may have come from NSA work. As NSA employee(s), they would have needed approval for outside work&#8202;—&#8202;and would likely not have received it, and gotten into trouble launching Bitcoin with its obvious uses in evading government spying.If Satoshi was simply shy or wanted to avoid drawing attention to future wealth, he/she/they probably would have gone public long ago. But violating the NSA rules and perhaps having improperly used some information, going public would mean possible prosecution and punishment. I’ve served in the federal government, as an intelligence officer, Federally Funded R&D Center (think tank) consultant, and in the Pentagon Senior Executive Service&#8202;—&#8202;these rules limiting outside employment are real and consequential. Following Occam’s razor, favor the simplest explanation: Satoshi was probably an NSA employee(s) who was breaking the rules by publishing and founding Bitcoin. He/she/they had to make up a fake name, and still need to remain anonymous.As a former intelligence officer and DoD think tank consultant, I’ve been to NSA at Fort Meade many times on projects, but never worked there full time and am not basing anything I write here on either classified or inside NSA information. This is all reasoned speculation.My second NSA related theory and prediction, is that the NSA will be tasked to take down Bitcoin. While relative to the Internet, blockchain is very secure and effectively unhackable for a criminal group&#8202;—&#8202;it is in fact quite capable of being cheated and manipulated if you have enough computing power. NSA probably has plenty of computing power and expertise to take the Bitcoin blockchain down.Why would the NSA want to take down Bitcoin? What NSA wants is irrelevant&#8202;—&#8202;it’s what government leaders want. And there are many scenarios that could lead to an order to take the Bitcoin blockchain down, with either minor disruption (letting it come back with just a few accounts robbed) or totally destroyed (stealing from many accounts and screwing it up so badly it is impossible to restore):1. North Korea is a major owner, user, exploiter (for computer ransomware) of Bitcoin. As a sanction, punishment, or means of waging war, NSA could be ordered to rob accounts suspected of being NK owned.[1]2. Bitcoin and many of its owners and advocates are Libertarian and anti-government. Bitcoin is an affront to national “fiat” currencies and handy for evading government rules and taxes. Big Government is very motivated to destroy Bitcoin.3. Bitcoin has been used as ransom payments for computer hacking. I predict it will soon be used for human ransom as well. Rather than the high risk of transferring dollars, kidnappers may demand digital payment in Bitcoin.

Those that are curious acquiring bitcoin, however, can have a difficult time understanding the practical aspects of sending and receiving Bitcoin. That’s what we’ll cover in this article. Before Making Your First Transaction\nIt is important to first consider the length of time a Bitcoin transaction tends to take, which may vary far more than a bank transfer.\nTwo primary variables affect the transaction time for Bitcoin. The first is the amount of activity going on in the network.\nUltimately, if there is high network density (meaning that there are a lot of transactions to process), the transaction time will be far longer. The Bitcoin network processes an average of 3-4 transactions per second; if there are tens of thousands of transactions in the queue, it’s going to take a long time.\nMiners need to process each block, and it takes time for them to do that. If transaction fees are higher, however, miners are more likely to process the transaction quicker. Due to the volatile nature of the network, this means transactions can take anywhere from a few minutes to more than 12 hours to process, depending on network conditions.\nBloomberg How do Bitcoin Transactions Work?\nIf someone wants to send bitcoin, their intention is logged when they commence the transaction. Then, the nodes scan the whole bitcoin network to confirm that the bitcoin is there to send and that it hasn’t already been sent to someone else.\nOnce this information is verified, the transaction gets included in a “block” which is attached to the previous block – hence the name: blockchain . Transactions cannot be cancelled or manipulated, because this would mean altering all the blocks that came after, a virtually impossible task.\nThe bitcoin wallet does not actually hold bitcoin. Instead it does is holds the bitcoin’s private key and public address. This ‘public address’– a long string of 34 letters and numbers – is also referred to as the “public key.” Private keys are strings of characters that control coins–this is what is stored in a crypto wallet. The signature from the private key is what validates the transaction and allows it to go through. How to Send a Bitcoin Transaction\nTo send bitcoin you need to begin by getting a Bitcoin wallet. We’ll use Coinbase to illustrate as it is one of the most popular sites for these types of transactions.\nAs mentioned there are two key factors to consider when making a bitcoin transaction. You need a private key and a public address to send the coins to. Coinbase does, however, hold your private key, so it is not entirely within your control.\nThis is just something to consider from a security perspective; if you find Coinbase to be a trustworthy entity, then allowing them to keep your private keys in storage shouldn’t be an issue. If this is a problem, however, you may want to consider storing your crypto in a way that allows you to have total control over your private keys. Steps for Sending Funds:\nStep 1 : Open your software wallet and press the “Send” tab, or use the “Trade|Send Bitcoin” which can be found on your wallet menu.\nStep 2 : Enter the destination address for your recipient’s wallet. This is the public address, add it by copy and pasting it, QR code, or writing it out by hand.\nStep 3 : Select a label to track your transaction.\nStep 4 : Enter the amount you’d like transferred in the BTC box.\nStep 5 : Review the details and make sure the info you entered is correct, as the transaction cannot be reversed.\nStep 6 : Press “Send” to finalise the transfer. How to Receive Bitcoin\nTo receive Bitcoin, you only need your wallet and your public address (as well as your security features to access the wallet obviously).\nStep 1 : Once you’ve set up your Coinbase account, click the “Accounts” tab. Here and you will find your wallets. Click the “Receive” button on your Bitcoin wallet.\nStep 2 : The address for your Bitcoin will be displayed. Share this address with anyone who would like to send you Bitcoin.\nIf using an exchange to obtain Bitcoin, you will need to pay for the Bitcoin, which can be done via Paypal, Bank Transfer or cash depending on what you and the trader agree to . Are Bitcoin Transactions Anonymous?\nThe common assumption is that Bitcoin transactions offer complete anonymity in a way that bank transfers and cash payments do not. This is not strictly true, however, as an increasing number of web merchants leak transaction details about purchases, alowing your coins to be traced back to you. Whilst privacy is offered , using these transactions is sort of like writing under a pseudonym. If someone can trace one of your transactions, all of them become traceable.\nThis occurs due to web trackers and cookies which are pieces of code that track the way sites are used and passed on to third parties.

Although cryptocurrencies can be mined using regular computer equipment, specialised processing devices dedicated to mining are more effective and can generate more income.\nThe company’s co-chairman Jianping Kong told Reuters in April that he expected China’s push to promote the domestic chip industry to help drive growth for the company.\nCredit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Canaan’s float, according to IFR.\nCanaan Creative declined to comment. Ebang could not be immediately reached for comment. All the banks didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCanaan’s IPO valuation has yet to be set as there is no listed comparable and the prices of cryptocurrencies have\nfluctuated a lot, reported IFR.

Godbole: Techs point lower for Bitcoin\nThe bulk of trading in Cryptocurrency markets is done using technical analysis, for this reason, it is always important to take an informed look at the charts as well as the fundamental news.\nWriting for Coindesk, Omkar Godbole, a technical trading analyst is quite bearish the major crypto as he sees evidence that Bitcoin could be set to return to the $7,000 handle as the recent bullish run appears to be struggling,\n“BTC looks set to take out support at $8,207 and could then drop to $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to the May 5 high) or even as low as $7,698 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July 2015 low to the December 2017 high).”\nIt is not all doom and gloom, however, as the price is now very close to a meaningful break of $8760, the level which Mr. Godbole believes would invalidate the bears and continue to point the major digital currency higher,\n“Bullish scenario: Another rebound from $8,207 and a break above $8,760 would open doors for a move back above $9,000. A daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA, currently seen at $9,038 would confirm the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 has ended.”\nAs the debate over cryptocurrencies continues, it is interesting to note how the job market continues to expand in blockchain and cryptocurrencies.\nPostings continue to increase, suggesting decent capital inflow into the space and suggesting that things may be on a more solid footing than the volatile price action suggests.

Für viele Anleger stellt sich jetzt die Frage der ordnungsgemäßen Versteuerung. Kryptowährungen wie der Bitcoin erlebten im vergangenen Jahr einen regelrechten Boom. Anleger konnten beim Handel mit digitalen Währungen große Gewinne erzielen. Nach einem Erfahrungsbericht der Kanzlei GRP Rainer Rechtsanwälte folgte auf den Höhenrausch aber auch häufig die Katerstimmung. Denn die Steuerpflichten wurden von den Anlegern vielfach vernachlässigt und dies führt zu Problemen mit dem Finanzamt. Gewinne, die aus dem Handel mit den Kryptowährungen erzielt wurden, müssen versteuert werden. Sie unterliegen nicht der Abgeltungssteuer, sondern der Einkommenssteuer, erklärt die Wirtschaftskanzlei GRP Rainer Rechtsanwälte. Steuerfrei sind die Gewinne erst nach einer einjährigen Haltedauer. Für die Anleger bedeutet dies, dass sie die Gewinne exakt ermitteln und dem Finanzamt vorlegen müssen. Diese Pflicht sollte auf keinen Fall vernachlässigt werden, da ansonsten der Vorwurf der Steuerhinterziehung im Raum steht und empfindliche Strafen drohen können. Die Berechnung der Gewinne ist allerdings vielfach problematisch. Es muss detailliert dargelegt werden, zu welchem Zeitpunkt welcher Gewinn beim Handel mit Kryptowährungen erzielt wurde. Dazu müssen in der Regel große Datenmengen verarbeitet werden. Ohne fundierte steuerrechtliche Kenntnisse ist die Gewinnermittlung kaum möglich. Unsicherheit bestand auch bei der umsatzsteuerlichen Behandlung des Handels mit Kryptowährungen. Hier hat das Bundesministerium der Finanzen (BMF) Ende Februar für mehr Klarheit gesorgt. Demnach unterliegt das Bezahlen mit Bitcoin nicht der Umsatzsteuer. Gleiches gilt für den Umtausch der digitalen in eine konventionelle Währung und umgekehrt. Von der Umsatzsteuerpflicht befreit ist auch das sog. Mining. Bei kostenpflichtigen elektronischen Geldbörsen (Wallets) oder speziellen Handelsplattformen für Kryptowährungen wird hingegen Umsatzsteuer fällig. Wer in Bitcoin & Co. investiert hat, sollte seine Steuerpflichten genau im Auge behalten, damit es keinen Ärger mit dem Finanzamt gibt. Wer sich auf der rechtlich sicheren Seite bewegen möchte, kann sich an im Steuerrecht und Steuerstrafrecht kompetente Rechtsanwälte wenden.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "handel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael rainer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rainer rechtsanwält", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rainer rechtsanwälte erfahrungsbericht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin der handel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "einkommenssteuer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gewinne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rainer rechtsanwälte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steuerpflichten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kryptowährungen wie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abgeltungssteuer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "recht & gesellschaft", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "katerstimmung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wirtschaftskanzlei", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T11:01:01.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "22019e4e7894ff3fabab414459dfd5473a1f4f01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScP1WpxThAb4ojXcxFDJ0xWZvpX116Rn9NTuklLOLyoZmYYud.IcpvSjDCdlh5d3XxXQ4isOge4H", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin Wallet Released on Huawei App Store", "title_full": "Bitcoin Wallet Released on Huawei App Store", "published": "2018-05-15T10:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "22019e4e7894ff3fabab414459dfd5473a1f4f01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScP1WpxThAb4ojXcxFDJ0xWZvpX116Rn9NTuklLOLyoZmYYud.IcpvSjDCdlh5d3XxXQ4isOge4H", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-15T10:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Wallet Released on Huawei App Store", "text": "Bitcoin Wallet Released on Huawei App Store\n/u/dragonstail1111\nsubmitted by /u/dragonstail1111\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T10:42:20.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "061efe55f9830d0b8022a8f9d18a5e22e2effb42", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScP1WpxThAb4jYTFwXZk1aCjD_gvSTmSMiLgMYic0XEqpt689VnmfW1oMO0SXxCxzBDGVLwnztkg", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin: Beyond The Bubble -

Now, one artist has come up with a new way to benefit directly from this still-nascent technology by inviting passersby to donate to him using a Bitcoin QR code, which he affixed to his murals. The brainchild behind the idea is French street artist Pascal “PBOY” Boyart, and the artist’s embrace of the digital currency is already paying dividends. As of this writing, Boyar has made 0.11 Bitcoin (about $1,000) from 23 donors thanks to his clever embrace of cryptocurrency. The feat has even caught the attention of Reddit. Boyart was intrigued by the idea of being able to connect directly with the public and to receive money for his work without going through a middleman. So, he took six months off from painting to learn about this new technology. The donation process that resulted is decidedly simple: Anyone with a smartphone and a Bitcoin wallet can scan the QR code on the mural and make a digital payment that goes directly to the artist. “I think that the times we are living are difficult for free-minded artists,” the artist told artnet News in an email. “It looks like the Impressionist era, with an official art of academic artists and the others that you have not much chance to see in an international art fair.”… read more Image: Pascal “PBOY” Boyart, Rembrandt dos au mur , a mural in Paris featuring a QR code that allows the public to donate to the artist using Bitcoin.
