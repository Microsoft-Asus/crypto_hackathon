I want to hear from knowledgeable individual what the future holds.\nTraditional investors like Warren Buffet usually lays statements prejudicial to bitcoin's existence. Their ways are still inclined to the traditional way of investing, which is acquiring shares of stocks, purchasing gold, investing into bank notes, etc. What makes him say those statements are the lack of any regulation among cryptocurrencies in general. Although he may be against Bitcoin, he is not entirely wrong at all. Having to invest into something that lacks collateral or security is generally risky if you compare it to the other types of investment tools.\nQuote: from: ecnalubma on June 01, 2018, 03:10:44 AM Warren Buffet is a conservative investor and maybe he doesnt invest much on technology and dont even understand it. But no matter what people say negative about Bitcoin or crytocurrency the community is getting stronger as time goes its an internet 2.0 and Im very positive that it will withstand the test of time and these innovations are phenomenal.\nAt some point, I even considered that he is just trolling everyone by influencing them not to invest into bitcoin. Not to mention, he may be even one of the whales that try to manipulate the prices.

It allows users to store, transfer and exchange Bitcoin Cash and EOS alongside the current roster of bitcoin, ethereum, Litecoin, XRP, Dash, Monero and Stellar Lumens. The app is currently available on both App Store and Google Play Store.\nDeVere Group CEO Nigel Green said the addition of Bitcoin Cash and EOS to the crypto exchange app is part of their ongoing commitment to clients.\n“The users of the app are demanding an ever-wider, diversified crypto portfolio as the crypto sector expands and moves even further into the mainstream,” Green said.\nAccording to a new global survey conducted by the company, 35 percent of high net worth individuals will have exposure to cryptocurrencies by the end of the year. DeVere said 600-plus respondents of this poll are some of the group’s wealthy clients who currently reside in the US, the UK, Australia, the UAE, Qatar, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Spain, France, Germany and South Africa.\n“This mainstream expansion is clearly evidenced by the fact that more than a third [35 per cent] of wealthy individuals around the world – who are already likely to be successful investors – are telling us that they already have exposure to crypto or that they will have by the end of this year.” Green said. “The survey’s findings demonstrate that high net worth individuals are increasingly unable to ignore the huge potential of cryptocurrencies. There’s now surging public awareness of the value, need and demand for digital, global currencies in a digitalized, globalized world.”\nGreen added that he expects that a broader awareness and understanding of the crypto sector will grow exponentially next year as the tech that underpins it further improves, as major corporations and financial institutions embrace it, and as regulation is further developed.\nEstablished in 2002, deVere Group has over $10 billion under management, with over 80,000 active clients in more than 100 countries. The company’s range of services include international savings, FATCA, bonds, retirement planning, life insurance, pension transfers, and education planning, among others.

Here's why.\n'It's Much Cheaper to Buy Now' On Thursday — the founder of Pantera Capital, a San Francisco-based investment firm focused on blockchain technologies — told CNBC's Fast Money that he believes Bitcoin has hit the bottom for 2018. As such, now is the best time to buy.\nThe former chief financial officer and head of macro trading at Tiger Management told the trading-focused show:\nAll cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now […] It's much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally as it goes.\nBitcoin, the first and foremost cryptocurrency, topped $20,000 on December 17th, 2017. In February, however, the gold standard of cryptocurrency dropped to levels below $6,000, before ping-ponging back and forth in an attempt to regain stability. At the time of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $7,507.72, down 0.34 percent over the last 24 hours.\nThe total market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies has followed a similar pattern, reaching upwards of $830 billion before bottoming out underneath $250 billion. At the time of this writing, the total market capitalization for the cryptocurrency market is just over $330 billion.\nBeat the Herd The cryptocurrency market's extreme volatility has many buyers remaining tentative while sellers remain firmly in control. Nevertheless, Pantera Capital's founder and CEO suggests getting in while you still can — or, at least, before the herd of institutional investors arrive. Explained Morehead:\nMany institutions are essentially buying the rumor [of potential SEC regulations] and selling the fact. Getting invested now so that in three, four, five months when the institutional, quality-regulated custodians that we're hearing about come online, they'll already have their positions.\nAn Easy 239 Percent Pantera Capital's CEO also offered a friendly tip for those looking to make long-term trades. Morehead told CNBC that he recommends buying a currency when it falls below its 230-day moving average, before waiting one year and selling for an easy 239 percent. He claimed:\nWithout even thinking about it, you make an average of 239 percent. [With Bitcoin, it] happened about five times in the last six years […] That's the essence of this trade: It rarely ever gets cheap to its long-term average. So today is a good day to be buying.\nOf course, it bears mentioning that Morehead's Pantera Capital Management is one of the first U.S. Bitcoin firms and owns roughly 35 pre-auction ICOs and about 25 liquid blockchain currencies, including Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH), and ICON (ICX). Thus, the recommendation comes from an individual deeply invested in cryptocurrencies — a fact which should be factored in.\nMorehead also has a long history of recommending investors buy Bitcoin. On April 27th, he called the market leader \" a screaming buy .\" A couple weeks earlier, he also stated , \"It's a very good time to buy.\"\nWhat do you think of Dan Morehead's latest recommendation to buy Bitcoin? Do you think the floor is in for the market leader this year?

Host country Russia faces a range of economic sanctions imposed by the United States – potentially opening the door for cryptocurrency.\nAlso read: U.S. Crypto Customers Get New Option as Bittrex Adds USD-BTC\nJoin the Bitsonline Telegram channel to get the latest Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and tech news updates: https://t.me/bitsonline\nAs a result of the economic blockade, two of the world’s biggest digital payment processors Visa and Mastercard are partially hindered during FIFA 2018, prompting consumers to turn to bitcoin as a means of payment for hotels, flights, and daily expenses. Will the bitcoin price respond to the potential increase of use at the World Cup?\nBitcoin to Score Big\nDespite the sanctions, Visa and Mastercard will still process most of transactions using a range of workarounds. However, the rise in demand for bitcoin as a payment option could lead to its most significant price breakout for the year.\nReportedly, Kaliningrad – one of the eleven host cities – is offering to accept cryptocurrency payments for hotels . A number of bars and travel agents are open to accepting payments in bitcoin, to capitalize on the trend.\nCryptoCup, a blockchain-powered betting platform explicitly created for FIFA 2018, along with other projects aimed at crypto and football lovers, could add value to bitcoin.\nThe international football event will function as a stage for bitcoin to prove its worth as a means of exchange, something it has been as yet unable to achieve. The increased circulation of bitcoin is expected to drive the price up.\nTurning the Quarter\nBitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, have had a rough first quarter of 2018. A turnaround was expected during and after Blockchain Week in New York City. Superstitious as it may sound, history has indicated that during and after the Consensus Conference, one of the biggest crypto conferences, bitcoin prices tend to surge.\nEven Robert Sluymer, managing director and technical strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors, predicted the bitcoin price would catapult after the Consensus Conference. However, none of these predictions materialized.\nBitcoin – the Only Global Currency\nPredicting a bitcoin price surge during the football event is more reasonable if fundamental demand and supply forces are taken into account. According to Thorsten Koeppl, professor of economics at Queen’s University in Canada, the more bitcoin is used as a means of payment, the higher its value:\n“The value of Bitcoin is partly driven by its potential as a payments tool and, before the fees rose along with the price, there were people using Bitcoin for international transfers. This has become more expensive to do now. But the price is still being supported.”\nIt remains difficult to argue for a need for a global digital currency. Yet, the particular challenges that the 2018 World Cup faces – a host country in Russia facing economic sanctions with which large – particularly American – multinational corporations need to comply, demonstrates the usefulness of bitcoin. Bitcoin’s relatively broad adoption compared to fellow digital assets has it in the driver’s seat in any race to claim “global currency” status.\nWill the price of bitcoin surge due to the World Cup in Russia?

Because it runs inside your browser, there is no need to install a program on your computer. Upon loading our site or a webpage, a javascript program runs using a small amount of your systems resources to mine cryptocurrency that is typically paid to the owner of the broker account holder.\nJavascript miners will not harm your computer. They make use of your computer’s resources like any other application. When you watch internet videos your system is using its resources to render that video, same with video games, same with installed applications. There is nothing that happens to your computer that is different from any other use.

He told anchor Mellisa Lee that Bitcoin may have found it’s bottom for the year so that today is a good time to go shopping. “All cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now,” Morehead who also acts as Pantera’s co-Chief investment officer added that the cryptocurrency market is down about 65% from its high right now so “It’s much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally as it goes,”\nThe take away from Morehead’s appearance is his suggestion that by buying a currency after it breaks its 230-day moving average and after a year “without even thinking about it, you make an average of 239 percent.” He said that this has happened with Bitcoin “about five times in the last six years,” Summing up the strategy he said,\n“That’s the essence of this trade: It rarely ever gets cheap to its long-term average, So today is a good day to be buying.”\nCustody is The Silver Bullet\nThe volatile nature of Bitcoin prices over the last six months and the ever-looming but seemingly never reconciled questions about regulatory practices have kept many investors at bay. When the issue of how unsettled custody is affecting institutional investment was broached by Lee, Morehead said that his fund has had institutional investors in the crypto market since 2013.\nHe went on to say that having an SEC-approved custodian is “the silver Bullet everyone is waiting for.” In terms of risk to reward he pointed out that last year there was a lot of reward in exchange for the same amount of risk that remains today but there is no switch that can be thrown to turn it back on.\nIn anticipation of the SEC resolving the custody issue he said “Many institutions are essentially buying the rumor [of potential SEC regulations] and selling the fact, Getting invested now so that in three, four, five months when the institutional, quality-regulated custodians that we’re hearing about come online, they’ll already have their positions.”\nMorehead founded Pantera Capital Management in 2013 as one of the first hedge funds to handle Bitcoin. Today the firm owns 35 pre-auction ICO’s and handles 25 blockchain based currencies.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/31/buy-bitcoin-now-while-its-still-cheap-says-cryptocurrency-investor.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pantera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mellisa lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan morehead", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pantera capital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "crypto investing crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morehead", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T11:46:52.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b4fc3c81aeb65487735186fac69e01cdea73bb10", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfI08aGgDDr_WGz2VduYHlc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Bitcoin still a buy despite recent losses", "title_full": "Bitcoin still a buy despite recent losses", "published": "2018-06-01T11:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b4fc3c81aeb65487735186fac69e01cdea73bb10", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfI08aGgDDr_WGz2VduYHlc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "rabia_laskor", "published": "2018-06-01T11:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin still a buy despite recent losses", "text": "BTC is the father of crypto world and people know about btc and people also wants to invest here if you know the market policy then is the best time for invest also other people also investing money whereas the price of btc is low but I will tell they are smarter thats why they are buying this coin to earn huge profit.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T10:37:35.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e6bbfb89c851b01ac205b5e027c9eb3d7fb620d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY6ijqaA.DDRyFEAxdGmVmYlgr0fGZnpS1Erf8LxEVB08x9B9tBtv2T.7evzB3GuCoBfJ3SdjjEpYDkgxShSempF.kxck4Oeqw-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Why are Miners still mining Bitcoin Core when Bitcoin Cash is more Profitable?", "title_full": "Why are Miners still mining Bitcoin Core when Bitcoin Cash is more Profitable? : btc", "published": "2018-06-01T11:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.022, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e6bbfb89c851b01ac205b5e027c9eb3d7fb620d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY6ijqaA.DDRyFEAxdGmVmYlgr0fGZnpS1Erf8LxEVB08x9B9tBtv2T.7evzB3GuCoBfJ3SdjjEpYDkgxShSempF.kxck4Oeqw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "KaizerKlementine", "published": "2018-06-01T11:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why are Miners still mining Bitcoin Core when Bitcoin Cash is more Profitable?", "text": "I think Jihan Wu discussed this before but I can't seem to find his Quote: s.

Here’s why. ‘It’s Much Cheaper to Buy Now’\nOn Thursday — the founder of Pantera Capital, a San Francisco-based investment firm focused on blockchain technologies — told CNBC’s Fast Money that he believes Bitcoin has hit the bottom for 2018. As such, now is the best time to buy.\nThe former chief financial officer and head of macro trading at Tiger Management told the trading-focused show:\nAll cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now […] It’s much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally as it goes.\nBitcoin, the first and foremost cryptocurrency, topped $20,000 on December 17th, 2017. In February, however, the gold standard of cryptocurrency dropped to levels below $6,000, before ping-ponging back and forth in an attempt to regain stability. At the time of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $7,507.72, down 0.34 percent over the last 24 hours.\nThe total market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies has followed a similar pattern, reaching upwards of $830 billion before bottoming out underneath $250 billion. At the time of this writing, the total market capitalization for the cryptocurrency market is just over $330 billion. Beat the Herd\nThe cryptocurrency market’s extreme volatility has many buyers remaining tentative while sellers remain firmly in control. Nevertheless, Pantera Capital’s founder and CEO suggests getting in while you still can — or, at least, before the herd of institutional investors arrive. Explained Morehead:\nMany institutions are essentially buying the rumor [of potential SEC regulations] and selling the fact. Getting invested now so that in three, four, five months when the institutional, quality-regulated custodians that we’re hearing about come online, they’ll already have their positions. An Easy 239 Percent\nPantera Capital’s CEO also offered a friendly tip for those looking to make long-term trades. Morehead told CNBC that he recommends buying a currency when it falls below its 230-day moving average, before waiting one year and selling for an easy 239 percent. He claimed:\nWithout even thinking about it, you make an average of 239 percent. [With Bitcoin, it] happened about five times in the last six years […] That’s the essence of this trade: It rarely ever gets cheap to its long-term average. So today is a good day to be buying.\nOf course, it bears mentioning that Morehead’s Pantera Capital Management is one of the first U.S. Bitcoin firms and owns roughly 35 pre-auction ICOs and about 25 liquid blockchain currencies, including Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH), and ICON (ICX). Thus, the recommendation comes from an individual deeply invested in cryptocurrencies — a fact which should be factored in.\nMorehead also has a long history of recommending investors buy Bitcoin. On April 27th, he called the market leader “ a screaming buy .” A couple weeks earlier, he also stated , “It’s a very good time to buy.”\nWhat do you think of Dan Morehead’s latest recommendation to buy Bitcoin?

Unless there is an abnormal change in hashrate, the reward for successful Bitcoin miners will drop from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC per block in May 2020. The burning question is what effect will the block reward reduction have on the price of Bitcoin? A Little Bit of History Bitcoin is less than a decade old. Thus, history might not paint a complete picture. However, historical patterns and trends are an excellent place to begin any price analysis. There have been two Bitcoin halvings: 2012 and 2016. Halvings occur every four years or after 210,000 blocks have been mined. Both halving events have happened before significant bull runs. Whether the price rallies occurred as a consequence of the block reward reduction is unknown. A year after the 2012 halving, BTC price rose to $1,000 in November. At the time, it was the highest ever recorded price for the number one cryptocurrency. A year after the 2016 halving, Bitcoin also reached another record milestone. BTC prices rallied to an all-time high of $19,500 in mid-December 2017. Halving and Bitcoin Price The historical pattern shows Bitcoin prices booming one year after each previous halving. However, history doesn’t always paint a complete picture when it comes to the cryptocurrency market. Case in point, the anticipated Consensus price rally failed to happen this year even after many leading experts made bold predictions . If there is indeed any correlation between halving and price, it might lie in the former’s effect on hashrate and stability. In a nutshell, the question isn’t how halving might affect prices but how it might affect miners. Reduction in block reward means a decrease in revenue for miners, especially if the mining difficulty remains significantly unchanged. A lot depends on the price of Bitcoin in the months leading up to the halving as well as the transaction volume on the network. Miners earn fees for facilitating transactions in addition to the block rewards for their mining efforts. If Bitcoin prices rise high enough to offset whatever the halving might cause in revenue drop, then the odds are that hashrate will not change significantly. Halving and Hashrate Commenting on the potential impact of halving on BTC price, Garrick Hileman, the research head at Blockchain said that : Cryptocurrency markets are often very event-driven, and as we get closer to the next halving bitcoin’s price will receive a boost from those anticipating the forthcoming reduction in new supply. In the months leading up to the last two halving events, we saw bitcoin’s price steadily trend upward, and then power higher following the reward halving. Hileman also went on to say that a significant change in mining hashrate due to the halving was unlikely. He went on further to say: Miners have historically shown a willingness to maintain or increase computing power through halving events because they expect future bitcoin price increases to offset the reduced block reward.

[Note: This is an op-ed] Old Man Yells at Bitcoin In an article published last week, Skidelsky draws similarities between gold and Bitcoin, concluding that it’s incorrect to perceive flaws in money itself as the cause of “sick” economies. In other words, boom and bust cycles are natural occurrences, and the incumbent financial system is the best humans can do, if only the sluggish economies could just get it together. Skidelsky argues: The fact is that human societies have discovered no better way to keep the value of money roughly constant than by relying on central banks to exercise control over its issue and to act directly or indirectly on the volume of credit created by the commercial banking system. But let’s leave the Keynes versus Hayek debate for another article. Instead, what stands out like a sore thumb is not only the complacency and the knee-jerk reaction to defend the status quo, but doing so through ignorance of Bitcoin’s fundamental properties. Amusingly, Skidelsky even acknowledges that “the technical details of the new cash-generation systems are difficult to grasp; their inspiration is not.” A person from the early 20th century might have also said that “the technical details of the airplane are difficult to grasp; their inspiration is not.” Hence, the mere attempt to improve money is rebuked because all previous attempts have failed to come up with anything better than the paper mill that is today’s financial system. Skidelsky dismisses Bitcoin as merely the latest attempt to use new technology “to stop money from going bad.” Let’s take a look at some examples of the erroneous statements made by the emeritus of political economy. Lie 1: It’s Created Out of Nothing Paradoxically, although it is created out of nothing, it will offer no possibility of money ‘creation.’ First, bitcoins aren’t created out of “nothing.” Second, since it’s already being accepted as a medium of exchange in many places online and across the globe for goods or services, then it’s de facto money. Furthermore, energy, coding skills, resources, and time spent on software and hardware development and production are just some of the components required to run and maintain the Bitcoin network. It is also underpinned by a globally distributed network of users who all agree to play by the rules of the network for their own benefit. The more users in this network, the greater the value of Bitcoin will become, according to Metcalfe’s law . Lie 2: No Elasticity Bitcoin will be ‘mined’ in diminishing quantities until it is exhausted in 2040, having delivered 21 million digital coins. In other words, there is no elasticity in the currency… [T]he currency will run into the same problem as the gold standard: not providing enough money to support a growing economy and population. First, Skidelsky is off by a century as the last bitcoin will be mined in 2140 , though most will enter the supply by 2030. Second, the problem was never with gold itself but the debasement of gold and thus the distortion of value. For example, most scholars believe it was the “clipping” of gold coins that was largely responsible for the fall of the Roman Empire . The publicly verifiable and immutable ledger of bitcoin ensures that this monetary network can’t be tampered with, unlike with fiat. Third, unlike gold, a bitcoin is merely the name of a digital unit (whose value is determined by the market). This makes it highly divisible. In fact, the smallest possible unit is one hundred millionth of a single bitcoin (0. 1 BTC) — called a ‘satoshi’— making it possible to send tiny fractions of a penny at current market prices. This can’t be done even with digital fiat today, let alone physical cash or metal coins. This, in fact, makes Bitcoin the most elastic form of money ever created as the 21 billion digital units equal to roughly 2,099,999,997,690,000 (over 2 quadrillion) satoshis according to the calculations presented here . What’s more, new layer-2 applications built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, such as the Lightning Network , will enable the ability to send even smaller amounts off-chain. Lie 3: Deflation Will Lead to ‘Hoarding’ This [lack of money supply] would be exacerbated by any tendency to hoard bitcoins. Hoarding is a pejorative term for saving. If there is no saving, then there is no capital. And there can be no capitalism without capital. The “deflationary death spiral” argument against sound money is an overblown theory perpetuated by Keynesian economists, which is refuted here . In fact, some argue that saving actually leads to greater consumption in the long-run. Saifedean Ammous explains this concept in his book, The Bitcoin Standard , stating: A society which constantly defers consumption will actually end up being a society that consumes more in the long-run than a low savings society, since the low time-preference society invests more, thus producing more income for its members. Even with a larger percentage of their income going to savings, the low time-preference societies will end up having higher levels of consumption in the long-run, as well as a larger capital stock.

Skidelsky doesn’t specify which inflation he’s actually referring to – monetary supply inflation vs. price inflation. Though the two are correlated, the latter is an integral feature of fiat currencies whose value is guaranteed to depreciate over time as more money is printed. Sooner or later, the incentive for governments and central banks to print more money becomes irresistible to the detriment of the population. Inflation is also sometimes referred to as a “hidden tax” that is much easier to impose on citizens as opposed to direct taxation. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s monetary supply is not only controlled but is fully transparent and known to all. Even the gold supply cannot be as accurately predicted. Whereas the 21 million digital units that will ever exist are a key property of the Bitcoin protocol that cements its digital scarcity . Put differently, the millions of people around the world who use Bitcoin today know the supply is capped, which results in more accurate price discovery for goods and services. It is also important to note that people who use bitcoin are doing so voluntarily to store their wealth and move their money. Bitcoin Is a Revolutionary Idea With the advent of cryptocurrencies, for the first time in history, humans now have the option to choose their money. This is nothing short of revolutionary since throughout history there was always some central authority, be it the state, the church, or a banking cartel, maintaining a monopoly over money by decree, and ultimately, by force. Comparatively, it is fiat currencies that provide no security against inflation. In fact, fiat currency supply is specifically designed to grow indefinitely as emission rate is controlled by a handful of unelected bankers through the artificial setting of interest rates. Rubber will meet the road as more people realize they can now opt out of this system by buying Bitcoin. The good news is that people now have a choice between trusting bankers or a voluntary decentralized monetary network with no one in charge. What other myths have you heard about Bitcoin?

Learning how to securely archive records that hold private keys like a JSON file or exporting, importing, and sweeping can provide people with the basic steps towards really owning bitcoin. Also read: Localbitcoincash.org Revamps Website and Adds New P2P Features Private Key Ownership Provides Financial Sovereignty Every day someone new is learning about the fantastic benefits of bitcoin and cryptocurrency solutions. Many people will have acquired their first digital asset from an exchange like Coinbase or Circle Invest, but have yet to learn how to secure their private keys so they can really own those precious cryptocurrencies. The first and foremost lesson to digital currency ownership is a statement said over and over again by veteran bitcoiners. If you don’t possess your private key, you don’t own bitcoins. Private Keys and the Different Ways to Obtain Them A private key is the secret alphanumeric code that is mathematically paired with your public key — the alphanumeric address you use to receive payments. Private keys allow you to spend your cryptocurrencies and ensure you maintain ownership over them as long as the 256-bit alphanumeric code is kept a secret. If you happen to own cryptocurrencies because maybe you purchased some on an exchange, or someone loaded up a wallet for you or gave you a paper wallet, you may want to know how to obtain full ownership of your private keys. The thing about private keys is they can be stored in various ways and it’s good to gain knowledge on the differences between each method. Mnemonic Phrase If someone gave you a wallet you may have to find out the mnemonic phrase or mnemonic seed associated with the cryptocurrency. For instance, if someone gave you some bitcoin cash (BCH) using a software client like the Bitcoin.com Wallet you could set up your and find your mnemonic recovery phrase easily. An example of a phrase would be twelve random words given to you by the software client in order which you must back up by writing down the phrase in the exact same order. The twelve words (some wallets use 24) can be used to recover your bitcoin cash either using the same Bitcoin.com Wallet or another wallet that supports the mnemonic phrase backup restoration process. These words should be guarded with maximum security and you should never take a screenshot of them or type the words online. If someone else knows the twelve-word mnemonic seed tethered to your coins this means someone can have full access to your cryptocurrency holdings. An example of a private key tied to a twelve-word mnemonic phrase within an Electrum wallet. The QR code to the right is also a private key. A Backup Keyfile or JSON File There are other ways you can be given a private key like, for instance, in a keyfile or JSON file. A JSON file (JavaScript Object Notation) is simply a file with a lightweight data format that allows it to be easily read and written by humans or machines. Sometimes browser wallets will give you a backup JSON file that contains your coins’ private keys. These types of files need to be imported into a supporting wallet to gain access to the funds associated with the keys. These files need to be secured in a safe manner and users can hide them and encrypt them in folders so intruders can’t gain access to the file. Just like the mnemonic seed, someone with access to a keyfile or JSON has full access to the funds associated with those keys. The Fundamental Difference Between Importing and Sweeping Import There are also two different ways people can obtain their keys — importing and sweeping. These two distinct ways of gaining full ownership of keys are separate actions within the cryptocurrency-import process. Importing a private key means you are simply tethering the funds that belong to the private key to an existing set of keys in your software wallet. This means the coins are still tied to the private key that may be tied to a paper wallet for example. Both wallets now have access to the funds tethered to the private key until they are spent. If you are planning to import keys make sure that both areas of ownership remain 100 percent secure from other individuals, otherwise you may want to sweep the keys. Sweep Essentially sweeping private keys is a form of importing them but when you sweep them they are sent to an entirely different address and the older imported key set is no longer valid. So if you take the Bitcoin.com Wallet and sweep the paper wallet someone gave you, the paper wallet will be emptied. Anytime you sweep a source wallet the funds will be moved to an entirely different location with another public and private key pair. Lots of wallets allow users to sweep a QR code that contains a private key in order to gain access to the funds. Note that if you have a QR code tethered to a private key on a paper wallet or stored somewhere and it is exposed it can be easily swept away if it’s not kept hidden. Bitcoin: Be Your Own Bank As we mentioned above, keys can be kept in QR codes, keyfiles, JSON files, and mnemonic phrases and knowing how to access them for full ownership is a must for every cryptocurrency enthusiast. If you hold your money on an exchange you are allowing a third party to have ownership of your coins and if something happened to that exchange like a hack that resulted in a huge loss you may lose your bitcoins. Gaining access to your cryptocurrency’s keys means you own them and you maintain full ownership. The fundamental benefit of bitcoin means you get to be your own bank .

Also Read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: Asus Creates 20-GPU Mining Motherboard Crypto Portfolio Diversification This latest addition to the app means that users of the service, which also supports fiat USD, Euro and GBP, can now buy, sell, store, and exchange the two cryptocurrencies alongside the current roster of Bitcoin Core (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) Litecoin (LTC), Ripple (XRP), Dash (DASH), Monero (XMR) and Stellar Lumens (XLM). Nigel Green, founder and CEO of the group, commented: “The addition of Bitcoin Cash and EOS to the Devere Crypto app is part of our ongoing commitment to clients. The users of the app are demanding an ever-wider, diversified crypto portfolio as the crypto sector expands and moves even further into the mainstream.” After the app released earlier this year, Green explained: “All the digital coins on Devere Crypto have different characteristics, strengths and values. As such these additions help to achieve portfolio diversification within this specific asset class and their individual traits make them useful in different ways for investors. I believe that there is no longer any doubt that cryptocurrencies in some form are the future of money.” HNWIs Shedding some light on why the group has entered the crypto market, it also released the findings of a new poll in which it is revealed that 35% of high net worth individuals are now already invested in or will make investments in cryptocurrencies before the end of 2018. According to Devere, the 600+ respondents of this poll are some of the group’s wealthy clients who currently reside in the U.S., the UK, Australia, the UAE, Qatar, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Spain, France, Germany and South Africa. CEO Green opined : “This mainstream expansion is clearly evidenced by the fact that more than a third of wealthy individuals around the world – who are already likely to be successful investors – are telling us that they already have exposure to crypto or that they will have by the end of this year. The survey’s findings demonstrate that high net worth individuals are increasingly unable to ignore the huge potential of cryptocurrencies. There’s now surging public awareness of the value, need and demand for digital, global currencies in a digitalised, globalised world. I expect that a broader awareness and understanding of the crypto sector will grow exponentially in the next year as the tech that underpins it further improves, as major corporations and financial institutions embrace it, and as regulation is further developed.” What do you think about Devere adding BCH and EOS support?

Hanyecz, who was the first person to use Bitcoin in a real-world commercial transaction described Nakamoto as an “oddball.” The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains a mystery till this day. A Bit of an Eccentric Fellow According to Hanyecz, worked pro bono as a developer during the early days of the Bitcoin project, Nakamoto was an eccentric fellow who regularly gave him “a weird feeling.” Commenting on his experience to Business Insider , Hanyecz said : I thought bitcoin was awesome, and I wanted to be involved, but I had a regular developing job. Nakamoto would send me emails like ‘Hey, can you fix this bug?’‘Hey, can you do this? He’d say, ‘Hey, the west side’s down,’ or ‘We have these bugs — we need to fix this.’ I’d be like, we? We’re not a team. I thought that it was approval from him, that maybe he accepted me as a member. But I didn’t want the responsibility. I didn’t really understand all of the forces that were going on at the time. Hanyecz admits that he found some of Nakamoto’s requests to be annoying and said he’d dismiss them from time to time. Nakamoto’s identity remains a mystery and Hanyecz says the Bitcoin creator was always intent on maintaining privacy and anonymity. According to Hanyecz, this behavior of Nakamoto’s struck him as strange. He or she or whoever it was never told me anything personal. I asked a few questions, but he always dodged them. Those questions never got answered. The Search for Satoshi Nakamoto The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains one of the biggest mysteries in the entire digital currency industry. Several leading figures in the world of cryptography, programming, and computer science are among possible candidates for the person behind Bitcoin. In 2015 and 2016, an Australian computer scientist and businessman named Dr. Craig Wright claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto. In fact, several leading media outlets, including the BBC and The Economist , published articles claiming that Wright had provided proof to back up his claims. In spite of this, however, the general consensus among the crypto community is that Wright’s claims are false and the mystery behind the pseudonymous Nakamoto remains unsolved. Do you find Hanyecz’s description of Nakamoto as surprising? Will we ever find out who created Bitcoin? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below.

In connection with this, Xi added that China plans to prepare national laboratories with the express aim of helping to develop the technology infrastructure, related to these three industries.\nThis speech comes on the heels of China’s May 24th announcement that it will start a state-funded Blockchain research hub in an area of the country called the “Guangdong Free-Trade Zone.”\nTo be clear, this name comes from the fact that the area is in the country’s Guangdong province, as well as that it is a place where customs regulations are eased to promote quick and efficient trade.\nThe implication from this is that, contrary to popular opinion on where China stands on Blockchain regulation, they’re actually aiming to lead the charge in promoting Blockchain innovation.\nAs if this usage of the Guangdong FTZ doesn’t serve well enough to back this claim up, specific language related to the Blockchain has also been added to China’s current five-year economic development plan.\nAs until recently, China has been seen as a staunch opposer to the Blockchain, it is reasonable to wonder what exactly catalyzed this change of heart.\nWith what seems to be a push by US regulators to solve the issue of clear Blockchain regulation, one can see the motivation for China to stand on the other side of the debate. This might be even more believable when taken in connection with the fact that the Trump administration is pushing for higher tariffs on Chinese products. To make matters worse between the two countries, the administration’s also pushing to limit Chinese visas, especially those related to the Technology and Science sectors.\nUntil proven otherwise, it’s not exactly clear whether China is doing this to get ahead of the rest of the world or because they truly believe in the Blockchain. With local projects like NEO, which are globally successful, the answer might be said to lie somewhere in between.\nBy: BGN Editorial Staff\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T00:23:47.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "709253959261339436c9026bb6b1f82ac593eb87", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXIbq4kvUPSvn1FruEQBGJM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Bitcoin can be useful for a troubled economy", "title_full": "Bitcoin can be useful for a troubled economy", "published": "2018-06-01T11:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "709253959261339436c9026bb6b1f82ac593eb87", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXIbq4kvUPSvn1FruEQBGJM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kirito1614", "published": "2018-06-01T11:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin can be useful for a troubled economy", "text": "The reality of the matter is that bitcoin can enable individuals to out of neediness and xan give a superior future fiscally, many individuals including me as of now feel the impact of bitcoin, bitcoin could give a salary and new opening for work that can assist individuals with getting a superior life, if the administration bolster bitcoin then it will beyond any doubt increment the cost and bitcoin could enable more to individuals.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T11:26:50.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a21f5f447e61ef46280fae2f18d21f5ddab8135", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54PWOIn425FOCwq6dZb4ilQhFp8a826Jft9PqHyDfvQnQGIKgCCKBXAILpDcGpVytGA--", "site_full": "bitcoinist.com", "site": "bitcoinist.com", "site_section": "http://bits.aihosting.com/rss", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "BTC News Aggregator", "title": "Buy Bitcoin Now, Says Pantera Capital CEO (Again)", "title_full": "Buy Bitcoin Now, Says Pantera Capital CEO (Again)", "published": "2018-06-01T11:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ss-buy-sell-bitcoin.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3a21f5f447e61ef46280fae2f18d21f5ddab8135", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54PWOIn425FOCwq6dZb4ilQhFp8a826Jft9PqHyDfvQnQGIKgCCKBXAILpDcGpVytGA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-01T11:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Buy Bitcoin Now, Says Pantera Capital CEO (Again)", "text": "Buy Bitcoin Now, Says Pantera Capital CEO Adam James · June 1, 2018 · 4:00 am · Views: 3,302\nAccording to Pantera Capital Management’s Dan Morehead, now is a good time to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Here’s why. ‘It’s Much Cheaper to Buy Now’\nOn Thursday — the founder of Pantera Capital, a San Francisco-based investment firm focused on blockchain technologies — told CNBC’s Fast Money that he believes Bitcoin has hit the bottom for 2018. As such, now is the best time to buy.\nThe former chief financial officer and head of macro trading at Tiger Management told the trading-focused show:\nAll cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now […] It’s much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally as it goes.\nBitcoin, the first and foremost cryptocurrency, topped $20,000 on December 17th, 2017. In February, however, the gold standard of cryptocurrency dropped to levels below $6,000, before ping-ponging back and forth in an attempt to regain stability. At the time of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $7,507.72, down 0.34 percent over the last 24 hours.\nThe total market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies has followed a similar pattern, reaching upwards of $830 billion before bottoming out underneath $250 billion. At the time of this writing, the total market capitalization for the cryptocurrency market is just over $330 billion. Beat the Herd\nThe cryptocurrency market’s extreme volatility has many buyers remaining tentative while sellers remain firmly in control. Nevertheless, Pantera Capital’s founder and CEO suggests getting in while you still can — or, at least, before the herd of institutional investors arrive. Explained Morehead:\nMany institutions are essentially buying the rumor [of potential SEC regulations] and selling the fact. Getting invested now so that in three, four, five months when the institutional, quality-regulated custodians that we’re hearing about come online, they’ll already have their positions. An Easy 239 Percent\nPantera Capital’s CEO also offered a friendly tip for those looking to make long-term trades. Morehead told CNBC that he recommends buying a currency when it falls below its 230-day moving average, before waiting one year and selling for an easy 239 percent. He claimed:\nWithout even thinking about it, you make an average of 239 percent. [With Bitcoin, it] happened about five times in the last six years […] That’s the essence of this trade: It rarely ever gets cheap to its long-term average. So today is a good day to be buying.\nOf course, it bears mentioning that Morehead’s Pantera Capital Management is one of the first U.S. Bitcoin firms and owns roughly 35 pre-auction ICOs and about 25 liquid blockchain currencies, including Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH), and ICON (ICX). Thus, the recommendation comes from an individual deeply invested in cryptocurrencies — a fact which should be factored in.\nMorehead also has a long history of recommending investors buy Bitcoin. On April 27th, he called the market leader “ a screaming buy .” A couple weeks earlier, he also stated , “It’s a very good time to buy.”\nWhat do you think of Dan Morehead’s latest recommendation to buy Bitcoin?

Yesterday's highlighted important bullish trend line is in place with support at $7,450 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is about to make the next move either above $7,600 or below $7,400 in the near term. Bitcoin price is approaching a crucial break against the US Dollar. BTC/USD breakout levels are $7,600 on the upside and $7,400 on the downside.\nBitcoin Price Analysis There were mostly ranging moves above $7,400 in bitcoin price during the past two sessions against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair struggled to break the $7,580 and $7,600 resistance levels. As a result, there was a minor downside reaction from the recent high of $7,602. There was a break below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $7,260 low to $7,602 high.\nHowever, the decline was limited by the $7,400 support area. More importantly, yesterday's highlighted important bullish trend line with current support at $7,450 held declines on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Additionally, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $7,260 low to $7,602 high protected losses below the $7,400 support. The pair is on the move again and it retested the $7,580 and $7,600 resistance levels. Both the mentioned levels are important barriers and preventing gains above $7,650.\nLooking at the chart , the price seems to be approaching a crucial break either above $7,600 or below $7,400. On the upside, a break and close above $7,600 could set the pace for a push towards $7,800 and $8,000. On the flip side, a break below $7,400 may perhaps take the price to $7,260.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is about to move back in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is heading higher towards the 60 level.\nMajor Support Level – $7,400\nMajor Resistance Level – $7,600\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD

Tim Draper, the crypto millionaire and venture capitalist, told Forbes that fiat currency usage will be a laughable anachronism in five years. But for now at least, with the bitcoin price down by more than half from its peak, the original crypto asset has about the same market value as the largest banknote in circulation.\nThat bill is Brunei’s B$10,000 note, which is worth about $7,482 , roughly the same as bitcoin these days, at around $7,500 . The legal tender—featuring a portrait of Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah— was issued in 2006. Such large denominations aren’t convenient for a typical wallet, but could be useful during an emergency or during wartime, as well as for illicit purposes. The Brunei dollar’s value is legally par with the currency of Singapore, which has its own S$10,000 bill (though it is no longer issued ). (www.polymernotes.org)\nThe tiny nation of Brunei is pretty much the opposite of crypto believers’ decentralized ideal. Bolkiah, one of the richest people in the world, is among the few remaining absolute monarchs and one of the longest reigning, according to the BBC . Thanks to vast oil and gas fields, which account for nearly the entire economy, its gross domestic product per capita is among the highest in the world. In 2014, the country with 423,000 residents adopted strict Islamic sharia law that received heavy criticism from international rights groups.\nBrunei’s B$10,000 note stands out at a time when high-denomination bills are being retired. Latvia’s 500-lat note was worth about $982 as it was phased out when the Baltic nation became the euro zone’s 13th member in 2013. The euro zone is getting rid of its €500 bill —dubbed the “ bin Laden” —amid concerns that the banknote, worth around $584 at current exchange rates, is being used to finance terrorism.\nLarge-value banknotes are useful for money laundering, tax evasion, and other criminal activities (pdf) because they’re easy to transport. A briefcase containing $1 million worth of 100-dollar bills would be 70% full. The same value using Singapore or Brunei’s largest notes would only take up 1.5% of the case, according to an International Monetary Fund article , which acknowledged that the rise of digital money could eventually mean the end of paper money.\nBig bills have a bad reputation, but Brunei is generally seen as a low threat for money laundering and terrorism finance, according to the US State Department . And despite the risks associated with high-denomination banknotes, Switzerland has resisted pressure to stop printing its mighty 1,000-franc note , a strip of paper worth $1,012, which has grown increasingly popular as other countries restrict the circulation of their most valuable notes. The 1,000-franc note now accounts for more than 40% of Switzerland’s bills in circulation.

Other affiliate programs are run primarily through email marketing campaigns. Regardless of your approach, like with other ways of monetizing your website, you have an opportunity to make passive income and eventually a full-time income from the effort you put in.\nSince Bitcoin affiliate programs are becoming more popular, we want to outline some of the best Bitcoin referral programs to earn money online. This way you can get a feel for what Bitcoin is all about and get a leg up on those who aren’t yet taking advantage of this cryptocurrency. Bitmedia Image Source: Screenshot – BitMedia.io\nThe Bitmedia ad network affiliate program gives you about 10% affiliate commissions for every referral. That’s not bad considering some of the sales are going to be highly priced. Currently, Bitmedia only offers an affiliate program for when you recommend new advertisers. So, if you have a tech blog of some sort and you start recommending Bitmedia, some companies might take notice and want to start advertising with Bitmedia. Therefore, you can receive up to 5% of the budget of a new advertiser, making it rather profitable depending on how long the ad campaign runs. If you’re familiar with Google AdSense, Bitmedia works in a similar way, except it’s run with Bitcoin. A-Ads Image Source: Screenshot – A-ads.com\nA-Ads (Anonymous Ads) offers another solution for making completely anonymous ad campaigns. What’s interesting about the A-Ads referral program is that you can make your own referral program through them. So you might have your own product and want others to advertise it and write blog posts about it. However for the sake of this article, we’ll focus more on getting advertisers to sign up for the A-Ads referral program. Fortunately, A-Ads makes it extremely easy to get started. No registration is needed if you’d like to remain anonymous, and you receive a link to share with all of your readers or customers. After that, an advertiser signs up, sets their budget, then you get 10% of whatever they have spent. This is by far one of the simplest of all the affiliate programs on the market, and it goes along with the Bitcoin culture of keeping things basic and decentralized. CoinBase Image Source: Screenshot – Coinbase.com\nCoinBase is one of the most popular Bitcoin exchanges. An exchange is where you can buy and sell digital currencies and even convert the currencies into anything from US dollars to Euros. Referrals are completed by generating a unique link for your account and sharing that link with your friends or followers to spread the word. This referral program works more like a rewards system. So if one of your friends puts over $100 in their account both you and the friend get the equivalent of $10 in Bitcoin. I wouldn’t say this is a way to get rich quick on your blog or email newsletters. But it’s a nice incentive if you already have a CoinBase account and know some other folks who are interested in the Bitcoin game. XCoins Image Source: Screenshot – XCcoins.io\nXCoins pays 50% of all transaction fees, meaning you’ll typically make more than 5% of the total transaction. What’s interesting about the XCoin referral program is that they don’t simply dish out one payment when a new user signs up. You can actually make a solid income with this one, since you get paid for all of the transactions made by your referrals. This goes on for life, or until the person stops making transactions on the XCoins system. I like this for just about everybody, since you can start making passive Bitcoin income with the referrals of one or two people. You might end up landing a referral who makes dozens of transactions a month, sending you lots of Bitcoin money in the process. Exmo Image Source: Screenshot – Exmo.com\nExmo offers 25% of Exmo’s commision. So you probably won’t make as much money as the previous two options we discussed, but you do continuously bring in money from your referrals. Exmo has a system similar to XCoins where a referral is a referral for life. If that person makes a transaction in five years, you still make money off of them. Not only that, but Exmo is a simple way to create your own Bitcoin wallet , generating a hub for you to keep all of your funds, bringing your knowledge of the platform to the next level when recommending it to other folks. You do have to register in order to get your affiliate link (which is not always the case with Bitcoin referral programs) but that’s not going to be a dealbreaker for everyone. Genesis Mining Image Source: Screenshot – Genesis-mining.com\nBitcoin mining is the process of validating Bitcoin transactions and as a reward, you get Bitcoin in return. In the past anyone with a computer could participate mining Bitcoins, but nowadays mining has become more and more resource intensive and expensive. That’s where cloud mining companies like Genesis Mining come into play that offer cost-effective packages for Bitcoin mining. While Bitcoin mining itself is already a way of making money, you can also earn online revenue by promoting cloud mining companies through their affiliate programs. With the Genesis Mining referral program you can earn 2.5% additional hashpower in case you start mining Bitcoins by yourself and the new customer will get a 3% discount on the purchase of a Bitcoin mining plan. KO Currency Image Source: Screenshot – Kocurrency.com\nKO Currency sells white label business platforms for accepting Bitcoin. All of the solutions are built with WordPress, making it rather secure and easy to use for the average person. For example, KO Currency sells a complete Bitcoin auction site, ready to be launched and make money with. Some of the other platforms include options like directory sites, multi-vendor platforms, betting sites, membership sites, and more. It’s kind of like a highly customized WordPress theme company, seeing as how they have made these platforms to work just with Bitcoin. The affiliate program pays out about $100 per referral, making it a high payment for every person you sign up. Not only that, but they have 90-day tracking cookies, which is pretty long in the affiliate world. CryptoVPN Image Source: Screenshot – CryptoVPN.me\nVPNs and Bitcoin go hand in hand. Not only do they both allow for anonymity, but each are ahead of their time when it comes to privacy and protecting one’s information. The CryptoVPM platform allows customers to do things like circumventing censorship, encrypting WiFi and unlocking geo-restricted services like Netflix and Hulu. It’s great for non-US users, and you’re bound to find blog readers who are interested in the best VPNs. You can make from 12% to 20% depending on the number of signups you get. Therefore, CryptoVPN offers a completely viable solution for making money on a blog, social media page, or email newsletter. They also have real time tracking, marketing materials, and affiliate assistance. Which Bitcoin referral program is right for you? Image Source: BenjaminNelan\nBlogging about Bitcoin not only helps to establish cryptocurrencies in our society but also can be a nice additional revenue stream on your WordPress website. For example if you run a tech blog and plan on writing about VPNs, there’s no reason not to consider the CryptoVPN affiliate program. Other than that you have a wide range of options when looking at Bitcoin ad networks and exchanges.\nTalking about Bitcoin and giving readers your own reviews, thoughts, and ideas about the market is extremely valuable. After all, it’s one of those areas in the financial world that doesn’t get much attention from banks and financial advertisers and bloggers. Bitcoin is somewhat of a rebel’s currency, so a diligent blogger or affiliate marketer has a good chance of capturing a niche market. Have you promoted Bitcoin on your website before?

BTC/USD above $7500\nThe price of the major cryptocurrency rose on Thursday helping to drag the smaller alt-coins higher with it.\nIota (IOT) was the top performer, bouncing as much as 13% while Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash enjoyed positive performances.\nThe big issue for a marketplace which correlates this strongly with the movement of one asset is that it makes following all the other coins virtually irrelevant as they are simply more volatile versions of the same asset.\nPut simply when Bitcoin rises a couple of percents, Ethereum might rise 5% while Iota might rise 10% and likewise to the downside.\nThis is by no means a perfect example but it makes diversification almost impossible, and thus the need for stable coins like Tether which are very important for liquidity in cryptocurrency. The technical analysis points higher for Bitcoin\nThe charts in BTC/USD continue to be rather confusing as the lack of volume takes significance away from any of market moves. Regardless of the lack of speculation, Omkar Godbole at Coindesk believes that the recent bounce may now indicate that the price could reach as high as $7800 over the next day or so, with the mid $8000 level within reach beyond that,\n“Bitcoin will likely soon rise to $7,870 (descending trendline hurdle) in the next 24 hours. A high-volume break above that level would allow a re-test of the 50-day moving average, currently located at $8,522.”\nOf course, it is not all good news, and as is usually his style, Mr.Godbole included a bearish eventuality, indicating how high the stakes are if this rally fails,\n“Bearish scenario: The moving averages are maintaining a bearish bias, so a drop to $6,900 could be on the cards if the bulls fail to capitalize on the break above $7,500 and the price drops below $7,270 in the next 24 hours”\nFrom my perspective, it is only a return of volume which can make me particularly interested in any moves that Bitcoin makes moving forward. A big slip seems possible in thin liquidity but these can be reversed quickly if volumes return. For that reason, it is binoculars for most big speculators who won’t be keen to actually get involved until some degree of uncertainty is lifted in a meaningful way.

According to the central bank's report, high price volatility of cryptographic assets prevents them from becoming a reliable standard for values as a means of exchange and storage of value.\nIn addition, the document presents a number of risks associated with investing in cryptographic assets, including the lack of protection of investors' rights, the risk of preventing money laundering and terrorist financing, the lack of market liquidity, operational risk and the use of leverage.\nLet's now take a look at the Bitcoin technical picture at the H4 time frame. The market is hovering around the weekly pivot at the level of $7,582 which is very close to the golden trend line dynamic resistance. In a case of a breakout higher the next target is seen at the level of $7,890. In a case of a failure, the immediate support is seen at the level of $7,435 and then $7,247. The outlook remains bullish due to the completed corrective cycle of the wave 2/B. A breakout through the trend line will be the first confirmation the bottom is in place.

Do we all believe government can perfectly distribute this new money, of course it doesnt do so.\nHeres a good link I saw that I think explains about how USD self funding works and inversely why Bitcoin is in demand as unbiased to a central point of failure (not that I think any system can be perfect not even gold )\nhttps://twitter.com/WallSt_Dropout/status/981270850048577537\nQuote: Grandma and Grandpa can't even afford to buy Precious Metals anymore, much less Bitcoin.

A lot of people have the misinformed notion that Bitcoin and a majority of other cryptocurrencies are anonymous. But that is simply not true. If you go to Bitcoin.org, it clearly says that it is not anonymous . Is Bitcoin Anonymous? Yes, Bitcoin Is Not Completely Anonymous\nIt takes a decent amount of effort to ensure privacy protection of Bitcoin users. Every transaction made with Bitcoin is stored publicly and can be accessed by anyone. This includes knowing the balance of each account address. But there is no way of knowing the identity of a person holding the account address unless via a transaction or open declaration.\nTo ensure maximum privacy, it is advised that one Bitcoin address should be used no more than once. It is up to the user to remain vigilant and privacy-conscious in all their dealings with Bitcoin.\nWe can see why a lot of people think Bitcoin is anonymous. While it is advertised as an “anonymous digital currency” and notorious for Silk Road drug trades, it is not completely anonymous. To understand why it is necessary to look at the actual transaction process.\nWhen a Bitcoin transaction is made, it requires a Bitcoin address and a one-time-use-only token with a randomized sequence of digits and alphabets.\nSo you can send Bitcoin to an address much in the way you would send an email to a particular digital address.\nMoreover, since Bitcoin is decentralized and involves transactions without intermediaries, all transactions are publicly recorded on the online ledger called the Blockchain. All Digital Things Have a Trail\nIn truth, Bitcoin is pseudonymous, but not anonymous. Just like writers publishing under pen names or pseudonyms, pseudonym addresses perform the same function. In case the actual identity of any writer is connected with their pen name, people would know who that person is.\nLikewise, every transaction using Bitcoin is perpetually stored on the Blockchain even though they are made using pseudonymous addresses. So if any address you used to make transactions is linked back to you, everyone will get to know you. Moreover, they will know all the transactions you have ever made.\nCryptocurrencies are digital tokens of value that naturally have a digital trail. While it is possible to stay hidden by using Bitcoin addresses, you do reveal your address every time you make a transaction. Even if you use unique addresses every time, they could still be used to trace who you are. The Ross Ulbricht Case: Alleged Silk Road Creator\nAs all transactions between pseudonymous addresses are available publicly, tracing Bitcoins is not very difficult. This is one of the biggest reasons behind Ross Ulbricht’s arrest. He was convicted of using the pseudonym ‘Dread Pirate Roberts’ for running Silk Road. At his arrest at a San Francisco public library in 2013, Ulbricht’s laptop contained all the answers.\nUsing Bitcoin addresses on this laptop and comparing them with Silk Road Bitcoin addresses, FBI agents identified Ulbricht’s wallet. The agents even said that since the records were publicly available, the job became even easier. The main idea was to check if they had used a legit bank for the transactions. Your Identity Can Be Linked by Stores\nYou can use a number of methods to enhance your anonymity when using cryptocurrencies. Some of these include using multi-input transactions, having multiple wallets, using mixing services for trading out Bitcoins, and the use of web-hosted ‘eWallets’ for masking real owners.\nBut these efforts cannot stop store owners you are transacting with from finding your true identity linked with your Bitcoin address. Moreover, payment processors used by retailers can also do the same.\nSo if you are using Bitcoins to pay an online retailer using a customer identification number, you are at risk. This is because you are permitting them to connect your identity to your Blockchain username.\nAs almost all cryptocurrencies require transaction parties to show who they are, true anonymity is not possible.\nHungry.dk is an example of this. They offer take-out delivery services online and can be paid in Bitcoins for it. But they would also need an actual delivery address to deliver the food. So, your privacy is still at risk here. Cryptocurrency Traffic is NOT Encrypted\nAccording to the Bitcoin protocol, transactions require posting on Bitcoin’s nodes without any encryption. Likewise, two communicating nodes also do not use encryption. Currencies like Zcash, Monero, Dash, and others do not have encrypted node traffic as yet. Network monitoring entities like ISPs can use this to find out transaction and block origins. This will directly lead from the Bitcoin address to the user’s IP address and thus reveal their true identity. How to Make Bitcoin Transactions Anonymous?\nVPNs or Virtual Private Networks can be used for protecting privacy during transactions. Here are their main features. Outgoing traffic encryption from your device during transactions. Disarming of ISPs and government bodies from going to your wallet and tracking your transactions. Buying products anonymously without showing your actual IP address. Through configurations on proxy servers, only your wallet traffic can be routed via VPNs without impacting other online actions.\nSo yes, Bitcoin should always be used with a VPN. Take a look at our top VPN for Bitcoin review to get a better understanding of which VPNs are best to use when dealing with cryptocurrencies. Additional Tips Logless VPNs\nLogless VPNs do not store your activities on servers. They encrypt your online traffic and route them through a number of servers selected by you before delivery to endpoint destinations.\nAlso, make sure you use a shared IP address that is much more difficult to track than a dedicated IP. Keep in mind that if a VPN company stores your usage logs, it wouldn’t mind sharing those logs with the government. However, you do need to trust the VPN provider to not keep any logs. If you think a VPN provider is shady, it’s best to choose another. Using Tor\nThe Tor browser can be used to connect to the Bitcoin network. Tor’s community of volunteers is committed to anonymity and tracking-free use of the internet.\nNodes used by Tor encrypt and route online traffic through random device nodes on their dedicated network before delivery. It is very hard to definitively point out the IP addresses used in any transaction. However, KYC-activated sites like CoinBase, CoinSecure etc. make Tor less useful.

According to the central bank's report, high price volatility of cryptographic assets prevents them from becoming a reliable standard for values as a means of exchange and storage of value.\nIn addition, the document presents a number of risks associated with investing in cryptographic assets, including the lack of protection of investors' rights, the risk of preventing money laundering and terrorist financing, the lack of market liquidity, operational risk and the use of leverage.\nLet's now take a look at the Bitcoin technical picture at the H4 time frame. The market is hovering around the weekly pivot at the level of $7,582 which is very close to the golden trend line dynamic resistance. In a case of a breakout higher the next target is seen at the level of $7,890. In a case of a failure, the immediate support is seen at the level of $7,435 and then $7,247.

Thank you!\nThe advantage you will get is that your economy will get better if you know how to know using bitcoin properly. And the disadvantage if you do not know anything about bitcoin is to get big losses when you invest.\nAdvantage of bitcoin to the other coin is that in bitcoin many investors or traders witness how legit and nice bitcoin is because of his last performance on december 2017, many people waking up because of that movement. Disadvantage is that you need to hold it for a couple of months/years because its a long term.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T05:32:40.078+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "15914c0f3f7ab8ff34f6cea59c0627821c759f3f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.smdDwUub1RpNIgRUzWiakBFM1tXtZmExHjecoOixOIXffCtg3OkzQYIk5pEJufCoIWCNfQhKu1XD", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin has found a bottom after plunging 60% from December highs, says technician", "title_full": "Bitcoin has found a bottom after plunging 60% from December highs, says technician", "published": "2018-06-01T09:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "15914c0f3f7ab8ff34f6cea59c0627821c759f3f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.smdDwUub1RpNIgRUzWiakBFM1tXtZmExHjecoOixOIXffCtg3OkzQYIk5pEJufCoIWCNfQhKu1XD", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-01T09:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin has found a bottom after plunging 60% from December highs, says technician", "text": "Bitcoin has found a bottom after plunging 60% from December highs, says technician\n/u/Helios_WC\nsubmitted by /u/Helios_WC\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T09:44:56.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb9826795efe653f1fedbb00e98e4fd99323ceac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRfy4UHGN1lvmIX5q11IOR4p0eSmXe6PTsB77erYT2CTaa1QrrCkFwtD7uvTyBFU9AK2Fbn7GCSPY8v0Vvj_iYfzaCQY4inR5tIMGrSOOWFQ7IQmVbih80XVK5.DOaXEmk-", "site_full": "www.exchangerates.org.uk", "site": "exchangerates.org.uk", "site_section": "http://www.exchangerates.org.uk/news/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Exchange Rates UK - Currency News", "title": "Bitcoin, Where Next?

The Outlook For BTC Is As Unclear As It Has Ever Been Facebook Bitcoin adrift as investor disinterest continues - BTC/USD stuck moving sideways\nIn a decidedly disappointing few weeks for Bitcoin, a slow crawl downwards has been replaced with an even slighter tick sideways. The listless ship BTC has now been hovering around $7200 for a week and it does not appear that there are many people prepared to take a gamble in any direction as uncertainty is the name of the game. A global united front on regulation has so far failed to appear, and until this monster in the closet either shows itself in the daylight or goes away forever large investors will probably remain a little gun-shy. If there is one specific reason why volumes have dried up, this would be a significant cause for concern, and bulls will have to hope that a more hawkish US regulatory stance has not shown the level of legitimate speculation to be significantly less than it was in the free-wheeling days of 2017. Bitcoin techs “neutralized”\nThe outlook for BTC is as unclear as it has ever been, but in many ways, the fledgling market behaves much like an old-fashioned forex chart as it responds well to mechanical systems and a low to high volatility breaks have often followed through. Bitcoin is in such a period of low volatility and so the next move should be watched closely as investors will be hungry to jump in on the next move. Omkar Godbole an analyst at Coindesk believes that a $300 bounce is needed to justify an additional leg higher towards $8000,\n“The immediate outlook has been neutralized, but only a convincing move above the 10-day MA of $7,562 would add credence to yesterday's bullish outside-day candle and signal a short-term bullish reversal. In such a case, BTC will likely test the descending trendline hurdle, now seen at $7,930.”\nDespite this potentially bullish eventuality, the momentum is clearly to the downside longer term and Mr. Godbole believes that if this level gives way then it could be look out below, as $5000 could be on the cards once again,\n“The overall bias remains bearish as long as the falling trendline hurdle remains intact. Repeated rejection at the 50-candle MA resistance in 4-hour chart could yield a pullback to $7,100–$7,000.A break below $6,900 would open up downside towards $5,000,”\nCryptocurrency markets are in snooze mode and it will be interesting to see if they come out of their slumber anytime soon. There really isn’t a news cycle to make it happen so some kind of major development is needed, Bitcoin’s bulls are bruised and beaten but if they can hold 7K the future may be brighter towards years end.

However, he has since made another statement about the bitcoin, stating that the value of the currency is going to fall closer to $5,000 in the future.\nWoo wrote on social media that he feels the bitcoin will balance in value by a slight bit in the near future, but the currency will start to drop down in value after a while. He does not expect the bitcoin to hold onto the $7,000 value that is moving around.\nWoo also states that June will probably be the time with the bitcoin starts to fall further in value. He cites this with the belief that the currency is going to keep on dropping to around the $5,000 mark in the future.\nThe bitcoin has dropped in value since it was in a five-digit range in recent time. The bitcoin was listed around the $10,000 mark during the late part of February and has declined since then. The currency had gotten to around the $6,000 mark in the earlier part of April and had gotten up to $9,000 a month later. The value has been trending downward since and has been progressively getting lower over time as the value continues to drop further.\nThe analysis Willy Woo has put into the bitcoin suggests that the currency will break out of its losing pattern in the fall. He states that the drop of the bitcoin has been similar to what happened in 2014 when it went through a few cycles while dropping down in value. He also feels that while the bitcoin might start to drop in more cycles before it moves up in value again, the cycles are not going to last as long as they have in the past.\nAlthough the bitcoin did not have any dramatic drops or rises in the past month, the currency has experienced a progressive drop in its value. The currency has fallen by around a thousand dollars in value since the start of May. The trading volume for the currency has been consistent all this time as well.\nIn a related story, the bitcoin has experienced a drop in its value in recent time. The decline comes as the value of the currency starts to drop. The fees for the bitcoin are lower right now than what they are for Bitcoin Cash , a rival that was originally promoted as being a low-fee version of bitcoin. In addition, the bitcoin is increasing in its adoption rate, thus making it slightly more accessible to where it becomes easier for people to handle certain transactions.\nThe bitcoin’s drop in value continues to move forward to this moment. It is uncertain as to how long it will take for the currency to catch back up, but Willy Woo is not confident that there will be any positive changes coming along in the near future over the value in the currency.

It provides an alternative to physical banking in the 21st century. Exchange is through \"electronic wallet software\". Bitcoin actually subverts the traditional banking system and operates outside government regulations.\nBitcoin uses state-of-the-art encryption technology and can be distributed in any denomination, has a decentralized distribution system, and is in great demand worldwide. Compared to other treaties (such as US dollars), it has several obvious advantage. First of all, it cannot be embellished or frozen by banks or government agencies.\nBack in 2009, when the value of Bitcoin was only 10 cents per coin, if you waited for 8 years, you could convert thousands of dollars into millions of dollars. The number of Bitcoins that can be purchased is limited to 21,000,000. At the time of writing this article, the total number of Bitcoins in circulation was 16,275,288, which means that the proportion of total Bitcoin mined was 77.5%. At that time, a bitcoin was at the time of writing this article. Its current value is US$1,214.70\nAccording to Bill Gates, \"Bitcoin is more exciting and better than currency.\" Bitcoin is a decentralized form of currency. What is blockchain technology it does not need any \"concern any transaction\"] Trusted Third Parties. By excluding the bank, you will also eliminate most of the share of each transaction fee. In addition, the time required to transfer funds from point A to point B will also be significantly reduced. 19659003] the largest transaction using Bitcoin is $150 million. This transaction charges a minimum fee within a few seconds. In order to use the \"trusted third party\" to transfer large sums of money, it takes days or even thousands of dollars. This explains why banks are fiercely opposed to people buying, selling, trading, transferring, and spending Bitcoin.\nOnly 0.003% of the world's (250,000) people are estimated to hold at least one bitcoin. Only 24% of people know what it is. Bitcoin transactions chronologically entering \"blockchain\" is just the way banks do business. At the same time, blocks are like individual bank statements. In other words, blockchain is the public ledgers of all bitcoin transactions that have ever been executed. It grows with \"complete.\" Blocks add a new set of records. For traditional banking, for example, blockchain is like the complete history of banking transactions.\nStep 2 - Set up your e-wallet software account\nAs long as you create your own unique e-wallet software account, you can transfer funds from your e-wallet to the recipient's e-wallet in bits In the form of currency, if you want to use the bitcoin ATM to withdraw funds from your account, you will basically link your wallet address to your selected ATM cash wallet address. To make Bitcoin transfer on the trading platform, you just need to put your e-wallet address \"#\" to the e-wallet address at the trading platform of your choice. Actually, it is better than listening It's much easier to learn. The learning curve associated with using wallets is very short.\nIn order to set up an e-wallet, there are countless companies that provide secure, free, and packaged wallet solutions online. Where to get bitcoin wallet a simple Google search will help you find the right one for you Depending on your needs, many people start using the \"blockchain\" account. This is a free setup and is very secure. You can choose to set up a two-tier login protocol to further enhance your e-wallet account Security and security, in essence, prevent your account from being hacked.\nThere are many options for setting up an electronic wallet. A company called QuadrigaCX is a good place to start. You can find them through Google search. Quadrigacx employs some of the most stringent security protocols currently in existence. In addition, QuadrigaCX-funded Bitcoin is stored in a freezer and may use some of the most secure encryption programs. In other words, it is a very safe place for Bitcoin and other digital circles.\nIn order to withdraw local currency funds from your e-wallet, you need to find bitcoin ATMs, which are usually found in local businesses in most major cities. Bitcoin ATM can be found through a simple Google search.\nStep 3 - Purchase any part of bitcoin denomination\nTo purchase any number of Bitcoins, you need to deal with digital currency brokers. As with any currency broker, you must pay the broker a fee when you buy Bitcoin. If this is all you want to buy, it is possible to buy Bitcoins or less. The cost is based solely on the current market value of the full bitcoin at any given time.\nThere are a large number of Bitcoin brokers on the Internet. How to purchase bitcoin a simple Google search will allow you to easily find the best one for you. It is always a good idea to compare their interest rates before making a purchase. Before you buy through a broker, you should also confirm the Bitcoins interest rate online because interest rates tend to fluctuate frequently.\nStep 4 - Stay away from any trading platform Promising unrealistic returns to undoubted investors\nLook for a reputable Bitcoin trading company offering high returns for your online success Is very important. Earning 1% per day in the industry is considered high returns. It is impossible to earn 10% a day. With online bitcoin transactions, it is feasible to double the digital currency within 90 days. You must avoid being attracted by any company that provides a return of 10% per day. This type of return on digital currency trading is unrealistic. Where do you trade bitcoin there is a company called Coinexpro that provides Bitcoin traders with a 10% fee each day. It eventually became a Ponzi scheme. If it is 10% a day, walk away. The above trading platform looks very complicated and is considered legal. My advice is to focus on trading your Bitcoin with a company that offers a reasonable return (such as 1% per day). There are other companies that will try to use unscrupulous methods to separate you from Bitcoin. For any company that provides unrealistic returns, please be careful. Once you transfer your bitcoin to the recipient, you can do almost anything to restore it. You must ensure that your trading company of choice is fully automated and integrated with the blockchain [19950007] from receipt to payment.

Go Jaxx. Thank you for the commitment to support Bitcoin Cash in your wallets!\nIn the blog post they describe the problem more specifically, and it make sense to me. The issue is Bitpay’s most recent releases of Insight might support BCH post HF but those most recent Insight releases have significant changes for which Jaxx’s internal layer utilizing it would need significant changes to adopt. Or in order words Jaxx is running on a stable older version of Insight which Bitpay hasn’t back-ported changes need to support BCH post recent HF.\n”If you need to transact with BCH immediately you can always export your private keys or mnemonic (found in the MENU > Tools > Backup Wallet > View Backup Phrase) and then import them into another wallet program such as bitcoin-abc. A long-standing tenet of Jaxx has been that your private keys belong to you and we will never lock our users into our platform.”\nGood advice and obviously possible, abc and bitcoin.com wallet can do it. However for you non tech guys out there you might want to see if you can hold tight for the update, don’t trust other random wallet programs or apps you find out there, Jaxx can be trusted. Just be super careful whenever exposing private keys to any software you don’t fully know and trust.\n”Please accept my apologies on behalf of the Jaxx team at Decentral Inc. We’re working hard to bring BCH back online as well as to meet our timeline to bring you Jaxx Liberty on July 1st.”\nI personally accept his apology and believe in them.\n submitted by /u/bchjaxxproblems\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://blog.jaxx.io/bitcoin-cash-network-upgrade-jaxx-wallet-bch/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T04:50:28.046+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a181799a9a433fbe25c92037b28e62ffcff24c5d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRY2Shc8M9uV_qarllSSsDajcDYuDOmjZ0b2bXQhUaxfCgxzNeB7AAELk1JdaAKB82rK97.SsxvmA--", "site_full": "netmag.pk", "site": "netmag.pk", "site_section": "http://netmag.pk/feed/atom", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NetMag Pakistan", "title": "Chance to get free Bitcoins for betting on FIFA 2018 winners via CryptoCup", "title_full": "Chance to get free Bitcoins for betting on FIFA 2018 winners via CryptoCup", "published": "2018-06-01T08:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "PK", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://netmag.pk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ASB-15.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a181799a9a433fbe25c92037b28e62ffcff24c5d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRY2Shc8M9uV_qarllSSsDajcDYuDOmjZ0b2bXQhUaxfCgxzNeB7AAELk1JdaAKB82rK97.SsxvmA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ayesha Maqbool", "published": "2018-06-01T08:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "Chance to get free Bitcoins for betting on FIFA 2018 winners via CryptoCup", "text": "News June 1, 2018 Ayesha Maqbool Chance to get free Bitcoins for betting on FIFA 2018 winners via CryptoCup Chance to get free Bitcoins for betting on FIFA 2018 winners via CryptoCup.
