There is a rising speculation that the SEC could start calling some cryptos securities and if they do that, it creates some rather sticky legal issues for the founders and holders.\nHere’s a post that explains why this is such an issue.\nAnd this is a big case that may be the decision maker from a legal standpoint in the US.\nAnyway, if the SEC does end up classing them as securities it could cause some extreme volatility in the crypto market, I mean, even more than usual.\nIf something is classified as a security then it has to be subject to the usual laws and regulations regarding traditional financial assets. Meaning, it needs to be registered with the authorities according to the laws already set in place and be taxable as such. Anyone who has made profits in crypto, and converted those profits into cash, could be liable to pay taxes on those profits.\nFor example, any new ETF like the one that the Winklevoss twins have just secured a patent for will be classified a security.\nCryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are a different ball of wax. We’re talking about a brand new asset class here and the coins themselves will likely require new sets of rules that are more versatile and designed to encompass this new technology.\nBecause we live in a moderately diversified world, the laws could end up being different in every country. The Swiss have actually set an excellent precedent in their ICO guidelines , which breaks down the crypto classification into three different categories:\nBitcoin would certainly fall under the first category as it is designed to be a means of payment and store of value.\nEthereum and Ripple’s XRP are classic examples of Utility Tokens. They were designed to interact with their respective blockchains in order to provide access/payment to an application or service within the network.\nAsset Tokens, or Securities, implies that the token holder will be entitled to partial ownership in the company or foundation. This can manifest itself as a share of the company’s profits or voting rights within the company.\nThough the Ethereum network often holds votes using ETH tokens, the act of holding the token itself does not give the hodler the right to influence the network’s actions. Ripple’s XRP is managed by a private company called Ripple Labs and XRP holders are not entitled to any piece of that company.\nThe original DAO tokens in 2016, for those of you who remember that experiment, were considered Securities as confirmed by the SEC .\nThis content is provided for information and educational purposes only and should not be considered to be investment advice or recommendation.\nThe outlook presented is a personal opinion of the analyst and does not represent an official position of eToro.\nPast performance is not an indication of future results. All trading involves risk; only risk capital you are prepared to lose.\nCryptocurrencies can widely fluctuate in prices and are not appropriate for all investors. Trading cryptocurrencies is not supervised by any EU regulatory framework.\nMati Greenspan is the Senior Market Analyst at eToro, a global social trading and investment platform.

On May 11, Bitstamp used this data to advocate for offline storage and argue that this puts an upward pressure on the price. Bitstamp: “That Makes Bitcoin Even Scarcer”\nThe data shows that around 20% of the circulating supply is inaccessible or has been destroyed. The price of a cryptocurrency depends on the ratio between buyers and sellers. If there is much more supply than demand, the price lowers and vice versa. As such a large percentage of the circulating supply is unable to be sold, there is less supply-side pressure. In theory, this adds momentum to the price rising.\nBitstamp said : “All of these losses could easily be avoided if people behaved with the same vigilance when storing Bitcoin as we do with traditional assets, like gold. In fact, just like with gold and paper money, the safest place to store crypto might be in a good-old safety deposit box.”\nBitcoins are lost when they are sent to incompatible addresses, including addresses for other cryptocurrencies. Alternatively, access to Bitcoins can be lost when a user no longer knows their private key. The Bitcoins are still in the network but will never be moved. James Howell hit the news when he asked his local council to dig up a landfill site to find his lost hard drive containing 7,500 BTC. This would have a current value of around $64 million. LOST COINS: Research suggests that anywhere between 2.8 and 3.8 million #Bitcoin might be lost forever. That makes Bitcoin even scarcer, but also shines a light on the significance of safe #storage with HW #wallets like @TREZOR and @LedgerHQ . https://t.co/qIU4t8zxDD\n— Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) May 11, 2018\nHowever, while Bitstamp may be concerned with the safety of private keys, concerns have been raised over the storage of passport details by exchanges and companies running ICOs. Simon Lange, founder of Liberal Coins , said: “You can see with one of our competitors that they do Know-Your-Customer (KYC) checks in-house. I am very concerned with the passport data out there. Usually with exchanges, they secure cryptocurrencies in cold storage but with user data, we do not know how they store it.” In January, eight South Korean exchanges were fined for various privacy violations involving user data.\nThere are a lot of blockchain use cases, such as Datum , that are trying to solve the problem of user data and allow users the ability to sell their data and control who has access. With regard to exchanges, Yoti is trying to solve the problem by providing users with an encrypted ID. Mark Hindle, Brand and Communications Manager, said: “We believe the current process is outdated. If you are showing your passport, you are showing your details. It does definitely open you up to the potential of identity fraud.” They are currently working on integrating with a number of exchanges but have only recently moved into the cryptocurrency sphere.\nChainanalysis , who provided the data, is a company that focuses on compliance and investigations regarding blockchain technology. They work with businesses and governments to turn the obscure data of cryptocurrency transactions into usable data. This means they can help track criminal activity and suspicious behaviour. They have shown that although Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, in some cases users can be identified.

with digital currencies: Hackers and scammers can make them vanish. If an owner has a poor memory, the bitcoins can get locked for eternity in an electronic wallet, like a fly in amber.\nSome high-profile people have admitted this year to losing cryptocurrency, among them Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.\nIn another case last month, a cryptocurrency promoter doing a livestream on his YouTube channel was notified by a viewer that digital currency was flowing out of the host’s virtual account. The host later acknowledged he suffered losses of “over $2 million.”\nIn the Wild West world of bitcoin and other digital currencies, many new investors may not fully grasp the challenges of keeping their crypto investments safe, whether on their own devices or lodged in accounts at exchanges around the globe.\nMore on cryptocurrencies Why AI and cryptocurrency are making a type of computer chip scarce S&P decides against crytocurrency indexes — for now Twitter to ban cryptocurrency ads, joining Facebook, Google Trump bans US use of Venezuelan cryptocurrency With bitcoin mining, the Mid-Columbia basin joins the tech elite — or a Ponzi scheme | Jon Talton Google to ban cryptocurrency and related advertisements “I suspect many small investors may assume that their money is as safe as it would be in an online bank. But that’s not necessarily the case,” said Graham Cluley, a British security blogger and researcher.\nBitcoins first emerged in 2009, spawning the creation of dozens of other digital currencies that exist only in electronic form. They operate independently of central banks and have fluctuated wildly in value. A single bitcoin traded for around $9,130 last week.\nCryptocurrency exchanges, where buyers and sellers gather to trade digital currencies, are like honey pots for hackers. In the largest known heist to date, hackers in late January made off with around $530 million in cryptocurrency from a Tokyo-based exchange, Coincheck.\n“South Korea said they thought it could be North Korea (behind the heist) but I haven’t seen any other evidence of that, and it has the hallmarks of the typical cyber hack by thieves,” said Yaya J. Fanusie, a former economic and counterterrorism analyst at the CIA who is now at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a national security think tank in Washington, D.C.\nAn Italian-based platform, BitGrail, reported that hackers made off with more than $170 million of a cryptocurrency known as Nano in February.\nThe loss experienced by Wozniak stung, even though he is a multimillionaire.\n“I had seven bitcoins stolen from me through fraud,” Wozniak told the Global Business Summit in New Delhi on Feb. 26, according to the Economic Times newspaper. “Somebody bought them from me online through a credit card and they canceled the credit-card payment. It was that easy! And it was from a stolen credit-card number so you can never get it back.”\nBitcoins and many other digital currencies have public keys and private keys. The private key is a secret number that allows someone to access his or her cryptocurrency.\nWhoever has the private key controls what’s in an electronic wallet.\nCluley said there were “lots of reports of folks losing a small fortune (and sometimes a large one) … following the loss of their private keys.”\nSometimes the method by which bitcoins are lost remains a mystery years later.\nTom Curry, who is a homebuilder in Massachusetts, still remembers his chagrin the day in 2013 when he lost 996 bitcoins, which at today’s prices would be about $9.2 million.\n“I woke up at 5:30 or 6 in the morning and I got a text message: ‘All the bitcoins have been removed from your wallet,’ ” Curry said. Someone had gained access to his account and his private key.\nMost Read Business Stories A look at Seattle businesses facing the head tax Albertsons closing two Seattle stores Passenger helps subdue naked man on flight to Alaska WTO rules Airbus failed to fix harm done to Boeing; U.S. to seek tariffs against the EU After head-tax vote, Amazon resuming work on one building, but unsure of plans for another Unlimited Digital Access: $1 for 4 weeks Curry bought the bitcoins for a few bucks each, he said, and still rues what they would be worth today if he hadn’t been ripped off.\n“I would no longer be doing construction. I would be in the Caribbean, that’s a definite,” he said in a telephone interview.\nIf a digital-currency owner loses a private key — say, storing it on a laptop that melts down, or simply forgetting it — the bitcoins are essentially frozen in an electronic limbo.\n“Let’s say a guy dies and he never gave his wife the private keys, and she doesn’t know how to move that crypto,” Fanusie said. “She’s a millionaire in crypto but with no way to get it.”\nFanusie said problems around securing and managing private keys for electronic wallets is a major drawback to digital currencies, harder than dealing with ordinary passwords.\n“For cryptocurrencies to grow in adoption, someone’s going to have to figure out a better way for private key management, a way that’s more easy to use. Right now, that just doesn’t exist,” Fanusie said.\nOne solution is to store digital currency in a hardware wallet, a physical device a bit larger than a USB flash drive, which is not connected to the internet, kept in what industry experts call cold storage. Only when the hardware wallet is plugged into a computer can the currency be accessed.\nThe crypto promoter who suffered the loss of digital currency on an April 16 livestream is Ian Balina, a former IBM analyst who has drawn tens of thousands of followers on his YouTube and Telegram channels. Balina later tweeted an explanation.\n“I ended today’s livestream b/c I am being hacked,” Balina wrote. “I’m not worried about the money. I learned my lesson. I only care about catching the hacker.”\nBalina said in a May 2 tweet that he’d gone to the FBI and “we believe to have identified the hacker(s). Funds recovery is a super complex situation. When dealing with folks outside the US, the process can take a while.”\nBalina did not respond to inquiries about the incident.\nTim Johnson", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "starbucks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nestle", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "woodinville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wild west", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T18:01:13.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb02c6ea9c3efd368989da6b3079f1ae5bb84fb6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ12d1OcfFtBQX63OFaX7pPXDjcAfKl4c1SdkNkMm0T.Yy.S.iCNYzGwRPX_Q7AC6_yDzrm38YWVW7ppo0.6hn3zvP9CMXhY4VSErpb58Uyxw--", "site_full": "www.blackhatworld.com", "site": "blackhatworld.com", "site_section": "http://www.blackhatworld.com/forums/-/index.rss", "site_categories": ["herbs_for_health", "health", "non_standard_content", "social"], "section_title": "BlackHatWorld", "title": "BitCoin/Crypto Trading Journey 1.5k to 15k", "title_full": "BitCoin/Crypto Trading Journey 1.5k to 15k", "published": "2018-05-13T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.blackhatworld.com/data/avatars/m/37/37830.jpg?1463572384", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2337, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb02c6ea9c3efd368989da6b3079f1ae5bb84fb6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ12d1OcfFtBQX63OFaX7pPXDjcAfKl4c1SdkNkMm0T.Yy.S.iCNYzGwRPX_Q7AC6_yDzrm38YWVW7ppo0.6hn3zvP9CMXhY4VSErpb58Uyxw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "anil2006 (invalid@example.com)", "published": "2018-05-13T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "BitCoin/Crypto Trading Journey 1.5k to 15k", "text": "Likes Received: 227 I use technical analysis to decide entry and exit and do trades almost every other day. I start i was losing money but slowly started to protect my asset and start making some profits. In last two weeks i made around 30% profit using trading. In start i used to hold but that was making me loss so i left holding and started trading. My main focus is to increase amount of bitcoins as i believe it will explode very soon even if market is down right now. But increasing USD is also important so i will report my asset in BTC and USD both. I have another successful journey running in money making section and from that you can see i am kinda long term guy and try to have patience in Business and trading as well. Hope you guys will benefit from my experience and knowledge and be inspired to make profit by seeing my moves daily. I use tradingview for charting and technical analysis and try to update this thread daily for every other day. Or if there is some major move . I will start with today's scene and prediction for upcoming days: 13th may Chart: After getting rejected from a major resistance at 10k, BTC dumped to around 8.2k and now hanging around 8.5k . It is making a big triangle which can turn in big bear flag and may dump BTC to 7.2k once triangle completes , which is expected to complete at E of ABCDE (check chart). E point is known to overshoot or undershoot so do not get surprised if it does not play perfectly . Remember no TA is 100% correct but even if you can make it correct 50% of time with good risk reward and money management , you will be in profit at end of week or month. Keep an eye on resistance of triangle , it needs to break 8600 and stay above to go up, otherwise down.

When looking at a historic snapshot from May 12th, 2013, by far the best cryptocurrency purchase one could have made was bitcoin.\nAlso Read: Markets Update: Cryptocurrencies Lose Steam During the Weekend\nBTC Top Performing Market Since May 12th, 2013 According to the snapshot , bitcoin had a market capitalization of just 1.293 billion on the 12th of May, 2012. Back then, the circulating supply was just over half of it maximum total, with approximately 11.14 million coins in circulation.\nThe price was just $116.07 USD, however, had just gained by approximately 40% in ten days – with the bounce comprising a recovering rally following the fallout from the early-2013 bubble that saw many Cypriots charge into the bitcoin markets seeking refuge from the harsh structural adjustment policies imposed by the European Union and International Monetary Fund.\nOf all fourteen cryptocurrency markets listed on Coinmarketcap on May 12, 2013, bitcoin has since far outperformed its rivals, gaining by approximately 7175% in the last five years.\nLTC Only Altcoin Still Ranked in Top Ten by Market Capitalization Of the markets listed on the 2013 snapshot, Litecoin is by far the altcoin with the largest market capitalization today (approximately $7.94 billion as of this writing). At the time of the snapshot, the then second largest cryptocurrency had a total market capitalization of just $59.1 million, and a circulating supply of roughly 17.5 million.\nAt the current prices of roughly $140.55, LTC has made gains of 4,083% during five years. Whilst Litecoin’s market dominance has since eroded, LTC is still the sixth largest cryptocurrency by market cap – making it the best performing altcoin from May 12, 2013.\nOnly 50% of Crypto Markets Are More Valuable Today Than They Were 5 Years Ago The third highest performing crypto market since the snapshot is the then twelfth largest by market cap, Ixcoin . At the time of the snapshot, Ixcoin was priced at approximately $0.015. With IXC current trading for $0.193096, Ixcoin’s value has inflated by 1177% in the last 5 years. IXC’s capitalization has grown from $191,294 to approximately $4 million, ranking it 677th by market cap.\nAt the time of the snapshot, Peercoin was the third largest market by capitalization (approximately $4.72 million), with PPC trading for roughly $0.25. Currently priced at $2.56, PPC has since gained 924%. Peercoin has been among the most enduring of May 2013’s crypto markets, currently comprising the 198th largest market with a capitalization of $63.3 million.\nThe then fourth largest cryptocurrency, Namecoin , has offered investors a modest return of approximately 130% since the snapshot, gaining in price from $0.853 to $1.96. NMC’s is now the 309th largest market, having grown from a capitalization of $4.70 million to $28.8 million today.\nFeathercoin , the then ninth largest cryptocurrency market, has gained from $0.1256 to $0.169727 – a meager 35.1% increase in five years. Feathercoin is now the 278th largest market, with FTC’s capitalization growing from to $821,341 to $34 million.\nThe then seventh largest market, Novacoin , has gained by only 15.5% in five years, increasing in value from $3.54 to $4.09. NVC is now the 550th largest market with a capitalization, growing from almost $1 million to roughly $8.5 million.\n46% of Altcoins Have Lost More Than 80% of Their Value Nearly half of the altcoins included in the snapshot – many of which promised that they would change the world whilst making investors rich – have since lost more than 80% of their value.\nThe then fifth largest cryptocurrency market, Terracoin , has dropped nearly 81% from $0.4 to 0.164. It is ranked 694th by market cap, after gaining from approximately $1 million to $3.74 million.\nAt the time of the snapshot, Freicoin was the eighth largest crypto market with a capitalization of $882,374. Since then, FRC’s capitalization has actually shrunk to a meager $203,719 (approximately 24 BTC) – ranking it 1,152nd by market cap. The price has also decreased by 84.5%, falling from $0.0424 to $0.00658.\nThe market cap of the then eleventh ranked market, Mincoin , has also shrunk – dropping from $230,012 to $169,379 (approximately 20 BTC). Now ranked 1,170th, MNC has also shed nearly 83% of its value, with prices falling from $0.220779 to $0.037906.\n23% of Altcoins Trading on the 12th of May, 2013 Now Appear Dead Nearly a quarter of the altcoins included in the snapshot now appear dormant.\nData for the then sixth largest crypto market, Devcoin , stops on November 24th, 2017 – with the last recorded price of $0.000023 comprising an approximately 90% drop from $0.000223.\nThe most recent price for then tenth ranked market, CHNCoin , was recorded on boxing day last year – CHNCoin having then dropped by nearly 99% in five years, falling from $0.1 to just $0.001222.\nAnd lastly, but certainly not least, data for then thirteenth ranked market, BBQCoin , also ended on the 24th of November – with BBQ’s final price of $0.000458 comprising a 95% loss in value from $0.0091.\nWhat was your opinion of cryptocurrency in 2013?

If your idea of who owns what is different than mine then how can we trade?\nTo achieve this, the Bitcoin protocol keeps its ledger of all transactions in a series of blocks, with each block recording a collection of transactions. Since we don't have a central authority to declare which blocks are valid, we run a 'lottery' instead.\nEach miner bundles up all the new transactions he knows about, adds in an extra transaction which creates some coins out of thin air and pays them to the miner, mixes in a random number and hashes the whole thing. If he gets a hash less than a certain number, he wins and his block is added to the blockchain. If not, he tries with a different random number, over and over. Everyone else can verify that his random number with his transactions hashes to a low enough number, so they accept his block. The network periodically adjusts what this target \"low enough number\" is, in an attempt to keep the average speed of block generation at about 10 minutes. Why do we need a GPU, not a CPU?\nYou generate coins by calculating hashes. Each hash you calculate has a certain chance of making a block, and earning the associated reward, which is currently 50 coins. The faster you can calculate hashes, the more chance you have of generating 50 coins. It just so happens that ATI GPUs have the right kind of hardware in them to calculate sha256 hashes many times faster than an Intel CPU can do it. That's why people use GPUs instead of CPUs.\nThe Bitcoin network automatically adjusts the \"chance per hash\" to try to keep the global rate of generation at one block every ten minutes.\nIn the beginning, before GPU mining started in earnest and not many people were mining, CPU mining worked just fine. But as more people joined the network and hash rates became faster, the network difficulty increased to keep the blocks coming along every 10 minutes or so. As a result, CPU mining became less rewarding per CPU.\nThen when it became more common for miners to use GPU hardware to mine because it is so much faster and more energy efficient than CPU mining, the global network hash rate increased still further eventually making it completely useless to mine with a CPU; the expected rewards are less than the power consumed by the CPU.\nMaybe one day FPGAs or ASICs will render GPUs useless for mining, like GPUs already did to CPUs.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "gpu", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T16:02:16.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d50bcafb30065301a1ae06a00f861263e96f4cfa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.2.AUx1dtMfX2hkErMAvYu6hHhEuYQVI6eykFWINrBiGgPAmbvUWWsUi4G17TN.G9d2IAi_2kHW8G.sX0KbiBYyP3UiZpULcxMfSOSQRUz0Q--", "site_full": "www.howbitcoinminingworks.com", "site": "howbitcoinminingworks.com", "site_section": "http://www.howbitcoinminingworks.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "How Bitcoin Mining Works", "title": "This German Bank Prefers Bitcoin Over SWIFT for International Transfers", "title_full": "This German Bank Prefers Bitcoin Over SWIFT for International Transfers", "published": "2018-05-13T15:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d50bcafb30065301a1ae06a00f861263e96f4cfa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.2.AUx1dtMfX2hkErMAvYu6hHhEuYQVI6eykFWINrBiGgPAmbvUWWsUi4G17TN.G9d2IAi_2kHW8G.sX0KbiBYyP3UiZpULcxMfSOSQRUz0Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mosquito Control (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-13T15:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "This German Bank Prefers Bitcoin Over SWIFT for International Transfers", "text": "\nhttps://ift.tt/2rDQwz4 via /r/Bitcoin https://ift.tt/2KkNirb ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bank prefers bitcoin over swift", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T18:39:18.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "27ff17b4ba00c27423b71bbbfa58b29c79be5e9d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTE3rPE82S_4_9aR2Jo8uvKXDs7hYcXxaYEWjdwDT86HEhjN7z_jjRRx7CjBKV6fTL2npOq7vL6Ww--", "site_full": "cryptocoremedia.com", "site": "cryptocoremedia.com", "site_section": "http://bits.aihosting.com/rss", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "BTC News Aggregator", "title": "Bitcoin part of 28 Blockchain Projects to be Assessed by Chinese Government", "title_full": "Bitcoin part of 28 Blockchain Projects to be Assessed by Chinese Government", "published": "2018-05-13T15:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cryptocoremedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/China_28_proyect-1024x422.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "27ff17b4ba00c27423b71bbbfa58b29c79be5e9d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTE3rPE82S_4_9aR2Jo8uvKXDs7hYcXxaYEWjdwDT86HEhjN7z_jjRRx7CjBKV6fTL2npOq7vL6Ww--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-13T15:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin part of 28 Blockchain Projects to be Assessed by Chinese Government", "text": "28 Blockchain Projects to be Assessed by China Blockchain Projects to be Assessed by China\nThe Chinese government is set to assess blockchain projects and introduce a new rating system in the process. China’s Ministry for Information and Technology will rate 28 projects based on the technological capabilities and their utility to the public. We will be covering all the 28 projects in detail to give our readers knowledge on them and the ability to decide for themselves if the Chinese government’s ratings live up to expectations. Bitcoin\nBitcoin is the first and the original blockchain project started by an anonymous developer known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The world’s best developers are working on and contributing to this project. It is the most decentralized blockchain of all since there is no central authority to control it. It works by using the proof-of-work algorithm and has a massive hashpower that adds security to the entire network. Developers are currently working on the lightning network which is a second layer scaling solution designed to facilitate microtransactions.\nMany see Bitcoin’s major drawback to be the high fees and slow network speed due to the huge transaction volume. This has already been rectified after Segwit was enabled using a soft fork. The network fees have come down to 1 Sat/byte on average, and the Segwit adoption is also growing at a rapid pace. Segwit adoption was at 35% at the time of writing. The Lightning network is another scaling solution being employed on Bitcoin. It takes microtransactions off the main chain to a secondary layer. People are awaiting the Lightening network for making microtransactions at negligible fees. Ethereum\nJust like apples and oranges, Bitcoin and Ethereum are different blockchain projects. Bitcoin was created to be used as a world reserve currency while Ethereum was created to be used as a “world computer.” Programs are built on the Ethereum blockchain and transactions are made only when the conditions in the program are met. These programs on the Ethereum blockchain are called Smart Contracts and the transactions are carried out using the currency Ether .\nSmart Contracts are programs that automatically run on the blockchain once incorporated onto the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum also uses proof-of-work algorithm and Ether is created through mining. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has mentioned that they will be moving to the proof-of-stake algorithm this year. There are thousands of decentralized apps created on Ethereum blockchain. Each one of them is programmed to carry out certain tasks in a decentralized manner. Ethereum also faces performance issues like Bitcoin and the team is working on improving the performance of the network.\nThere are a lot of other competitors to Etherum like EOS, Cardano, Kamodo, Waves and many others trying to build a platform for enabling smart contracts. For now, Ethereum is still the most popular and widely used. Ripple\nRipple Labs is the organization that has developed the token called XRP. Ripple is built on distributed ledger technology which requires various parties to validate the transaction. In short, Ripple is a payment network (RippleNet) and a cryptocurrency (Ripple XRP). The technology can be used as a cryptocurrency as well as a cross-border payment system for financial institutions like banks and private remittance agencies like Western Union money transfer. If successful, Ripple XRP could disrupt the $500 Billion global remittance industry.\nRipple’s major competitor is the traditional Swift payment used by the banks for cross-border payments. Ripple promises to replace Swift and become the global leader in cross-border transactions. Swift is a messaging system that is used by financial institutions for transmitting information related to the transactions globally. Banks are still using Swift and are reluctant to move to XRP. This is due to regulatory issues with various governments. Ripple Lab’s other products are being used globally by financial institution. xCurrent is one of the products. We will just have to take a wait and see approach to figure out if the banks would be using XRP for global remittance. Keep in mind that this is a half a trillion dollar industry. Litecoin\nLitecoin was created by Charlie Lee in 2011. It is famously called:\n“The Silver to Bitcoin’s Gold”\nIn reality, Litecoin is like a little brother to Bitcoin, and they both complement each other. Litecoin also acts as a testnet for Bitcoin since some major releases have been implemented on Litecoin prior to being implemented on Bitcoin. Litecoin has faster and cheaper transactions compared to Bitcoin. The 2.5 minutes block time is faster than Bitcoins’s 10 minutes. In theory, for every single Bitcoin block, 4 Litecoin blocks get confirmed during the same period. Litecoin also implemented Segwit prior to Bitcoin. There are also plans to have the Lightning network on Litecoin. Bitcoin Cash\nBitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin that was created by a part of the community led by Roger Ver, early Bitcoin adopter and a strong advocate and Chinese crypto miner Jihan Wu. They wanted to split from the original blockchain since they believed in a block size increase as a scaling solution. They dismissed Segwit as a viable scaling solution and argued that it was not the “Orginal Vision of Satoshi” since it was not stated in the whitepaper.\nBitcoin Cash was forked from the Bitcoin blockchain after Segwit was enabled by a soft fork in August 2017. Since then, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has experienced gradual growth and adoption across the globe. It has also come under severe accusations from the Bitcoin community for brand confusion. The complaints are that newcomers are being made to believe Bitcoin Cash was the real Bitcoin.\nWith time, we will know if bigger blocks with Bitcoin Cash are a better scaling solution than Segwit and Lightening network.\nThe above are the major five projects from the 28 blockchain projects to be assessed by the Chinese government. The remaining projects are explained in detail in the articles linked below.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://webmaster.yandex.ru/vocabularies/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "blockchain projects", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry for information and technology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T00:20:56.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a6da7e3e5218af5d6ff2924f005b7b0d1c593823", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__38hpNqqVg.IWgjRETlLlD9ZjZDWzUyidw_rfm9oFHddIrCvK.sEK3DBxIgoH7Shy5w--", "site_full": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin24on.blogspot.se/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "title": "5 Years Ago You Should Have Bought Bitcoin, Not Altcoins", "title_full": "5 Years Ago You Should Have Bought Bitcoin, Not Altcoins", "published": "2018-05-13T15:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a6da7e3e5218af5d6ff2924f005b7b0d1c593823", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeB5da2ruv__38hpNqqVg.IWgjRETlLlD9ZjZDWzUyidw_rfm9oFHddIrCvK.sEK3DBxIgoH7Shy5w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin 24on (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-13T15:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "5 Years Ago You Should Have Bought Bitcoin, Not Altcoins", "text": "Home » bitcoin news » crypto coin » crypto news » 5 Years Ago You Should Have Bought Bitcoin, Not Altcoins 5 Years Ago You Should Have Bought Bitcoin, Not Altcoins bitcoin news , crypto coin , crypto news #bitcoin #news # invest #money\nWith seemingly endless new altcoins claiming that they will change the world whilst generating exorbitant returns for investors, it can be highly informative to sometimes get a bird’s eye view of longer-term altcoin performance by digging through the annals of Coinmarketcap’s historic snapshots. When looking at a historic snapshot from May 12th, 2013, by far the best cryptocurrency purchase one could have made was bitcoin.\nAlso Read: Markets Update: Cryptocurrencies Lose Steam During the Weekend BTC Top Performing Market Since May 12th, 2013\nAccording to the snapshot , bitcoin had a market capitalization of just 1.293 billion on the 12th of May, 2012. Back then, the circulating supply was just over half of it maximum total, with approximately 11.14 million coins in circulation.\nThe price was just $116.07 USD, however, had just gained by approximately 40% in ten days – with the bounce comprising a recovering rally following the fallout from the early-2013 bubble that saw many Cypriots charge into the bitcoin markets seeking refuge from the harsh structural adjustment policies imposed by the European Union and International Monetary Fund.\nOf all fourteen cryptocurrency markets listed on Coinmarketcap on May 12, 2013, bitcoin has since far outperformed its rivals, gaining by approximately 7175% in the last five years. LTC Only Altcoin Still Ranked in Top Ten by Market Capitalization\nOf the markets listed on the 2013 snapshot, Litecoin is by far the altcoin with the largest market capitalization today (approximately $7.94 billion as of this writing). At the time of the snapshot, the then second largest cryptocurrency had a total market capitalization of just $59.1 million, and a circulating supply of roughly 17.5 million.\nAt the current prices of roughly $140.55, LTC has made gains of 4,083% during five years. Whilst Litecoin’s market dominance has since eroded, LTC is still the sixth largest cryptocurrency by market cap – making it the best performing altcoin from May 12, 2013. Only 50% of Crypto Markets Are More Valuable Today Than They Were 5 Years Ago\nThe third highest performing crypto market since the snapshot is the then twelfth largest by market cap, Ixcoin . At the time of the snapshot, Ixcoin was priced at approximately $0.015. With IXC current trading for $0.193096, Ixcoin’s value has inflated by 1177% in the last 5 years. IXC’s capitalization has grown from $191,294 to approximately $4 million, ranking it 677th by market cap.\nAt the time of the snapshot, Peercoin was the third largest market by capitalization (approximately $4.72 million), with PPC trading for roughly $0.25. Currently priced at $2.56, PPC has since gained 924%. Peercoin has been among the most enduring of May 2013’s crypto markets, currently comprising the 198th largest market with a capitalization of $63.3 million.\nThe then fourth largest cryptocurrency, Namecoin , has offered investors a modest return of approximately 130% since the snapshot, gaining in price from $0.853 to $1.96. NMC’s is now the 309th largest market, having grown from a capitalization of $4.70 million to $28.8 million today.\nFeathercoin , the then ninth largest cryptocurrency market, has gained from $0.1256 to $0.169727 – a meager 35.1% increase in five years. Feathercoin is now the 278th largest market, with FTC’s capitalization growing from to $821,341 to $34 million.\nThe then seventh largest market, Novacoin , has gained by only 15.5% in five years, increasing in value from $3.54 to $4.09. NVC is now the 550th largest market with a capitalization, growing from almost $1 million to roughly $8.5 million. 46% of Altcoins Have Lost More Than 80% of Their Value\nNearly half of the altcoins included in the snapshot – many of which promised that they would change the world whilst making investors rich – have since lost more than 80% of their value.\nThe then fifth largest cryptocurrency market, Terracoin , has dropped nearly 81% from $0.4 to 0.164. It is ranked 694th by market cap, after gaining from approximately $1 million to $3.74 million.\nAt the time of the snapshot, Freicoin was the eighth largest crypto market with a capitalization of $882,374. Since then, FRC’s capitalization has actually shrunk to a meager $203,719 (approximately 24 BTC) – ranking it 1,152nd by market cap. The price has also decreased by 84.5%, falling from $0.0424 to $0.00658.\nThe market cap of the then eleventh ranked market, Mincoin , has also shrunk – dropping from $230,012 to $169,379 (approximately 20 BTC). Now ranked 1,170th, MNC has also shed nearly 83% of its value, with prices falling from $0.220779 to $0.037906. 23% of Altcoins Trading on the 12th of May, 2013 Now Appear Dead\nNearly a quarter of the altcoins included in the snapshot now appear dormant.\nData for the then sixth largest crypto market, Devcoin , stops on November 24th, 2017 – with the last recorded price of $0.000023 comprising an approximately 90% drop from $0.000223.\nThe most recent price for then tenth ranked market, CHNCoin , was recorded on boxing day last year – CHNCoin having then dropped by nearly 99% in five years, falling from $0.1 to just $0.001222.\nAnd lastly, but certainly not least, data for then thirteenth ranked market, BBQCoin , also ended on the 24th of November – with BBQ’s final price of $0.000458 comprising a 95% loss in value from $0.0091.\nWhat was your opinion of cryptocurrency in 2013?

I am sure many users would appreciate this. as your answer stands now I can't see how and why POW is used in bitcoin still – user56231 Jul 27 '17 at 6:13 @user200300 I'm not quite sure what you're unclear about. Do you understand the problem I'm describing? Someone can form two valid transactions and we need some way for everyone to eventually agree on which one to accept. (Maybe it would help to ask your own question about what specifically you don't understand?) – David Schwartz Jul 27 '17 at 7:29 Hi David. How does the miner decide which transaction to commit POW to? And how does this selection help maintain the integrity of the blockchain? Also, isn't POW performed on a block, not on a transaction per se? – nanonerd Dec 11 '17 at 3:17 PoW is performed on a block, but that block cannot form a chain that includes both transactions or that chain is invalid and will be ignored. A miner wants to get paid, so he mines on top of the longest chain he can find. – David Schwartz Dec 11 '17 at 4:56 up vote 3 down vote\nProof of Work (PoW) basically makes sure that miners don’t cheat.\nThere is no way to trust that everyone in the network is honest, so there has to be some way to prevent miners from creating new blocks that benefit themselves. The way it works is that you have a bunch of people all trying to guess the answer to the math problem and no one knows who is going to get the correct answer first. Whoever does get the right answer first gets a reward, but only if all the other miners agree to accept that transactional record (If it becomes apparent that a certain miner is creating fraudulent transactions then the other miners can collectively refuse to accept their contributions). This is why the process of creating a new block is designed to be energy intensive, so that there is a cost associated with creating each new block. This prevents miners from simply creating a whole bunch of new fraudulent blocks with the hopes that maybe they’ll get accepted, because the cost of doing so offsets the potential reward. It helps to think about proof of work as a possible solution to email spam. If there was a requirement for each computer to spend a minute on a PoW problem before every piece of mail was sent, then only people with genuine messages would agree to expend the effort. One minute of computer time is a very low cost for an individual, but the guy who is blasting 10 million spam emails couldn’t afford to wait 10 million minutes to do so. So going back to bitcoin, the chance of each individual miner being the one to solve each block is pretty small, and since it takes a lot of effort to solve the blocks they can’t just spam the network with solutions. This means that they are incentivized to only expend the effort if their contribution is going be accepted by the network.\nHope that makes sense.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

"Bitstamp Reminds Users of the $25 billion Lost Bitcoin to Encourage Strong Security Measures Date: in: Bitcoin 7 Views\nBlockchain intelligence platform Chainanalysis revealed in November that 20% of Bitcoin currently in circulation has been lost at a value of about $25 billion. On May 11, Bitstamp used this data to advocate for offline storage and argue that this puts an upward pressure on the price. Bitstamp: “That Makes Bitcoin Even Scarcer”\nThe data shows that around 20% of the circulating supply is inaccessible or has been destroyed. The price of a cryptocurrency depends on the ratio between buyers and sellers. If there is much more supply than demand, the price lowers and vice versa. As such a large percentage of the circulating supply is unable to be sold, there is less supply-side pressure. In theory, this adds momentum to the price rising. Sponsored Links\nBitstamp said: “All of these losses could easily be avoided if people behaved with the same vigilance when storing Bitcoin as we do with traditional assets, like gold. In fact, just like with gold and paper money, the safest place to store crypto might be in a good-old safety deposit box.”\nBitcoins are lost when they are sent to incompatible addresses, including addresses for other cryptocurrencies. Alternatively, access to Bitcoins can be lost when a user no longer knows their private key. The Bitcoins are still in the network but will never be moved. James Howell hit the news when he asked his local council to dig up a landfill site to find his lost hard drive containing 7,500 BTC. This would have a current value of around $64 million. LOST COINS: Research suggests that anywhere between 2.8 and 3.8 million #Bitcoin might be lost forever. That makes Bitcoin even scarcer, but also shines a light on the significance of safe #storage with HW #wallets like @TREZOR and @LedgerHQ . https://t.co/qIU4t8zxDD\n— Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) May 11, 2018\nHowever, while Bitstamp may be concerned with the safety of private keys, concerns have been raised over the storage of passport details by exchanges and companies running ICOs. Simon Lange, founder of Liberal Coins, said: “You can see with one of our competitors that they do Know-Your-Customer (KYC) checks in-house. I am very concerned with the passport data out there. Usually with exchanges, they secure cryptocurrencies in cold storage but with user data, we do not know how they store it.” In January, eight South Korean exchanges were fined for various privacy violations involving user data.\nThere are a lot of blockchain use cases, such as Datum, that are trying to solve the problem of user data and allow users the ability to sell their data and control who has access. With regard to exchanges, Yoti is trying to solve the problem by providing users with an encrypted ID. Mark Hindle, Brand and Communications Manager, said: “We believe the current process is outdated. If you are showing your passport, you are showing your details. It does definitely open you up to the potential of identity fraud.” They are currently working on integrating with a number of exchanges but have only recently moved into the cryptocurrency sphere.\nChainanalysis, who provided the data, is a company that focuses on compliance and investigations regarding blockchain technology. They work with businesses and governments to turn the obscure data of cryptocurrency transactions into usable data. This means they can help track criminal activity and suspicious behaviour. They have shown that although Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, in some cases users can be identified.

resistance against the US Dollar. There is a significant bearish trend line forming with resistance at $8,900 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may rise in the short term, but it is likely to face resistances near $8,900 and $9,000.\nBitcoin price is facing tough barriers around $8,900-$9,000 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD must stay above $8,200 and $8,000 to avoid any further losses in the near term. Bitcoin Price Support\nThis past week, there was a sharp bearish reaction from the $9,500 pivot level in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The price declined sharply and moved below the $9,000 and $8,500 support levels. The decline was such that the price traded towards the $8,200 level. It also broke a connecting bullish trend line at $9,000. A low was formed at $8,226 before buyers appeared. Later, the price started consolidating losses above $8,200 and is currently stable.\nIt tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $9,479 high to $8,226 low. It seems like the price is finding it hard to move above the $8,500 level, which is also a pivot level. Above the $8,500 level, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $9,479 high to $8,226 low is at $8,850. There is also a significant bearish trend line forming with resistance at $8,900 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. Therefore, the price is likely to face sellers near the $8,500 and $8,900 levels. Once there is a proper close above $8,900 and $9,000, there could be more gains towards $9,500.\nLooking at the chart , the current price action is slightly bearish below $8,900. On the downside, the $8,200 level is a decent support, followed by $8,000. If bitcoin fails to hold $8,000, it could decline below $7,500.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n4-hours MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is about to move into the bullish zone.\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently well below the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $8,200", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XBTUSD/", "https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/05/10/bitcoin-price-watch-btc-usd-broke-key-barrier/", "https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/05/11/bitcoin-price-watch-btc-usd-turned-bearish/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T16:10:25.151+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "caeb42e25f1b6e7c71eb57fcf1b11a8c390b322a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZOF3r4AI7NOipGtxnEupIw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin will not be there after 10 years ??", "title_full": "Bitcoin will not be there after 10 years ??", "published": "2018-05-13T15:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "caeb42e25f1b6e7c71eb57fcf1b11a8c390b322a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZOF3r4AI7NOipGtxnEupIw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cryptoreflector_666", "published": "2018-05-13T15:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin will not be there after 10 years ??", "text": "Quote: from: bitcad4u on May 07, 2018, 07:47:19 PM Quote: from: First77 on May 07, 2018, 07:36:24 PM I'm sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume. -- Satoshi\nDid Satoshi Nakamoto say Bitcoin will last for 20 years only ??\nI don't know what will happen after 20 years.I will have some huge bitcoin,if the bitcoin is survive till the end of 20 years .And Sathoshi doesn't mention the survive lifetime about bitcoin.As compared to last year May month price,this May month price is high.S o I don't think bitcoin will die in 20 years.\nIt is not necessary to die - it is rather transformed logically into something more progressive and promising.

You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.

If, instead, you want to know whether or not a particular spend would be accepted to your node's memory pool, Bitcoin Core's development branch ( master ) features a new testmempoolaccept RPC; here's it's current help: testmempoolaccept [\"rawtxs\"] ( allowhighfees ) Returns if raw transaction (serialized, hex-encoded) would be accepted by mempool. This checks if the transaction violates the consensus or policy rules. See sendrawtransaction call. Arguments: 1. [\"rawtxs\"] (array, required) An array of hex strings of raw transactions. Length must be one for now. 2. allowhighfees (boolean, optional, default=false) Allow high fees Result: [ (array) The result of the mempool acceptance test for each raw transaction in the input array. Length is exactly one for now. { \"txid\" (string) The transaction hash in hex \"allowed\" (boolean) If the mempool allows this tx to be inserted \"reject-reason\" (string) Rejection string (only present when 'allowed' is false) } ] Examples: Create a transaction > bitcoin-cli createrawtransaction \"[{\\\"txid\\\" : \\\"mytxid\\\",\\\"vout\\\":0}]\" \"{\\\"myaddress\\\":0.01}\" Sign the transaction, and get back the hex > bitcoin-cli signrawtransaction \"myhex\" Test acceptance of the transaction (signed hex) > bitcoin-cli testmempoolaccept \"signedhex\"\nYou could also test out the complete script using regtest.

Most cryptocurrencies dropped in price over the period, following developments with depressing effect on traders. In Japan, Mt. Gox’s bitcoins stored in court ordered wallets have moved again, while in South Korea, the largest exchange Upbit has found itself under investigation for suspected fraud.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Saturday: “Social” Coins, Crypto Vending, Blockchain Mileage Markets React to Disturbing News from Japan and Korea\nThe prices of leading cryptocurrencies dropped this week, with some recovery across the board on Sunday. The negative trend was probably determined by some notable developments in Asia, powerful enough to influence the mood of traders. Just as Bitcoin (BTC) looked poised to storm the $10,000 psychological threshold, the ghost of notoriously hacked cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox reminded bitcoiners it isn’t done with them yet. Tokyo-based court appointed trustee of the remaining bitcoin to be distributed among creditors, Nobuaki Kobayashi, seems ready to flood the market , again. According to Blockchain.info, over 8,000 coins from two court ordered cold storage wallets have been recently shifted. As soon as the news broke, BTC prices plummeted.\nSouth Korean media reported that the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, is under investigation on suspicions of fraud. The exchange confirmed the news in a statement and tried to reassure its customers that their assets are kept securely, while “all transactions and withdrawals are operating normally.” Reports suggested that Upbit is suspected of transferring customer funds from their cryptocurrency exchange account to a representative or executive account. Acting on that information, Korean prosecutors have conducted search and seizure against the company, securing computer hard disks and accounting records. Upbit is currently the world’s fourth-largest crypto trading platform. China to Publish Monthly Crypto Report\nThe Chinese government has decided to keep a close eye on decentralized currencies, despite all crypto bans it has imposed so far. Beijing authorities are set to publish a regular monthly analysis of over two dozen crypto assets in the form of the new Global Public Chain Assessment Index. “This independent analysis of cryptocurrencies and global public blockchain technology demonstrates the confidence of the Chinese Government in the technology, and will act as a guide,” according to a government press release. Almost 30 cryptos will be analyzed. The coins included in the index are expected to conform to certain standards like having an independent main chain and an open block browser.\nChina is also working to develop a national standard for blockchain technologies and applications. The new system should be completed and introduced by the end of 2019, according to reports by state-controlled media in the People’s Republic. Initially the blockchain standard will include basic standards, business and application standards, process and method standards, credible and interoperable standards, and information security standards, but the scope of its applicability will be expanded in the future. Localbitcoins Changes ToS to Comply With EU Law\nThe popular peer-to-peer exchange Localbitcoins has updated its Terms of Service (ToS) , noting that the changes have been introduced mainly due to regulations in the European Union. The new ToS of the Helsinki-based trading platform highlight certain identification requirements. In some situations users will be required to submit a copy of ID, although identity verification is not yet implemented as a mandatory procedure for all traders. The company has detailed some of the situations in which identification will be necessary. These include trading over certain volume limits, cases of account hacking/recovery, and fraud investigations. The new terms will be enforced on May 25. Facebook Mulls Own Token, Reports Say\nThis week we also covered some interesting developments in our daily rubric “Bitcoin in Brief” . After introducing a ban on crypto-related ads earlier this year, social media giant Facebook is now considering creating its own cryptocurrency to facilitate on-platform payments, reports suggested. Sources familiar with the matter told the financial news outlet Cheddar that the network is serious about the project to introduce global crypto payments. A digital token would allow its two billion users around the world to take advantage of crypto transactions and skip state-issued fiat currencies. The company announced recently it had formed a team tasked to explore the uses for blockchain technologies that can be utilized to improve its business. The group is headed by David Marcus, former head of Facebook Messenger and ex-president of Paypal, who currently sits on the board of Coinbase. BCH-Powered Social Media Apps Launch New Features\nTwo popular Bitcoin Cash social media applications, Memo and Blockpress, have introduced new features on their platforms this week. Users can now upload pictures, video, and even torrent magnets found on the Pirate Bay. Memo has recently added a bunch of features like replies, emojis, and a counter for typing. Its programmers also added a ‘Topics’ section where people can discuss any topic trending on the application. On Thursday, the Memo development team added image and Youtube video support. Users can now upload a picture or their favorite Youtube video utilizing an on-chain BCH transaction.\nLast week, another BCH-powered social media application was launched – Blockpress . Just like Memo, the platform enables the ability to publish 77 characters via the Bitcoin Cash network. Its developer “Attila” said that after the May 15 BCH upgrade the Blockpress platform will provide the ability to upload much longer content. Currently, its users can add images to posts, a notification feed, community topics, and a sidebar of followed profiles on Blockpress. Bitcoin and the Carnal Temptations\nA bitcoin supporter hopes to replace New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who resigned amid a sex scandal. Four women have recently complained about non-consensual physical violence by Schneiderman. Stock market lawyer and former stand-up comedian Manny Alicandro has announced his candidacy on the Republican ticket. He is described as bitcoin enthusiast and a crypto investor, who advises several blockchain startups. Alicandro’s campaign will highlight the current harsh regulation of bitcoin in the Empire State and may accept donations in bitcoin . He has been quoted as saying that he would like to see lighter rules for cryptocurrency businesses. Alicandro believes that New York’s Bitlicense regime is hurting jobs and stifling innovation.\nNY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman resigned just hours after the news about the violent sex scandal broke. His administration was behind an investigation into the operations of bitcoin exchanges which was rebuked by representatives of the crypto industry like Kraken CEO Jessie Powell who sharply criticized the regulatory overreach of his office.\nThis week bitcoin and carnal pleasures were mentioned together more than once. Exotic dancer Brenna Sparks, featured in the article about a Las Vegas club where strippers accept bitcoin via QR tattoos, has published a blog post on an adult entertainment industry portal explaining the advantages of cryptocurrency to her colleagues. Noting that digital money can help with upholding privacy and fighting piracy, Brenna also points out the main advantage of cryptos like bitcoin – helping people in the business avoid paying almost 50% to middlemen.\nWhat are your thoughts on this week’s bitcoin topics? section below.\nImages courtesy of Shutterstock.\nBitcoin News is growing fast.

Most cryptocurrencies dropped in price over the period, following developments with depressing effect on traders. In Japan, Mt. Gox’s bitcoins stored in court ordered wallets have moved again, while in South Korea, the largest exchange Upbit has found itself under investigation for suspected fraud.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Saturday: “Social” Coins, Crypto Vending, Blockchain Mileage Markets React to Disturbing News from Japan and Korea\nThe prices of leading cryptocurrencies dropped this week, with some recovery across the board on Sunday. The negative trend was probably determined by some notable developments in Asia, powerful enough to influence the mood of traders. Just as Bitcoin (BTC) looked poised to storm the $10,000 psychological threshold, the ghost of notoriously hacked cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox reminded bitcoiners it isn’t done with them yet. Tokyo-based court appointed trustee of the remaining bitcoin to be distributed among creditors, Nobuaki Kobayashi, seems ready to flood the market , again. According to Blockchain.info, over 8,000 coins from two court ordered cold storage wallets have been recently shifted. As soon as the news broke, BTC prices plummeted.\nSouth Korean media reported that the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, is under investigation on suspicions of fraud. The exchange confirmed the news in a statement and tried to reassure its customers that their assets are kept securely, while “all transactions and withdrawals are operating normally.” Reports suggested that Upbit is suspected of transferring customer funds from their cryptocurrency exchange account to a representative or executive account. Acting on that information, Korean prosecutors have conducted search and seizure against the company, securing computer hard disks and accounting records. Upbit is currently the world’s fourth-largest crypto trading platform. China to Publish Monthly Crypto Report\nThe Chinese government has decided to keep a close eye on decentralized currencies, despite all crypto bans it has imposed so far. Beijing authorities are set to publish a regular monthly analysis of over two dozen crypto assets in the form of the new Global Public Chain Assessment Index. “This independent analysis of cryptocurrencies and global public blockchain technology demonstrates the confidence of the Chinese Government in the technology, and will act as a guide,” according to a government press release. Almost 30 cryptos will be analyzed. The coins included in the index are expected to conform to certain standards like having an independent main chain and an open block browser.\nChina is also working to develop a national standard for blockchain technologies and applications. The new system should be completed and introduced by the end of 2019, according to reports by state-controlled media in the People’s Republic. Initially the blockchain standard will include basic standards, business and application standards, process and method standards, credible and interoperable standards, and information security standards, but the scope of its applicability will be expanded in the future. Localbitcoins Changes ToS to Comply With EU Law\nThe popular peer-to-peer exchange Localbitcoins has updated its Terms of Service (ToS) , noting that the changes have been introduced mainly due to regulations in the European Union. The new ToS of the Helsinki-based trading platform highlight certain identification requirements. In some situations users will be required to submit a copy of ID, although identity verification is not yet implemented as a mandatory procedure for all traders. The company has detailed some of the situations in which identification will be necessary. These include trading over certain volume limits, cases of account hacking/recovery, and fraud investigations. The new terms will be enforced on May 25. Facebook Mulls Own Token, Reports Say\nThis week we also covered some interesting developments in our daily rubric “Bitcoin in Brief” . After introducing a ban on crypto-related ads earlier this year, social media giant Facebook is now considering creating its own cryptocurrency to facilitate on-platform payments, reports suggested. Sources familiar with the matter told the financial news outlet Cheddar that the network is serious about the project to introduce global crypto payments. A digital token would allow its two billion users around the world to take advantage of crypto transactions and skip state-issued fiat currencies. The company announced recently it had formed a team tasked to explore the uses for blockchain technologies that can be utilized to improve its business. The group is headed by David Marcus, former head of Facebook Messenger and ex-president of Paypal, who currently sits on the board of Coinbase. BCH-Powered Social Media Apps Launch New Features\nTwo popular Bitcoin Cash social media applications, Memo and Blockpress, have introduced new features on their platforms this week. Users can now upload pictures, video, and even torrent magnets found on the Pirate Bay. Memo has recently added a bunch of features like replies, emojis, and a counter for typing. Its programmers also added a ‘Topics’ section where people can discuss any topic trending on the application. On Thursday, the Memo development team added image and Youtube video support. Users can now upload a picture or their favorite Youtube video utilizing an on-chain BCH transaction.\nLast week, another BCH-powered social media application was launched – Blockpress . Just like Memo, the platform enables the ability to publish 77 characters via the Bitcoin Cash network. Its developer “Attila” said that after the May 15 BCH upgrade the Blockpress platform will provide the ability to upload much longer content. Currently, its users can add images to posts, a notification feed, community topics, and a sidebar of followed profiles on Blockpress. Bitcoin and the Carnal Temptations\nA bitcoin supporter hopes to replace New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who resigned amid a sex scandal. Four women have recently complained about non-consensual physical violence by Schneiderman. Stock market lawyer and former stand-up comedian Manny Alicandro has announced his candidacy on the Republican ticket. He is described as bitcoin enthusiast and a crypto investor, who advises several blockchain startups.

Most cryptocurrencies dropped in price over the period, following developments with depressing effect on traders. In Japan, Mt. Gox’s bitcoins stored in court ordered wallets have moved again, while in South Korea, the largest exchange Upbit has found itself under investigation for suspected fraud.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Saturday: “Social” Coins, Crypto Vending, Blockchain Mileage Markets React to Disturbing News from Japan and Korea\nThe prices of leading cryptocurrencies dropped this week, with some recovery across the board on Sunday. The negative trend was probably determined by some notable developments in Asia, powerful enough to influence the mood of traders. Just as Bitcoin (BTC) looked poised to storm the $10,000 psychological threshold, the ghost of notoriously hacked cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox reminded bitcoiners it isn’t done with them yet. Tokyo-based court appointed trustee of the remaining bitcoin to be distributed among creditors, Nobuaki Kobayashi, seems ready to flood the market , again. According to Blockchain.info, over 8,000 coins from two court ordered cold storage wallets have been recently shifted. As soon as the news broke, BTC prices plummeted.\nSouth Korean media reported that the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, is under investigation on suspicions of fraud. The exchange confirmed the news in a statement and tried to reassure its customers that their assets are kept securely, while “all transactions and withdrawals are operating normally.” Reports suggested that Upbit is suspected of transferring customer funds from their cryptocurrency exchange account to a representative or executive account. Acting on that information, Korean prosecutors have conducted search and seizure against the company, securing computer hard disks and accounting records. Upbit is currently the world’s fourth-largest crypto trading platform. China to Publish Monthly Crypto Report\nThe Chinese government has decided to keep a close eye on decentralized currencies, despite all crypto bans it has imposed so far. Beijing authorities are set to publish a regular monthly analysis of over two dozen crypto assets in the form of the new Global Public Chain Assessment Index. “This independent analysis of cryptocurrencies and global public blockchain technology demonstrates the confidence of the Chinese Government in the technology, and will act as a guide,” according to a government press release. Almost 30 cryptos will be analyzed. The coins included in the index are expected to conform to certain standards like having an independent main chain and an open block browser.\nChina is also working to develop a national standard for blockchain technologies and applications. The new system should be completed and introduced by the end of 2019, according to reports by state-controlled media in the People’s Republic. Initially the blockchain standard will include basic standards, business and application standards, process and method standards, credible and interoperable standards, and information security standards, but the scope of its applicability will be expanded in the future. Localbitcoins Changes ToS to Comply With EU Law\nThe popular peer-to-peer exchange Localbitcoins has updated its Terms of Service (ToS) , noting that the changes have been introduced mainly due to regulations in the European Union. The new ToS of the Helsinki-based trading platform highlight certain identification requirements. In some situations users will be required to submit a copy of ID, although identity verification is not yet implemented as a mandatory procedure for all traders. The company has detailed some of the situations in which identification will be necessary. These include trading over certain volume limits, cases of account hacking/recovery, and fraud investigations. The new terms will be enforced on May 25. Facebook Mulls Own Token, Reports Say\nThis week we also covered some interesting developments in our daily rubric “Bitcoin in Brief” . After introducing a ban on crypto-related ads earlier this year, social media giant Facebook is now considering creating its own cryptocurrency to facilitate on-platform payments, reports suggested. Sources familiar with the matter told the financial news outlet Cheddar that the network is serious about the project to introduce global crypto payments. A digital token would allow its two billion users around the world to take advantage of crypto transactions and skip state-issued fiat currencies. The company announced recently it had formed a team tasked to explore the uses for blockchain technologies that can be utilized to improve its business. The group is headed by David Marcus, former head of Facebook Messenger and ex-president of Paypal, who currently sits on the board of Coinbase. BCH-Powered Social Media Apps Launch New Features\nTwo popular Bitcoin Cash social media applications, Memo and Blockpress, have introduced new features on their platforms this week. Users can now upload pictures, video, and even torrent magnets found on the Pirate Bay. Memo has recently added a bunch of features like replies, emojis, and a counter for typing. Its programmers also added a ‘Topics’ section where people can discuss any topic trending on the application. On Thursday, the Memo development team added image and Youtube video support. Users can now upload a picture or their favorite Youtube video utilizing an on-chain BCH transaction.\nLast week, another BCH-powered social media application was launched – Blockpress . Just like Memo, the platform enables the ability to publish 77 characters via the Bitcoin Cash network. Its developer “Attila” said that after the May 15 BCH upgrade the Blockpress platform will provide the ability to upload much longer content. Currently, its users can add images to posts, a notification feed, community topics, and a sidebar of followed profiles on Blockpress. Bitcoin and the Carnal Temptations\nA bitcoin supporter hopes to replace New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who resigned amid a sex scandal. Four women have recently complained about non-consensual physical violence by Schneiderman. Stock market lawyer and former stand-up comedian Manny Alicandro has announced his candidacy on the Republican ticket. He is described as bitcoin enthusiast and a crypto investor, who advises several blockchain startups. Alicandro’s campaign will highlight the current harsh regulation of bitcoin in the Empire State and may accept donations in bitcoin . He has been quoted as saying that he would like to see lighter rules for cryptocurrency businesses. Alicandro believes that New York’s Bitlicense regime is hurting jobs and stifling innovation.\nNY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman resigned just hours after the news about the violent sex scandal broke. His administration was behind an investigation into the operations of bitcoin exchanges which was rebuked by representatives of the crypto industry like Kraken CEO Jessie Powell who sharply criticized the regulatory overreach of his office.\nThis week bitcoin and carnal pleasures were mentioned together more than once. Exotic dancer Brenna Sparks, featured in the article about a Las Vegas club where strippers accept bitcoin via QR tattoos, has published a blog post on an adult entertainment industry portal explaining the advantages of cryptocurrency to her colleagues. Noting that digital money can help with upholding privacy and fighting piracy, Brenna also points out the main advantage of cryptos like bitcoin – helping people in the business avoid paying almost 50% to middlemen.\nWhat are your thoughts on this week’s bitcoin topics?

Most cryptocurrencies dropped in price over the period, following developments with depressing effect on traders. In Japan, Mt. Gox’s bitcoins stored in court ordered wallets have moved again, while in South Korea, the largest exchange Upbit has found itself under investigation for suspected fraud.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Saturday: “Social” Coins, Crypto Vending, Blockchain Mileage Markets React to Disturbing News from Japan and Korea\nThe prices of leading cryptocurrencies dropped this week, with some recovery across the board on Sunday. The negative trend was probably determined by some notable developments in Asia, powerful enough to influence the mood of traders. Just as Bitcoin (BTC) looked poised to storm the $10,000 psychological threshold, the ghost of notoriously hacked cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox reminded bitcoiners it isn’t done with them yet. Tokyo-based court appointed trustee of the remaining bitcoin to be distributed among creditors, Nobuaki Kobayashi, seems ready to flood the market , again. According to Blockchain.info, over 8,000 coins from two court ordered cold storage wallets have been recently shifted. As soon as the news broke, BTC prices plummeted.\nSouth Korean media reported that the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, is under investigation on suspicions of fraud. The exchange confirmed the news in a statement and tried to reassure its customers that their assets are kept securely, while “all transactions and withdrawals are operating normally.” Reports suggested that Upbit is suspected of transferring customer funds from their cryptocurrency exchange account to a representative or executive account. Acting on that information, Korean prosecutors have conducted search and seizure against the company, securing computer hard disks and accounting records. Upbit is currently the world’s fourth-largest crypto trading platform. China to Publish Monthly Crypto Report\nThe Chinese government has decided to keep a close eye on decentralized currencies, despite all crypto bans it has imposed so far. Beijing authorities are set to publish a regular monthly analysis of over two dozen crypto assets in the form of the new Global Public Chain Assessment Index. “This independent analysis of cryptocurrencies and global public blockchain technology demonstrates the confidence of the Chinese Government in the technology, and will act as a guide,” according to a government press release. Almost 30 cryptos will be analyzed. The coins included in the index are expected to conform to certain standards like having an independent main chain and an open block browser.\nChina is also working to develop a national standard for blockchain technologies and applications. The new system should be completed and introduced by the end of 2019, according to reports by state-controlled media in the People’s Republic. Initially the blockchain standard will include basic standards, business and application standards, process and method standards, credible and interoperable standards, and information security standards, but the scope of its applicability will be expanded in the future. Localbitcoins Changes ToS to Comply With EU Law\nThe popular peer-to-peer exchange Localbitcoins has updated its Terms of Service (ToS) , noting that the changes have been introduced mainly due to regulations in the European Union. The new ToS of the Helsinki-based trading platform highlight certain identification requirements. In some situations users will be required to submit a copy of ID, although identity verification is not yet implemented as a mandatory procedure for all traders. The company has detailed some of the situations in which identification will be necessary. These include trading over certain volume limits, cases of account hacking/recovery, and fraud investigations. The new terms will be enforced on May 25. Facebook Mulls Own Token, Reports Say\nThis week we also covered some interesting developments in our daily rubric “Bitcoin in Brief” . After introducing a ban on crypto-related ads earlier this year, social media giant Facebook is now considering creating its own cryptocurrency to facilitate on-platform payments, reports suggested. Sources familiar with the matter told the financial news outlet Cheddar that the network is serious about the project to introduce global crypto payments. A digital token would allow its two billion users around the world to take advantage of crypto transactions and skip state-issued fiat currencies. The company announced recently it had formed a team tasked to explore the uses for blockchain technologies that can be utilized to improve its business. The group is headed by David Marcus, former head of Facebook Messenger and ex-president of Paypal, who currently sits on the board of Coinbase. BCH-Powered Social Media Apps Launch New Features\nTwo popular Bitcoin Cash social media applications, Memo and Blockpress, have introduced new features on their platforms this week. Users can now upload pictures, video, and even torrent magnets found on the Pirate Bay. Memo has recently added a bunch of features like replies, emojis, and a counter for typing. Its programmers also added a ‘Topics’ section where people can discuss any topic trending on the application. On Thursday, the Memo development team added image and Youtube video support. Users can now upload a picture or their favorite Youtube video utilizing an on-chain BCH transaction.\nLast week, another BCH-powered social media application was launched – Blockpress . Just like Memo, the platform enables the ability to publish 77 characters via the Bitcoin Cash network. Its developer “Attila” said that after the May 15 BCH upgrade the Blockpress platform will provide the ability to upload much longer content. Currently, its users can add images to posts, a notification feed, community topics, and a sidebar of followed profiles on Blockpress. Bitcoin and the Carnal Temptations\nA bitcoin supporter hopes to replace New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who resigned amid a sex scandal. Four women have recently complained about non-consensual physical violence by Schneiderman. Stock market lawyer and former stand-up comedian Manny Alicandro has announced his candidacy on the Republican ticket. He is described as bitcoin enthusiast and a crypto investor, who advises several blockchain startups. Alicandro’s campaign will highlight the current harsh regulation of bitcoin in the Empire State and may accept donations in bitcoin . He has been quoted as saying that he would like to see lighter rules for cryptocurrency businesses. Alicandro believes that New York’s Bitlicense regime is hurting jobs and stifling innovation.\nNY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman resigned just hours after the news about the violent sex scandal broke. His administration was behind an investigation into the operations of bitcoin exchanges which was rebuked by representatives of the crypto industry like Kraken CEO Jessie Powell who sharply criticized the regulatory overreach of his office.\nThis week bitcoin and carnal pleasures were mentioned together more than once. Exotic dancer Brenna Sparks, featured in the article about a Las Vegas club where strippers accept bitcoin via QR tattoos, has published a blog post on an adult entertainment industry portal explaining the advantages of cryptocurrency to her colleagues. Noting that digital money can help with upholding privacy and fighting piracy, Brenna also points out the main advantage of cryptos like bitcoin – helping people in the business avoid paying almost 50% to middlemen.\nWhat are your thoughts on this week’s bitcoin topics?

This is the third time the court has granted remand for Paladiya.\nAs per the CID officials, Paladiya has revealed that as per decided percentage, Ketan Patel (lawyer) received Rs 70 lakh of the extorted bitcoin money. Patel's part of the money was given to Paladiya as promised by him.\nLater, Patel expressed interest (to Paladiya) in wanting to invest in bitcoins. Patel asked Paladiya if he knew any traders as he wished to invest Rs 10 lakh of the extorted money.\nPaladiya then took Rs 10 lakh from Patel and gave the money to a Surat-based bitcoin trader named Rakesh Viradiya. On Friday, CID (crime) officials recovered Rs 10 lakh from Viradiya, which belonged Patel. As per the officials: \"Viradiya played no part in the crime, he was just an investor and after the money was recovered, he was released.\"\nThe officials also said that Patel claimed that his part of the money was with his brother Jatin Patel, who is absconding. During Ketan Patel's interrogation, he claimed that his brother was out of country for medical treatment.\nMeanwhile, former MLA Nalin Kotadiya had faxed a letter to CID (crime) on May 9, stating that he has been out of town for some personal work, and hence skipped two summons. He had promised to reach the CID office by May 11 or 12. However, he failed to turn up.\nThe Police is searching for Kotadiya in Amreli.

But when I reply that while bitcoin might be newsworthy, the really important story concerns the blockchain technology that underpins it, their eyes glaze over and they start looking for the nearest exit as they conclude that they are in the grip of Coleridge’s Ancient Mariner .\nAnd, in a sense, they are. Blockchain technology is indeed important, but it seems largely incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, even though the web teems with attempts to explain it . This is partly because cryptography lies at its core, and since crypto involves complex mathematics it therefore lies beyond the ken of most people. But if one is prepared to take the maths as given, then really the basic idea is simple. As Don and Alex Tapscott put it in their book, Blockchain Revolution , a blockchain “is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value”.\nUntil recently, the banking establishment was unremittingly hostile to cryptocurrencies. Jamie Dimon, the boss of JPMorgan Chase, for example, famously described bitcoin as a “fraud” . But recently, the wind seems to have changed. Last December, two big exchanges – the CME Group and Cboe Global Markets – launched bitcoin futures trading operations. This week Goldman Sachs announced that it would follow suit and is looking into the direct trading of bitcoin. And now – according to Wednesday’s Financial Times – even the New York Stock Exchange is “setting up an online platform for buying and holding bitcoin”.\nSo what’s going on? To interpret it you need to understand that the cryptocurrency story has two interwoven strands: human greed on the one hand and utopian idealism on the other. It’s no accident that bitcoin emerged just after the 2008 banking crisis as people realised that we had been taken for an epic ride by the financial services industry. In a world where nobody – even the biggest banks – could be trusted, an unknown genius going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper arguing that cryptography could be harnessed to enable trustworthy transactions without having to rely on fallible or corrupt human institutions. A new digital currency – bitcoin – was the working example he proposed. And underpinning it was the cryptographic tool – the blockchain – which ensured that all transactions in the new currency could be validated without needing an institution to guarantee or underwrite them.\nBecause the total number of bitcoins that can exist is limited by the design of the system to 21m, the currency was rapidly perceived as an asset or a store of value – like gold. Accordingly greed kicked in, triggering waves of speculative mania that are still continuing. And it is this speculative wave that Goldman Sachs and co now – belatedly – wish to surf.\nNo surprise there, then. But implicit in the blockchain concept is an endearing strain of technocratic utopianism, a hope that technology can overcome some aspects of human frailty and corruption. The key to that lies in the latter half of the Tapscott definition Quote: d earlier – the idea that a blockchain can record “not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value” in a ledger that cannot be falsified.\nThis is a really big idea, because well-governed societies depend on keeping certain kinds of documentation – birth and death certificates, title deeds, wills and so on – in ledgers that are both public and secure. In industrialised societies we have achieved this by having trustworthy institutions (registrars, solicitors, local authorities, etc), which have legal responsibilities and democratic oversight. But other societies are not so fortunate. In developing or authoritarian countries, for example, registries of land titles are critically vulnerable to tampering by corrupt officials. Using a blockchain to hold such titles could provide a way of ensuring that credible records endure, which is why countries such as the Republic of Georgia are beginning to do it .\nNone of this is easy to do, and there are lots of practical difficulties ahead. But in the greed and cynicism surrounding bitcoin and its peers, we shouldn’t lose sight of the great potential of blockchain technology. Many years ago, an engineer called Paul Baran had a Big Idea – that we could make a great communications network by using digital data packets rather than analogue phone lines. He was laughed out of court by AT&T. But it turned out that Baran’s idea was what gave us the internet.\nWhat I’m reading Gone – and forgotten\nHonestly! Kids these days! Opinion pollster YouGov did a survey to find out how much today’s schoolchildren know about the communications technologies of the past. They were shown 12 pictures of relevant objects from the past – typewriter, Nokia mobile phone, overhead projector, floppy disk, cassette, pager etc. Two-thirds didn’t know what a floppy disk was (though some recognised it as the icon for “Save”), 27% didn’t recognise a typewriter and 40% didn’t know what an audio cassette was. (On the other hand, analogue nostalgists can take comfort that only a quarter of the kids couldn’t recognise a record player. So vinyl may not be a lost cause with future generations.
