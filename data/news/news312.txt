Specifically, Bitcoin Diamond (BCD), Huobi Token (HT), and Skycoin (SKY). Meanwhile, the more well-known altcoins, such as Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Litecoin (LTC) are all down.\nWe’re going to focus on the three alternative coins and token today — Bitcoin Diamond (BCD), Huobi Token (HT), and Skycoin (SKY). Bitcoin Diamond (BCD)\nBitcoin Diamond (BCD) is currently selling for $5.51. This puts BCD up 14.71% in the past twenty-four hours. Not bad, right? BCD has a market capitalization of $846.81 million. Source: CoinMarketCap\nSo far, Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) has had a successful month of May. The latest announcement from the Bitcoin Diamond team came on Monday. At the start of the week, Bitcoin Diamond announced that it will be listing on the SWFT blockchain platform. If you don’t know, SWFT is a cross-blockchain platform. Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) is now listed on SWFT Platform. You can start trading on https://t.co/ErgwJHHCQX or download the app and start making money\nHow?

Further, last week, Bitcoin Diamond provided development and operation progress for the month of April. It cited support from exchanges, like OKcoinkr.com and KEX.kr, and support from the media. For instance, both Reuters and Nasdaq have reported on the alternative coin. Additionally, on May 1, it was announced that Coinw listed Bitcoin Diamond (BCD). $BCD just listed on Coinw exchange! Coinw ( https://t.co/h7XvkHgSXV ) is a Chinese state-owned enterprise in Hong Kong with an open global digital asset trading platform, mainly for users worldwide under CITICCASH Hong Kong Investment Limited. https://t.co/3zCMTnLPd3 pic.twitter.com/UR2iQ5Lu07\n— Bitcoin Diamond[BCD]⚡️ (@BitcoinDiamond_) May 2, 2018 Huobi Token (HT)\nHuobi Token (HT) is currently selling for $3.67. This puts Huobi Token (HT) up 14.04% in the past twenty-four hours. Huobi Token (HT) has a market cap of $183.60 million. HT is below Factom (FCT) and ahead of Achain (ACT). Source: CoinMarketCap\nDespite being a newbie to the crypto markets, Huobi Token (HT) has managed to develop the reputation of being a coin that offers solid volatility. Over the past two months, Huobi Token (HT) has made waves, even when the crypto market was faced with a crash. In April, Huobi Token (HT) collected roughly 83% of gains during the last 30 days.\nSo, what’s happened in May so far? Is there a reason Huobi Token (HT) is up nearly 15% in the past twenty-four hours? Huobi doesn’t appear to have announced anything today, but that doesn’t mean the markets aren’t optimistic about the value of this token. In fact, one report stated that because Huobi didn’t go through an initial coin offering, and its structure makes sure investors are keen to have the token no matter what, Huobi Token’s (HT) value has a chance of increasing.\nWhat do you think? Skycoin (SKY)\nSkycoin (SKY) is currently selling for $26.38. This puts Skycoin (SKY) up 10.83% in the past twenty-four hours. Source: CoinMarketCap\nSkycoin has been pretty quiet since early April. On April 12, it was announced that Skycoin (SKY) is now trading on CHAOEX. However, word surfaced this week that Skycoin (SKY) will be added to five “upcoming high volume exchanges” soon. Skycoin has not said anything about this, so keep your eyes peeled to see if this really is happening.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cryptorecorder.com/2018/05/09/huobi-token-ht-is-sky-rocketing-while-the-market-is-dropping/", "https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/huobi-token/#charts", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Airdrop?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/AQ3XhxG5Ql", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/SWFTC?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BCD?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/UR2iQ5Lu07", "https://t.co/ErgwJHHCQX", "https://twitter.com/SwftCoin/status/993904160528515072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/skycoin/#charts", "https://twitter.com/BitcoinDiamond_/status/991502893801861120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-diamond/#charts", "https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BCD&src=ctag&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/9qfvd7Zy8C", "https://t.co/3zCMTnLPd3", "https://stocksgazette.com/2018/05/10/2-fast-2-furious-coins-zilliqa-zil-huobi-token-ht-mithril-mith-aelf-elf/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter", "https://t.co/h7XvkHgSXV"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "caroline harris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huobi token", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skycoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "swft platform", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinmarketcap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ltc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin diamond", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "skycoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T22:29:28.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "482076be55f8ee0c2e79cde35e5caed7aced8c78", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWlAO5eXvV0jd2Unsnu9Oc5R2u9pMpDcojCwSliTnddQalH.YxldoOBu0bJ50SKKHLz6yp6bjrTKwlSyqlHpRG4P5KT9mNODJhZinqoQNO131QA3AZipdV0EUu9d_Ntm41kCfGO2eWKhw--", "site_full": "news.bitcoin-babe.com", "site": "bitcoin-babe.com", "site_section": "http://news.bitcoin-babe.com/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Distributed Event Series and the Let’s Talk Bitcoin Network Present:", "title_full": "Distributed Event Series and the Let’s Talk Bitcoin Network Present:", "published": "2018-05-10T21:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "482076be55f8ee0c2e79cde35e5caed7aced8c78", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWlAO5eXvV0jd2Unsnu9Oc5R2u9pMpDcojCwSliTnddQalH.YxldoOBu0bJ50SKKHLz6yp6bjrTKwlSyqlHpRG4P5KT9mNODJhZinqoQNO131QA3AZipdV0EUu9d_Ntm41kCfGO2eWKhw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoinbabeau", "published": "2018-05-10T21:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Distributed Event Series and the Let’s Talk Bitcoin Network Present:", "text": "10.05.2018\nIn partnership with the distributed event Series along with the Let’s Chat Bitcoin Network, Distributed Dialogues provides listeners a detailed look at the cryptocurrency and enterprise blockchain ecosystem by providing voice to the people, ideas and projects that make it possible.

We had the ability To see that there is a very special type of distributed cards, suitable for this kind of a use case, said O’Rourke. And that’s model of decentralized IDs and verifiable claims, since it allows this info be reliably communicated without really being tethered to a blockchain itself.O’Rourke believes creating a holistic, blockchain based identity solution is the pivotal starting point.

The NY Times first reported on the events of May 7, 2018, after four people divulged plans and associated mails to the paper. While lean in the exact details, the report reveals that the exchange, which will be built for big investors, in mind, would allow direct trade bitcoin, not futures like we have seen with the CBOE and CME. In accordance with the NYT’s resources, ICE has been in discussions with heritage banks and Financial Institutions to facilitate swap contracts for possible bitcoin trading.\nThese contracts would basically allow banks to purchase contracts for bitcoin, giving the exchange sure anchors of liquidity. Once an exchange consumer purchases one of those contracts, cash changes hands along with the corresponding bitcoin would seem in his/her pocket the following day. In practice, an exchange contract is much more complicated than this, however, the significant point to note is the fact that it’d give the exchange the regulatory backing of present legislation and make it fully compliant with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a status even today’s most popular cryptocurrency trades have to secure. Though the report makes it very clear that ICE is at least at the process of inventing a bitcoin trading plan, it didn’t indicate if the exchange is mulling over record additional popular cryptocurrencies like ether or litecoin.\nFurther, it cautions that all developments aren’t final and plans for the exchange could dissolve given crypto’s unregulated, unfettered landscape. However, if ICE does go through with its plans, it’d become the primary traditional financial market to trade bitcoin directly. This could put it in the business of Goldman Sachs, who announced earlier this week its plans to trade bitcoin futures contracts on behalf of its customers. Goldman Sachs suggested that while it isn’t comfortable with trading bitcoin directly straight from the gate, the bank has plans on standby if better regulations surface. The institution shares this opinion with Nasdaq, whose Chief executive officer, Adena Friedman, told CNBC that the exchange would start up bitcoin trading when individuals are ready for more controlled sector. ,Right now, the only traditional financial exchanges that offer bitcoin options of any type are the Chicago based CME and CBOEs, each of which began offering futures contracts in December of last year.A representative for the NY Stock Exchange fell to comment on the developments.\nSources:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "intercontinental exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ny stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ny times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T04:47:20.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "459a3c1973216457e6b210ef1795b734045a62c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS6L7nbyxruQyvx8GSCQ.XU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "title_full": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "published": "2018-05-10T21:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "459a3c1973216457e6b210ef1795b734045a62c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS6L7nbyxruQyvx8GSCQ.XU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "afbitcoins", "published": "2018-05-10T21:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "text": "Quote: from: TERA2 on Today at 01:47:19 PM Any wall street involvement with public cryptos is a ploy to get inside and take them down, like with the futures.\nI'll second that.

For example, KFC’s chicken shortages in the U.K.\nforced two-thirds of its 900 restaurants to close while the company worked to repair its delivery, via DHL. (And this was then followed by a gravy shortage.) Ultimately, it turned out that those U.K.\nevents were because of human error, not any lack of chicken. And that revelation only reinforced how critical excellent record-keeping and accountability are for maintaining supply chain integrity.\nBut help is on the way: Fortunately, the supply world will soon be revolutionized by the innovative solution of blockchain. The most promising approach to robust supply-chain data is likely blockchain technology, a relatively new approach to digital record-keeping most famously associated with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin but applicable to many domains.\nRelated: 15 Crazy and Surprising Ways People Are Using Blockchain Sharing is the secret to blockchain’s robustness against tampering: Because everyone has a record of the information, there is no way any one person can alter data in the chain.

Collier | May 10, 2018 | 11:30 a.m. Share on email Share on print\nUnless you’ve been living in a mushroom cave these past few years, you’ve witnessed the spectacular emergence of cryptocurrency. For those of you, like me, who have trouble grasping what this new medium of exchange really is ... well, it’s like money ... sort of.\nBut this strange virtual currency has stirred much controversy among experts about its economic viability.\nFor instance, Warren Buffett says :\n“You can’t value Bitcoin because it’s not a value-producing asset.”\nHe added that there’s no telling how far Bitcoin’s price will go, and described it as a “real bubble in that sort of thing.”\nIn other words, for Bitcoin and its many crypto-brethren, there is no underlying asset. Its value is based purely on speculation and the willingness of the more courageous investors to trade in the cryptocurrency market.\nBut beware: No one wants to fall victim to the “Greater Fool Theory” of Wall Street.\nSo, what’s this got to do with Christianity, you ask? The World of Crypto-Religions\nAccording to some estimates, there are roughly 4,200 religions in the world. Worldwide, more than 8-in-10 people identify with a religious group. 1\nSo, which ones are “true,” and which ones are not? Some say “they’re all true, they all lead to the same place.”\nBut such thinking flies in the face of the Law of Noncontradiction, which says, if all 4,200 religions are mutually exclusive (each one claims to be true and the others are false), then only two possibilities exist: Either (1) they are all false, or (2) one is true, and the rest are false.\nSo how would we sort out the true religion from the horde of other claimants?\nBut first, why do religions exist in the first place? What “problem” do they claim to “solve” for their adherents?\nIf all you want is something to do on Sunday mornings, or to find a belief system that makes you feel better about yourself, then “pick your poison” from among the 4,200 candidates.\nBut if you are concerned about a much bigger problem — one that affects your eternal destiny — then you need to be much more selective in your search.\nHere is why Christianity has been so successful for so long ... it offers a real solution for a real problem: The Problem\nThe Bible tells us that a huge spiritual “bill” has been “run up” by every person who has ever lived. Basically, we are born sinners.\nSome say that we only become sinners when we commit sin, but that’s backward. We sin because we’re sinners ... by nature ... made so when we inherited our spiritual DNA from our parents, which they got from their parents, all the way back to Adam and Eve .\nConsider: Have you ever had to teach your children to lie, hit their siblings or raid the cookie jar when told not to? No. You had to teach them not to do those things — it’s a nature thing.\nPaul’s Epistle to the Romans concludes:\n“There’s nobody living right, not even one, nobody who knows the score, nobody alert for God. They’ve all taken the wrong turn; they’ve all wandered down blind alleys. No one’s living right; I can’t find a single one. Their throats are gaping graves, their tongues slick as mudslides. Every word they speak is tinged with poison. They open their mouths and pollute the air. They race for the honor of sinner-of-the-year, litter the land with heartbreak and ruin, Don’t know the first thing about living with others. They never give God the time of day.” 2 The Consequences\nUnfortunately, the result of committing sin — even just one — is consequential and eternal, “For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all.” 3\nFurthermore, scripture compares sinning throughout a lifetime to “working” at a job, and then being “paid” in the form of spiritual death:\n“As long as you did what you felt like doing, ignoring God, you didn’t have to bother with right thinking or right living, or right anything for that matter. But do you call that a free life? What did you get out of it? Nothing you’re proud of now. Where did it get you? A dead end ... Work hard for sin your whole life and your pension is death.” 4 God’s Solution\nFortunately, God knew in advance that Adam and Eve, and all who followed would break faith with Him and incur sin’s lethal effects. So, before He created the first man, God had already provided the remedy that would restore mankind’s relationship with Him — proactively:\n“Your life is a journey you must travel with a deep consciousness of God. It cost God plenty to get you out of that dead-end, empty-headed life you grew up in. He paid with Christ’s sacred blood, you know. He died like an unblemished, sacrificial lamb. And this was no afterthought. Even though it has only lately — at the end of the ages — become public knowledge, God always knew he was going to do this for you. It’s because of this sacrificed Messiah, whom God then raised from the dead and glorified, that you trust God, that you know you have a future in God.” 5 Underlying Assets\nUnlike “Bitcoin religions,” Christianity is built upon a totally unique underlying asset that eternally guarantees eternal life to anyone coming to Christ in faith:\n“... Knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ .” 6\nChristianity’s underlying asset is no less than the blood of Christ, God’s Son. No other religion can claim that distinction. It provides the only “tradable currency” in heaven, the blood of a divine innocent substitute, with sufficient intrinsic value to settle mankind’s accumulated guilt since time began: Pointing to Realities of Heaven\n“But when the Messiah arrived, high priest of the superior things of this new covenant, he bypassed the old tent and its trappings in this created world and went straight into heaven’s ‘tent’— the true Holy Place — once and for all. He also bypassed the sacrifices consisting of goat and calf blood, instead using his own blood as the price to set us free once and for all. If that animal blood and the other rituals of purification were effective in cleaning up certain matters of our religion and behavior, think how much more the blood of Christ cleans up our whole lives, inside and out. Through the Spirit, Christ offered himself as an unblemished sacrifice, freeing us from all those dead-end efforts to make ourselves respectable, so that we can live all out for God.” 7 How About You?\nIf Christ’s sacrifice was good enough for God, why would you settle for anything less? Why attempt to scale the walls of heaven on your own merit when you can place a God-ordained substitute between yourself and the consequences of your sin?\nWant to receive immediate relief from guilt, have peace with God, a clear conscience and a renewed spirit? It’s yours for the asking.\n— D.C. Collier is a Bible teacher, discipleship mentor and writer focused on Christian apologetics.

I guess that some are legit, but most of them should not really steal your sleep.\n1: Exposure to Bitcoin-Specific Scams and Fraud.\nMakes no sense. Bitcoin itself is not a scam, so you shouldn't judge ICO scams, or any other projects that use bitcoin and turn out to be scams. There are plenty scams with fiat as well, and you are not concerned that fiat will disappear. People need to start separating what is bitcoin and what are projects that use bitcoin as a currency.\n2: Black Market Activity May Damage Reputation and Usefulness.\nSame as above for reputation and black market activity. As for reputation and usefulness, bitcoin has a great team behind it, and it's practical cases can't be denied. I won't mention them because there is plenty information about it already. I think you should see bitcoin as insurance for a world crisis, because it has value and is decentralized.\n3: Susceptible to High Price Volatility.\nTrue, but that can't last forever. If adoption occurs that will stop because the liquidity will be huge, so less volatility.\n4: No Chargebacks or Refunds.\nDon't really see a problem with this one.\n5: Potential to Be Replaced by Superior Cryptocurrency.\nTechnology keeps evolving so that can happen to everything. But even land mail wasn't completely replaced by email, so you can't really tell what will last and what it will disappear.\n6:Environmental Ills of Bitcoin Mining.\nEnvironment is a global concern and not just a bitcoin problem. If you think about, gold and fiat are more harmful to the environment than bitcoin, so this is actually a point in favor for BTC.\n7: Bitcoins Are Not Widely Accepted.\nTrue, but BTC is just in it's early days. It needs to solve a lot of issues first. See BTC as a beta product, and evaluate it's potential as a full product. I would say it's a really good investment.\n8: Wallets Can Be Lost.\nA lot of valuable things can be lost. This is not a bitcoin problem. Even money on banks is not 100% safe, so you can't really go that way.\n9: Risk of Unknown Technical Flaws\nThe same as above. There are no 100% bullet proof products.\n10: No Physical Form\nActually there is at least one project that created a bill version for bitcoin. They are normal bills with values from 0.005 to 0.01 BTC or something like that. They have a chip that is made by samsung if I'm not mistaken, and they are just that. Bills that have bitcoin in it. Not sure we really need that, but it can be done.\nReply like this is what I call contributing to the community. These are the kind of post that needed meriting sorry their although I know you don't need it but i don't have neither to acknowledge your efforts.

According to theory, this is an impossible task.\nThe trading industry won&a;rsquo;t have you believe this because their pay checks often depend on the imaginary gift of calling market direction. The history of Wall Street is strewn with amazing traders that were genius and massively profitable when the trend was with them but crashed and burned when the trend got to a bend in the end.\nSo what do you do when you are a financial institution that the Federal Reserve offers infinite money to for almost free? You&a;rsquo;d better find yourself a way of trading with that money that isn&a;rsquo;t going to blow up, that you can get quickly back, and that pays a fat coupon beyond what the Fed is going to charge you.\nYou need a &q;carry trade&q; (borrowing at a low interest rate and investing in an asset that provides a higher rate of return). You need lots of &q;carry trades.&q; With trillions on offer almost any trade will do.\nWhat is a no-brainer is to buy stocks. The liquidity is there, there is yield and everyone else with access to the ocean of money is going to be buying stocks and pushing them higher. This is the story of the mega-bull market post 2008-2009.\nTrillions of levered QE dollars have pushed the stock market to epic highs. This process is being unwound and because of that the markets have become extremely volatile.\nSo what has this got to do with Bitcoin? The answer is, Bitcoin is part of this &q;carry trade&q; and when liquidity is being injected into the market like last week, up goes Bitcoin. Take a look at this:\n&l;!–donotpaginate–&g;\n&l;img class=&q;size-full wp-image-57095&q; src=&q;http://blogs-images.forbes.com/investor/files/2018/05/dowbitcoin.jpg?width=960&q; alt=&q;Dow leading Bitcoin&q; data-height=&q;553&q; data-width=&q;900&q;&g; Dow leading Bitcoin\nOn Thursday&l;sup&g;,&l;/sup&g; May 4, when the Dow got a stick save from breaking lots of technical levels, minutes later up goes Bitcoin.\nIt been noted before that Bitcoin seems to be correlated to stocks and here it is again, this time intraday and very clearly so.\nWhere is the linkage? For one, cheap money can be turned into &q;cash and carry.&q; There you would take a Fed handout, buy Bitcoin and sell the future. As I write, the yield on this trade is 10%-plus. So for your riskless trade of &q;borrow a billion dollars,&q; buy Bitcoin now and sell the futures contract &a;lsquo;for delivery,&a;rsquo; you have a 9% carry trade, a sweet $90 dollar profit per annum.\nThis is why I believe the Dow is a leading indicator of Bitcoin intraday, because liquidity in or out from the Fed and they appear to be doing both to try and smooth out reverse QE, and the Dow will instantly react. Bitcoin, a much more primitive and niche market, takes time for the cash injection to hit.\nSo traders, get it while you can, because one thing is for sure, leading indicators like this don&a;rsquo;t last for long.\n&l;a href=&q;http://bit.ly/2nP7Hek&q; target=&q;_blank&q; rel=&q;nofollow noopener noreferrer&q; data-ga-track=&q;ExternalLink:http://bit.ly/2nP7Hek&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;&l;strong&g;&l;em&g;Stay informed and ahead of the crowd with Forbes Crypto Confidential, a free weekly e-letter on crypto and blockchain.

The test, according to one e-mail sent to the bitcoin development email list on Thursday, comes after the group behind the project added theoretical evaluation in an attempt to address the concerns that the first Dandelion proposal might be exposed to de-anonymization assault. A wide range of projects have concentrated on this question inside the bitcoin network, all which seek to improve privacy for users of the public – and pseudonymous – blockchain. As previously reported by CoinDesk, the Dandelion Bitcoin dandelion content was first printed in June of last year, backed by Zcash advisor and University of Illinois assistant professor Andrew Miller, and a number of other faculty members and students from the faculty.\nThe proposal initially aimed at present a two phase route for bitcoin transactions: stem, that’s the transaction itself, and fluff, which is a darkening phase that would eventually obscure the original Internet protocol address of a bitcoin sender. Nevertheless, following the proposal’s publication, Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell pointed out that the tech might run into deanonymization with time, which suggests attackers will still be capable to identify the origin by cross checking transaction patterns.\nNevertheless, in the most recent update, the group behind the Dandelion job have indicated an inbound edge, which basically aims to ensure Dandelion transactions sent from one node will be routed in various paths in the network to be able to block the identification of data that was hierarchical. Afterward, the group then moved to test the job on its own little network, discovering that far Dandelion is suitable has built a prototype and group stated.

According to Electrum, the malicious knockoff, Electrum Pro, is designed with malware to hijack private seed keys. The platform is urging users to be wary of the fake bitcoin storage service. Electrum vs. Electrum Pro Bitcoin Wallet\nThe development team at Electrum has since been trying to alert users to the possibility that Electrum Pro is a fake. According to Electrum, the counterfeit platform has been cloning its brand image, even going as far creating a website on the dot-com domain. (In the interest of security, we will not link to the copycat site.) However, the official Electrum site is on the dot-org domain . Electrum also alleges that the knockoff platform has been claiming to be a fork of the Electrum project. Electrum's website is https://t.co/aHiZIZH54e . We do not own electrum dot com, and \"Electrum Pro\" is very likely bitcoin stealing malware. Please use https://t.co/Rne1yx5acw for a list of Bitcoin wallet websites.\n— Electrum (@ElectrumWallet) April 5, 2018\nIn April, Electrum alerted users to the fake platform via a tweet. The fact that the counterfeit service chose to use their brand name without permission raised red flags. The team then set about trying to prove its suspicions and has finally done so as seen in a recent GitHub document . Proof of the Bitcoin Stealing Malware\nOn May 8th, Electrum posted a tweet declaring that they had evidence that Electrum Pro was a malicious copycat platform. Also, the team published the hash of the alleged fake wallet with independent verification from archive.org and Virus Total . In the GitHub document detailing the elaborate scam, the Electrum Pro wallet appears infected with a malware that steals the private seed key of users. Seed keys are cryptographic keys that grant access to the bitcoins stored in a wallet across multiple addresses. Seed keys are usually mnemonic phrases. Here is a verifiable proof that \"Electrum Pro\", a fake version of @ElectrumWallet , is in fact Bitcoin-stealing malware: https://t.co/FvhkTp29wI\n— Electrum (@ElectrumWallet) May 9, 2018\nWhen a user manages any of their Bitcoin addresses via Electrum Pro, their seed key is automatically hacked and sent to the fake electrum.com domain. Once this happens, an unauthorized person can access the user’s funds and steal all the bitcoins in the wallet.\nThe platform also advises users who have inadvertently used Electrum Pro to delete the program and move their bitcoins immediately. Electrum users are urged to avoid downloading binaries from unofficial sources to prevent becoming victims of scams like Electrum Pro. Thus, it is best to visit the official platform website when downloading executables, binaries, and other software programs.\nDo you know of any other malicious cryptocurrency wallet platform?

Roger Ver, whose involvement in the space since 2011 has earned him the moniker ‘Bitcoin Jesus’, believes technologically superior cryptocurrencies like ethereum and bitcoin cash will see massive gains in the coming months and years.\nA significant surge in their value will likely correlate with more modest gains for bitcoin, according to Mr Ver, leading to what analysts have termed “The Flippening” – the point in time when bitcoin no longer the cryptocurrency with the highest market capitalization. “I see it happening, and I believe it’s imminent,” Mr Ver told The Independent.\n“Ethereum could overtake bitcoin by the end of the year and bitcoin cash could do the same before 2020.” Mr Ver cited issues with bitcoin’s core technology, which has seen it beleaguered with slow transaction times and high fees as its popularity has increased. More than 1,500 other cryptocurrencies have come into existence since bitcoin’s inception in 2009, each one trying to overcome one or more of bitcoin’s flaws.\nIncreasing interest in bitcoin over the last year has been reflected across the cryptocurrency markets, with ethereum and bitcoin cash making significant gains on bitcoin. In the past 12 months, the price of one bitcoin has risen from around $1,700 to $9,360 – an increase of 450 per cent.\nIn the same timeframe, ethereum has seen gains of almost 1,000 per cent to reach its current value of $764, while bitcoin cash has surged from around $500 in August last year to today’s price of $1,655. The price of ethereum may still be a long way off bitcoin, however there are five-times more in circulation – meaning ethereum’s market cap is just under half that of bitcoin’s.

According to Electrum, the malicious knockoff, Electrum Pro, is designed with malware to hijack private seed keys. The platform is urging users to be wary of the fake bitcoin storage service. Electrum vs. Electrum Pro Bitcoin Wallet\nThe development team at Electrum has since been trying to alert users to the possibility that Electrum Pro is a fake. According to Electrum, the counterfeit platform has been cloning its brand image, even going as far creating a website on the dot-com domain. (In the interest of security, we will not link to the copycat site.) However, the official Electrum site is on the dot-org domain . Electrum also alleges that the knockoff platform has been claiming to be a fork of the Electrum project. Electrum’s website is https://t.co/aHiZIZH54e . We do not own electrum dot com, and “Electrum Pro” is very likely bitcoin stealing malware. Please use https://t.co/Rne1yx5acw for a list of Bitcoin wallet websites.\n— Electrum (@ElectrumWallet) April 5, 2018\nIn April, Electrum alerted users to the fake platform via a tweet. The fact that the counterfeit service chose to use their brand name without permission raised red flags. The team then set about trying to prove its suspicions and has finally done so as seen in a recent GitHub document . Proof of the Bitcoin Stealing Malware\nOn May 8th, Electrum posted a tweet declaring that they had evidence that Electrum Pro was a malicious copycat platform. Also, the team published the hash of the alleged fake wallet with independent verification from archive.org and Virus Total . In the GitHub document detailing the elaborate scam, the Electrum Pro wallet appears infected with a malware that steals the private seed key of users. Seed keys are cryptographic keys that grant access to the bitcoins stored in a wallet across multiple addresses. Seed keys are usually mnemonic phrases. Here is a verifiable proof that “Electrum Pro”, a fake version of @ElectrumWallet , is in fact Bitcoin-stealing malware: https://t.co/FvhkTp29wI\n— Electrum (@ElectrumWallet) May 9, 2018\nWhen a user manages any of their Bitcoin addresses via Electrum Pro, their seed key is automatically hacked and sent to the fake electrum.com domain. Once this happens, an unauthorized person can access the user’s funds and steal all the bitcoins in the wallet.\nThe platform also advises users who have inadvertently used Electrum Pro to delete the program and move their bitcoins immediately. Electrum users are urged to avoid downloading binaries from unofficial sources to prevent becoming victims of scams like Electrum Pro. Thus, it is best to visit the official platform website when downloading executables, binaries, and other software programs.\nDo you know of any other malicious cryptocurrency wallet platform?

Shrem is a bitcoin pioneer, social economist, digital currency trader and is currently the founder of Crypto.IQ. His work in this field is legendary.\nIn 2011, at the dawn of the crypto era, Shrem founded BitInstant, the first and largest Bitcoin company. In 2013, he founded the Bitcoin Foundation and served as its Vice Chairman. Since then, Charlie has advised more than a dozen digital currency companies, launched and managed numerous partnerships between crypto and non-crypto companies, and is the go-to guy for some of the world’s wealthiest entrepreneurs. He recently started Crypto.IQ, a premier advisory firm providing expert research, education and advice in the world of crypto assets. In short, he is the ultimate insider at the epicenter.\nShrem was an early change-maker for bitcoin, identifying some of the initial challenges and quickly working to overcome them so that it could be adopted on a mass scale. His company BitInstant was born out of the frustration of losing bitcoins due to long transaction times. At one time, it processed 30% of all bitcoin transactions. Shrem is responsible for bringing cryptocurrency to the masses by partnering with MoneyGram to allow cash deposits for bitcoin at over 700,000 US locations.\n“Shrem’s first hand experience with both the actual and perceived limitations of digital currency, followed by rapid innovation to overcome them, is exactly what we need to introduce a new cryptolocation technology on a massive and global scale,” said XYO Network co-founder Markus Levin.\nThe XYO Network is the next generation of GPS technology as it provides an efficient and foolproof way to deliver trustworthy location through cryptolocation technology that protects privacy while providing greater accuracy. With a platform of over one million connected beacon devices already in circulation, the blockchain technology can jump from the online realm into the real world with precise physical coordinates.\nAs the world leader in blockchain location technology, the XYO Network can serve as an Internet of Things (IoT) backbone for smart cities of the future. It can power everything from automated parking payments to traffic flow optimization, self-driving cars, autonomous drone delivery, airline luggage tracking, e-commerce, and many additional applications. It can even extend beyond the Earth to vehicle and equipment location services on the Moon or even Mars.\nFor additional information, visit xyo.network .\nAbout XYO Network:\nXYO Network built the world’s first decentralized location verification system with more than one million location tracking devices in circulation around the world. After years of investment and breakthroughs in crypto-location technology, XYO is poised to help bring the promise and the benefits of blockchain technology to the real world on a massive and global scale. This can have a profound impact on businesses that rely on the delivery of goods and services requiring non-forgeable and verifiable location data. It can power current applications like eCommerce as well as the backbone for smart cities of the future including the Internet of Things (IoT), self-driving vehicles, autonomous delivery drones, and even location tracking on the Moon and Mars.\nContacts XYO Network\nKeri Kukral, 760-487-8421\nkeri@xyo.network", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "charlie shrem", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "charlie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitinstant", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "xyo network", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin foundation founder charlie shrem joins xyo network advisory board san diego", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "board of advisors", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin foundation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T16:59:04.110+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4831015554afd62175ffec2337a44165b843ad70", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8h25XQH3LtaRmUvms5ovyV_ekWY.MRZ4Pde4kz0xCV8_8y6DsRKY74G22LUU_ekqB9HbZ63AP.FREkG6RA3yB_mN96nLxK0QI-", "site_full": "www.apkmania.live", "site": "apkmania.live", "site_section": "http://downloadapkgratis.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Download APK Gratis", "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, IOTA Ripple Price & Crypto News v2.1 Android Free Download", "title_full": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, IOTA Ripple Price & Crypto News v2.1 Android Free Download", "published": "2018-05-10T20:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jqS8h5r9WdERxf2kYe-3J71ApZbCzsvehLqpowWYl7L5eSBRcI506gAEvJF-jy6BSA=h450", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4831015554afd62175ffec2337a44165b843ad70", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8h25XQH3LtaRmUvms5ovyV_ekWY.MRZ4Pde4kz0xCV8_8y6DsRKY74G22LUU_ekqB9HbZ63AP.FREkG6RA3yB_mN96nLxK0QI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "downloadapk", "published": "2018-05-10T20:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin, Ethereum, IOTA Ripple Price & Crypto News v2.1 Android Free Download", "text": "Home » Apps » Bitcoin, Ethereum, IOTA Ripple Price & Crypto News v2.1 Android Free Download Bitcoin, Ethereum, IOTA Ripple Price & Crypto News v2.1 Android Apps , Finance Bitcoin, Ethereum, IOTA Ripple Price & Crypto News v2.1 Android Free Download 10 Views\nDownloadapkgratis.com – Free Download Bitcoin, Ethereum, IOTA Ripple Price & Crypto News v2.1 5:47 pm and this Bitcoin, Ethereum, IOTA Ripple Price & Crypto News v2.1 Android by Downloadapkgratis.com Real-Time Crypto Market DataInvesting.com offers an overview of cryptocurrency markets, ideal for tracking prices and exchange rates.* Real-Time and historical price data tracking for a variety of digital assets* Quotes for more than 1300 altcoins and fiat currencies* Market capitalization per altcoin* Percentage change in price for 1D, 7D\nNEWS & ANALYSISStay up to date with the latest Bitcoin and altcoin news and analysis from the following sources: Investing.com, CoinDesk, NewsWire, Bitcoin Magazine, The Merkle, CryptoPotato, CryptoCoins News, Blockchain.com Blog, Bitcoinist, Altcoin Today, Coin Telegraph, Yahoo, Reuters.\nPORTFOLIOEasily monitor all your blockchain assets and holdings, along with real-time detailed information on each coin.

Proponents of both coins laud their cryptocurrency as the one true Bitcoin, often pointing out the limitations of the opposing technology to substantiate their claims.\nOne of the major differences between the two blockchains is their approach towards scaling. While Bitcoin opts to implement Segregated Witness and second-layer scaling solutions like the Lightning Network, Bitcoin Cash relies on increased block sizes.\nCurrently, Bitcoin Cash is a lot cheaper to transfer and use, while Bitcoin is perceived to be more stable and widespread.\nLingham said:\n“At the moment, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are focusing on two completely different markets. Bitcoin Cash is most commonly used for fast payments, as a medium of exchange, and Bitcoin is the better suited for store of value, in my opinion”\nHe added:\n“When I look at it from the product standpoint, I think the greater demand is for peer-to-peer cash than for digital gold, given the size and velocity of the markets.”\nHe further said that however there is still uncertainty about the potential adoption of Bitcoin Cash. It remains to be seen if the network effect around Bitcoin Cash can grow faster than Bitcoin’s. The question remains about Bitcoin Cash’s capability to catch up to Bitcoin if it focuses just on payments.\nBitcoin Cash is designed to function as a substitute, and possible replacement, for cash as it offers fungibility and security. While cryptocurrencies have steadily gained the attention of mainstream consumers, Lingham said there is a long way to go before they could replace cash as a medium of exchange.\nHe said what we are seeing now is the beginning of a token economy.\nLingham says:\n“Blockchain technologies are changing the way the world functions, and I believe this is just the beginning of the token economy. The adoption of the infrastructure, the cost of transactions and network security will be in relation to primary value of the token infrastructure. It will not be pegged to the value of the underlying assets on that network, but rather the activity levels for trading those assets”\nHe predicted the demand for Ethereum and Bitcoin would rise on fiat-to-crypto exchanges in the short term, leading to possible widespread adoption and utilization of the technology in mainstream applications.\nLingham concluded:\n“Given that these token assets can typically only be purchased on exchanges that accept cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the demand for Bitcoin and Ethereum will rise at the fiat onramps. However, it’s not far-fetched to believe that you could one day buy a CoffeeCoin, blockchain-based stock, or Civic token directly via your bank or brokerage account with the token economy’s growth and becomes more mainstream.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vinny lingham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vinny lingham bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lingham", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lightning network", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lingham", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T22:28:11.061+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "67a972df0019e9c5505262ac19d468340a3b9120", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRTJaJxS4ehrK7ZRE1V3oxY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why do some government ban bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why do some government ban bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-10T20:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.242, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "67a972df0019e9c5505262ac19d468340a3b9120", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRTJaJxS4ehrK7ZRE1V3oxY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Xester", "published": "2018-05-10T20:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why do some government ban bitcoin?", "text": "Quote: from: Rustandy on Today at 09:34:25 AM Because it has no formal basis and regulatory authority, bitcoin is prone to be misused for illegal transactions, money laundering, and financing of terrorism.

Not only harm the society later, such transactions can also disrupt the stability of the state financial system.\nIt is true that bitcoin is being used by drug traffickers, money launderers and other illicit activities and it is one reason why countries banned bitcoin. Other banned bitcoin because the government has no control over bitcoin and they are afraid of what negative effects it may bring to their economy.

I relied on the precise definition of a bear market that is employed by Ned Davis Research, the quantitative research firm, according to which there have been 10 bear markets since the mid 1970s.\nFor each of these bear markets, I calculated a ratio of two numbers: The first is average daily NYSE trading volume over the first month of that bear market, and the second is the average over the month prior to the bear market’s beginning (that is, in the last month of the preceding bull market).\nAcross all 10 past bear markets, this ratio’s average was precisely 2.0-to-1.

Wright. The event, titled “The Future of Bitcoin (Cash)” , was organized by University of Exeter Business School academic Dr Jack Rogers, and economics student Sebastian Ploetzeneder.\nDr. Rogers said that the event would be a good opportunity to raise questions about the technology and collectively explore the possibilities, particularly for underdeveloped countries. “This is a chance for people to ask Craig and Jimmy how bitcoin operates, how it could replace other currencies and whether in the future there could be just one form of global money. The panel will also discuss the implications it has for the way governments manage macroeconomic stability, and the impact it may have on people in underdeveloped countries,” Dr. Rogers said.\nDuring the discussion, Dr. Craig S. Wright reiterated a major benefit that he has been pointing out in several other speeches: bitcoin is about inclusion.\nThe truth of the matter is, if we want a free world, we need to have open transactions and we need to have free money.\nWatch his speech below.\nJimmy Nguyen, nChain’s CEO, talked about materializing the original Bitcoin vision and enabling people and merchants to transact directly\nYou can see his speech below:\nWright and Nguyen also took part in a panel discussion with the university’s business school lecturer John Maloney, economics student Sebastian Ploetzeneder, and mathematics and cryptography lecturer Gihan Marasingha. You can see that clip below:\nIn a Yours post, event co-organizer Ploetzeneder says the event was successful\n“It was a win in many ways: it put the University of Exeter on the map for what will be a leading blockchain university (with its new cryptocurrency module coming later this year), attendees got to gain insights from the 2 experts in the field, and—not the least of all wins—it opened the door for mainstream acceptance and adoption of Bitcoin Cash in a world where anyone can transact with anyone else around the planet, a world that leads to the wealth of nations as we have never experienced it before,” he wrote.

Opinion Top 5 reasons bitcoin is a cancer Bitcoin—the popular virtual decentralized currency—is changing the world. That much is certain. But is it changing the world for good? Or is it a cancer that will eventually bring about the destruction of all mankind? Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry 4 questions new leaders should ask\nA well-meaning cancer, but a cancer nonetheless.\nAnd I’m not speaking metaphorically here, either. I mean Bitcoin is literally a cancer foisted upon the world. Think I’m talking crazy? Okay.\nFirst-off, let’s review how cancer works: cancerous cells are those that start off as regular cells but then their DNA mutates for one reason or another. And once that happens, the cells go crazy. They stop regulating their own growth and proliferate throughout the body. This is exactly the case with Bitcoin. And I don’t mean to suggest that Bitcoin is proliferating as a currency—that it’s becoming more mainstream—because that might be a good thing. And I’m not talking about Blockchain either, the technology Bitcoin relies upon, though in this recent episode of my podcast, Device Squad, my guest, former Bitcoin Armory Engineer, Andy Ofiesh asserted Blockchain has zero application to the enterprise due to its inherently cumbersome nature.\nSo just how is Bitcoin a cancer? Let us count the ways. 1. Planet-polluting\nHow do new Bitcoins come to be? New Bitcoins are birthed through a process called “mining” (Andy and I talk about Bitcoin mining in this episode of the Device Squad podcast.). Simply put, miners compete to find the lowest hash function, a number that represents all recent (but not confirmed) bitcoin transactions that occurred since the last hash was found. To even be eligible, the number must start with a certain number of zeroes. When that number is found, it locks all the new transactions into a bitcoin block, which gets added to the permanent record of all previous transactions. Hence: blockchain. This occurs about once every ten minutes. A nice explanation may also be found here .\nBut how does mining happen? Mining requires very expensive, very fast computers that typically use high-speed video cards. And now, due to the rising price of bitcoin, the competition for mining bitcoin is intense. Consequently, miners are constantly building faster machines to improve their chances of finding a hash function. Side note: the practice of bitcoin mining is also hurting the PC gaming community since manufacturers take advantage of rising bitcoin prices by raising the prices of the cards. Worse yet, these video cards become obsolete almost immediately as faster and faster technology is released. So where do the ‘outdated’ machines go? Many are simply discarded and wind up in landfills. More environmentally-conscious miners might drop them off at a thrift store for the tax write-off. Here’s links to a couple of machines donated to Goodwill : Bitmain Antminer S5 ASIC Bitcoin Miner , Bitmain Antminer S7 ASIC Bitcoin Miner . And here’s another one on Craigslist , which leads us right to #2: 2. Energy-consuming\nIn case you missed it, here’s the content of the above Craigslist ad:\n“Fully working Bitmain S7-LN ( this is the low noise home miner version of the S7) Plugs directly into 110v outlet using the built in 1000 watt gold power supply. Great for beginner, hobby , miner since these are quiet and easy to maintain. Also provides extra heating during the winter months. Can deliver within the Cambridge area, or meetup in a dunking donuts or Starbucks. $750 cash or will take crypto currency too.”\nNotice anything strange? You can deduce from the “1000-watt gold power supply” and the fact that the miner “provides extra heating during winter months” that this thing uses a lot of energy (presumably 1000 watts worth), solely for mining bitcoin.\nBitcoin mining uses A LOT of energy. As in, an ungodly amount. And this amount is only increasing as the machines for mining bitcoin continue to get faster and faster and the competition becomes ever more fierce as a result. Take a look at Digiconomist’s Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index and you’ll see what I mean. As the price of bitcoin takes off, so too does the amount of energy consumed. As of May 7th, Bitcoin’s estimated annual electricity consumption is 65.45TWh, up from 12TWh a year ago. What the heck is a TWh? It’s a Terawatt-hour. So, let’s put this in terms you’ll understand. This number is approximately equivalent to the electricity consumed by the entire Czech Republic: population 10.56 million! In fact, according to Digiconomist, a single bitcoin transaction uses enough electricity to power 28.7 US households for a day. Not to burst your bubble, but Eric Holthaus of grist predicts that “By February 2020, [the bitcoin network] will use as much electricity as the entire world does today.” 3. Commerce-preventing\nBitcoin aficionados like to dream of a world where a decentralized currency reigns supreme, not beholden to any bank or central authority, and ruled by the people themselves! Sounds good, right. Only hold on. Since Bitcoin is such a total wackadoo idea the price goes up and down by thousands at the drop of a hat, or slip of the tongue (such as when Berkshire Hathaway CEO, Warren Buffett recently called it “rat poison squared” and Bill Gates said he’d bet against it if he could. Further, the fact that most people who invest in it have no idea how Bitcoin works, the opposite is true when somebody announces a change to the protocol, or rather, when an announced change doesn’t happen, such as when the SegWit2x fork got cancelled. You have no idea what that means, right? Of course not. Neither did I until Andy explained it to me .\nIn short, Bitcoin’s extreme volatility means nobody will ever spend it on anything so long as it might be worth twice as much tomorrow (who want to pay $40 for a pizza?) and nobody will ever accept it so long as it could be worth half as much tomorrow as it is today. Everybody’s just hanging on to it, in the hopes the price will start to skyrocket again. That said, a list of companies who do accept Bitcoin can be found here . Ironically, the list includes bloomberg.com , Domino’s, Microsoft, and San Jose’s professional soccer team, the San Jose Earthquakes. 4. Crime-facilitating\nHowever, there is one group for whom Bitcoin will always be appealing, no matter what happens to the price, and that group is criminals. Specifically, hackers. According to cybersecurity firm Malwarebytes , in the summer of 2016, ransomware was already so prevalent that 40% of companies surveyed had been targeted worldwide. As you’ll recall, last year’s WannaCry ransomware attack took over your computer and demanded payment in Bitcoin to get the files back. Why did the hackers demand Bitcoin? Because since there’s no bank or credit card company involved, Bitcoin provides some serious anonymity. In fact, Bitcoin may be stored in virtual wallets identified only by a number.\n“Where the ends are illicit, the means almost always involve bitcoins,” asserts Simon Usborne of The Guardian. The dark web—a parallel internet of heavily encrypted networks where identities are easily hidden—practically runs on it. One such black marketplace was AlphaBay, where users could purchase drugs, prostitutes, and so much more (shutdown by Law Enforcement July, 2017). It’s a virtual Tangier! Plus if you’ve got the chutzpah to actually slink into the dark web (wherever that actually may be), you’ll find you can use a Bitcoin laundry system (which itself sounds like a criminal enterprise) to make your coin untraceable.\nAnd guess what? The more the price of Bitcoin goes up, the greater the incentive to unleash some new ransomware upon the world! But that’s not all! Bitcoin is also perfectly suited for any illicit application where anonymity is key, including software piracy, gambling, illegal weapons purchasing, money laundering, you name it! cancer much? 5. Culpability-evading\nLastly, should the world eventually decide Bitcoin is just too much of a bad thing, for all its energy-hogging and crime-facilitating, there’s literally no one person in charge. Bitcoin’s supposed creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, probably doesn’t even exist! That’s right. Nobody knows who he is, or even if he is. He’s just like Banksy that way. He may even be Banksy. Most likely, however, the name represents a group of people, none of whom wanted to attach their name to this cancerous monstrosity. Or he/she may simply be an alien hell-bent on destroying the Earth, one Bitcoin at a time. As with the Tootsie Pop question, the world may never know.\nThis article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network.

While calling himselfa Buffett disciple, Palihapitiya told CNBC that Buffett is wrong about bitcoin. $9K Still in Play Despite Bitcoin Rally – – Not everybody is right all the time, he told the news source, further suggesting thatthat knowledge about technology is not in Buffett’s circle of competence.\nTags: billionaire Warren Buffett, Venture capitalistÂ Chamath, ofÂ Berkshire Hathaway, derogatory statements,\n@CryptoNewswire: Buffett ‘Disciple’ Condemns Investor’s Views On Bitcoin – https://t.co/XiKs0JXNJQ $BTC #blockchain #news #fintech\nBuffett ‘Disciple’ Condemns Investor’s Views On Bitcoin\nEvery investor should buy crypto, says digital currency index founder It’s almost essential for every investor to have at least 1% to 2% of their portfolio in crypto, Novogratz, the CEO and Founder of Galaxy Digital Capital Management, told Maggie Lake on Markets Now on Wednesday.

In fact [it’s] designed to be not transparent, Bessant said on CNBC’s Squawk Box. Just like we don’t allow stocks to be purchased on our credit cards, we’re not going to allow cryptos or other currencies to be purchased on our credit cards, Bessant said. Using the good guy-bad guy analogy again, she said during a chat with CNBC’s Kayla Tausche that the relationship is clear with someone robbing a bank, but less so with someone stealing data. Often times the hacker or the person who causes the leak and steals the data are considered heroic, Bessant said.

The former chief economic advisor, who resigned from the Trump administration in early March, said in an interview on this weekthat bitcoins underlying blockchain technology was more interesting than the actual virtual currency. As the worlds first cryptocurrency, bitcoin was the first to make use of the blockchainan online ledger that serves as a permanent record of all transactions for the digital currency. His former employer is the first major Wall Street bank to open a bitcoin trading desk, having succumbed to pressure from clients enthusiastic about cryptocurrency.

Here’s how to incorporate it.\nMay 10, 2018\n6 min read\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\nThe basis for all business is supply and demand, but recent events have shown that supply can be more fragile than we might expect. For example, KFC’s chicken shortages in the U.K. forced two-thirds of its 900 restaurants to close while the company worked to repair its delivery, via DHL. (And this was then followed by a gravy shortage .)\nUltimately, it turned out that those U.K. events were because of human error, not any lack of chicken. And that revelationonly reinforced how critical excellent record-keeping and accountability are for maintaining supply chain integrity. But help is on the way: Fortunately, the supply world will soon be revolutionized by the innovative solution of blockchain. Blockchain: the next wave in supply chain management\nThe most promising approach to robust supply-chain data is likely blockchain technology, a relatively new approach to digital record-keeping most famously associated with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin but applicable to many domains.\nRelated: 15 Crazy and Surprising Ways People Are Using Blockchain\nSharing is the secret to blockchain’s robustness against tampering: Because everyone has a record of the information, there is no way any one person can alter data in the chain. The technology’s distributed nature also means there is no central authority, so no one group controls that data.\nThese attractive features, of database security and distributed storage, are what’s motivating the incorporation of blockchain into business operations. They’re also the reasons blockchain will come to have the ring of trustworthiness in consumers’ perceptions. That trust is critical to competing in today’s marketplace.\nCompanies that lead in adopting blockchain will enjoy building that trust early in the process of its global adoption. So, are you in? Following are a few simple steps to move your company toward incorporating blockchain into your own operations: 1. Don’t adopt blockchain because it’s the cool new thing but because it ensures trust.\nNew technologies tend to stir up excitement, but that can also create a bandwagon effect in which companies wind up wasting resources on new tech just because they can.\nRelated: 12 Startups Utilizing Blockchain Technology in New Ways\nI’m seeing this pattern with blockchain, and it reminds me — and others — of the dotcom era. That thinking goes something like this: “We’re going to store data about transactions in the blockchain. Why? Because that’s what’s cool. “\nBut that’s never a good business reason. Instead, commit to adopting blockchain only if you need to ensure trust in your transactions through a verifiable and incorruptible system. Trust is ultimately about proof. Ask yourself, what exactly do you need to prove, and to whom do you need to prove it?\nFor example, if you have a massively long list of transactions that relate to your supply chain, is verifying every entry on that list important to your business? Or are you actually trying to prove just a fraction of that? To know exactly where you’ll need provable data, do some thinking about supply chain issues and what blockchain can do for them.\nFortunately, there is no shortage of great resources to develop your understanding of blockchain. In my own education, I’ve found YouTube to be an excellent tutor. Several other resources I recommend include an overview of how blockchain will change the economy , a lesson about how it works and recent conference presentations on the technology. 2. Know blockchain’s current limitations: real-time transactions and scaling.\nIt’s fair to say that because of a glaring lack of speed, blockchain is not ready for real-time transactions. The transaction rates are unable to compete at the level seen by credit card companies or any domain with a very high rate of transactions — essentially anything with an exchange.\nVitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, a popular cryptocurrency and alternative to bitcoin, has discussed in an online video how the peak capacity for Bitcoin is five transactions per second, with Ethereum nudging past it at six per second. But he then compares that to the much greater transaction capacity of Visa’s network, which is capable of handling a blazing 56,000 transactions per second , as a spokesman told the MyBroadband blog.\nSpeed may come to blockchain in time, but for now, intense real-time applications have been ruled out. That limitation excludes many use cases, which allows you to focus a little more closely on what actually can work. The present limitations in the blockchain technology also pose inherent problems. Buterin also blogged about this issue , noting that with the milestone of Ethereum transactions having reached a million a day early in 2018, blockchain networks have been generally reaching the limits of their (current) capacity.\nRelated: More Than Just Bitcoin: Blockchain Has Value Across Multiple Industries 3. Make sure you can tolerate working out some kinks with blockchain.\nBlockchain as a concept was born less than a decade ago, so it is still in the research and development stages. For that reason, if you’re going to adopt it, be sure you can stomach some bumps in the road as the technology improves — as well as the slew of variations and new offerings competing for your business. Things can get dizzying quickly.\nFor example, there isn’t just one standard blockchain. Instead, there exist many types of what are now known as “distributed ledger technologies,” or DLTs. Although diversity in digital tools is a positive aspect for business, it also creates mental overhead in your choosing the right approach for your needs. Some DLTs are more suitable for certain kinds of programs, so it’s important to do the research necessary to understand which is best for you.\nFinally, because blockchain is relatively new, press coverage and general buzz about it may swing wildly and is often driven by investor concerns or exaggeration — regardless of what’s happening with the technological progress.\nIn fact, a recent TechCrunch article even characterized it as having entered the “valley of despair” that is common to all change. The point, though, is that you should be careful to not get caught up in the buzz — good or bad — regarding blockchain, and instead stick closely to the technological facts. If your supply chain needs can benefit from tracking transactions with a new level of trust, then all that media chatter doesn’t matter. The blockchain future is arriving. Will you be ready?\nExpect to see more of your competitors offering and advertising a blockchain solution in the coming year. By being prepared, you can be part of a revolution in supply chain management, building trust in your brand and making product-tracing massively more efficient.\nWhether you create an in-house solution or outsource to today’s cutting-edge consultants, this novel approach to accountability can make all the difference in your client satisfaction and brand recognition during 2018 and beyond.\nSource: Entrepreneur This entry was posted in Market & Motivation News .

Shrem is a bitcoin pioneer, social economist, digital currency trader and is currently the founder of Crypto.IQ. His work in this field is legendary.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510005572/en/\nCharlie Shrem (Photo: Business Wire)\nIn 2011, at the dawn of the crypto era, Shrem founded BitInstant, the first and largest Bitcoin company. In 2013, he founded the Bitcoin Foundation and served as its Vice Chairman. Since then, Charlie has advised more than a dozen digital currency companies, launched and managed numerous partnerships between crypto and non-crypto companies, and is the go-to guy for some of the world’s wealthiest entrepreneurs. He recently started Crypto.IQ, a premier advisory firm providing expert research, education and advice in the world of crypto assets. In short, he is the ultimate insider at the epicenter.\nShrem was an early change-maker for bitcoin, identifying some of the initial challenges and quickly working to overcome them so that it could be adopted on a mass scale. His company BitInstant was born out of the frustration of losing bitcoins due to long transaction times. At one time, it processed 30% of all bitcoin transactions. Shrem is responsible for bringing cryptocurrency to the masses by partnering with MoneyGram to allow cash deposits for bitcoin at over 700,000 US locations.\n“Shrem’s first hand experience with both the actual and perceived limitations of digital currency, followed by rapid innovation to overcome them, is exactly what we need to introduce a new cryptolocation technology on a massive and global scale,” said XYO Network co-founder Markus Levin.\nThe XYO Network is the next generation of GPS technology as it provides an efficient and foolproof way to deliver trustworthy location through cryptolocation technology that protects privacy while providing greater accuracy. With a platform of over one million connected beacon devices already in circulation, the blockchain technology can jump from the online realm into the real world with precise physical coordinates.\nAs the world leader in blockchain location technology, the XYO Network can serve as an Internet of Things (IoT) backbone for smart cities of the future. It can power everything from automated parking payments to traffic flow optimization, self-driving cars, autonomous drone delivery, airline luggage tracking, e-commerce, and many additional applications. It can even extend beyond the Earth to vehicle and equipment location services on the Moon or even Mars.\nFor additional information, visit xyo.network.\nAbout XYO Network:\nXYO Network built the world’s first decentralized location verification system with more than one million location tracking devices in circulation around the world. After years of investment and breakthroughs in crypto-location technology, XYO is poised to help bring the promise and the benefits of blockchain technology to the real world on a massive and global scale. This can have a profound impact on businesses that rely on the delivery of goods and services requiring non-forgeable and verifiable location data. It can power current applications like eCommerce as well as the backbone for smart cities of the future including the Internet of Things (IoT), self-driving vehicles, autonomous delivery drones, and even location tracking on the Moon and Mars.\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510005572/en/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180510005572/en/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "charlie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie shrem", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "board of advisors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin foundation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T20:42:26.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ea565ae0d544750beffb21c95961e76a92795a51", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQVnuM8.NLpOjSxvKSfnMQ4Uz4Fjm5EJUMany..Gd0sDqhR_YhZOftdvV6_wg913SZsVSBu0h9l_A6fQ3eFcPuTZMfR7.TNYu_0rEqJPQ06W4IFxlhiA7b9S37dv.ZxU50-", "site_full": "www.cnbc.com", "site": "cnbc.com", "site_section": "http://www.cnbc.com/id/15839069/device/rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Investing", "title": "Bitcoin could soar as high as $64,000 next year, investment research firm Fundstrat predicts", "title_full": "Bitcoin could soar as high as $64,000 next year, investment research firm Fundstrat predicts", "published": "2018-05-10T19:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/04/19/105143510-GettyImages-934467996.1910x1000.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 767, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1639, "comments": 0, "shares": 1639}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 7}}}, "uuid": "ea565ae0d544750beffb21c95961e76a92795a51", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQVnuM8.NLpOjSxvKSfnMQ4Uz4Fjm5EJUMany..Gd0sDqhR_YhZOftdvV6_wg913SZsVSBu0h9l_A6fQ3eFcPuTZMfR7.TNYu_0rEqJPQ06W4IFxlhiA7b9S37dv.ZxU50-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-10T19:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin could soar as high as $64,000 next year, investment research firm Fundstrat predicts", "text": "The growth of bitcoin \"mining\" activity could send the cryptocurrency's price as high as $64,000, investment research firm Fundstrat said Thursday.\nBitcoin is created through an energy-intensive process known as mining, in which computers receive the cryptocurrency as reward for solving complex mathematical equations. Processing power to guess the solution is known as \"hash power,\" which Fundstrat predicts will grow 350 percent through 2019.\n\"We believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range,\" Sam Doctor, head of data science research at Fundstrat, said in a report.\nPerformance of bitcoin over the last 12 months\nSource: Coinbase\nBitcoin traded near $9,300 midday Thursday. Last year, the cryptocurrency surged from less than $1,000 to above $19,000, helped by a flood of investor interest. Concerns about a regulatory crackdown have helped send prices lower so far this year.\nHowever, the economics of bitcoin mining likely create a support level for the cryptocurrency, Doctor said. He said bitcoin miners are more likely to hold bitcoin as its price falls to breakeven for operating costs, and sell as its price rises, leading to greater profits.\n\"The primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors,\" Doctor said during a conference call Thursday.\nMining depends on factors such as the cost of electricity, cooling equipment and specialized hardware, known as rigs.\nAs of May 6, Fundstrat estimates the cash break-even price for the older Antminer S7 model is $6,003 per bitcoin, and $2,368 for the newer Antminer S9. Both are made by Beijing-based Bitmain, which Bernstein analysts estimate had $3 billion to $4 billion in operating profits last year.\n\"The release of the next generation of rig hardware should trigger a new round of capex as well as hash power growth, which could accelerate if BTC price appreciates,\" Doctor said.\nFundstrat co-founder Tom Lee is the only major Wall Street strategist to cover bitcoin. He issued his first formal report on the cryptocurrency last July, when bitcoin traded near $2,540. At the time, Lee predicted bitcoin could become a substitute for gold and reach $20,000 to $55,000 by 2022.\nshow chapters Palihapitiya: I am a Buffett 'disciple' but he's wrong about bitcoin 8:10 AM

I think most localbitcoins exchangers deal in much smaller amounts. – Nick ODell Apr 12 '13 at 21:57 1 @NickODell: I've seen in person BTC transactions of that size take place at San Francisco Bitcoin meetups. – David Schwartz Apr 13 '13 at 5:07 up vote 3 down vote\nThe AML laws in the US deliberately make this hard. Suddenly moving $10K of USD into BTC is exactly the kind of thing that makes the government worry about money laundering. So, without any case law protecting them, most exchanges aren't going to be willing to risk it without verifying your identity to help them get in compliance with the KYC/AML laws.\nMy personal opinion is that Bitfloor might be the fastest now, but I haven't tried everyone. But, even that is going to take a few days. And I started there with a smaller sum of money. $10K might hit some triggers that slow it down.\nOr you could try to put several smaller transactions through bitinstant or localbitcoins, if you are more tolerant of fees and hassle.
