Beware of scammers asking for bitcoin payouts this tax season: fraud watchdog\nAccording to court documents, the 37-year-old told undercover operatives it was best if he didn't know anything about the sale of narcotics.\n\"I didn't hear that,\" Ong explained to one agent. \"So there is one thing I tell people is I don't really care what ... they use the bitcoin for ... it's better that I don't actually know. 'Cause then I can have plausible deniability.\" 'I get the job done'\nIn addition to the jail sentence, Ong has also agreed to forfeit cash and bitcoin worth more than $1.1 million US.\nAccording to the original complaint, the U.S. department of Homeland Security began investigating Ong in December 2016 after responding to an online advertisement advertising the anonymous buying and selling of bitcoin.

He claimed a fee of 7.3 per cent.\nAgents later followed Ong as he deposited cash to a number of banks.\nAt the next meeting, the same agent asked Ong to trade $50,000 US for a fee of slightly more than nine per cent.\n\"I am charging ... higher than a lot of people, but because ... I get the job done, people come to me,\" he was recorded as saying. 'Your friends seem to be a bit open'\nAt one point in March 2017, Ong asked an agent who was acting as the 'boss' of the operation if his underlings could stop talking about drugs.\n\"I am not interested in what you buy or sell (bitcoin) for, so please do not mention it or have your friends mention it either,\" he said.\n\"Your friends seem to be a bit open about what you do when there is really no need to be.\" According to U.S. court documents, Ong transferred crypto-currency to a bitcoin wallet after receiving cash from undercover agents. (Simon Dawson/Bloomberg)\nAfter a uniformed agent confronted Ong, he registered with the federal U.S. agency tasked with stopping money laundering.\nBut then he proceeded to make three more transactions with undercover agents in violation of the rules.\nAccording to Ong's sentencing memorandum, he moved to Canada from Singapore with his mother in 1987, graduating from the University of B.C. with a degree in computer science.\nHe is described as an entrepreneur who worked to develop video game software.\nThe U.S. government claims a forensic review of his digital device revealed that he had been involved in the world of bitcoin since at least 2013.

agents posing as drug dealers to stop talking about where their money came from has been sentenced to 20 days in a U.S. jail.\nLouis Ong pleaded guilty last week in Seattle U.S. District Court to operating an unlicensed money transmission business.\nBeware of scammers asking for bitcoin payouts this tax season: fraud watchdog According to court documents, the 37-year-old told undercover operatives it was best if he didn't know anything about the sale of narcotics.\n\"I didn't hear that,\" Ong explained to one agent. \"So there is one thing I tell people is I don't really care what ... they use the bitcoin for ... it's better that I don't actually know. 'Cause then I can have plausible deniability.\"\n'I get the job done' In addition to the jail sentence, Ong has also agreed to forfeit cash and bitcoin worth more than $1.1 million US.\nAccording to the original complaint, the U.S. department of Homeland Security began investigating Ong in December 2016 after responding to an online advertisement advertising the anonymous buying and selling of bitcoin.\nSuspected bitcoin bandit escapes prison and makes getaway on Icelandic PM's flight After an exchange of text messages, an agent met Ong in a McDonald's parking lot in Tukwila, Wash. to exchange $12,000 US for bitcoin.\nLouis Ong pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money transmission business after he was caught in a sting by federal authorities in the United States. (Twitter) Ong used a money counter to verify the amount and then transmitted bitcoin to a digital wallet using an iPhone. He claimed a fee of 7.3 per cent.\nAgents later followed Ong as he deposited cash to a number of banks.\nAt the next meeting, the same agent asked Ong to trade $50,000 US for a fee of slightly more than nine per cent.\n\"I am charging ... higher than a lot of people, but because ... I get the job done, people come to me,\" he was recorded as saying.\n'Your friends seem to be a bit open' At one point in March 2017, Ong asked an agent who was acting as the 'boss' of the operation if his underlings could stop talking about drugs.\n\"I am not interested in what you buy or sell (bitcoin) for, so please do not mention it or have your friends mention it either,\" he said.\n\"Your friends seem to be a bit open about what you do when there is really no need to be.\"\nAccording to U.S. court documents, Ong transferred crypto-currency to a bitcoin wallet after receiving cash from undercover agents. (Simon Dawson/Bloomberg) After a uniformed agent confronted Ong, he registered with the federal U.S. agency tasked with stopping money laundering.\nBut then he proceeded to make three more transactions with undercover agents in violation of the rules.\nAccording to Ong's sentencing memorandum, he moved to Canada from Singapore with his mother in 1987, graduating from the University of B.C. with a degree in computer science.\nHe is described as an entrepreneur who worked to develop video game software.\nThe U.S. government claims a forensic review of his digital device revealed that he had been involved in the world of bitcoin since at least 2013.\n'He wanted to be his own boss' Ong's friends and family filed a number of glowing letters with the U.S. court.\nOng has been living in Los Angeles with his sister pending the outcome of the charges. He volunteers with a church and a number of charities that help the homeless.\nThe references provide little insight as to how Ong got into bitcoin trading, though one letter from a Vancouver-area doctor describes Ong as a natural entrepreneur.\n\"Louis was forever looking for another (legal and honest) way to make money and he always seemed to have his fingers in several pies. He wanted to be his own boss and did not like the restrictions of a regular, 'nine-to-five' job,\" the letter says.\n\"When Louis called me recently, he explained to me what he had been doing and how in doing so, he had broken a law in the state of Washington.\"\nBought bitcoin in 2017? Here's how cryptocurrency is taxed in Canada Bitcoin farm proposed for former B.C. sawmill site His mother told the court Ong \"is very respectful and remorseful of what happened.\"\nAccording to a news release from the department of Homeland Security, Ong tearfully told the court he realized how his activities had \"facilitated more people being exposed to addictive substances.\"\nIn addition to his jail sentence, Ong was also given three years of supervised release and will likely be unable to return to the U.S. About the Author Jason Proctor\n@proctor_jason\nJason Proctor is a reporter in British Columbia for CBC News and has covered the B.C. courts and mental health issues in the justice system extensively.\nCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices Report Typo or Error", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "louis ong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ong", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "seattle u.s. district court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T18:23:59.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "af7b6f87d658d008b54c5383b28d8c537edbd8e7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTX1fZhnH6w9auiLYdjgyyLSRzuePtQMKO4zMpsBAk.._FakX6btkTGcz8TMV4n5BboJLZlrZc8aON.Ic5kQGSwQdrWhJMrudwpSM_YipdWdw--", "site_full": "talkpropeller.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://talkpropeller.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Talkpropeller's Articles", "title": "“Bitcoin Magazine's Week in Review: Blockchain's Big Gathering” - Adnan Ariffin's Nuzzel Newsletter for Sat, May 19", "title_full": "“Bitcoin Magazine's Week in Review: Blockchain's Big Gathering” - Adnan Ariffin's Nuzzel Newsletter for Sat, May 19", "published": "2018-05-19T22:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "af7b6f87d658d008b54c5383b28d8c537edbd8e7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTX1fZhnH6w9auiLYdjgyyLSRzuePtQMKO4zMpsBAk.._FakX6btkTGcz8TMV4n5BboJLZlrZc8aON.Ic5kQGSwQdrWhJMrudwpSM_YipdWdw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Adnan Ariffin (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-19T22:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "“Bitcoin Magazine's Week in Review: Blockchain's Big Gathering” - Adnan Ariffin's Nuzzel Newsletter for Sat, May 19", "text": "Adnan Ariffin's Newsletter Sat, May 19 View this issue in your browser Reply to this email to give Adnan feedback on this newsletter!

Instead of the player making few but large bets, a bot makes many many smaller bets, so for the same wagered amount, a bot is likely to be much closer to the expected value.\nI used this factual Quote: to demonstrate the point that making more small bets will converge the result towards the expected value more than using fewer larger bets.\nQuote: from: broke_tradah on May 19, 2018, 01:39:46 PM I gain nothing from people losing.\nCorrect, you gain from rollover. The longer it takes them to lose the more commission you get. That's why your system uses a high stake and low profit target with many small bets. That is to maximise your return despite it diminishing their chances of winning.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T17:43:12.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "02a52b6a38653270d82118d5609ef0c5dd9a9454", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScP1WpxThAb45RQr7LWKpC4eFqDTNvAcsYJdU7IkGFe6wd7yduQlHDoZMqN8BfplKEB8cS86VTal", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin Network Status Update Saturday, May 19, 2018", "title_full": "Bitcoin Network Status Update Saturday, May 19, 2018", "published": "2018-05-19T21:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "02a52b6a38653270d82118d5609ef0c5dd9a9454", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScP1WpxThAb45RQr7LWKpC4eFqDTNvAcsYJdU7IkGFe6wd7yduQlHDoZMqN8BfplKEB8cS86VTal", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-19T21:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Network Status Update Saturday, May 19, 2018", "text": "Bitcoin Network Status Update Saturday, May 19, 2018\n/u/crypto_bot\nStatus of the Bitcoin network as of Saturday, May 19, 2018 at 12:00:02 EST: Total bitcoins: 17,042,652.295296\nHeight: 523,418\nDifficulty: 4,143,878,474,754.187988\nStatistics for the past 24 hours: Number of blocks mined: 161\nTotal bitcoins output (amount sent): 801,198.744084\nTotal fees: 37.446555\nAverage time until block found: 8 minutes, 56 seconds\nEstimated hashrate: 33,164,923,906.604836 gh/s\nCurrent price: US$8,318.45\nData provided by Smartbit.com.au .

The company has so far allowed lending and borrowing of loans in Bitcoin.\nThe company is now using Bitcoin to facilitate international transfer of fiat loans as well, Reuters reports .\nThe loaned amount will be transferred to the borrower using the Bitcoin’s blockchain, only to be converted back to their country’s currency as soon as the transaction is processed.\nUsing Bitcoin to transfer the loans will purportedly make the transfer of loan quicker and cheaper in comparison to the existing transfer means.\nCurrently, most of the world’s banking institutions rely on the SWIFT network to facilitate international transactions, but that comes with several shortcomings.\nUsers end up paying several fees for each transaction they make through the network. These include transaction fees levied by the correspondent and recipient banks, and currency exchange rates charged by the banks.\nIt is also worth noting that SWIFT doesn’t actually enable the transfer of money, but only allows secure communication about payment orders between the banks.\nAt the time of its launch, SWIFT had revolutionized international transactions with its Bank Identified Codes (BICs), now popularly called ‘SWIFT codes’, which made transactions a lot securer and faster.\nWith blockchain technology, there’s a promise to make this process further efficient.\nIn fact, the Ripple Transaction Protocol associated with the world’s third largest cryptocurrency Ripple, was developed as a blockchain-based alternative to SWIFT — however researchers have cast doubts on the long-term efficacy of its protocol.\nTransactions with cryptocurrencies can be made in a manner of seconds without huge transaction fees involved. There’s only one intermediary that needs to be paid, which are the miners confirming the transaction.\nBitbond’s development of a marketplace that relies on Bitcoin to transfer loans in fiat is interesting, but even Bitcoin currently suffers from high transaction fees and longer time span for processing the transactions.\nThe successful implementation of Lightening Network can change this, or other cryptocurrencies can be explored as a means for facilitating the transactions.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://thenextweb.com/topic/bitcoin/", "https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/04/21/lightning-network-can-real-improvement-bitcoin-matures/", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-bitcoin/german-online-bank-uses-bitcoins-to-transfer-loans-idUSKBN1ID07Y", "https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/05/14/german-bank-using-bitcoin-international-fiat-loans/", "https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/01/22/bitcoin-fast-transactions-low-fees/", "https://cryptorecorder.com/2018/03/15/is-this-a-ploy-to-support-the-centralized-ripple-xrp/s"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitbond", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitbond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T22:10:39.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c16df866d634653e08e673927dd23d6deac6b3b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ46SQ1LfzKTkgniTLz.d6sSLA--", "site_full": "programadores.esforos.com", "site": "esforos.com", "site_section": "http://programadores.esforos.com/./viewforum.php?f=34", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Delphi - PROGRAMADORES", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Bitcoin-crans", "title_full": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Bitcoin-crans - PROGRAMADORES", "published": "2018-05-19T21:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c16df866d634653e08e673927dd23d6deac6b3b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKyOO8CflTnTcqZR9RYwLBcA82rkTaVBl5UtwQqspgrwkPF1upjQQJ46SQ1LfzKTkgniTLz.d6sSLA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JanetFub", "published": "2018-05-19T21:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Bitcoin-crans", "text": " soft for SEO/SMM\n can bypass\nXEvil 4.0 bypass ANY captchas, included Google ReCaptcha2 , Google ReCaptcha2 defeated: new program \"XEvil 4.0\" did that , XEvil + XRumer: NEW solving ReCaptcha app :) , How to hack Recaptcha-2\nBEST anti-ReCaptcha softwaresupport rucaptcha com , XEvil 4.0 + any SEO/SMM software = PROFIT!

It boasted an attendance three times more than its previous iteration and is a testament to the growing mainstream interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain. Therefore, Thomas Lee predicted a bump in price over the last week. This did not come to be.\nLee took to Twitter to mention what he thought were the reasons that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies did not gain price over the past week. He said that it was a “week of generally positive news for crypto”, including various institutional adopters and infrastructure developments that came to be during the conference.\nThe uptick seen in the aftermath of the 2017 conference was not seen, as Bitcoin had a 1.35x growth between 20th May and 25th May 2017. It grew from around $2000 to a high of $2700 before correcting to around $2500. This year, Bitcoin was facing a bearish market before Consensus and did not recover but stayed at around the $8200 mark over the week.\nLee said that cryptocurrencies were, and have been suffering from an “overhang of regulatory risk” and a hostile reception from financial institutions. The opportunity was offered at the conference to strengthen the community’s conviction. He said:\n“Conferences are chances for the community to gather in a centralized place and meet constituents new to the community, it seems natural that the combination of “sanity check” plus “new interest” should strengthen the crypto-community’s conviction.”\nHe gave the reasons for the rally not happening as the “Consensus sell-off”. Even major announcements were made on the front of institutional investors, with Nomura working with Ledger and Global advisors to provide a crypto-custodian bank service.\nLee predicts that a conclusion must be reached on a regulatory framework, from institutional regulatory parties like the SEC, and that a cultural buy-in must occur by the institutions themselves. The “Blockchain: good, crypto: bad” mentality must be broken to allow for a rally in price.\nHe mentioned that multiple institutional service providers and institutional custody solutions were released, which indicated progress. However, he said:\n“It is obvious that crypto still faces significant internal resistance and hurdles within traditional financial institutions. In our many conversations with institutional investors/banks, we find that specific teams may be enthusiastically committed, but widespread internal acceptance of crypto/blockchain faces hurdles”\nHe also mentioned that it was encouraging that a large share of the incremental addition to attendance were financial institutions.\nZcash [ZEC] was the major rallying crypto this week as stated by Lee, due to its addition on the Gemini trading platform operated by the Winklevoss twins. Consensus was a great growth for the community.\nLee said that even though Bitcoin has been stated as being boring, and that many offices are looking for the “next bitcoin”, it will be one of the two primary onramps for major institutional trading along with Ethereum. Even as a currency, through payments, it is seeing growth through companies like BitPay and Square.\nLee gave a bottom line on the conference, saying:\n“While there was not a Consensus bump, our conviction on cryptocurrencies strengthened during the conference.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T22:58:28.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ec5ceeb11036007e0f00d49041e7ba3e462deac3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdCLQWDzEggT39Rl39VRkas-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Government and Bitcoin", "title_full": "Government and Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-19T21:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.014, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ec5ceeb11036007e0f00d49041e7ba3e462deac3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdCLQWDzEggT39Rl39VRkas-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jakirdj95", "published": "2018-05-19T21:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Government and Bitcoin", "text": "When you have a network system that is holding a potential replacement for the current financial system or in any financial way it will grip one day and threaten your control, will you believe it in the first place?The government can not control or touch Bitcoin if its decentralized money, but any government will always be suspicious of Bitcoin.

By some estimates, bitcoin’s consumption alone exceeds -- or will exceed -- that of Ireland, Denmark, Japan or even the entire world....\n\"Digital currency is wasteful by design. Bitcoin 'miners,' who process transactions in return for new currency, must race to solve extremely difficult cryptographic puzzles. This computational burden helps keep the transaction record secure -- by raising the bar for anyone who would want to tamper with it –- but also requires miners to build giant farms of servers that consume vast amounts of energy. The more valuable bitcoin becomes, the more miners are willing to spend on equipment and electricity.\n\"Still, it’s important to put things in perspective. A recent report suggests that at current prices, Bitcoin miners will consume an estimated 8.27 terawatt-hours per year. That might sound like a lot, but it’s actually less than an eighth of what U.S. data centers use.... It also compares favorably to the currencies and commodities that bitcoin could help replace: Global production of cash and coins consumes an estimated 11 terawatt-hours per year, while gold mining burns the equivalent of 132 terawatt-hours. And that doesn’t include armored trucks, bank vaults, security systems and such....\n\"What’s more, bitcoin’s consumption won’t necessarily keep rising as it has. Data centers, for example, have gotten a lot better. Not long ago, the Department of Energy was predicting that their electricity use would double every five years, and Google was getting slammed for consuming enough to power 200,0000 homes. In recent years, though, the centers’ total electricity use has flattened even as their number has kept growing ... better cooling and power management technology improved efficiency. Bitcoin miners are no less motivated by profit, so it stands to reason that they will seek to become more efficient....\n\"It’s easy to criticize bitcoin for being wasteful. But so are many things in life, including airplanes, commuting to work and Sunday Night Football. A return to subsistence farming could drastically reduce our carbon footprint, but sometimes using energy to improve our quality of life is worthwhile.\n\"The bitcoin network has the potential to generate a lot of benefits. How much is sound money worth? How about the ability to send money freely across borders, with no permission or central counterparty involved? Or to own an asset that can’t be seized? People in the U.S. and other developed countries might take these things for granted, but people in places like Zimbabwe and Venezuela are turning to bitcoin for survival. So perhaps all those computations aren’t wasteful: Maybe the miners are simply transforming the energy into something more valuable.\" Read more: https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-12-07/bitcoin-is-greener-than-its-critics-think\n'via Blog this' ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "elaine ou", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denmark", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T00:36:21.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7ab15317698f0f07ec9628d2d9d1b0aefc2c0cfa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme0VjrLEbFxylUqvJnn31sI-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Is bitcoin future assets ?", "title_full": "Is bitcoin future assets ?", "published": "2018-05-19T21:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.015, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7ab15317698f0f07ec9628d2d9d1b0aefc2c0cfa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme0VjrLEbFxylUqvJnn31sI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Cutieh01", "published": "2018-05-19T21:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is bitcoin future assets ?", "text": "Quote: from: bitcoinrunners001 on Today at 01:06:40 PM Bitcoin price has always been increasing and many peoples buying it.Biitcoin is an asset and a good investment.Bitcoin is something that has a big role now in our society.The fact that bitcoin are one of the stable cryptocurrrencies and more digital currencies that depend on it it is really a future assets that would give huge opportunities toits holders and users in the future.There are lot bitcoin holders who buys and hold their bitcoin and wait until its value increases again.\nPeople now are slowly adopt the crypto as their daily exchange medium.

There are loads of different places that will accept payments in Bitcoin. These range from peer-to-peer markets right through to established retailers. There are even companies that allow you to buy gift cards with cryptocurrency that can then be exchanged for goods at online shops that don’t currently accept Bitcoin. The list of things that one can buy with BTC is getting bigger every day. Not bad for an experiment in decentralization and cryptography that completely opposes the status quo of global finance! What Pushes Bitcoin forward? A little more than five years ago, no one would have believed that the obscure new form of money could ever rival traditional currency. It may well be that even the creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, wouldn’t have expected Bitcoin could be recognized globally and the Bitcoin price could go through the roof. Attitudes to cryptocurrency have changed since then, and now Bitcoin is no longer a new kid on the block. It is a sought-after asset that can be well used either as a lucrative investment or a legal means of payment. So, what turned the tables on Bitcoin? Media hype The mainstream media has always been a powerful tool for promoting awareness of new releases and developments. Bitcoin was no exception. Yet another hack, the rise and fall of the market, government ban — any cryptocurrency-related news was largely covered by press. This hype has led to better Bitcoin recognition and acceptance among the public. At present, the cryptocurrency market review or analysis is a must-have headline for any type of the media. Thought leaders’ support People tend to follow the key players. When the world’s most respected leaders like Bill Gates , Steve Wozniak , Richard Branson endorse Bitcoin or the technology behind it and even invest in cryptocurrency, it won’t go unnoticed by general public. This fuels positive sentiment towards the industry and serves as a trigger for buying a couple of coins to further benefit from the price rises or just take a hand in the new technological revolution. Government tolerance Government regulation is another tool that helps shape public opinion. So far there are only a few nations that oppose Bitcoin vigorously. Most governments are working on the ways to fit cryptocurrencies into the regulatory framework, but not to wipe them off. A striking case in point is Japan. Once the Financial Services Agency recognized cryptocurrency as a legal means of payment for goods and services in 2017, the price of Bitcoin surged and so did the investors’ confidence. This kind of public and political backing has contributed to wider acceptance of Bitcoin among businesses as well. Below, we’ve listed just some of the many ways that people can spend their cryptocurrency. Let’s take a look. Bitcoin: Accepted Here Retailers. There’s a growing list of online retailers that take payments directly in Bitcoin. Loads of different kinds of merchants are opening to the idea of accepting the cryptocurrency. Some of the more prominent examples are the online dating website OKCupid, the gentleman’s lifestyle magazine Playboy, computing behemoth Microsoft, and homeware sellers OverStock.com. These websites allow their customers to make payments for goods or services directly in cryptocurrency. With the price explosion in 2017, any of them that had started accepting Bitcoin earlier and decided to keep part of the payment in the digital currency were glad of their decision (we’re looking at you OverStock!). Property markets. With the Bitcoin price going parabolic throughout 2017, there’s a lot of new money around the space. Many of these early investors are young millennials who would otherwise struggle to get on the property ladder. Fortunately for them, there are a growing number of examples of sellers accepting payment for real estate using Bitcoin. There are websites like Bitcoin Real Estate or brokers like Canter Companies that offer high-end property in exchange for BTC. Cryptocurrency payments for real estate are proving so popular that more agents are starting to specialise in facilitating the process. Andrew Canter of Canter Companies explained: “We realised there is so much new wealth in the crypto space… There are a lot of new buyers and a lot of people that have seen their wealth fluctuate over the last year.” Peer-to-Peer Markets. If you love the idea of eBay but wish you could pay directly with crypto, platforms like OpenBazaar are ideal. Users can sell their unwanted items, their home-made goods, various seeds, and collectibles of all kinds on the platform. OpenBazaar doesn’t have nearly as strict a policy on what users can and can’t sell as eBay. You can pretty much use it to shift anything (and therefore buy anything) you like! Strippers. So, after you’ve bought your mansion via Bitcoin Real Estate, furnished it at OverStock, and failed to find love at OKCupid, what else is there to spend your Bitcoin on? The first examples of strippers accepting payments in cryptocurrencies were reported earlier this year. The dancers wear QR codes that visitors could scan and tip them directly using their mobile phones. According to reports, the idea proved so popular that cryptocurrency ATMs in Sin City were constantly full! The D Casino houses one such machine. Their owner highlighted their success in Vegas: “The damn machine was getting full! And it holds $80,000 worth and it’s getting full every couple of days.” These are just some of the things that highlight a growing acceptance of Bitcoin around the world. However, there are many concerns regarding both Bitcoin’s inherent functionality and regulation that still keep the currency from mainstream adoption. Once the solutions are offered and improvements are made, Bitcoin will be here to stay not only as an investment asset, but as a generally valid method of payment. Hopefully, this time next year the list of Bitcoin-friendly merchants will be even longer too.

After performing this technical analysis, he concluded that Bitcoin’s strongest support is around the $7,100 level.\nIn spite of this analyst consensus that the digital currency has been building up strength at the aforementioned price levels, one market observer seemed more sceptical.\n“There might be some support at $8000 but any price level can be broken,” said cryptocurrency investor Marius Rupsys.\nAs a result, he advocated a cautious approach. “I would sit on sidelines to see where the price goes next,” concluded Rupsys.

There was free beer served from an ID-validating dispenser, Warren Buffet was criticized for his “rat poison” view of cryptocurrency, and there were plenty of business announcements, including news from eToro, Netki, Bitmain and Circle. Catch up on these stories and more in this week’s Bitcoin Magazine review.\nFeatured stories by Amy Castor, Colin Harper and Kyle Torpey\nStay on top of the best stories in the bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. Subscribe to our newsletter here .\nFred Wilson Explains Why Warren Buffett Doesn’t Get Bitcoin In his 2018 annual shareholder meeting at Berkshire Hathaway recently, Warren Buffet referred to bitcoin as “rat poison.” Venture capitalists Fred Wilson and Balaji Srinivasan had a chat with Wall Street Journal reporter Paul Vigna on the mainstage of Consensus 2018. The pair of tech investors pointed out the differences between Buffett’s approach to investing and how the crypto asset market works.\nCivic Demos Proof of Concept With Beer Vending Machines, Launches ID Codes Blockchain identity verification platform Civic has emerged from Consensus 2018 with a project that imagines a network of validators and service providers who work together to verify individual identities. Conceptually, new users would put identity information on a smart contract that would get validated with references on the blockchain that attest to its validity. Then service providers can request to validate said information, which would streamline ID checks and help prevent against fraud.\nCivic showed a working proof of concept using their Civic app. Anyone verified on the platform can scan a QR code to prove that they’re of legal drinking age. In a partnership with Anheuser-Busch, Civic unveiled the vending machine at Consensus 2018, offering anyone who used it a free brew from the “world’s first crypto beer vending machine.”\nDigital Identity Company Netki Launches Investor Validation Solution Los Angeles based Netki just made it easier for companies launching token sales to onboard their customers in a way that supports compliance with existing security laws, using their digital identity confirmation platform. The company is adding investor validation to its existing know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) solution. The service allows investors to upload requisite documents via a web browser or mobile app. Compliance is a huge concern for ICO projects right now. Regulators are in the midst of trying to decide how to label virtual currencies, and it is looking as if they may rule that many existing tokens are non-compliant securities.\nSocial Cryptocurrency Trading and Brokerage Firm eToro Is Expanding to U.S. eToro is a regulated global brokerage firm located in Israel that trades in cryptocurrencies, stocks, commodities, ETFs and more. Having recently received $100 million in funding, the company is currently in talks with U.S. financial institutions, regulators and regulatory advisors, and has already registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The company is opening an office in New Jersey and plans launch a crypto wallet later this year.\nBitmain Leads Circle’s $110 Million Round; Teams Up to Create Stable Coin Bitmain continues to make news. The largest of the Bitcoin mining operations is putting its muscle behind mobile payments and cryptocurrency trading firm Circle by leading a $110 million Series E round of funding, the companies announced at Consensus this week.\nThey are also joining forces to create a “stablecoin,” a cryptocurrency that is pegged to a stable asset. The goal is to eventually have lots of stable tokens, all backed by different fiat currencies, managed by CENTRE, but the first will be Circle USD Coin (USDC), a coin backed one-to-one by the U.S. dollar with the fiat to be stored in an auditable bank account and redeemable by verified buyers.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://netki.com/", "https://blog.circle.com/2018/05/15/circle-announces-usd-coin-bitmain-partnership-and-new-strategic-financing/&quot;", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/digital-identity-company-netki-launches-investor-validation-solution/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/social-cryptocurrency-trading-and-brokerage-firm-etoro-expanding-us/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitmain-leads-circles-100-million-round-teams-create-stable-coin/", "https://blog.circle.com/2018/05/15/circle-announces-usd-coin-bitmain-partnership-and-new-strategic-financing/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/digital-identity-company-netki-launches-investor-validation-solution/&quot;", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/civic-demos-proof-concept-beer-vending-machines-launches-id-codes/", "https://www.civic.com/&quot;", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/social-cryptocurrency-trading-and-brokerage-firm-etoro-expanding-us/&quot;", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/subscribe/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/fred-wilson-explains-why-warren-buffett-doesnt-get-bitcoin/&quot;", "https://www.civic.com/", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UtsIhie0aPts27dQdDrpUA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/bitcoin_magazine_673/ce51c06206094148c3fb89b938be394f);", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/civic-demos-proof-concept-beer-vending-machines-launches-id-codes/&quot;", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitmain-leads-circles-100-million-round-teams-create-stable-coin/&quot;", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/subscribe/&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UtsIhie0aPts27dQdDrpUA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/bitcoin_magazine_673/ce51c06206094148c3fb89b938be394f", "https://netki.com/&quot;", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/fred-wilson-explains-why-warren-buffett-doesnt-get-bitcoin/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "warren buffet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "balaji srinivasan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy castor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colin harper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyle torpey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul vigna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "big gathering week", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "blockchain week", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine’s week", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T16:39:42.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "237f938c9d770af6e0d1e6d3cba39e00830c9519", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va7_TMEC7XtYD368NC3w0anJA.pL0B3s0N5SIv1YM35HY52lxWOofqXNSmNp7rYB7kw8A7w8qvjk2..WJXD2IcwWGx2jKAhkf1..uNvPrsmP8Yd0F3X7pZvYE-", "site_full": "bitcoin.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions -

The controversial hard fork of bitcoin hard forked again several days ago in an effort to add new functionality to the cryptocurrency protocol and further differentiate it from its predecessor.\nBut in the process – executing at block 530350 – a portion of the bitcoin cash community was left behind. At the time of writing, between 16 percent and 17 percent of bitcoin cash nodes are running old software and because of the way upgrading by hard fork works (whereby changes are not backwards compatible), those nodes are now running on a completely separate network.\nAs such, if any user running one of those nodes were to make a transaction, the new, larger bitcoin cash network would not recognize it. Critics of bitcoin cash argue it’s a bad sign that so many nodes haven’t upgraded, since those users are now completely cut off from the rest of the network.\nSome have even gone as far as to argue the quietness around the hard fork as a sign that relatively few people care about bitcoin cash. If more people cared, they contend, the changes would see more debate, because people would be worried about the implications, Bitcoin Core contributor Kalle Alm argued on social media.\n“You can tell bitcoin cash is not bitcoin by looking at how not everyone is losing their shit all over the place,” he said, adding: But proponents of the network disagree. “That’s a rather meaningless statistic.

In a strange juxtaposition, her successful tenure at JPMorgan coincided with CEO Jamie Dimon’s bitcoin bashing.\nClovyr is composed of a suite of tools for blockchain applications and services for development teams to deploy products to the cloud or on-site production environments.\nBuilt around an ecosystem philosophy, Clovyr touts a GUI dashboard for users to interact with its product suite. As a means of avoiding vendor lock-in, the company also touts flexibility with hosting, whether that’s staying with Clovyr or using public or private cloud deployments.\nBaldet hopes to capitalize on increased enterprise-level interest in blockchain applications with her new startup. At the same time, she admits that enterprises’ concerns are valid and that blockchain is not “some privacy panacea,” she wrote in a tweet on April 23.\nThe suite that Clovyr provides seeks to assuage fears with tools that lower the barrier to entry for development teams. The service relies heavily on open-source tools built for the Ethereum blockchain, such as Parity and Geth. Source: Clovyr\nIn an interview with Fortune, she compared enterprise’s reluctance toward blockchain technology to the private vs. public cloud debate.\n“When public cloud started to be a thing, a lot of businesses said, Oh, cloud, it’s a great idea architecturally, but we’re going to go ahead and build our own private cloud internally because it’s safer and we know what we need,” Baldet says. “Now they’re spending millions of dollars to undo a lot of that work in an attempt to migrate to the public clouds that have evolved to the point where they are secure and robust and connected.”\nWith extensive experience in JPMorgan and the traditional finance sector overall, Baldet has expert knowledge for opening up the blockchain for enterprise.\nAlongsidecCo-founder and CTO Patrick Nielson, also a former J.P. Morgan engineer, Baldet is seeking to grow the team.\nBaldet’s Twitter account has an impressive following of over 37k. She has become a leader for diversity in blockchain technology, and her startup continues this tradition.\nAs CCN reported, the gender gap has drawn criticism, as women represent between only 4% and 6% of blockchain investors. She is a firm believer that a diverse range of perspectives serves to improve blockchain applications. She has spoken at SXSW, the MIT Media lab, and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.\nFeatured image from YouTube", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

For example, the phrase “neat rat”, used to describe Bitcoin in an interview with CNBC last Saturday.\nThis was certainly enough to curb the recent rally of the digital currency to the level of $ 10,000 and send it in the opposite direction – over $ 9,000. Other encryption followed.\nWhile it is difficult for anyone to challenge Buffett, some crippled experts believe he is wrong in evaluating Bitcoin. Darren Marble, Managing Director of CrowdfundX, is one of them. “Although Warren Buffet has been well aware of many investments, it is completely wrong for Bitcoin because he has no idea of ​​technology,” Marble said. “How can someone who does not use e-mail evaluate Bitcoin? Can not.”\nMarble relies on Bitcoin’s strong performance over Berkshire Hathaway over the last three years. “For history, if you had invested in Berkshire Hathaway shares three years ago, you would make a 30% profit, and if you had invested in Bitcoin three years ago, you would have done literally 100 times better.”\nMarble continues with a tough prediction. “In a few years now, when dust is settled, the failure of Warren Buffett for Bitcoin will be the biggest failure of his career that will make his failures for Amazon and Google seem to be bearable.”\nDaniel Rice, Sagewise’s technology chief, is another cryptosancialist who disagrees with Buffett. “We disagree with Warren Buffet that Bitcoin is a zero-sum game,” says Rice. “While it is true that Bitcoin behaves differently from more traditional investments, this is not negative in our view. Traditional investors often forget that bitcoin is actually a technological infrastructure.”\nDaniel Worsley, manager of LocalCoinSwap’s operations, agrees.\n“Bitcoin has boosted innovation in recent years. Revolutionary blockchain technologies have shown that there are alternatives to many industries and assets,” says Worsley. “Money, insurance, contracts, computational power or even voting are now more fair and efficient thanks to Bitcoin and the blockchain.”\n“Warren Buffet has told you in the past that you have to” invest in what you know. This is a tip that we all must definitely follow! “", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin warren

FEATURE May 19, 2018 at 17:05 UTC | Updated May 19, 2018 at 17:06 UTC\nBitcoin cash now has 32 MB blocks and smart contracts.\nThe controversial hard fork of bitcoin hard forked again several days ago in an effort to add new functionality to the cryptocurrency protocol and further differentiate it from its predecessor. But in the process - executing at block 530350 - a portion of the bitcoin cash community was left behind.\nAt the time of writing, between 16 percent and 17 percent of bitcoin cash nodes are running old software and because of the way upgrading by hard fork works (whereby changes are not backwards compatible), those nodes are now running on a completely separate network. As such, if any user running one of those nodes were to make a transaction, the new, larger bitcoin cash network would not recognize it.\nCritics of bitcoin cash argue it's a bad sign that so many nodes haven't upgraded, since those users are now completely cut off from the rest of the network.\nSome have even gone as far as to argue the quietness around the hard fork as a sign that relatively few people care about bitcoin cash. If more people cared, they contend, the changes would see more debate, because people would be worried about the implications, Bitcoin Core contributor Kalle Alm argued on social media .\n\"You can tell bitcoin cash is not bitcoin by looking at how not everyone is losing their shit all over the place,\" he said, adding:\n\"Imagine if 20 percent of bitcoin nodes failed consensus? Everyone would explode.\"\nBut proponents of the network disagree.\n\"That's a rather meaningless statistic.

A popular fork\nPacia pushed back on the idea the calm surrounding the hard fork means anything but that users were happy with the upgrade.\nDespite a portion of users not yet upgrading their systems to go along with it, Pacia said, all miners have upgraded. And sure enough, leading up to the fork, social media comments among bitcoin cash advocates were overwhelmingly in favor of the changes.\n\"The network update has the full support of the community, with bitcoin cash aiming to compete with the [lightning] network of bitcoin,\" said Matthew Newton, an analyst at crypto investment platform eToro, in a statement.\nThe statement continued:\n\"Increasing the block size and allowing smart contracts to be built is seen as an important step in its quest to become the dominant cryptocurrency.\"\nThe new features look like they're working properly so far.\nPacia was one of the first to use OP_CAT, one of the so-called smart contracts added to the protocol through the hard fork.\nAnd other projects got a boost from the new features too. For instance, because of the bigger block size, users can now write longer messages on the bitcoin cash social media site Memo.cash .\n\"If this was a contentious change and those nodes didn't upgrade because they legitimately wanted to stick with the world rules than that could be a problem. But I'm pretty sure that isn't the case here,\" Pacia added. Reckless competition?\nThat said, the hard fork continues to draw mixed reception from the broader cryptocurrency community.\nThe hard fork that led to bitcoin cash was a controversial one and even though the two groups have went their separate ways, there is still arguments over the groups use of language and marketing.\nAlm told CoinDesk he thinks it's \"insane\" that bitcoin cash developers don't care about the node statistic more and \"that goes to show how little [they] care about individual sovereignty.\"\n\"In bitcoin, the nodes are everything. They are the users of the system. To dismiss cutting off a fifth of your users in a hard fork, controversial or not, is reckless, to say the least,\" Alm added.\nAnd further, many critics argue the upgrades in the latest bitcoin cash hard fork don't have good trade-offs for the system as a whole.\nFor example, increasing the block size too much can decrease the likelihood that anyone can run full nodes in the future, since the storage requirements will be more than most household computers generally allow for. This is a particularly contentious point, since many cryptocurrency enthusiasts believe running a full node is the safest and most decentralized way to use the technology.\nStill, bitcoin cash advocates see the effort to continue improving the cryptocurrency as a sign of necessary competition within the space.\n\"What events like these are also making clear, however, is the underlying sense of competition between the bitcoin cash and bitcoin communities,\" Newton said. \"Both are fiercely passionate about these assets and confident that one will emerge as the victor.\"\nHe added:\n\"Ultimately, it remains to be seen how that will play out over the long-term, as both cryptocurrencies continue to develop.\"\nFork image via Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "",

link. Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy. News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system . Do not post your Bitcoin address unless someone explicitly asks you to. Be aware that Twitter, etc. is full of impersonation.

The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor.

One goal is to provide balance to the negative impressions that mainstream media often gives bitcoin.\nEarlier this month, Genesis Mining organized a “Bankers Against Bitcoin” demonstration at the 2018 Consensus blockchain conference in New York City. The protesters, who presented themselves as bankers, carried anti-bitcoin signs to convey the banking industry’s opposition to bitcoin.\nMarco Streng, CEO of Genesis Mining, noted on the Bankers Against Bitcoin website that decentralized technology marks the biggest competition banks have faced and noted that the protest represents what will happen to companies that fail to accept change", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T03:40:30.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ff35659681df66b18800cb2d337a26ffa6100735", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0nzjwg1fwJWYo4ubEIYvw_PpxFuIRfdl2XprfwD.PbujgEMpicLlVsMX2FnfbzElabmLbPEoz.VWXuBoDM_bofbuW2zk.n1YmHshzMshmgOnfueb14zP7APiyEeJSxvle2Ykfi9skIdOKFNH05M0u", "site_full": "canadianeasymoving.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://canadianeasymoving.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Unlicensed B.C. bitcoin trader jailed in U.S. after federal sting – canadianeasymoving", "title": "Unlicensed B.C. bitcoin trader jailed in U.S. after federal sting", "title_full": "Unlicensed B.C. bitcoin trader jailed in U.S. after federal sting", "published": "2018-05-19T19:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ff35659681df66b18800cb2d337a26ffa6100735", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0nzjwg1fwJWYo4ubEIYvw_PpxFuIRfdl2XprfwD.PbujgEMpicLlVsMX2FnfbzElabmLbPEoz.VWXuBoDM_bofbuW2zk.n1YmHshzMshmgOnfueb14zP7APiyEeJSxvle2Ykfi9skIdOKFNH05M0u", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "canadianeasymoving", "published": "2018-05-19T19:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Unlicensed B.C. bitcoin trader jailed in U.S. after federal sting", "text": "\nA Vancouver man has been sentenced to 20 days in jail and more than $1 million in forfeitures after making bitcoin trades with federal agents posing as drug dealers.\nOriginal Story: https://ift.tt/2LfTbHu\nfrom Blogger https://ift.tt/2ItNN5H ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T19:40:50.005+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32209, "moreResultsAvailable": 11109, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=21100", "requestsLeft": 451}
