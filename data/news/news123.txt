Bitcoin is still the raging bull that can catch headlines like a wildfire. Believe it or not, it can still make or break lives. The torrent of real-life stories found across the web is a living proof of this. Now, if you think that it’s too late to join the Bitcoin bandwagon, let us be the messenger of good news for you.

So, how to get free Bitcoins to be a part of the thrilling journey? Is there a legit free Bitcoin maker?\n- Frankly speaking, we didn’t believe that there could be a free Bitcoin maker until a couple of months back. By this time, we had already tried dozens and dozens of free Bitcoin tools with no success. It always felt that we were moving few steps backward instead of moving ahead. Trust us; our Bitcoin generator find is very rare. For us, it was like finding a needle in the haystack. We finally found a free Bitcoin generator that did the trick for us. Of course, we didn’t get Bitcoin rich or anything, but we received plenty. So, we won’t bitch about this cool, productive, and free Bitcoin generator tool.\n- For the curious minds out there, the free Bitcoin generator online tool works without any strings attached to it. You don’t need to download any software. Also, we found it to be virus-free and bug-free. By closest to correct estimates, the generator is formed to help everyone enjoy the power of Bitcoin. Of course, it’s not advisable to choose a large Bitcoin amount while using the Bitcoin generator online tool because we have noticed that it causes the tool to lag.

So, it pays to be smart over here and not greedy to make the most of the free Bitcoin generator tool.\nVideo :", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://freebtcgenerator.net/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T18:11:12.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bf3ae61c473fc10e178f1ec86e3a49f2c4d705f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ3.7SIFEgnmzykQtKSaJ5xWDM1r6PbQf3X_NUkv1Fni6RLadtbpsx.Yk3JhKfAYlKdA7gc4x.u6FUp1stiaMIc2NKJsZwQAMmMheKgjnLGSw--", "site_full": "jacckashakash.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://jacckashakash.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "HACKING", "title": "Bitcoin backlash as ‘miners’ stress power grids in Central Washington", "title_full": "Bitcoin backlash as ‘miners’ stress power grids in Central Washington", "published": "2018-05-27T18:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bf3ae61c473fc10e178f1ec86e3a49f2c4d705f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ3.7SIFEgnmzykQtKSaJ5xWDM1r6PbQf3X_NUkv1Fni6RLadtbpsx.Yk3JhKfAYlKdA7gc4x.u6FUp1stiaMIc2NKJsZwQAMmMheKgjnLGSw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JAcckash Akash (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-27T18:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin backlash as ‘miners’ stress power grids in Central Washington", "text": "Comments\nfrom Hacker News https://ift.tt/2IT3tvp\nvia", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T18:43:02.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a311b42177ad4ec034f282e42f89d5a99614bd9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKKyIkA2j5ihptshYbBylWWZgmtcD9llfxZHiDXCIA9mzobrDlFffqWwGfo.shfrKk", "site_full": "www.freelancer.com", "site": "freelancer.com", "site_section": "http://www.freelancer.com/rss/affiliatejob_searching1_NET.xml", "site_categories": ["job_search", "hobbies_and_interests", "jobs", "freelance_writing"], "section_title": "Freelancer - New Projects", "title": "I need someone to make me my own bitcoin wallet software", "title_full": "I need someone to make me my own bitcoin wallet software", "published": "2018-05-27T18:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.f-cdn.com/assets/img/facebook/default-04d56222.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1547, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8a311b42177ad4ec034f282e42f89d5a99614bd9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKKyIkA2j5ihptshYbBylWWZgmtcD9llfxZHiDXCIA9mzobrDlFffqWwGfo.shfrKk", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-27T18:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "I need someone to make me my own bitcoin wallet software", "text": "I need someone to make me my own bitcoin wallet software\nfor windows, the name of the software is to be called bitcoin standard, Offer to work on this job now!

Who thinks what?\nas the title of your thread, you'll buy bitcoin when the price is $1500. I think that is unlikely to happen bitcoin wont fall that low. The lowest possible I think will be around $5900-$6500 if bitcoin falls in that range then for sure I'll buy many.\nMy understanding on the title of this topic is that, he is willing to invest $1500 on bitcoin and he is asking for some opinion on what price to enter in the market. Well, the question is quiet hard for me since the market is unpredictable but I think $6k level is a good entry point and in short time this market will recover and you can have now the profit.

There is a key declining channel forming with resistance at $7,600 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair has to stay above the $7,200 and $7,000 support levels to avoid a major downside break. Bitcoin price is trading well below the $7,600 pivot level against the US Dollar. If BTC/USD breaks the $7,000-7,200 support, there could be heavy declines. Bitcoin Price Decline This past week, there were heavy losses from the $8,500 swing high in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The price declined sharply and broke two important support levels at $8,150 and $7,900. The decline was such that the price even broke the $7,600 pivot level. It traded close to the $7,000 level and found support near $7,200. A low was formed at $7,220 before the price started consolidating in a range. It traded a few points above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $8,606 high to $7,220 low. However, buyers failed to gain momentum above the $7,600 pivot level. Therefore, the price is in a downtrend below $7,600. More importantly, there is a key declining channel forming with resistance at $7,600 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. A break above the channel resistance and $7,650 is needed for an upside push. Above $7,650, the next hurdle for buyers sits around the $7,950 and $8,000 levels.\nLooking at the chart, the price is struggling to recover above $7,600. On the downside, there is a crucial support at $7,200. A break below the stated support at $7,200 could open the doors for more declines below the $7,000 level. Looking at the technical indicators: 4-hours MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is struggling to gain pace in the bullish zone. 4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently just above the 30 level.

Some see them simply as new investments and payment methods, while others worry they provide potential vehicles for illegal activities, from money laundering to drug-dealing.\nIt’s a debate that matters for the sprawling U.S. national security apparatus, which has to keep track of more than 4 million people with some form of security clearance. That includes workers who, at least in theory, could sell secrets to America’s enemies with the aid of anonymous transactions facilitated by cryptocurrencies.\nTerrorists and cybercriminals use cryptocurrencies to shield their transactions from investigators and often demand payment in bitcoins and other digital assets, according to international law-enforcement groups including the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force and Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre.\nAt the same time, young investors have decamped from the halls of prominent financial institutions for the evolving world of cryptocurrency investing, and entire states have pegged their futures to its popularity. The instrument is going mainstream as Goldman Sachs moves forward with bitcoin trading operations.\nNevertheless, bitcoin has fallen about 50 percent from its December high to about $8,200 as regulators around the world continue to evaluate how to manage digital assets and some Wall Street pros dismiss the market. Warren Buffett, for example, has likened bitcoin to “rat poison squared.”\nIf the U.S. government were to decide that owning cryptocurrencies is a security risk, it could have a “huge negative impact” on the growing market, according to Singh.\nAny move to more closely investigate job applicants who own cryptocurrencies also could hamper the Pentagon’s efforts to expand its operations in cyberspace, a goal that Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis has made a priority.\n“If we’re going to say that if you’ve got a bitcoin or another digital currency account that could be a signal or shoot up a red flag for a security clearance, guess what? Those people aren’t going to sit around waiting to try to on board for a government job,” Greg Touhill, a retired Air Force general who was the first Federal Chief Information Security Officer, said in an interview. “It would grow the backlog considerably, in my view.”\nThe Pentagon has sent conflicting messages about how it’s handling the matter.\nAfter a Defense Security Service employee suggested in an email that bitcoin be considered a foreign currency and reported on the lengthy SF-86 security form filled out by clearance applicants, DSS quickly countered by issuing official guidance saying there is no official Department of Defense guidance, according to ETHNews, an online cryptocurrency news site.\n“There is no current Department of Defense guidance related to the reporting of ownership of cryptocurrencies,” according to a statement posted to the DSS website. “DSS is working with DoD policy offices for further clarification and once such guidance is issued, DSS will ensure the widest dissemination to industry.”\nThe equivocation has been cited by law firms and job search sites. ClearanceJobs.com put it bluntly: “Should you report your bitcoin to your security officer? It depends upon who you ask.”\nThe lack of clear direction from the Pentagon only adds to the headaches already faced by government contractors that need to hire workers with security clearances.\nTheir top priority is overhauling a clearance system with a backlog of more than 700,000 background investigations and billions of dollars in associated costs.\nRaytheon Vice President Jane Chappell told the Senate Intelligence Committee in March that fixing the clearance system should be a priority for the country and that the backlog was hurting “programs that provide critical warfighter capabilities.”\nFor now, it appears the Pentagon needs further information from the country’s financial regulators. Without a clear policy from the Treasury Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission or other agencies, it will be very difficult for the Pentagon to issue guidance, according to Singh.\nIn the U.S., bitcoin isn’t treated as a foreign currency for tax purposes, according to a Treasury Department spokeswoman, but Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network monitors virtual currency exchanges to counter the laundering of money and the financing of terrorists.\nIf the U.S. government were to assess that bitcoin is a form of foreign currency, “such activities could have an impact on a security clearance determination,” Maj. Audricia Harris, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said in a statement.\nThe government should keep in mind that owning cryptocurrencies might not indicate bad intent, said Steve Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists.\n“I don’t know if the government has a clear understanding of what makes a person actually a security risk,” Aftergood said. “Instead, they look at proxy factors like excessive debt, drug use and contact with the criminal justice system, which don’t necessarily translate to risk.”\nBut Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, said the Pentagon is right to scrutinize clearance applicants who own cryptocurrencies, even those who are buying and holding them as investments, known as “HODL’ers.”\n“Since bitcoin’s only real use is to buy drugs, etc., it deserves suspicion,” he said. “As for the HODL’ers, eh, they will pass through the clearance process OK because its clear they are just little speculators. Or outright delusional speculators, in which case, do you really want that type in government?”\nBloomberg’s Saleha Mohsin contributed. article continues below", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jim mattis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "daniel flatley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "param vir singh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "defense", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "carnegie mellon university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "armed services committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defense department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pnc center for financial services innovation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T18:09:12.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "453cff87f8bf899366d8d521c73206bc57f41f38", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYZG7J_puPbWT3PXGZ8jRFY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "This guy has lost 103 Bitcoins", "title_full": "This guy has lost 103 Bitcoins", "published": "2018-05-27T17:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 13, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "453cff87f8bf899366d8d521c73206bc57f41f38", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYZG7J_puPbWT3PXGZ8jRFY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sanjeevgogi", "published": "2018-05-27T17:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "This guy has lost 103 Bitcoins", "text": "Quote: from: Cryptoshops on January 07, 2018, 08:18:07 PM This guy has lost 103 bitcoins he mined back in 2011 and then lost his wallet dat file similar to what I have done but wow this guy must be gutted the amount of money he has lost compared to me\nHis Address 166BuLPWHUjqoqiYp5rGE3B5r5AmqgHpoL Final Balance 103.20832384 BTC\nSo many people have the same problem and I wonder just how much Bitcoin is stuck not being able to be used\nHe says \"I used to mine Bitcoin back in 2011 and I lost my wallet.dat file (through several stupid moves on my part).

After opening the trading day at 55, shares of Northern Bitcoin AG traded in a close range. Northern Bitcoin AG currently has a total float of 2.26 million shares and on average sees 132 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 40 and high of 110. What Makes The German Commerce?\nWith Germany being considered by the World Trade Organization (WTO) as the biggest exporter of goods worldwide, it is no longer surprising why the German Stock Exchange is one of the most important stock exchanges that make or break global commerce. Companies like Northern Bitcoin AG enjoy to be the part of German stock exchange. German Stock Exchange\nThe German Stock Exchange consists of eight stock exchanges located throughout Germany. Northern Bitcoin AG were included in one of its units as well. The biggest component of the German Stock Exchange is the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or the FWB Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse, which is owned and operated by Deutsche Börse in Frankfurt. These companies listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange alone represent 80% of the overall market capitalization in Germany. The second largest component of the German Stock Exchange is the Stuttgart Stock Exchange or the Börse Stuttgart. Most financial companies are listed here.\nOther major components of the German Stock Exchange include the Börse Berlin-Bremen, the BÖAG Börsen AG, and the Hamburg Stock Exchange or the Hamburger Börse.\nThe Börse Berlin-Bremen, which is located in Berlin-Charlottenburg, was established in 2003 from the union of the Berlin Stock Exchange and the Börse Bremen.\nMeanwhile, the BÖAG Börsen AG, which oversees trade in Hamburg and Hanover, was established in 1999 from the union of the Hamburg Stock Exchange and the Hanover Stock Exchange. Benchmark Index\nThe major index on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is the German Stock Index, commonly known as Deutsche Aktien Xchange 30 (DAX 30), which is the benchmark equity market index in the country.\nDAX 30 tracks the top 30 companies in terms of market capitalization listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Consequently, DAX 30 is a vital indicator of the health of the German economy and investor sentiment as well. Many investors are interested in such DAX companies as Northern Bitcoin AG.\nThe companies tracked by DAX 30 are capped at 10% weight in order to meet its provisions. This also prevents index heavyweight that might result from mergers and acquisitions (M&As).\nDAX 30 has two versions: 1) performance index, which is usually quoted; and 2) price index, which is similar to indices quoted in other countries.\nThe index has a base value of 1,000 since December 1987. DAX 30 indices are calculated using XETRA since June 1999. Since 2006, they are being calculated after every second.\nThe movement on DAX 30 is in 0.50 increments. The margin requirement among most brokers is 2% while the minimum trade size is one index.\nDAX 30 had its longest period of glory days around 2003 to 2007. During that time, it had peaked at €8,105.69. However, after the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, DAX 30 had hit €3,580.\nBeing able to fully recover from the repercussions of the turmoil in the earlier decade, DAX 30 had recorded its all-time high in September 2013 at €8,736.\nThe performance index, on the other hand, had hit the 12,000 mark in March 2015. DAX 30 had attained its all-time high a month later at 12,374.73 after reaching an intraday high of 12,390.75. Its all-time low had been posted in November 1974 at 372.30.\nBecause of the world-renowned success of the DAX 30, more and more investors are betting on the German equity market. They pay close attention to Northern Bitcoin AG shares. Existing investors have long been enjoying meaningful returns.

My background is, that I joined cryptocurrencies in late December, after reading and understanding the technogly, which I found as genius and revolutionary. Now, I never really dived too much into the debate of scaling between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, because the social media war and misinformation digusted me. Long story shot: I would like understand what the sentiment was from the beginning of Bitcoin till the moment of the big scale debate and lastly the fork.\nQuestion 1:\nLets assume Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin to be an electronic cash system, decentralized and being on distributed ledger. Adding to this he mentioned in forums, that he could imagine a bigger blocksize than 1mb, if the system begins to congest.\nThen why didnt the Bitcoin Devs made the certain changes to stay as a cash system?\nBecause now the sentiment is that Bitcoin shall be a store of value. Fine. But what that means is that, the really early adopters who accumulated thousands of Bitcoins shall be the new super rich, if Bitcoin will been seen as store of value as the gold inherent.\nWhat is the purpose of keeping it or aiming to make Bitcoin a store of value? Doesnt we have already a highly centralized system of value distrubution in our world, who basically influence the economy and states in any way -The Banks-?\nSo the solution of the Blockstream were. Segwit, which I have to admitt dont understand. It should make transactions faster and cheaper. But what is the point of it, if nobody is using it? The second solution was or is Lightening. Off chain scaling, where you need to pay a certain amount of btc to open a channel. Currently its about 30$. 30$ may not be much for a guy with 10k BTC but poor people with maybe 0.010btc in Uganda wont be able to pay such a large sum, over and over again for new channels.\nThese solutions look not at all to be harmonizing with the idea of a cash system, which should be liquid and not stored.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T13:44:20.048+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4e644ede19b600b9ad4fa4bc2ec4c1b92a6dedaa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcwRJySHfLkD4398JOQfghs-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why bitcoin gone too much deep??", "title_full": "Why bitcoin gone too much deep??", "published": "2018-05-27T17:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.874, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4e644ede19b600b9ad4fa4bc2ec4c1b92a6dedaa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcwRJySHfLkD4398JOQfghs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "poletando", "published": "2018-05-27T17:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why bitcoin gone too much deep??", "text": "Its a constant fluctuation, it goes dow, it goes back up again", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T13:05:53.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4049f676e33ebab51accd2277964bf4c8c73f45a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWf8tMLYZszdEZ1YCoGnpZc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Is Bitcoin Getting Old?", "title_full": "Is Bitcoin Getting Old?", "published": "2018-05-27T17:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.039, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4049f676e33ebab51accd2277964bf4c8c73f45a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWf8tMLYZszdEZ1YCoGnpZc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Saiful Islam777", "published": "2018-05-27T17:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is Bitcoin Getting Old?", "text": "Bitcoin is not old but its use is old.

In the announcement via the Revolut blog, the team was full of praise for both coins and cryptocurrencies in general. The team at Revolut had promised from last year, to add new cryptocurrencies constantly as part of their evolving services to users. XRP and BCH now join Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC) on the wallet.\nThe team had this to say about the addition and cryptocurrencies in general:\n“Last year, we promised to add new Cryptocurrencies to the Revolut app, so say hello to XRP and BCH. We have always believed that the world of Cryptocurrencies should be open and available to everyone, and not reserved for the tech-savvy and digital currency enthusiasts.\nSo, back in December, we launched a product that would allow millions of our customers to instantly buy, hold and sell Cryptocurrencies at the touch of a button. No exchanges. No private keys. No cold storage. Just instant exposure at your fingertips.”\nThe Revolut app is very versatile in that it also provides a pre-paid debit cards (Mastercard and VISA) as well as allowing for the transfer of funds across the globe in a peer to peer manner for all its users. One can send or receive traditional fiat as well as the cryptocurrencies mentioned above with majority of the services on the app being free.\nAlso to note is the availability of a ‘vault’ in the app where you can save or lock up your funds for a specific amount of time via a savings scheme. There is also a tracker for your spending on the app, allowing the Revolut app to enable you to have access to traditional banking services at your fingertips. No more going to the bank or waiting in the mail for your transaction history.\nWith respect to the newly added coins of XRP and BCH, the crypto-markets have shown some stability today with the total crypto market capitalization holding steady at $333 Billion. XRP is trading at $0.611 with BCH trading at $1,027 at the moment of writing this.

In what has been described as the first of its kind operation in the history of the over a century old department, London police have sentenced “Courvoisier” a notorious computer hacker from whom half a million pounds sterling in bitcoin was seized in 2017. Dark Web Vendor Faces Jail Time\nGrant West, a 26-year old resident of the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, has been sentenced to ten years and eight months in jail for criminal activities.\nWest was able to obtain personal data of 165,000 people as well as 63,000 credit and debit cards by sending phishing emails claiming to be an official of Just Eat, an online takeaway delivery firm. The incident cost the company a whopping £200,000 ($266,161) to sort out.\nAccording to Bloomberg , the London Metropolitan police declared that West also hacked computers of large organizations including the British Cardiovascular Society, Sainsbury’s, Asda, a Finnish bitcoin exchange and more.\nThe police also seized a memory card that contained at least 78 million usernames and passwords of West’s victims. Police Committed to Pursuing Offenders on the Dark Web\nAccording to local news source KentOnline , the highly skilled hacker pleaded guilty to a two counts charge of conspiracy to defraud, one charge of computer hacking, four charges of possession and supply of cannabis, two counts of possessing criminal property and one count charge of money laundering bitcoin .\nThe head of the Met’s Organised Crime Command, Detective Chief Superintendent Mick Gallagher, praised all the officers and detectives that made the case successful.\nIn his words:\n“This case illustrates the lengths our detectives will go to in order to pursue offenders on the dark web. We will use many different measures to ensure such offenders are identified, prosecuted and their assets are seized.”\nWest’s former girlfriend, Rachel Brookes, a 26-year old resident of Denbigh, North Wales whose computer the dark web merchant used in carrying out some of the attacks, claimed the unauthorized use of computer material. Brookes was slapped with just two years community order and curfew at a Southwark Crown Court back in March 2018.\nWhile cases of cryptocurrency-related crimes seem to be on a continuous increase, the security operatives have been doing quite a commendable job in apprehending these bad actors.\n“This is the first time we have seized a cryptocurrency. We are determined to remain one step ahead of cyber criminals who believe they can act with impunity,” the police chief declared, adding ” I wish to thank our partners within the MPS and in both public and private industry who all assisted with this investigation which was incredibly complex and lengthy. I am very proud of my team for bringing this offender to justice.” 10 Years Not Enough\nConsidering the enormity of the crime committed, a ten-year sentence for West, a man described as “a one-man cybercrime wave,” doesn’t look like a severe penalty.\nOn April 6, 2018, BTCManager published a story about Gabriele Pearson, a U.K. citizen whose £50,000 ($66,540.25) worth of bitcoin was seized in a “proceeds of crime order” and he was subsequently given a mere 15-month jail term.\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have come to stay, and many more criminals will try using blockchain-based virtual currencies to aid their ugly activities. Therefore it is essential to formulate more stringent penalties for all crypto-related crimes in order to have a crime-free cryptospace.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-25/london-police-seize-bitcoin-worth-667-000-from-hacker", "http://www.kentonline.co.uk/sheerness/news/holiday-park-hacker-jailed-after-police-seize-half-a-million-pounds-in-cyber-currency-183631/", "http://bitcoin.org/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "grant west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cardiov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sheppey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london metropolitan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T23:20:17.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "10dd797ca26f1b396f78d9e9b54dc50a84265e77", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhLu_YUH8yQ4OulsO6fM5yHk-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-27T17:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "10dd797ca26f1b396f78d9e9b54dc50a84265e77", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhLu_YUH8yQ4OulsO6fM5yHk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-27T17:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 27, 2018 WEB GOOD NEWS for Bitcoin Payment Options as it's Becoming More Practical Crypto Core Media Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin (BCH) payment options along with a few other cryptos are becoming a lot more practical due to the efforts of Wirex and ...

There is a key declining channel forming with resistance at $7,600 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair has to stay above the $7,200 and $7,000 support levels to avoid a major downside break.\nBitcoin price is trading well below the $7,600 pivot level against the US Dollar. If BTC/USD breaks the $7,000-7,200 support, there could be heavy declines. Bitcoin Price Decline\nThis past week, there were heavy losses from the $8,500 swing high in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The price declined sharply and broke two important support levels at $8,150 and $7,900. The decline was such that the price even broke the $7,600 pivot level. It traded close to the $7,000 level and found support near $7,200. A low was formed at $7,220 before the price started consolidating in a range.\nIt traded a few points above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $8,606 high to $7,220 low. However, buyers failed to gain momentum above the $7,600 pivot level. Therefore, the price is in a downtrend below $7,600. More importantly, there is a key declining channel forming with resistance at $7,600 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. A break above the channel resistance and $7,650 is needed for an upside push .

One of the bigger upcoming developments is the Lightning Network. Over the past few months, thousands of new payment channels have been established, signalling a major step in the right direction toward mass adoption of this new technology. \\n The Lightning Network Payment Channels \\n\nScaling Bitcoin to offer instant and cheap transactions requires major developments. This code upgrade is known as the Lightning Network . It allows users to open direct payment channels between one another on a global scale. Doing so requires the necessary network participation. Without sufficient support, the Lightning Network will not make any meaningful impact. \\n\nEarlier this year, things did not look all that promising. Just 89 channels existed on January 19th. To some people, it showed how this scaling solution is unfeasible. Others considered it to be a lack of adoption because the technology is still not finished. Instead, it is being tested under open beta rules and caution remains advised at all times. \\n\nFast forward to a few days ago, and the number of channels has grown significantly. As of May 24th, over 6,600 direct connections exist. It is still a drop in the proverbial bucket when looking at the financial sector. However, it also confirms there is genuine interest in this technology. Scaling Bitcoin will remain an ongoing process for some time to come. These numbers may look very different a year from today. \\n Looking Ahead \\n\nEven though this growth is impressive, not everyone is convinced. Until the Lightning Network technology is fully developed, adoption will remain relatively low. Various important aspects still need to be implemented. There is no double-sided funding, no watching for offline transfers, and so forth. \\n\nAll of these issues will – hopefully – be addressed by the developers in the future. Most small and traditional purchases do not necessarily require all of those advanced features. However, the current implementation of the Lightning Network will not necessarily suit everyone. Giving users a lot of different options will remain one of the top priorities. \\n\nAfter nearly nine years of development, it seems things are finally looking up for Bitcoin. Scalability has always been the Achilles heel of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. The Lightning Network may not solve all of the problems in one go. With constant updates and refinements, it will eventually turn into a global payment ecosystem. That is, if enough people embrace this new technology for everyday purposes. \\n Featured image from Shutterstock. \\n\nThe post Rapid Growth of Lightning Network Payment Channels Paints a Bright Future for Bitcoin appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "lightning network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lightning network payment channels", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T09:02:59.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4ddb21e372a98cbcf989ddf960d67a98f1fa21d5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaChNMA4F8pszBOvwTrOvLk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Will banks ever offer bitcoin deposits?", "title_full": "Will banks ever offer bitcoin deposits?", "published": "2018-05-27T17:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4ddb21e372a98cbcf989ddf960d67a98f1fa21d5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaChNMA4F8pszBOvwTrOvLk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "franklin hoses", "published": "2018-05-27T17:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Will banks ever offer bitcoin deposits?", "text": "Well then it would end in the same cycle which it wanted to change the monopoly of banks over currency regulations", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T12:51:16.059+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a10c2392aad8725ede1fb704dc9cd7ecf23a79b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHKL_Yfqqn0.k.RyRyeNQGK7DsmJDUIPN2aJOv2mJ.6NtK0QIJ9SfReLIiJKcj8Mihoi7t8mz0SlBQttzs3AHY1S5jgmtl7lWXc-", "site_full": "wegobusiness.com", "site": "wegobusiness.com", "site_section": "http://wegobusiness.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "WeGoBusiness – Top business stories from around the internet", "title": "Bitcoin – 3 Cryptocurrencies and an ICO with Major Events in June (ETC, EOS, ONT)", "title_full": "Bitcoin – 3 Cryptocurrencies and an ICO with Major Events in June (ETC, EOS, ONT)", "published": "2018-05-27T17:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://wegobusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin-3-Cryptocurrencies-and-an-ICO-with-Major-Events-in-June-ETC-EOS-ONT.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a10c2392aad8725ede1fb704dc9cd7ecf23a79b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHKL_Yfqqn0.k.RyRyeNQGK7DsmJDUIPN2aJOv2mJ.6NtK0QIJ9SfReLIiJKcj8Mihoi7t8mz0SlBQttzs3AHY1S5jgmtl7lWXc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "WeGoBusiness - Digital Business Academy", "published": "2018-05-27T17:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin – 3 Cryptocurrencies and an ICO with Major Events in June (ETC, EOS, ONT)", "text": "Bitcoin – 3 Cryptocurrencies and an ICO with Major Events in June (ETC, EOS, ONT) 27 May 2018 8543 JakeTheCryptoKing · May 27, 2018 · 1:00 pm\nBitcoin and the cryptocurrency space has struggled after the recent Consensus event in NYC failed to boost the price, unlike the past few years. Nevertheless, there are still a few noteworthy events worth keeping an eye on, particularly for some altcoins. The Upcoming Week\nThis week has many exciting deadlines that are rapidly approaching. Two cryptocurrencies that have made exceptional noise while entering the scene have been EOS and ONT. They both have mainnet launches in the next seven days. Mainnet launches are telltale signs regarding the future of the cryptocurrency. Any delays could be absolutely detrimental while a strong showing of timeliness can lead to market support leading to a bull rally. Both ONT and EOS should be a major focus this week as their future could easily be dictated in the coming days.\nHistorically, many cryptocurrencies have timed the release of major news and events to coincide with Consensus, but with such an underwhelming market reaction to the blockchain summit this year, it should be expected that important events will continue to be announced this summer. EOS and ONT announced their mainnet launches months ago. Normally, a cryptocurrency wants to announce news of this magnitude while the markets are strong and bullish, however, ONT and EOS decided to buck the trend and release the mainnet regardless of the condition of the market. A very bold move, and one that shows commitment to their set deadlines.\nThe markets may seem reluctant to trend north but OTC (over the counter transactions) pressure remains very high on the buy side with almost no price movement in BTC.\nHard forks are occurring with Ethereum Classic removing a difficulty bomb on May 29th that should lead to their ability to move forward as a well-respected crypto. There are major differences between different types of forks, with some changing the underlying code (such as this one), while other forks create a new cryptocurrency entirely such as the ANON fork of ZCL. EOS\nEOS has more than doubled its market cap over the past three months, having gone from a market cap of $5 billion to over $11 billion. This is likely caused by the market rebound from February lows coupled with individuals eagerly flocking to a highly publicized cryptocurrency with a mainnet launch. EOS takes horizontal and vertical scaling of blockchain solutions to the next level.\nEOS promises to solve the issues plaguing the Ethereum blockchain each time a dApp becomes too popular. Their mainnet launch this week is the first real challenge in determining if, years from now, they will still be a relevant cryptocurrency. This is the week EOS converts from the ERC-20 platform to their own EOS blockchain. Ontology (ONT)\nOntology’s (ONT) first round of projects are live on GitHub while, like EOS, they have a mainnet launching soon – possibly as early as this week. Ontology is a high-performance blockchain project and a distributed trust collaboration platform. They are able to accomplish this by providing high-performance public blockchains that include a series of complete distributed ledgers and smart contract systems.\nThe ONT blockchain framework supports public blockchain systems and is able to customize different blockchains for different applications. ONT is able to customize blockchains based on the niche the individual is looking to target. ONT had a nice increase in value leading up to their mainnet release. From March 8 th to May 26 th ONT increased more than 350 percent in value.\nThe market remains bullish on cryptos that have upcoming mainnet and testnet releases with ONT and EOS having theirs in the next ten days. Diffusing Ethereum Classic’s Difficulty Bomb\nMay 29th has been the date chosen to handle the difficulty bomb plaguing the ETC system. It is anticipated that the removal of the difficulty bomb via a hard fork will be successful since Ethereum Classic has some of the best development talent behind it. As such, a hard fork of this magnitude should be relatively easy to pull off.\nETC has a market cap of $1.5 billion with a current value of over $15.27. Their ability to handle the hard fork will be very telling regarding the future of ETC. Stay tuned to see how ETC handles their hard fork this week! ICO of the Week: Keplertek\nKeplertek is an ICO worth taking a closer look at this week. They are built on the Ethereum, ERC-20 platform that provides an ecosystem of services through an easy-to-use interface that connects robotics and AI startups with interested investors and allows for full transparency and traceability of their investments.\nThe platform’s native cryptocurrency, the KEP token, will be used for investment on the platform, but also accessible via their platform is the conversion of fiat to KEP. A built-in wallet allows for easy investment into projects while also having access to an explorer to track the KEP once sent.\nKeplertek sounds like an ERC-20 token focusing on the niche of AI and robotics. Their team is where Keplertek really stands out. MIT’s Global Partner, Tech Park Georgia and GITA (Georgian Innovations and Technology Agency), developed the Kepler for startup incubation. Thus far the GITA team has worked with over 150 startups and created a vast network across the globe.\nKeplertek is currently in their pre-sale, and updates can be followed on their Twitter and Telegram.\nTo read the King’s prior articles, to find out which ICOs he currently recommends, or to get in contact directly with the King, you can on Twitter (@JbtheCryptoKing) or Reddit (ICO updates and Daily Reports).\nThe above publication does not constitute investment advice and it is recommended each individual conduct their own research. The Author of this article owns but does not trade the aforementioned cryptocurrencies.\nWhat are your thoughts on Crypto King’s picks for this week? Are there any that you would add to the list?

Coinbase is getting into the decentralized exchange business with its acquisition of Paradex, potentially opening up thousands of ERC-20 tokens to traders, depending on what the SEC ends up doing with regulations. The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, Intercontinental Exchange, continues work to implement a system to allow large investors to trade bitcoin directly. And Germany’s Deutsche Boerse is looking at getting into the cryptocurrency game. Finally, the city of Memphis had its first blockchain conference, which included keynotes from FedEx and a hackathon for various market segments that included some great prizes.\nFeatured stories by Amy Castor, David Hollerith and Nick Marinoff\nStay on top of the best stories in the bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. Subscribe to our newsletter here . Coinbase Takes Another Step Toward Trading ICO Tokens by Acquiring\nCryptocurrency exchange Coinbase just made an enormous play by acquiring decentralized relayer Paradex this week. Paradex bills itself as a decentralized exchange (DEX), meaning no third party is involved in holding the funds. Instead, users can use the platform to trade ERC20 tokens directly wallet to wallet. Paradex is built on top of the 0x (pronounced “zero x”) protocol .\nRight now, Coinbase trades four coins: bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH) and litecoin (LTC). Adding ERC20 tokens could significantly boost the number of digital assets it carries. Due to the ICO boom that has taken place over the last few years, thousands of different ICO tokens are now available. German Stock Exchange Eyes Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies\nFrankfurt Stock Exchange parent company, Deutsche Boerse AG , appears to have begun work on technology that will allow them to offer their clients bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related products.\nSpeaking at an industry event in London on May 23, 2018, Jeffrey Tessler, head of clients, products and core markets for Deutsche Boerse, said they are considering offering cryptocurrency products: “We are deep at work with it.” The Old New Thing: ICE and the Future of Bitcoin Trading and Regulation\nAs reported earlier by The New York Times (NYT) and Bitcoin Magazine , Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is developing an online trading platform that would allow large investors to trade bitcoin directly. As news about the ICE platform continues to develop, Bitcoin Magazine spoke with lawyers Ben Sauter and Dave McGill of Kobre & Kim, a New York City law firm which specializes in disputes and investigations, to examine the regulatory issues surrounding the launch of such a platform, including swap contracts and the implications the ICE platform might have on cryptocurrency trading in the future. What Happened At Graceland’s Ethereum Conference\nIn its first year, EthMemphis distinguished its place on the blockchain conference circuit for displaying an under-the-hood glimpse at what actually moves this young industry forward, specifically on the Ethereum network. The focus was on blockchain topics and projects applied to supply chain, healthcare, tourism/hospitality, education and law. Verge Cryptocurrency Suffers Its Second Hack in Less Than Two Months\nWhile Verge executives are claiming a DDoS attack is responsible for the recent serious delays on their blockchain, it appears that the problem may be more serious than the company is implying. The attack lasted more than a few hours and has resulted in over 35 million XVGs (worth approximately $1.7 million) being stolen.

One of the bigger upcoming developments is the Lightning Network. Over the past few months, thousands of new payment channels have been established, signalling a major step in the right direction toward mass adoption of this new technology. \\n The Lightning Network Payment Channels \\n\nScaling Bitcoin to offer instant and cheap transactions requires major developments. This code upgrade is known as the Lightning Network . It allows users to open direct payment channels between one another on a global scale. Doing so requires the necessary network participation. Without sufficient support, the Lightning Network will not make any meaningful impact. \\n\nEarlier this year, things did not look all that promising. Just 89 channels existed on January 19th. To some people, it showed how this scaling solution is unfeasible. Others considered it to be a lack of adoption because the technology is still not finished. Instead, it is being tested under open beta rules and caution remains advised at all times. \\n\nFast forward to a few days ago, and the number of channels has grown significantly. As of May 24th, over 6,600 direct connections exist. It is still a drop in the proverbial bucket when looking at the financial sector. However, it also confirms there is genuine interest in this technology. Scaling Bitcoin will remain an ongoing process for some time to come. These numbers may look very different a year from today. \\n Looking Ahead \\n\nEven though this growth is impressive, not everyone is convinced. Until the Lightning Network technology is fully developed, adoption will remain relatively low. Various important aspects still need to be implemented. There is no double-sided funding, no watching for offline transfers, and so forth. \\n\nAll of these issues will – hopefully – be addressed by the developers in the future. Most small and traditional purchases do not necessarily require all of those advanced features. However, the current implementation of the Lightning Network will not necessarily suit everyone. Giving users a lot of different options will remain one of the top priorities. \\n\nAfter nearly nine years of development, it seems things are finally looking up for Bitcoin. Scalability has always been the Achilles heel of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. The Lightning Network may not solve all of the problems in one go. With constant updates and refinements, it will eventually turn into a global payment ecosystem. That is, if enough people embrace this new technology for everyday purposes. \\n Featured image from Shutterstock. \\n\nThe post Rapid Growth of Lightning Network Payment Channels Paints a Bright Future for Bitcoin ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "lightning network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lightning network payment channels", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T08:50:16.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bc0b0912bb7d6caeb75e285a730f3bcc4fdabb52", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZ_s5cL927qGmrK1RqeFw2Vz82BxZVjqdWGcIxpfW7P.WRPqHqKDORT.gAODiRsTc8qZeTgVl7_V4CT8i.mkQtI.Ikj6lqIKYo-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Bitfinex, a shady exchange which referred to Bitcoin Cash as Bcash, is being probed by the DOJ & CFTC for price manipulation (wash-trading and order spoofing)", "title_full": "Bitfinex, a shady exchange which referred to Bitcoin Cash as Bcash, is being probed by the DOJ & CFTC for price manipulation (wash-trading and order spoofing) : btc", "published": "2018-05-27T16:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.161, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bc0b0912bb7d6caeb75e285a730f3bcc4fdabb52", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZ_s5cL927qGmrK1RqeFw2Vz82BxZVjqdWGcIxpfW7P.WRPqHqKDORT.gAODiRsTc8qZeTgVl7_V4CT8i.mkQtI.Ikj6lqIKYo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "micahdjt1221", "published": "2018-05-27T16:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitfinex, a shady exchange which referred to Bitcoin Cash as Bcash, is being probed by the DOJ & CFTC for price manipulation (wash-trading and order spoofing)", "text": "submitted by /u/micahdjt1221\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/24/us-opens-criminal-probe-into-bitcoin-price-manipulation-bloomberg.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T12:20:43.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7f40f40f16950bfb44d4a37418183c412ea1014f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZ_s5cL927qGtjofe3Jr7plY_9mg1QhTffiQt1vtCwyYJq62HHEJwg7UdUD3NNre5mcNjM0VCCYKjO8avKsmMExIfA0hgauq5g-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Why does everyone except /r/BTC hate Bitcoin Cash?", "title_full": "Why does everyone except /r/BTC hate Bitcoin Cash?

These stories and many more were covered in this week's daily editions of Bitcoin in Brief. And the most commented on story of the week talked about a guy living is his car while working two jobs just to invest in crypto.\nAlso Read: US Justice Department Investigates Price Manipulation in Bitcoin Market\nNew EU Rules Kill Another Crypto Venture You could not have missed the impact of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which came into force this week, not with all the emails you must have received from any service that has ever had access to your address. However, one might have not known that the new regulations also had severe consequences for some services that had to shut down.\nOn Monday we reported that team behind Parity Technologies, the developers of the Parity multi-signature wallet, have announced that due to GDPR they are shutting down PICOPS, a service used by ICO campaigns to comply with KYC/AML regulations by validating that the owner of an Ethereum wallet has already passed an ID background check.\nCrypto Revolution Reshaping Global Politics The intersection of politics and cryptocurrency was our main focus on Tuesday . We reported that Iranian and Russian lawmakers are jointly examining the idea of using cryptocurrency to bypass international and American sanctions. And in the US, Congressional candidate Brian Forde raised $100,000 in cryptocurrency donations, and an opponent attacked him for this, referring to his donors as \"bitcoin speculators that oppose cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.\"\nWe also reported that Vitalik Buterin has co-written a short manifesto of sorts with the young political economist Glen Weyl, unapologetically titled \"Liberation Through Radical Decentralization.\" In it they explain how the cryptocurrency ecosystem is suited for developing and testing new models for governance, voting and more, in a way that can fundamentally change how both democracy and capitalism work.\nMcAfee Predicts Bull Run as Crypto Markets Dip John McAfee's prediction of a bull run on the cryptocurrency markets in the near future was one of the most discussed issues on Wednesday . Billions will be pumped by institutional investors, the internet security expert expects. McAfee claims this will lead to significant changes in the market capitalizations of the leading cryptocurrencies, but also those of most altcoins.\n\"Institutional investors are preparing to enter the cryptocurrency market with a vengeance,\" McAfee said. He explained that they are generally long term investors that will spend billions on the market. \"Expect the top ten coins to go through the roof fairly quickly. The bulk of altcoins will soon follow,\" the software guru wrote. Admitting he had no more information than his followers, John McAfee advised them to check the recent news and use their heads.\nMain Street Adopts Bitcoin Ahead of Wall Street On Thursday we reported that Deutsche Börse AG, the group which operates the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, is actively examining its options for launching cryptocurrency derivatives. This was revealed by Jeffrey Tessler, CEO of the post-trade services provider owned by Deutsche Börse Clearstream and member of the group's executive board.

Why is privacy important , why private coins will go up? Privacy is a human right! Enough said What's a private or anonymous coin? A coin that hides the origin address , the destination or the amount. Bitcoin e.g. blockchain is so transparent Your wife of some criminal can find your history - porn shop or car purchase (I want Maserati)... We need coins that hide the worth of our savings, the addresses etc. Like bank account - all info is private, not spray painted outside the bank Few types of anon coins exist : Cryptonite like Monero, XDN, AEON. Zerocoin ones. Masternodes like DASH, SYS, DMD . Some new fancy coins - ENG, GRS, CLOAK, ONION, Verge, KMD, EXP .... And others. XST, BCD, BCA . Picture below . I exclude suspicious coins like BTCP, Zcash. Don't go there. I got 3 angles to discuss : First the dumbos and crybabies angle !!! Bitcoin is bu-bu-l , crypto is used by crimi-naals!!? Morons can't be more wrong !! Why - because bitcoin and even anonymous coins are way more traceable than paper, gold, betting chits, hookers, bribes... Duhhhh. What were criminals using before 2009??? Duuuhhhh . Here's a hypothetical money laundering situation You go in the bank with $50000 dirty smelly rumpled notes with white powder on. -Where u got these , sir?? - Found them on me train bubba, under some magazine !! - Welcome to our bank sir!!! Coffee , car, hookers ? Duhhhh. Now same situation with crypto coins : -Where u got these , sir?? - Found them on me train bubba, DASH was under some bottle , PIVX and XDN were spilling from the table !! - Hold on to call few policemen !! Duhhhh. Now the angle of normal people who own crypto . Tomorrow you go into the shop to buy whiskey bottle . Most expensive is 0.0001 bitcoin for Black label Johny The guy gets your bitcoin and checks your transaction history ... Oh look....there's balance of 40 bitcoin worth 2 million ?!? Previous history reveals you bought 2 Lamborginis, island in Greece , 5 houses.... Chain of transactions goes back to 2012 when you bought 1000 bitcoin f rom some exchange .!!! So when u go next in the shop...they wait for u with a baseball bat and beat you enough to give them all 40 bitcoin . Now you think bitcoin is not so great and should go the privacy coins route To be continued.... with tax inspection angle...

These stories and many more were covered in this week’s daily editions of Bitcoin in Brief. And the most commented on story of the week talked about a guy living is his car while working two jobs just to invest in crypto.\nAlso Read: US Justice Department Investigates Price Manipulation in Bitcoin Market New EU Rules Kill Another Crypto Venture\nYou could not have missed the impact of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which came into force this week, not with all the emails you must have received from any service that has ever had access to your address. However, one might have not known that the new regulations also had severe consequences for some services that had to shut down.\nOn Monday we reported that team behind Parity Technologies, the developers of the Parity multi-signature wallet, have announced that due to GDPR they are shutting down PICOPS, a service used by ICO campaigns to comply with KYC/AML regulations by validating that the owner of an Ethereum wallet has already passed an ID background check. Crypto Revolution Reshaping Global Politics\nThe intersection of politics and cryptocurrency was our main focus on Tuesday . We reported that Iranian and Russian lawmakers are jointly examining the idea of using cryptocurrency to bypass international and American sanctions. And in the US, Congressional candidate Brian Forde raised $100,000 in cryptocurrency donations, and an opponent attacked him for this, referring to his donors as “bitcoin speculators that oppose cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.”\nWe also reported that Vitalik Buterin has co-written a short manifesto of sorts with the young political economist Glen Weyl, unapologetically titled “Liberation Through Radical Decentralization.” In it they explain how the cryptocurrency ecosystem is suited for developing and testing new models for governance, voting and more, in a way that can fundamentally change how both democracy and capitalism work. McAfee Predicts Bull Run as Crypto Markets Dip\nJohn McAfee’s prediction of a bull run on the cryptocurrency markets in the near future was one of the most discussed issues on Wednesday . Billions will be pumped by institutional investors, the internet security expert expects. McAfee claims this will lead to significant changes in the market capitalizations of the leading cryptocurrencies, but also those of most altcoins.\n“Institutional investors are preparing to enter the cryptocurrency market with a vengeance,” McAfee said. He explained that they are generally long term investors that will spend billions on the market. “Expect the top ten coins to go through the roof fairly quickly. The bulk of altcoins will soon follow,” the software guru wrote. Admitting he had no more information than his followers, John McAfee advised them to check the recent news and use their heads. Main Street Adopts Bitcoin Ahead of Wall Street\nOn Thursday we reported that Deutsche Börse AG, the group which operates the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, is actively examining its options for launching cryptocurrency derivatives. This was revealed by Jeffrey Tessler, CEO of the post-trade services provider owned by Deutsche Börse Clearstream and member of the group’s executive board. And changes to the Volcker Rule give Americans a new reason for moving their money away from big banks to cryptocurrencies, according to the latest analysis by Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratings.

Over the past 24 hours, the bitcoin price has dropped by 2.5 percent, from $7,580 to $7,350, dipping below the $7,300 mark at one point. Lack of Momentum\nThroughout 2018, the bitcoin price has experienced three major corrections on February 7, April 10, and May 25. The initial correction that occurred on February 7 led the bitcoin price to drop from $19,900 to $6,100, by more than 69 percent. The second correction on April 10 prompted BTC to fall from $12,000 to $6,400, by 46 percent. The third and latest correction on May 25 led BTC to decline from $10,000 to $7,200, by 28 percent.\nA trend can be seen in the three major corrections BTC experienced in 2018, which is that every successive correction had smaller sell-offs and narrower correction periods. The initial correction in February lasted nearly two months, while the second and third corrections bottomed out in about a month.\nFollowing the five-month price trend of bitcoin, it is highly likely that BTC rebounds from the $6,800 mark in the short-term, initiating a strong rally in the mid to long-term. After BTC bottoms out at $6,800, the market is expected to experience an accumulation period, leading the value of BTC to increase gradually and secure momentum. Following a continuous accumulation period could be a parabolic rally, driving the value of most cryptocurrencies to grow exponentially.\nDespite the optimistic long-term outlook of BTC, it is important to acknowledge that both BTC and the rest of the market are in a bear cycle and the bear market will likely continue until BTC bottoms out at the higher end of the $6,000 region.\nAnalysts including Willy Woo have shared their vision of BTC falling to the $5,000 region but unless the BTC price falls below the $6,500 mark and fails to sustain the $6,800 support level, a fall below the $6,000 mark remains unlikely. Altcoins and Tokens\nTrading alternative cryptocurrencies and tokens in a highly volatile period and a bear cycle is similar to leverage trading. Because tokens tend to experience intensified movements on both the upside and downside, it will follow the price trend of bitcoin but with larger price movements.\nMost of the tokens that have performed exceptionally well against major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum throughout 2018 have not been able to avoid the bear cycle. 0x, ICON, Zcash, and WanChain, which have demonstrated significant improvements and major developments in regards to scalability, long-term strategy, and technology, have seen a substantial decline over the past month.\nOne evident trend is the lack of investors and traders willing to sell BTC and other cryptocurrencies at current levels. As such, although technical analysis points elsewhere, a fall below the $6,000 mark for bitcoin in the short-term is unlikely and the valuation of the cryptocurrency market is not expected to fall below the $300 billion region.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://hacked.com/continue-reading"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cryptocurrency market continues to fall as bitcoin price seeks support", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T16:39:10.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5eacf73263e218036693ea123d4e411d39512ecb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYib7EjSz.tcjAKc8kJ5saU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Saving Bitcoins for your Children", "title_full": "Saving Bitcoins for your Children", "published": "2018-05-27T16:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5eacf73263e218036693ea123d4e411d39512ecb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYib7EjSz.tcjAKc8kJ5saU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ram krish", "published": "2018-05-27T16:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Saving Bitcoins for your Children", "text": "Saving bitcoin for your children is the best idea.

IPHoldings South West ’ has successfully acquired a trademark for the name ‘Bitcoin’. According to a merchant on Etsy, IP-Holdings sent a cease and desist order because they were selling Bitcoin-themed t-shirts.\nAlso read: There’s a Bitcoin Themed Card Game On Kickstarter Called ‘Bitcon’ UK Company Successfully Copyrights the Name ‘Bitcoin’\nThis week cryptocurrency enthusiasts found out the name ‘Bitcoin’ had been trademarked using the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) in the UK on December 22, 2017. The news came as a shock to one merchant who was selling t-shirts on Etsy with the Bitcoin name and was told to stop his operations or be held liable in a court of law. The letter states :\nIt has come to our client’s attention that you are offering for sale a variety of clothing bearing the Bitcoin trademark on Etsy.co.uk. [Our Client] has not authorised your use of the Bitcoin trademark on and in relation to clothing. Such use, therefore, amounts to trademark infringement pursuant to s10(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1994.\nContacting the company is difficult as there is very little information on the London-headquartered firm called IP-Holdings — minus one other patented IP product called ‘Westworld.’ The trademark itself, filed this past December, reveals a list of goods that can’t bear the name without permission such as adult clothing, infants’ clothing, shoes, headbands, socks, and nearly everything that can be manufactured into a product. Trademark number ‘UK00003279106 Bitcoin’ was officially registered into the IPO’s records on April 13, 2018. The “BITCOIN” IPO trademark filed on December 22, 2017. Other Attempts to Trademark the Bitcoin Name Have Failed\nThe UK filing seems to be the first successful trademark using the name Bitcoin as there have been other undertakings in the past. Back in March of 2015, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) rejected the company Urban Trend’s attempt to trademark the name Bitcoin (Reg 86135516 ). A year later during the same month, the Russian patent agency Rospatent denied the Moscow-based firm M-Group when it tried to copyright the Bitcoin name .\nMany cryptocurrency enthusiasts have been angry about the recent news as prior attempts have infuriated bitcoiners in the past. Back in 2015 the nonprofit organization the Bitcoin Foundation published a plea to individuals and businesses asking them not to copyright the term Bitcoin.\n“The Bitcoin Foundation believes that the term “Bitcoin” alone should not be the intellectual property of any individual or entity,” explained the organization back in January 2015.\nRather, it is a generic term like the terms used for other currencies such as “dollar”, “euro,” “yen,” etc. The Foundation is committed to doing what it can to protect the term “Bitcoin” for public use.\nWhat do you think about the UK company trademarking the name Bitcoin and sending cease and desist letters to those who attempt to use the name?

The Bitcoin Cash price, for example, has dipped below $1,000 for the second time in a few days. This seemingly confirms there are growing concerns regarding the long-term future of this project. Bitcoin Cash Price Struggles are Very Real Anyone who has kept an eye on the Bitcoin Cash price this week may have noticed an interesting trend. Despite a somewhat steady price level throughout most of 2018, things have taken a dire turn since this week. With the Bitcoin Cash price dropped from over $1,200 all the way to $980 in a few days, the setback was pretty steep. At that time, some industry experts speculated Bitcoin Cash has not convinced most investors and speculators. An interesting stance, although it is always subject to interpretation first and foremost. All cryptocurrencies are bleeding value as of right now, thus this “problem” is not unique to BCH whatsoever. Until the Bitcoin value picks up the pace, it seems safe to assume the Bitcoin Cash price will continue to decline as well. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a 4.08% Bitcoin Cash price decline. Surprisingly, there is only a 0.92% drop in the BHC/BTC ratio, which seemingly confirms Bitcoin Cash would have a stable value if Bitcoin wasn’t getting manipulated. Even so, it also shows how BCH – just like all other cryptocurrencies – is primarily linked to the Bitcoin value, and right now, the future is not looking all that impressive. With $493.313m in 24-hour trading volume , it seems the demand to buy and sell BCH is not slowing down compared to 24 hours ago. It is evident there is a lack of trading volume for all currencies as of right now, but for Bitcoin Cash, the trend doesn’t necessarily look all that bad. Compared to some other top 10 coins, its volume is holding up surprisingly well, at least, for the time being. The way things stand right now, OKEx is the leading exchange in terms of BCH trading volume. Its USDT pair is well ahead of LBank’s BTC pair and HitbTC’s BTC market. EXX and OKEx’s BTC market complete the top five, which means there are no fiat currencies in the top five as of right now. In fact, there’s only one fiat currency pair in the entire top 10, which confirms the Bitcoin Cash price will not reserve course today by any means. Whether or not the Bitcoin Cash price can gain control around $1,000 is a difficult question to answer right now. While that seems somewhat plausible, it will heavily depend on how the Bitcoin price moves along in the hours and days to come. As of right now, the BTC price seems to be heading lower and lower, which will also push the Bitcoin Cash price down even further. Today won’t be a pleasant day in this regard, albeit stranger things have happened in the past.

It filed an indictment, alleging that Hilmi Git had managed to commit more than 20,000 fraudulent transactions using Israeli credit cards, laundering the money through the Bitcoin network. 1,071 BTC Seized by Israeli Police Halmi Git, a resident of Hebron, has been accused of multiple offenses of credit card fraud, providing means for committing a crime, carrying out fraudulent trade activity, and laundering the proceeds through Bitcoin. It is reported that the Git managed to accumulate a total of 1,071 Bitcoin over the course of his crimes. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $7,342.21, putting the total value of Git’s fraud at a little over $7.8 million. Web of Crime According to the indictment, Git ran a network of forums and websites used to provide information on how to commit a range of computer offenses. One such forum provided is reported to have provided stolen credit card information. While entry to the forum was free, members could purchase a “VIP” membership to receive “fresh” credit card data. Git also published different guides in violation with the country’s Computers and Money Laundering Law. But wait… there’s more! Reportedly, Git also ran another scam, fraudulently selling mobile phones – often members of his own forums – at substantially reduced prices. The indictment describes a scheme in which Git would request that the customer transfer his money for the phone, after which point he would proceed to block the customer from the forum without ever actually having sent the customer their phone. He would go on to publish a positive feedback message on behalf of the deceived customer, expressing gratitude for the cheaper mobile phone. All Payments Made in Bitcoin The Israeli State Prosecutor’s Office claims that Git had requested all the payments to be made in Bitcoin . As such, he has reportedly managed to accumulate more than 1,071 Bitcoin between 2008 and 2018. The Bitcoin wallet of the accused has been seized and the funds in it are to be confiscated if and when he is found guilty of his crimes. The prosecution also seeks an extension of Git’s confinement until the end of the trial due to potential flight risk as well as concerns that having access to the internet will allow Git to “continue carrying out the criminal enterprise he established over the past decade.” Given the defendant’s thoughts on his actions, the concern seems more than warranted. Showing no remorse whatsoever, Git was quoted as saying: We are thieves, from wherever we can take money – we’ll take it, no matter where – from Israel, The US or even the moon – we will reach it and use it. What do you think will happen to those 1,071 Bitcoin if Git is found guilty? Please let us know in the comments below!

Either the number one crypto is either here to stay or it is just a fad. Thus, whether you support the “ bubble ” argument, the “ currency of the future ” notion or any other position, it all inevitably leads to the “boom or bust” conclusion or at least, so says Grayscale Investments managing director Michael Sonnenshein. Two Mutually Exclusive Bitcoin Future Outcomes According to Sonnenshein, there is no middle ground as far as Bitcoin is concerned. Speaking during a recent interview with Fortune , the cryptoanalyst said : As we begin to look at assets like Bitcoin and the unbelievable adversity it’s faced over the last ten years, every day that Bitcoin doesn’t go away, every day that Bitcoin overcomes a new challenge, for me that makes me feel that Bitcoin will do either one of two things. It will either survive and become all these amazing things that we think it can be, which will cause its price to be a lot higher. Or it is possible something else may come along that will displace it and Bitcoin goes to zero. It likely will have a binary outcome. To emphasize the point, consider the image above. Those were the top ten cryptocurrencies exactly five years ago as cataloged by CoinMarketCap. How many of them do you recognize? Now compare with the image below and see that only Bitcoin and Litecoin are still in the top ten. Where did the others go? Well, Freicoin isn’t even in the top 1,000 coins. Namecoin and Peercoin have also fallen spectacularly over the years as have the others on the list. Bitcoin Should Be Able to Adapt The critical question is where does Bitcoin’s destiny lie? Sonnenshein believes there is hope for the digital currency as long as there are continued improvements upon the technology. The managing director of Grayscale investments said that Bitcoin’s future is tied to its ability to remain relevant in the emerging digital currency landscape which it has historically dominated right from the outset. Bitcoin does have one crucial advantage – it is an open source protocol. Thus, if a paradigm-shifting technological breakthrough emerges, it should be easy to incorporate at least some aspects of it into the network. Where do you stand on the boom/bust debate?

The strategy game was created by two cryptocurrency investors who were tired of hearing about people doing unbelievable things like selling their home or using their student loan money to go ‘all in’ on a portfolio of digital assets. Also read: Project to Build Satoshi Statue Gains Support in Kiev Win Big or Lose it All Playin ‘Bitcon’ Two guys named Brandon and Sam who call themselves the ‘two stupid investors,’ created a tabletop card game that replicates cryptocurrency investing called ‘Bitcon.’ Basically, players are dealt a hand of five cards each and players draw cards in sequence to find out if the market goes up or down, or maybe even collapse. Alongside cards that move the market, there are also other action cards like the ‘Reverse the Market’ card which changes the direction of the current market trend. There’s also the ‘Cash Out’ card which can enable a player to cash out and cause the next player to pick up the remaining cards. Moreover, each deck of Bitcon cards has three ‘Pop’ cards — a card that serves as market collapse warning and when the last card is used the bitcoin market crashes and the game ends. The two creators who designed the Bitcon card game say they kept hearing about individuals doing wild and unbelievable things to obtain bitcoin. Then soon scouring Reddit forums and social media their game concept became an amusing simulation showcasing the risks and rewards tied to cryptocurrency investments. “If you like fast-paced strategy games, laugh at people that sold their house to buy bitcoin, or simply want to show grandma how to lose all your cash online,” explains the creators of Bitcon. Buy Bitcon — You’ll soon be addicted to losing all your money. A Representation of What it Feels Like Riding Markets Up and Down The Bitcon creators say they wanted to create a game that allows the “ thrills of being a big money investor with zero risks.” According to the Kickstarter campaign, a Bitcon strategy tournament can be roughly fifteen minutes of gameplay. “Bitcon is our perfect representation of what it feels like riding markets up and down, using strategy to protect yourself but also attack opponents, and be ready to cash out your position before your investment is fully lost,” Its 15 minutes of pure strategy, pace, and gambling. Betting addicts we’ve found you a solution . Bitcon is not the first Kickstarter card game campaign featuring a bitcoin-esque theme as news.Bitcoin.com reported on Bitcoin Empire back in January of 2017. The game featured many cryptocurrency luminaries within the industry and even a Pepe the frog playing card.

Every minor gain made yesterday has effectively been turned into a net loss once again. All currencies continue to follow the Bitcoin price in this regard, as BTC struggles to remain above $7,300. Bitcoin Price Dip Isn’t Over yet It is evident there is still plenty of negative pressure on all of the cryptocurrency markets today. This is all tightly correlated to how manipulators and speculators continue to push the Bitcoin price down for quite some time now. It is not necessarily a good thing by any means, but this trouble situation has been in place for quite some time now. It seems there will be no change in the Bitcoin price anytime soon either. More specifically, there was some brief positive momentum last night. With the Bitcoin price rising above $7,500 again, most people assumed the bearish pressure was finally relenting. As is usually the case, that was just a brief uptrend which was negated pretty quickly. As such, the Bitcoin price dropped below $7,400 again and is now struggling to maintain any momentum above $7,300. With another net loss of 2.26% in the past 24 hours, it is evident things are not looking all that great right now. The Bitcoin price has steadily lost value nearly every single day throughout 2018, and it seems remaining above $7,000 will prove nearly impossible. Whether or not things will evolve in that direction, remains a bit unclear, as anything and everything is possible in the world of cryptocurrency. Even the Bitcoin trading volume is dropping, albeit that is not entirely unusual during the weekend. More specifically, trading volumes for all cryptocurrencies are on the decline as of right now. When the Bitcoin trading volume drops, altcoins are bound to go with it sooner or later, which is exactly what is happening right now. At the time of writing, Binance is the largest exchange by BT trading volume with its USDT pair. OKEx’S TRUE and USDT are in second and third place as of right now. Bitfinex offers the only fiat currency pair in the five, followed by Huobi’s USDT market. It is evident there is no real money pouring into Bitcoin to stop the outflow, albeit that situation may come to change next week. For the time being, it remains a bit unclear what the future holds for the Bitcoin price. Things do not look even remotely impressive right now, and a dip to $7,000 and potentially lower seems nearly inevitable. When that happens, there will be even more panic selling to push the Bitcoin price down even further. All of this remains subject to change, as unpredictable markets will remain unpredictable at any given time.

Even as you read this report, a hacker, somewhere in the world is busy trying to phish the data of unsuspecting crypto investors just to hijack their digital assets. According to findings by bitcoin.com.news , an average of $9.1 million is lost to hackers every day as a result of phishing , fraud, theft, and hacking. As sad as it may be, only a few numbers of these criminals ever face the hand of justice for their nefarious acts. Good news! A British hacker has been busted and sentenced for phishing the data of about 165,000 customers and selling them on the dark web for bitcoin. Grant West, 26, was described as “a one-man cyber crime wave,” because he was acting on his own without the assistance of a team. West was sentenced to ten years and eight months in prison. Judge Michael Gledhill gave the verdict at the Southwark Crown Court after West admitted charges including drug dealings, money laundering, and conspiracy to fraud. “When such inadequate security is confronted with a criminal of your skills and ambition it is totally unfit for purpose and worthless,” the judge said . West, who was arrested and on his way to London, used his girlfriend’s laptop for his hacking scams. When the British police raided west’s residence, they found an SD containing the details of 63,000 credit and debit cards. It also included the details of over 500 companies, and seven million phished email addresses with their passwords. His girlfriend, Rachael Brooks, 26, mother of his 9-month-old baby was found with half a kilo of cannabis and £25,000 in cash, and she too was seized by the authorities. Brooks was given a community order after pleading guilty of unauthorized access to computer material. West has also hacked many popular brands, including Uber, to steal emails and other valuable details. In 2015, he sent phishing scam emails pretending to represent Just Eat takeaway. West made £2 million worth of the crypto, with £500,000 worth of bitcoin seized by the Cops, while £1.5 million remain untraced, probably hidden in off-shore accounts and crypto investments. This is the ‘first of its kind’ case for the 188-year old London police department. No doubt, the punishment given to West would serve as a lesson to other crypto hackers and hopefully this would be a step towards eradicating crypto scam in the industry.

Bitcoins and Basset Hounds Last weekend, Patricia Howell lost her basset hound, Happy. She quickly took to local online forums and in-town pet communities, posting pictures of the dog and her telephone number while asking people to call her right away if they had seen him. Within a few days, she received a text message from a burner phone demanding $600 in Bitcoin or else Happy would be sold off or even killed. The scammer claimed to be using a burner phone, supposedly so that the call couldn’t be traced, and advised Howell not to go to the police. The only issue was Howell had been reunited with Happy earlier that day thanks to the help of someone who had seen the online post. Apparently, the scammer had found her personal phone number from the lost dog advertisements. Howell immediately recognized it as a scam as she could literally see her dog. She reported the call to the police, who said that they had heard of similar cases from around the country. Fake Threats Becoming Common Another North Carolina resident and his duo of dogs also fell victim to the same scam. After posting his information on websites that look to help people find lost dogs, he received an all-too-similar text message from a burner phone, demanding approximately $2,000 in Bitcoin or his dogs would be killed in less than ten days. Like the case with Howell, the dogs were already back with the owner before the text message was sent out. It seems scammers are hoping that the attachment that owners have for their pets will convince them to pay up. Not to mention the ease of Bitcoin transactions along with the lack of actually having to physically receive any ransom demand. In the end, Howell says it best when she states: They need to find a better way to make money. They need to leave people alone and realize that what they’re doing is hurtful and so cruel.

Market Overview ‘Rumour has it Bitcoin won’t see 10k anymore’ would serve as a suitable alteration to the chorus of Adele’s mega-hit, ‘Rumour Has It.’ It’s obvious that for the time being, bears are in full control of bitcoin price but this time it’s a little bit harder to discern the source of BTC’s recent turmoil. Could it be one of the following? Lingering effects of the Mt. Gox sell off? Simmering scandal from the Upbit and Bithumb investigations? Or perhaps it’s the whales on the run phenomenon as Bitfinex requested client tax and social security information to comply with federal SEC regulations? Those partial to conspiracies might be willing to entertain theories of institutional investors and whales manipulating prices to buy near the bottom before flooding crypto markets with cash and bringing on the greatest pump 2018 will ever see. Whatever the reason(s), Bitcoin is currently stuck in the mud, and it appears likely to continue languishing as the expected purchasing appetite just isn’t present right now. Daily Chart The RSI has struggled to stay out of bearish territory (above 50) and a pattern of lower highs and lower lows continues as BTC slipped below the downward channel and is down nearly 15% over the last seven days. Notice that the RSI is not oversold (above 30) which supports the possibility of further price decline and in the event of a deep sell-off, BTC could drop below lower leg of the triangle. At the time of writing, the 5-day MA sits below the 10-day MA and both are sloping downward indicating further short-term decline. Last week the concern was whether BTC would dip below the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level whereas this week there is the possibility of a full retrace back to the April low near $6,425. 4HR Chart The 4-hour chart shows the 20-day MA well below the 50-day MA as both trend downward. At the moment, BTC is nowhere near crossing the 50-day MA at $7,969 and remains far away from the recent high (May 21) at $8,644. Notice that the Stochastic oscillator approaches overbought territory, yet BTC price continues to decline, opening the door for deep loses in BTC price as there is plenty of room for the oscillator to fall in the event of a sell-off. At the time of writing the RSI is flattening while remaining near bearish territory which is indicative of further decline (see the direction of moving averages) but it is possible that BTC could continue trading sideways for the short term until buyers, sellers or some breaking news event impacts BTC price. Alas, all is not lost in the world of cryptocurrency. In a recent Twitter post, The Crypto Fam make a strong case that this current bear reversal will end near $7,000 and purchasing appetite for BTC will return as whales, small investors and institutional investors return to purchase BTC near the bottom. Vision BTC is nearing a full retrace to the April April low near $6,425. Panic selling below $7,000 could open the doors for price decline below the lowest support at $6,000 A full retrace to $6,425 could signal the completion of the current bear reversal. BTC needs to close above the 50-day MA at $7,969 and sustained price gains above the upper descending channel ($8,050) would indicate that the current correction has ended. As highlighted by The Crypto Fam , each leg down in the bear market since December 2017 has have shown reductions in selling volume and the price drops less extreme. They have interpreted this as an indication that the bear market is running out of steam as bears, whales, and market makers have reduced their BTC holdings and will be prepared to purchase aggressively once the cryptocurrency reaches a bottom. Their charts, along with the daily chart in this article show a bottom somewhere between $6,000 – $6,800. Traders are advised to watch from the sidelines as most technical indicators show bears having the advantage but aggressive investors could consider purchasing when the 20 and 50-day MA reverse and maintain upward momentum on the 4-hour chart. At current prices, longs could take positions starting at $7,300 (and probably below) as Bitcoin has been range bound between $6,000 to $12,200 since February 2018.

This marks a $100 spike from yesterday’s price, though that, in turn, marked a $100 fall from 48 hours ago, when bitcoin had previously been trading for $7,500. Thus, while bitcoin’s new position is a move in the right direction, it’s hardly something to get super excited about. Previously, the currency had broken key support levels in the $7,000 range, but while the bears still have primary control, sentiment does suggest that this is only temporary, and that one uptrend is all that’s really needed for the bulls to step in and take the reins. One of the reasons behind bitcoin’s latest price drop may stem from India . The country isn’t exactly known for being entirely friendly towards crypto (the RBI has already banned banks from working with companies that deal in bitcoin and digital assets), but now, the government is considering an 18 percent goods and services tax (GST) on cryptocurrency trading. A new report is being considered by India’s Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs. A hearing is set to take place on July 20; until then, all courts in India are barred from hosting any case related to the matter. India seems to have a solid grip on cryptocurrencies. Back when the RBI first announced its ban on bitcoin business-bank relationships, the asset took the first of several nasty falls that would ultimately bring it down to the $6,000 range, where it hovered for quite some time. Now that recovery has begun, it appears India is once again stepping into the mix and enforcing its power. Bitcoin just can’t seem to catch a break… However, one source suggests that the long-winded price bends of the last few weeks (or months, considering bitcoin’s high of $19,000 in December) may finally be coming to an end . A new theory suggests that many institutional investors bought stakes in bitcoin just before the launch of bitcoin futures. Futures trading – which many now believe may have been the cause for bitcoin’s subsequent price drops – allowed these holders to short their coins with ease. From there, fake-out dumps, failed rallies and major price dumps could occur accordingly. The theory was suggested in a series of tweets by a cryptocurrency community known as the Crypto Fam. Analysts in the group suggest that the bears’ hold on bitcoin may be coming to an end relatively soon, as institutional bitcoin holders’ stashes are starting to run short. “The bear market is running out of gas,” the researchers said. “This is a very simplified explanation of how markets work.

The price declined and broke a few important support levels such as $1,050 and $1,000. It traded towards the $950 level before starting an upside correction. A low was formed at $948 and the price corrected above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,322 high to $948 low. \\n\nHowever, the upside move was capped by the $1,050 resistance. It also failed to test and break the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,322 high to $948 low. BCH price is declining once again and it seems like it could retest the $948 low in the short term. A break below $948 could open the doors for a test of the $920 and $900 support levels. To the topside, there is a monster bearish trend line in place with resistance near $1,060 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH\\/USD pair. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the price is facing a tough challenge on the upside near $1,060 and the trend line.

However, one might have not known that the new regulations also had severe consequences for some services that had to shut down.\nOn Monday we reported that team behind Parity Technologies, the developers of the Parity multi-signature wallet, have announced that due to GDPR they are shutting down PICOPS, a service used by ICO campaigns to comply with KYC/AML regulations by validating that the owner of an Ethereum wallet has already passed an ID background check.\nCrypto Revolution Reshaping Global Politics The intersection of politics and cryptocurrency was our main focus on Tuesday.

He explained that they are generally long term investors that will spend billions on the market. â€œExpect the top ten coins to go through the roof fairly quickly. The bulk of altcoins will soon follow,â€ the software guru wrote.

The state lawmakers, most of them from the ruling BJP, recently claimed to have received text or WhatsApp messages asking them to pay Rs 10 lakh in bitcoin otherwise their families will be eliminated. \"During the probe, a crypto-currency (bitcoin) account, mentioned in the threat messages to legislators, has been detected. Transactions of 1.60368338 bitcoins (Rs 8.16 lakh) were done in this account. And the entire amount was later transferred to some other account,\" STF sources said here today. \"A total of six transactions, between 6.46 PM on May 2 and 4 AM on May 18, were done in the crypto-currency e-wallet during which bitcoin was received and sent through different e-wallets. One transaction each was done on May 2, 3, 4, and 18 and two transactions on May 17,\" they said. The matter came to the fore when the MLAs complained about receiving threat messages asking them to pay Rs 10 lakhs through bitcoins, they said. The sources said probe agencies are investigating as to who did all these transactions. After Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath took note of the matter, an SIT was constituted on May 23 to probe the high-profile matter. The state police is suspecting the handiwork of \"professional hackers\" behind this to create panic and has issued an advisory to the people not to be scared. Also Read: IIT-Kanpur to develop VTOL aircraft prototypes \"An advisory has been issued across the state asking all not to get panicked over such messages,\" DIG (Law and Order) Pravin Kumar said. \"Prima facie, it appears to be the handiwork of some mischief makers,\" he said, adding that the SIT constituted to go into the matter was already working on it. In all the messages, the sender has given out his name as Ali Budesh Bhai from Dubai, a reference to a gangster once linked to the now Pakistan-based Dawood Ibrahim. The MLAs who got the messages include Veer Vikram Singh (Meeranpur Katra in Shahjahanpur), Manvendra Singh (Dadraul in Shahjahanpur), Prem Prakash Pandey (Tarabganj in Gonda), Vinay Kumar Dwivedi (Mehnam in Gonda), Vinod Katiyar (Bhognipur in Kanpur), Shahshank Trivedi (Mahauli in Sitapur) and Anita Rajput (Debai in Bulandshahr), Dhirendra Bahadur Singh (Sareni-Raebareli). Also Read: Seat-sharing for 2019 LS polls in UP could be a difficult task The opposition had also attacked the Adityanath government over the issue. \"No one is secure under the present regime. The MLAs are being threatened of dire consequences,\" Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav had said. \"There is no law and order in the state.\" Congress spokesman Arun Prakash levelled similar charges, saying the threats to legislators \"expose the tall claims of the BJP government\".", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "mla", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "stf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uttar pradesh", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T18:37:40.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b380e450834972ebfca60f9496366c90379e662d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkdynKqnkSXb32QdsgBPZvs581AbthAGPDBU7uFj4wN2xyZfXR70zS3R4r7ReBwQKRj61SE4Y5FGLvDETKIrvQIdvD7cY_ukxI1086FNj67oyg--", "site_full": "www.americanbankingnews.com", "site": "americanbankingnews.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/AmericanBankingNews", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "American Banking News", "title": "Bitcoin Private Trading Down 6.3% Over Last 7 Days (BTCP)", "title_full": "Bitcoin Private Trading Down 6.3% Over Last 7 Days (BTCP)", "published": "2018-05-27T15:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/2575.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b380e450834972ebfca60f9496366c90379e662d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkdynKqnkSXb32QdsgBPZvs581AbthAGPDBU7uFj4wN2xyZfXR70zS3R4r7ReBwQKRj61SE4Y5FGLvDETKIrvQIdvD7cY_ukxI1086FNj67oyg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ABMN Staff", "published": "2018-05-27T15:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Private Trading Down 6.3% Over Last 7 Days (BTCP)", "text": "Posted by ABMN Staff on May 27th, 2018 // No Comments\nBitcoin Private (CURRENCY:BTCP) traded 8.5% lower against the U.S. dollar during the 1-day period ending at 8:00 AM E.T. on May 27th.

The price declined and broke a few important support levels such as $1,050 and $1,000. It traded towards the $950 level before starting an upside correction.

Sektörde bulunan tüm kripto yatırımcıları ise Bitcoin yeniden piyasaya hareket getirebilecek mi? Sorusuna cevap arıyorlar.\nbitcoin yeniden\nBitcoin yeniden 6.000 dolar seviyesine geri döner mi?\nWall Street firması Fundstratın kurucusu Tom Lee ve John McAfeenin de dahil olmak üzere birkaç yatırımcı, Bitcoinin kısa vadeli büyümesi konusunda iyimser olduğunu ifade ediyor. Kripto para birimi araştırmacısı Willy Woo ise Bitcoin fiyatının 6.000 doların altına düşme olasılığının da yüksek olduğunu dile getirdi:\nBitcoin fiyatının 7.000 dolar desteğine tutunamayıp, 5.000-5.700 dolar bandına gerileceğini ön görüyorum. Daha iyi bir tahmin yapmak için ise Haziran ayını bekliyorum.\nWilly Woo bu tahminini, Bitcoinin aşırı güçlü düşüş eğilimine, yüksek NVT sinyaline ve volatiliteye dayanarak yaptığını dile getirdi. Bitcoin fiyatının şu anki seviyesinden 8.000 dolarlık bir bölgeye geri döneceğini beklenmediğini de sözlerine ekledi.\nKripto para yatırımcısı ve Blocktower kurucularından Ari Paul, 25 Mayısta da benzer bir noktaya işaret etti. Paul, düşük hacimli düzeltmelerin mevcut periyodu nedeniyle hacim ve fiyatlarda ani bir artış beklenmediğini belirtti.\nYukarıdaki 30 dakikalık Bitcoin tablosunda görüldüğü gibi, Bitcoin hacmi ve tüm kripto para piyasası, Mayıs ayı ortasından bu yana nispeten düşük kaldı. Üç alış ve satış artışının yanı sıra 24 Mayıs itibariyle, Bitcoin hacmi nisan ve mayıs ayı başına kıyasla önemli ölçüde düşük kalmıştır.\nOcak ayından bu yana Bitcoinin eğiliminin, kısa vadede 6.500 dolar seviyesinden geri döndüğü görülüyor. Ancak analistler, kripto para piyasası hacminin bu şekilde düşük kalmaya devam etmesi durumunda, Bitcoin fiyatının 6.000 doların altına inebilme ihtimalini yüksek görüyorlar.\nConsensus 2018 sonrası Bitcoin yeniden artar diye düşünenler çoğunluktaydı\nNew Yorktaki Consensus 2018 konferansından sonra Bitcoin değerinde yüzde 70lik bir artış tahmininde bulunan Tom Lee, kısa vadede Bitcoin için 25.000 dolarlık bir fiyat hedefini tahmin etmek için kurumsal yatırımcı argümanına başvurdu.\nBence kurumsal yatırımcılar çok ilgi topladılar ve henüz birtakım yasal belirsizlikler olduğu için henüz kripto piyasasına tam anlamıyla adapte olamadılar. Ancak, bir varlık sınıfı olarak kriptoya bu tür bir sermaye girişinin, Bitcoinin yeni zirvelere çıkması için güçlü bir neden olarak karşımıza çıkıyor.\nŞu anda, kripto para birimi sektöründe çok az sayıda kurumsal yatırımcı var ve büyük ölçekli multi-milyar dolarlık emeklilik fonları, düzenleyici engeller nedeniyle kripto para elde etmek için mücadele ediyor.\nTom Lee ayrıca düzenleyiciler tarafından piyasa kazandırılabilecek bazı şeffaflıkların Pazar kurumsal yatırımcıyı çekebileceğini düşünüyor. Fakat piyasa yeni gelen kurumsal yatırımcıların büyük çaplı sermayelere taşımasının ise aylar sürebileceğini düşünüyor.\nhttps://kriptoparahaber.com/bitcoin-yeniden-piyasayi-canlandirabilecek-mi.html", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://kriptoparahaber.com/bitcoin-yeniden-piyasayi-canlandirabilecek-mi.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T04:39:26.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "40ad5e626701837b50e18d92b4c27538fbb04118", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg975pz92oGfeoTgwDBgQA8EYIAQaX0XDpL3TQty7pUy_Jznlz1Etkho3PQ7z9Gg7keqdEWvqplo2FpJSHjWpZCc", "site_full": "www.taringa.net", "site": "taringa.net", "site_section": "http://www.taringa.net/comunidades", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "comic_books"], "section_title": "Comunidades - Taringa! - Inteligencia colectiva", "title": "Bitcoin - Bitcoin, trading y criptomonedas", "title_full": "Bitcoin - Bitcoin, trading y criptomonedas - Taringa!", "published": "2018-05-27T15:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "AR", "spam_score": 0.084, "main_image": "https://a03.t26.net/avatares/1/0/3/9/120_c_103983.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "40ad5e626701837b50e18d92b4c27538fbb04118", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg975pz92oGfeoTgwDBgQA8EYIAQaX0XDpL3TQty7pUy_Jznlz1Etkho3PQ7z9Gg7keqdEWvqplo2FpJSHjWpZCc", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ibe444444", "published": "2018-05-27T15:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin - Bitcoin, trading y criptomonedas", "text": "https://getcryptotab.com/1394854", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://getcryptotab.com/1394854"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T16:13:10.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d2967e3194569c6059213763d312ec983d6197c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSDAcJIStjdfDkxWnrppft1goGEbLgNHUVjMXvZEoZpz1bXLS2p0hTkfiyzOfZRWOeR7FNR9NgUC8OsuGqR0Iek699XtDmPVXNs.WeEXqzACJ2RtfAyf5sWa3pcza9qPeuRhJDPFyD5Og--", "site_full": "cointelegraph.com", "site": "cointelegraph.com", "site_section": "http://www.xbt.money/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "XBT.MONEY", "title": "Buy Bitcoin, Sell Your Altcoins, Says Pioneering Wall Street Blockchain Analyst", "title_full": "Buy Bitcoin, Sell Your Altcoins, Says Pioneering Wall Street Blockchain Analyst", "published": "2018-05-27T15:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.xbt.money/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/528_Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8xZGJhYTg1MDEyZjA0NzlkMTY3YzAwYTM3MGIwNjUyNS5qcGc=-528x330.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45237, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d2967e3194569c6059213763d312ec983d6197c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSDAcJIStjdfDkxWnrppft1goGEbLgNHUVjMXvZEoZpz1bXLS2p0hTkfiyzOfZRWOeR7FNR9NgUC8OsuGqR0Iek699XtDmPVXNs.WeEXqzACJ2RtfAyf5sWa3pcza9qPeuRhJDPFyD5Og--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "xbt.money", "published": "2018-05-27T15:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Buy Bitcoin, Sell Your Altcoins, Says Pioneering Wall Street Blockchain Analyst", "text": "Buy Bitcoin, Sell Your Altcoins, Says Pioneering Wall Street Blockchain Analyst May 27, 2018 19 Views Bitcoin remains a strong buy despite recent losses, blockchain venture capitalist Spencer Bogart told CNBC yesterday, May 26. The cryptocurrency will trade “at least” above $10,000 by the year’s end, he added. Bogart is a partner at major VC firm Blockchain Capital , and was reportedly the first Wall Street analyst to cover Bitcoin and blockchain, authoring a highly regarded blockchain industry report. Bitcoin has now seen three weeks in the negative, its “longest running streak of losses since September 2017,” as CNBC’s interview intro noted. Despite this, Bogart outlined a bullish forecast for the long term, saying that: “The long-term thesis is very much intact… The institutionalization of Bitcoin is absolutely occuring…Every major bank is trying to do something in the space. Either they’re going to be offering Bitcoin to their clients, they’re working on a custody platform or they’re opening up a trading desk .” Bogart suggested however that many altcoins are likely “overvalued” and “have significant headwind,” emphasizing the dangers of relative valuation. He drew a parallel between the ICO boom in late 2017 – early 2018 and the dot-com boom of the early 2000s, warning that many crypto tokens are “over-promising and under-delivering.” Bogart said he would sell alts such as Cardano , TRON , IOTA and NEO , but was “neutral” and would hold Ethereum , Ripple , Bitcoin Cash and EOS . “I’m very constructive as regards Ethereum on a long-term basis,” he said. Nonetheless, he considered that Ethereum currently has “a lot of overhang” because of the many “overvalued” tokens that are built on its platform, and suggested that Ethereum’s future will be closely correlated to the future development of the ICO space. Bogart also noted that this has been the first sustained bear market where nobody has suggested the “end of Bitcoin.” He suggested that the reality of a deeper institutionalization of the crypto space is securing the long term “story,” and is “overall positive” for Bitcoin’s future. He also said that ongoing turbulence in the traditional financial sector, such as recent national fiat currency crises , is reinforcing Bitcoin’s use cases. “Could Bitcoin trade lower? Certainly. But do I think it will be higher a year from now? Absolutely… I would bet Bitcoin ends at least above $10,000 in the year.” Negative performance in the crypto markets for now seems to be continuing, with Bitcoin trading below $7,400 to press time, down a further 2 and half percent over the 24 hour period. This despite increasing provisions to facilitate mainstream investment in the crypto space, notably with a recent trend to provide custodian solutions for institutional holders. The ubiquity of the ‘ institutional investment will lead to a major market uptick’ narrative moved one prominent crypto commentator to protest this weekend: Two words I really don’t want to hear this week:\nInstitutional Investors", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.nasdaq.com/article/blockchain-capital-lures-bitcoin-analyst-away-from-wall-street-firm-cm750868", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/26/bitcoin-still-a-buy-says-blockchain-venture-capitalist.html", "https://www.crunchbase.com/person/spencer-bogart"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bogart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spencer bogart", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockchain capital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T23:20:33.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eb98b5d69a80cf760293cc5157d4e081e7d5d6b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.sk2k5JGijXJFLQfjUXvwLQ7N6wgZQCVFFf8pmq7YLDlCy9SRUqongxFINh0FLcRoww--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "This Week in Bitcoin: McAfee’s Bullish Prediction and a Guy Living in His Car", "title_full": "This Week in Bitcoin: McAfee’s Bullish Prediction and a Guy Living in His Car", "published": "2018-05-27T15:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb98b5d69a80cf760293cc5157d4e081e7d5d6b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.sk2k5JGijXJFLQfjUXvwLQ7N6wgZQCVFFf8pmq7YLDlCy9SRUqongxFINh0FLcRoww--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-27T15:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "This Week in Bitcoin: McAfee’s Bullish Prediction and a Guy Living in His Car", "text": "This Week in Bitcoin: McAfee's Bullish Prediction and a Guy Living in His Car\nAvi Mizrahi\nThis week we learned that Deutsche Börse \"Deep at Work\" on Bitcoin and John McAfee predicted bulls' billions will soon be pumped by institutional investors, despite the current cool market.

Recent Market Struggles\nSince mid-May, ever since the bitcoin price failed to test a major support level at $10,000, the cryptocurrency market has been on a continuous decline. The vast majority of tokens and small cryptocurrencies have followed the price trend of bitcoin and Ethereum. On both the upside and downside, the price movement of tokens intensified, recording larger drops than bitcoin during minor corrections.\nOn May 25, Woo noted that the bitcoin price would likely dip below the $6,000 level and test $5,500 to $5,700 as a long-term support level. In previous reports, CCN noted that the $6,500 mark is an important resistance level which bitcoin has been able to bounce off of since early January.\nIn the short-term, it is likely that bitcoin falls below $7,000 and test the $6,500 resistance level and the failure to remain above that level will likely send bitcoin to the lower end of $6,000 and potentially to the higher end of $5,000.\nWoo named four major reasons to support his call: High NVT signal Standard NVT overly high Volume Profile cliff below $6,800\n“NVT Signal is still too high. We need more blockchain transactional activity to justify the current price, or the price to drop to reconcile the difference. To drive up transactional activity in a bear slide is very unlikely. Volatility is still too high. I’m looking for a sustained low band of volatility which tends to be a signal for the end of the detox and the next accumulation phase. It’s still got some time to ride down,” said Woo. The NVT Signal is a trading indicator that analysts use to evaluate the bitcoin price.\nNVT Signal is a trading indicator developed by Woo, which is essentially a Standard NVT Ratio–Network Valuation divided by Transaction Value on the blockchain smoothed using moving average–except that instead of applying the moving average to both Network Valuation and Transaction Value, NVT Signal applies moving average to only the Transaction Value, creating a more responsive chart.\nWhile it is unlikely that the bitcoin price drops to the lower end of $5,000, Woo stated that bitcoin would most likely not be able to hold up in the $7,000 region and inevitably drop down to the $6,000 region.\nBut, because of the intensity of the decline since late 2017, Woo emphasized that 2018 will not see a similar correction period as 2014 and prevent a 2-phase drop.\n“So, in summary, my best guess… slowish bleed down to $6800… then a steeper slide to $5700, then a leveling out of the drop… then a flat zone. This is an educated guess based on volume profile and fundamental data framing the rate of movement,” added Woo. Bitcoin Price to Rebound from $5,700\nIn October 2017, after nearly doubling in price within a 3-month period, the bitcoin price achieved $5,700. Falling to the $5,700 region would essentially send the price of bitcoin back by nine months.\nHowever, the cryptocurrency market is significantly different from where it was in October. Its volumes are in orders of magnitude larger and the standard of infrastructure provided by companies like Coinbase and Gemini are unprecedented compared to the platforms that were available in early 2017.\nGiven the difference in the volume and structure of the market in comparison to 2017 and previous years, both Woo and other analysts in the cryptocurrency sector agree that the next bull rally or up cycle for bitcoin will take less time to initiate, possibly in the third quarter of 2018.\nImages from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1000223528803762176"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "woo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T23:20:36.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "63009f60d215aa21f50835506337f830c20be184", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmVDXG51mNTCfsBOSPJyF4Hk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=39.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Beginners &amp; Help", "title": "Muslims can trade with bitcoin according Islam.", "title_full": "Muslims can trade with bitcoin according Islam.", "published": "2018-05-27T15:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.008, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "63009f60d215aa21f50835506337f830c20be184", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmVDXG51mNTCfsBOSPJyF4Hk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jhon Wick", "published": "2018-05-27T15:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Muslims can trade with bitcoin according Islam.", "text": "Quote: from: cryptotezi on May 24, 2018, 02:24:49 PM One of the renowned mosque in London named The Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Hackney, has accepted bitcoin donation and announced that btc trade is Halal or permissible according to Sharia Law.
