Modified 7 Jun 2018 09:35 Facebook CFTC commissioner says Cryptocurrencies will feature in “every economy”\nThere hasn’t been much positive news for Bitcoin lately, in fact, there hasn’t been much bad news either. Instead, the bubble unwind has left a sort of eerie calm over cryptocurrency markets as the speculation has dried up. However, there was a bit of good news albeit small on Wednesday as Coindesk reported that a commissioner of the CFTC, Rostin Bernham, had a lot of good things to say about cryptocurrencies,\n\"But virtual currencies may – will – become part of the economic practices of any country, anywhere. Let me repeat that: these currencies are not going away and they will proliferate to every economy and every part of the planet ... Virtual currencies could transform the economic and social landscape.\"\nAnything which can be deemed to be regulators taking a positive stance on the fledgling technology is certainly a good thing for Bitcoin, but it is important to remember this was not the head of the CFTC and it does not necessarily imply that the US will take a benign stance on regulating cryptocurrencies. Technical picture continues to look uncertain\nFrom a technical perspective, things still look quite dark for Bitcoin. Poor liquidity makes rallies often quite slippy, and Wednesday’s bounce to $7600 was sharply rejected. While the price continues to lack conviction it is hard to get bullish, and Omkar Godbole an analyst for Coindesk continues to look for that high volume break out to the upside, but is cautious that a downside shift could see a retest of $7000,\n“A high-volume break above $7,780 would add credence to the quirky \"6th of the month\" pattern and signal a bullish trend reversal. In this case, prices will likely rise to the 10-week MA, currently located at $8,310. A break below $7,372 would put the focus back on the rising-wedge breakdown and allow a drop to $7,040.”\nDuring these quiet periods, Bitcoin looks more stable and more useful as a currency. This is something that many proponents of the major crypto may be quite excited about. Hopes that the volatility and hype would subside are the only real path to it being more than a store of value.

NYC just does this faster and cheaper. NYC is lightning fast – test it! Unconfirmed transactions worldwide in just 1-2 seconds. And NYC has been confirming blocks every 30 seconds since 2014.

Blockchain is a distributed data storage software that makes impossible to lose information even if part of network is down. It also encrypts the data so that you are the only one with access to it. There is about blockchain technology in general. But there are some security points that should be outlined in different ways of holding cryptocurrency.\nOnline services\nThe first rule is to be careful to different online services. Most of exchanges and online wallets do not provide enough insurance and security to be used to store money like a bank. They often suffer from hacker attacks. Accordingly, you might want to use other types of wallets. For example, hardware or software client-side wallets as Lumi. Otherwise, you should choose such services very carefully. However if you want to choose hosted wallets you are to mind safety and use additional security features as two-factor authentication (2FA).\nChoose client-side wallet\nLet's speak about software client side wallets in details. Why is it more secure? It means that there are no processes connecting with your personal data happen online. Consequently, your funds are vulnerable to losses only if you don't take care of your device (means don't use password on your device, give to third parties or lose it).\nBackup\nThe second rule is about backup for your wallet. It can protect you against computer failures and many human mistakes. It allows you to recover your wallet after your mobile or computer was stolen if you have a wallet backup. For example, Lumi provides you with 12-words mnemonic phrase that is a key to your funds. With this phrase you can recover your wallet in Lumi or into another wallet.\nUpdate in time\nThe third rule is to keep your wallet up to date. Updates include new useful security features and help to keep your wallet safe. Wallet teams always work hard for their clients.\nDiversify your risks\nAs for general advice, it is better not to store all your funds in one exchange or in one hot wallet. Diversify your risks. Or choose cold wallets. Keep your phone safe and take care of your private key.\nYou are welcome to find more info here :) https://blog.lumiwallet.com\nsubmitted by /u/Lumi_wallet\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lumi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T11:24:14.070+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e0e3fbfd531473ecbdef65c379745681362d6a75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHK.yB5fnjOaeGyMqkOHfdW1pP6W7Y4UU5zEv6wIdXBNAOuK5KaI8lHwgOAqaoyhYpnap7cD3hNW3XdWUB.YQFzHy1jGhKlYDrtbEunMxL1iPA--", "site_full": "wegobusiness.com", "site": "wegobusiness.com", "site_section": "http://wegobusiness.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "WeGoBusiness – Top business stories from around the internet", "title": "Bitcoin – Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: New Tech and a Quick Way to Make a Fortune in Crypto", "title_full": "Bitcoin – Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: New Tech and a Quick Way to Make a Fortune in Crypto", "published": "2018-06-07T11:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://wegobusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Bitcoin-Bitcoin-in-Brief-Thursday-New-Tech-and-a-Quick-Way-to-Make-a-Fortune-in-Crypto.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e0e3fbfd531473ecbdef65c379745681362d6a75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHK.yB5fnjOaeGyMqkOHfdW1pP6W7Y4UU5zEv6wIdXBNAOuK5KaI8lHwgOAqaoyhYpnap7cD3hNW3XdWUB.YQFzHy1jGhKlYDrtbEunMxL1iPA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "WeGoBusiness - Digital Business Academy", "published": "2018-06-07T11:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin – Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: New Tech and a Quick Way to Make a Fortune in Crypto", "text": "Bitcoin – Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: New Tech and a Quick Way to Make a Fortune in Crypto 7 June 2018 8534\nThe most important thing about bitcoin is the new freedom-enhancing innovations that the technology enables, but we know that’s not what everyone is looking for these days. So in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief we also feature a surefire way to make a quick fortune in cryptocurrency.\nAlso Read: Coinmint to Invest up to $700 Million in New York Mining Center How to Make $120,000 in a Week\nAre you too cautious to bet on ICOs? Sure they are all just bug-ridden trash, other than the outright scams. So why not make money off of that?\nGuido Vranken, a software security auditor (white-hat hacker) from the Netherlands, has earned a cool $120,000 in just one week of hunting for bugs on the EOS code. He reported 12 vulnerabilities, for $10,000 each. As the EOS ICO brought in a whopping $4 billion, and evidently no shortage of bugs, this seems like a great way to fatten your wallet if you are willing to do the work. You can find their bug bounty program policy here to see what they cover and what not. Thank you. A couple more waiting to be rewarded. I think the final tally was $120K but I lost count. Took me about a week.\n— Guido Vranken (@GuidoVranken) June 4, 2018 Ledger Wallet for Desktop Is Coming Soon\nLedger, the producer of the popular hardware wallet Nano Ledger, has announced that the release date of the new version of the Ledger Wallet desktop edition is now scheduled for July 9 th , 2018. It will be available as native desktop application, supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux, so that users won’t require accessing the wallet via Google Chrome or Chromium anymore. Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes?\nBlock Broker is the latest ICO to fall off the map, deleting all its social media presence and leaving investors to wonder if it was all an exit scam from the start. What makes this case interesting is that it was meant to “completely eliminate ICO fraud by creating a 100% safe investment environment.” The project promised a decentralized ICO investment platform to “ensure that fraudulent ICOs don’t get an opportunity to tarnish the booming industry.” Of course if you are going to trust a “team of experienced professionals” to somehow safely handpick investments for you in a decentralized way, you better make sure they aren’t scamming you first. Strong Demand for Chinese Ghosts\nAnd speaking about dishonest ICOs, reports from China indicate that there is still high demand for ghostwriters to produce Chinese whitepapers, despite the ban on the practice in the country. In fact, there are also many people advertising their services as ICO writers in China, offering a whitepaper for an average of 15,000 yuan (about $2,350), according to Securities Daily.\n“One 20-page whitepaper in Chinese will cost 15,000 yuan, and the one that has 45 to 50 pages will cost 40,000 yuan,” one provider reportedly said. “An additional 7,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan will be charged for an English version. The service usually takes 7 to 10 days to complete,” the whitepaper provider added. Virtual Crypto Technologies’ New Two-Way ATM NetoBit ATM\nVirtual Crypto Technologies Ltd. (OTCQB: VRCP), an Israeli tech startup dedicated to making cryptocurrencies accessible to the public, announced that it will launch its bitcoin ATM at the Tech Crunch Tel Aviv event today. The Neto Bit ATM is a two-was machine that enables users to both buy and sell cryptocurrencies with fiat money.\nAlon Dayan, CEO of Virtual Crypto, commented: “We continue to set standards for the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. Our proprietary algorithm reduced the typical transaction time from [between 10 and 60 minutes] to [only] several seconds. At this stage, Neto Bit ATMs combine that speed with the convenience of an ATM, giving customers the ability to buy and sell bitcoin with fiat money. The result is a vastly improved trading experience for customers, which we believe will be attractive to our business partners as well as consumers.” Bitcoin Cash on Money Week\nDominic Frisby, Money Week’s commentator on gold and commodities, and the author of ‘Bitcoin: the Future of Money?’ has written in the UK magazine yesterday about his impression of meeting BCH developers when looking for sponsors for his financial game-show. “I was deeply impressed with the ambition of the enterprise. They are really pushing this thing. In the coming weeks there are big deals for payments with major international merchants to be announced. They are building an enormous and ambitious payment infrastructure across all six continents. Owning the coin is like owning shares in the network, a network which is rapidly growing and well marketed. They want bitcoin cash to be used as widely as possible as a means of payment: to make sure it is actually used.”\nAdvising his readers if they should get BTC or BCH, he added that: “Bitcoin cash is more volatile and the downside risk is greater, but if you ask me which of the two is more likely to go up ten times from current prices, I’d have to say bitcoin cash.”\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates?

A current curious example from Germany shows that this is apparently true for parking lots, too. That is, if a paper notice is to be believed that we received from a reader of our blog. This is the notice we were alerted to by one of our readers. (Click to enlarge)\nWe usually receive malicious and suspicious files or web links via email. In this case, the submission consisted of a photo which showed an \"ad banner\" printed on paper. It advertised mining cryptocurrency using a browser. The use of browser plugins is not a new invention. What is new, though, is the fact that this method is advertised \"offline\", outside the internet. An alert reader of our blog sent us the picture, asking us to take a look at what was going on there. Naturally, with us being curious by nature, we could not resist. In our blog, we have also covered current trends in cryptomining in the past. In a nutshell, users share the computing capabilities of their PCs for mining Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency. Ideally, this happens with the knowledge and consent of the user. All clear - for now\nThe notice addresses users of Chrome and Firefox in particular. They should use the provided link to install an add-on in their browser in order to mine Bitcoins \"without any risks and free of charge\". We have taken a closer look at the advertised add-on called \"Cryptotab\". The good news is: we could not find evidence of foul play (as of May 30th, 2018). The add-on does not appear to contain malware. One could argue, though, that one of Cryptotab's additions could be classified as a \"potentially unwanted program\" (PUP). On the other hand: a user must actively install this optional module. Furthermore, the notice also contains a QR code which points to a registration site. This link will be important later on. Additional ballast Customizable search engines in Mozilla Firefox\nAll things considered, everything should be perfectly fine, right? Yes and no. While the Cryptotab add-on itself odes not contain harmful components, there are two things that stick out. For one, when installing the add-on, the user is also asked if he would like to install a component called \"mybit\". Mybit is a custom search engine as you would find in Firefox (see screen shot). When installing the add-on and performing a search using mybit, the user is redirected to the search results of the Yahoo search engine.\nIt is unclear what happens with the search terms that are entered and we are limited to conjecture here. The only thing that is certain is that any data entered into the mybit search field is sent to its makers. Motivation and Marketing\nIf you are now wondering why someone takes to using paper notices to get people to use the mining add-on, you're in good company. We have been asking ourselves the same question. The answer to this question lies in the QR code which is printed on it and on the website of the add-on's provider. The provider uses a so-called \"affiliate marketing\" strategy. If someone successfully manages to acquire a new user for the add-on, he or she receives a commission of 15 per cent of the cryptocurrency mined by this user (although the website lacks information about the time span the commission is based on). To receive the commission, the advertiser must ensure that the new customer uses this specific and unique link to register. This is what is contained in the QR code. So, this type of advertising is not based on pure philanthropy. Still, we would have expected this type of advertising to be a purely internet-based model - and not one found in the parking lot of a supermarket.\nOur verdict: Curious and interesting, but not really dangerous. What is \"Affiliate Marketing\"?\nAffiliate Marketing is a primarily internet-based sales method, where a partner (called an \"affiliate\" in this case) advertises a certain product or service. Depending on the model, they are provided with a unique link or ad banner which they can distribute as they see fit. If someone uses the affiliate's link, the company knows that this visitor has been directed to their website by clicking that particular affiliate's link or banner. The commission that an affiliate receives can be based on different factors. A commission might be paid if the visitor subsequently buys something from a shop (this is a model frequently used by Amazon, for instance). Other models might pay the affiliates based on whether a certain program is installed (\"pay per install\") or if a new user successfully registers for a service (\"pay per registration\").", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin mining", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim berghoff bitcoin mining", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T19:49:45.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "646f991bb9466b05903461259f16985e6713ac8d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNFWkNly87OODjUUPmFh0qleYcktFfER71sOwBYZjT3xBXHFFPOstl.MOJh7atZks84AONUEBTtAQgMKdbAW6O1I-", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/news-btc", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "NewsBTC - Barchart.com", "title": "Key Points Bitcoin price moved higher and broke a", "title_full": "Key Points Bitcoin price moved higher and broke a", "published": "2018-06-07T11:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.008, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "646f991bb9466b05903461259f16985e6713ac8d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNFWkNly87OODjUUPmFh0qleYcktFfER71sOwBYZjT3xBXHFFPOstl.MOJh7atZks84AONUEBTtAQgMKdbAW6O1I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aayush Jindal", "published": "2018-06-07T11:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Key Points Bitcoin price moved higher and broke a", "text": "Key Points Bitcoin price moved higher and broke a major resistance near $7,650 against the US Dollar. Yesterday\\u2019s highlighted major bearish trend line with resistance at $7,645 was breached on the hourly chart of the BTC\\/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may correct a few points in the short term, but dips remain supported around $7,600.\nBitcoin price is building bullish momentum above $7,600 against the US Dollar. BTC\\/USD remains buy on dips near the $7,600 and $7,500 support levels. Bitcoin Price Analysis\nThe past three sessions were positive as bitcoin price managed to gain traction further above $7,500 against the US Dollar. The BTC\\/USD pair traded slowly higher and broke a few important hurdles near $7,600 and $7,650. There was a proper close above the $7,600 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. A high was formed at $7,753 and the price is currently correcting gains.\nDuring the upside, yesterday\\u2019s highlighted major bearish trend line with resistance at $7,645 was breached on the hourly chart of the BTC\\/USD pair. If the price corrects lower from the current level, it may find support above $7,600. On the downside, an initial support is near $7,675, which was a resistance earlier . Below this, the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $7,355 low to $7,753 high. However, the most important support on the downside is near $7,600 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nLooking at the chart , the price is clearly trading with a bullish bias above $7,600. On the upside, a break above the recent high at $7,753 may perhaps open the doors for a push above $7,800. Above this, the next stop for buyers might be close to the $8,000 level.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\nHourly MACD \\u2013 The MACD for BTC\\/USD is now back in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \\u2013 The RSI is moving nicely and is currently well above 55 level.\nMajor Support Level \\u2013 $7,600\nMajor Resistance Level \\u2013 $7,750\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC\\/USD Dips Remain Supported ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T13:00:26.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "733bb86d9b5a85680fec88ff5d7a694b84cbedbd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTextAUhAOTc8FQ9_Wg2Rw0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=5.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Marketplace", "title": "Target Market of Bitcoin", "title_full": "Target Market of Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-07T10:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "733bb86d9b5a85680fec88ff5d7a694b84cbedbd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTextAUhAOTc8FQ9_Wg2Rw0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "winterland", "published": "2018-06-07T10:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Target Market of Bitcoin", "text": "Quote: from: BlackPanda on May 31, 2018, 07:46:38 AM Quote: from: winterland on May 30, 2018, 10:19:16 PM Quote: from: @darkangel on January 17, 2018, 10:46:39 AM Kindly enumerate all the target market of Bitcoin.\nMany people now loves doing bitcoin because of the advantages of doing so but the fact is many of them are still not aware of what does the Bitcoin do and how does it work. And the list of knowledge about Bitcoin is too small.\nThats why I am asking now, who must be the Target Market of Bitcoin?\nThank you.\nThe first target of bitcoin should be to become the currency of the internet, right now paypal is the system of payments everyone uses to settle payments over the internet so what we need is that bitcoin surpasses paypal and that everyone uses bitcoin in the same way they use paypal once that happen we can set our sights in bitcoin becoming used in the real world.\nYes the first time that must be achieved is to be the majority of financial transactions on the internet, by defeating the amount of transactions that can be achieved by paypal then Bitcoin can be a majority and then become the main choice. Bitcoin does offer a very remarkable thing, convenience and security being the most attractive thing that many people are interested in. That is the initial target that must be achieved by Bitcoin and then is Bitcoin can be a currency that is used globally.\nExactly, if bitcoin cannot beat paypal a simple payments system how it is going to beat a national currency? So that is the first thing that bitcoin needs to do and if bitcoin is able to do that in the next 10 years then without a doubt the future of bitcoin will be bright and I really think that bitcoin will be able to do that without too much of a trouble.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T09:48:46.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "72f445f608904fa71547e178bb0b47b866bc51f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYhr.7_6CWmgialL5P9_jsmkKyebet302tHr87dAHo1QvjGjKKFx8.o9a3oUEADyaDCdWgJPCawOtuFY3Tdpa9wlbCo4gVhc3k-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "\"The single most important difference between Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core is that Bitcoin Cash is not controlled by Bitcoin Core developers.

June 7, 2018 232\nThe cryptocurrency market has been experiencing faint signals of recovery when top-5 crypto giants went green yesterday. It seems as though the market could turn to a bullish trend for the remainder of the week if nothing bad happens. Even when the market is struggling for a complete reversal of last week’s damage, Bitcoin Cash is performing better than other cryptos effortlessly. On 4 th June Bitcoin cash nearly doubled its figure over 7 days. All that’s left to see is whether BCH markets can maintain this uptrend.\nBitcoin Cash’s Trading Volume\nBitcoin cash community members have been comparing it with BTC in terms of gains, traction, adoption, volume etc. since the very beginning. The reason why BCH soars so high is that of its dedicated community members and investors. A cryptocurrency’s demand is measured by its volume which turns out to be a useful indicator while analyzing a crypto’s success rate. Analysts have indicated that BCH market’s increasing volume might be the cause of its bullish trend. Currently, 13.26% of BCH volume is coming from OKEx where $88.3 million USD worth of Bitcoin Cash has exchanged hands at the individual price of $1131.50 USD while its total volume for the last 24 hours is close to $643 billion.\nJapanese Retailers Soon to Accept Bitcoin Cash\nSome experts believe that a bull run is just around the corner for Bitcoin cash. There’s been a revelation from Roger Ver, whom people know as cryptocurrency evangelist and promoter of Bitcoin cash that the currency might get adopted by thousands of Japanese retailers as a payment method and thus enter the Japanese market.\nAlthough it’s still just a hint which was given during a recent interview and not an official announcement, therefore, it’s still unknown as to when this adoption will take place. Roger Ver seemingly announced that some tens of thousands of convenience stores and retailers are up for accepting Bitcoin cash soon. This would allow people to buy stuff with BCH and also pay their bills with it. Ver has also pointed out towards the impending partnership with Menufly for accepting BCH as payment for its large-scale operations in major cities and bitbox to provide developing tools for devs utilizing Bitcoin cash network.\nBitcoinCashers.org Assists in Bitcoin Cash Adoption\nSince its inception, Bitcoin cash has been aiming towards becoming global payment mode and rule the sector by injecting the digital currency into the daily lives of people. Bitcoin Cash Foundation has made gradual advancements to clear BCH path by including more features in it and making it better than its core project, Bitcoin.\nBitcoin cash strives to be better suited for consumers as well as businesses and in countries with the high inflation rate, Bitcoin cash becomes more useful than fiat currencies. In order to quicken the pace of global adoption, the team behind Bitcoin cash has created BitCashers.org. One of the many purposes of BitCashers.org is that it is likely to promote Bitcoin cash as a ‘made for business’ crypto to the global audience and thus increase the number of BCH users substantially.\nZero Fee Transactions for BCH Miners\nThere’s one another of Bitcoin cash hitting headlines these days and it’s regarding a new initiative that convinces Bitcoin cash miners to process a limited number of 0 fee transactions in every block by removing dust limit. This initiative has gained support from many renowned individuals and companies such as Prof. Craig Wright who promotes Bitcoin. The said initiative turned heads when nChain and CoinGeek that their respective mining firms will start allowing their users to make transactions for a negligible fee (even less than 1 Satoshi i.e. $0.00001137). Through this initiative, some companies are aiming for Bitcoin Cash growth and promote competition free marketplace among miners.\nMarket Position\nThe total market capitalization of Bitcoin Cash is close to $19.4 billion USD according to CoinMarketCoin data at the time of writing. Having amassed such a huge market, Bitcoin cash is now available everywhere and assisting global vendors to make and accept payments directly without depending on any bank, government and payment service. It is presently ranked as the 4 th biggest cryptocurrency worldwide.\nConclusion\nBitcoin Cash undoubtedly has untapped potential to rise above the rest of the altcoins and change the course of crypto history by becoming the first forked digital asset that’s more profitable than its core project. There are many indications that Bitcoin cash may rise in the remaining week therefore, crypto enthusiasts believe that it might be good time to go all in. With new ideas like BitCashers.org, BCH team is actually trying to gain more attention from vendors, retailers and also developers from all over the world. If things go well, then $1500 mark can be possible to reach.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Happy with your 4% to 8% gains from the stock market? Satisfied with that safe 2% you garner from a high-interest savings account? Disagree with that. What about seeing 3000%, 5000% or even 10000% returns in only a few months? Welcome to the wonderful, beautiful, terrifying, intoxicating world of ICO’s, the very frontier lands of the wild west that is the crypto landscape. ICOs are hugely risky but can be hugely rewarding. Do understand that the market conditions change regularly and what coin may be a hot pick today or this week, may not be the case later. The current market clearly has thrown the idea of coin fundamentals out of the window. People are dumping money into coins based solely on hype without understanding the basics of market cap, coin supply, and coin fundamentals. It’s even worse with ICO’s where people will hand over their life savings to a dodgy, possibly anonymous team promising to deliver vast wealth with only a simple whitepaper and nothing else. Because there are virtually no regulations for ICO’s right now, there’s a lot of scams and dodgy money grab ICO’s that can lose you all your investment. So it’s very important you do the research to limit the potential risk. I want to make it clear. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. Do don’t go all into ICO’s lose all your money, then come back and blame me for your loses!\nICOs are risky and there is no avoiding that. But I’ve done very well on ICO’s and many many others have become multi mega millionaires by investing in ICOs. Crypto is becoming the greatest wealth redistribution on the planet, maybe of all time. And unlike previous examples, it’s the common man who’s getting in first, not the institutions. This is, in opinion, a once in a lifetime opportunity. A digital gold rush. The dotcom rush (i.e. the blockcoms) of our generation. Get in and make your money. Or watch from the sidelines while the few early birds with an appetite for risk make it rich. HOW MUCH CAN YOU MAKE FROM AN ICO? You can make ridiculous ROI’s if you choose an ICO that goes parabolic. A recent example for me (and some friends) was the ICON (ICX) ICO. The ICO price was around .10c per coin. As of the time of writing (3 weeks after ICO), ICX is worth about $11 dollars. I expect by the launch of the mainet Jan 24th, the coin will be worth $20 and after the end of January 2018, ICX may shoot up to $30 to $50. Certainly, ICON will be $100 or more by end of 2018. Right now at $11, ICON has given a return in fiat of more than 100x. That means if you put in $10,000 dollars into the ICO, you will now have about 1 million dollars. This is not some sort of lotto ticket that you hear about but never witness yourself. I have many friends who invested around $10,000 and are now closing on over a million USD. I myself made millions from ICX. And this is only one of half a dozen big ICO’s I’ve invested in over the past 7 months.\nSo ICO’s can and do make people rich. One ICO that goes parabolic is all you need to retire. ICO’s that go parabolic (i.e. explode in value many many times over) are not as rare as you think. I’ve had previous ICO’s I’ve done that have gone parabolic such as BQX (ETHOS) which went about 30x about a month out of ICO and six months later are valued at over 200x in value. There are some upcoming ICO’s I’ve done such as Wanchain, POA, Zilliqa that are due to hit the market in January that I’m expecting to go parabolic, going up 30x+ (and maybe 100-200x at least post-ICO over 2018). HOW TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT ICO. Now with practically a few ICO’s being launched every single day and hundreds per month, how do you sift through the shit to find the gems? There are many factors and variables to consider. But I’ll give you some basic guidelines that will help you choose the right ICO’s, or at least, help you avoid bad ones. I want to state that I firmly believe in trying to invest for the long term (as much as this is possible with blockchain) and to choose projects that look like they have lasting value, not short-term pump and dump coins of which 95% of the crypto market is formed. That means that I want to put money into a coin that I feel can actually deliver on their promise and bring something to market. I want to invest in projects that I feel will survive a market crash. With that said, let’s go over how to choose the best ICO’s.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [],

Directorate has questioned businessman and Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty ’s husband Raj Kundra for over eight hours in connection with alleged Bitcoin scam worth Rs 2000 crore.\nAccording to sources, the agency has questioned Kundra about other people he involved to promote Bitcoin. But now the Raj Kundra issues a statement clarifying his role in the whole scam. The statement read, “Mr Raj Kundra CMD of Viaan Industries Ltd was summoned by the Enforcement Directorate merely as a witness. An enquiry is underway by the concerned regulatory authorities and Mr Raj Kundra stands committed to extend all his cooperation to the law enforcement agency” Commenting on the articles, Mr Raj Kundra, CMD said “I am terribly disappointed by the irresponsible reporting carried out by some sections of the media. Clarity on the issue should have been sought before carrying such headlines. The authorities, summoned me merely as a witness, as the accused Amit Bharadwaj happens to be an acquaintance and some introductions were made hence there is a certain protocol being followed by the agencies. Amit Bharadwaj was intending to buy a team in our poker league and got into a contract with us for the same. However, he was expelled on account of non-payment of fees and I was called as a witness in this connection. While we continuously strive to keep taking steps to improve our reputation, these type of unconfirmed, baseless, reports severely dent our market perception and erode investor sentiments” He continued “Notwithstanding what has happened, at Viaan Industries, we shall continue to focus on growing our gaming and media vertical.

The company has been involved with the bitcoin ecosystem since 2011 and with the financial markets since the early 2000s. It was the second company to file for a bitcoin exchange-traded product with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC, however, repeatedly delayed deciding on the application.\nFounded in 1955, VanEck is an investment management firm offering mutual funds, exchange-traded products (ETP), variable insurance portfolios, separately managed accounts, and alternative investments. VanEck Vectors ETFs (about 75% of assets under management) and VanEck Mutual Funds (about 25% of assets under management) represent the company’s flagship investment offerings. It was first to file for a 40-Act bitcoin ETF, but withdrew the application last year after the SEC said it wouldn’t review a petition for a fund that intends to invest in virtual assets that aren’t yet available.\nThe companies announced on Wednesday that they will work jointly with regulators to list a physically-backed bitcoin ETF that will be insured against loss or theft of bitcoin. Under the arrangement, SolidX will act as the sponsor of the ETF and VanEck will provide marketing services. The ETF is expected to list on the CBOE BZX Equities Exchange.\nJan van Eck, Chief Executive Officer of VanEck, said that he believes that bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of ‘digital gold’ that may make sense for investors’ portfolios.\n“We believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process,” said van Eck. “A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin. It is important to communicate with investors about the risks as well as the opportunities, especially for new investment areas, and we have been committed to this effort.”\nDaniel H. Gallancy, Chief Executive Officer of SolidX, said that in determining a marketing partner, they looked for a firm with a clear understanding of the potential of bitcoin and the role it can play in an investment portfolio.\n“VanEck is deeply involved in this space, understands its potential, and has a long track record of successfully opening new avenues for investors to access unique and compelling investment opportunities,” said Gallancy. “We’re excited to work with the team at VanEck.”\nIn a public letter earlier this year, Dalia Blass, Director of the Division of Investment Management at the SEC, said that the division stands ready to engage in dialogue with sponsors regarding the potential development of bitcoin ETFs. But there are a number of significant investor protection issues that need to be examined before sponsors begin offering these funds to retail investors. These “issues” included concerns about market manipulations, whether funds could accurately value the volatile products, and whether investors can understand the risks.

We are most certainly negative in this market, and you can see that we can’t keep rallies going. If you been following me here at Daly Forex, you know I’m very bearish to this market. Quite frankly, when you look at the longer-term charts, it’s very clear that there is a major support level closer to the $6000 level, and I think that the market is trying to get there. Currently, I believe that selling rallies continues to be the best way going forward and it looks like we are rolling over a little bit during the day. So far, we have not managed to return to the $8000 level, which of course would be very bearish in and of itself.\nBTC\\/JPY\nBitcoin of course fell against the Japanese yen as well, failing at the same 20 SMA. I think that the market is going to struggle with the ¥850,000 level, the ¥900,000 level above there, and most certainly the ¥1 million level. The ¥700,000 level underneath has been major support more than once, and I think that the market is trying to work its way back down there. I would point out that the last attempt to reach the top of the consolidation area failed at the ¥1.1 million level, not reaching the top quite often will signify that the market is running out of upward momentum. I fully anticipate that it’s only a matter time before we break down below the ¥700,000 level, and make a fresh, new lows.

However, P2P finance platforms like Paxful recognize the opportunity cryptocurrency offers Africa.\nThe history of the African continent over the last few centuries hasn’t been exactly ebullient. Colonialism, massive food shortages, the spread of a number of virulent diseases, armed conflict, and unstable economies have all been elements that have shaped the ongoing development of Africa.\nYet a new economic and technological force is offering an unprecedented opportunity for those living in the so-called Dark Continent: cryptocurrency. The growing popularity and use of Bitcoin in Africa is allowing people to take their economic destiny into their own hands, and P2P finance platforms like Paxful are an integral part of this ongoing revolution. Troubles Abound\nThe vast natural resources of Africa were long exploited by numerous colonial powers. Eventually, those powers were forced to leave, but they left behind countries with very little in the way of infrastructure, a stable economy, and sound financial and educational systems. Civil strife between rival factions and natural disasters, such as crop failures, have only served to heighten the uncertainty that swirls across the continent.\nPeer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchanges in Africa understand that there many challenges facing Africans today. While inflation is manageable in a number of African countries, such as 2.71% in Zimbabwe and 3.6% in Namibia, inflation is rampant in many others, such as 12.48% in Nigeria , 18.7% in Libya, and an astounding 161.2% in South Sudan.\nThe result is that the average African is left helpless against economic, political, and military forces beyond their control. Fiat currency that is worth a set amount one day could be rendered worthless due to a change in regime. Banking institutions may curtail access to their services due to new laws being passed on the whim of a fickle central government. Yet such factors are actually conducive to the use of cryptocurrency being readily accepted and adopted by the average person. This is evident by the explosive growth in the popularity of Bitcoin in Africa . Providing Opportunities\nAt its heart, cryptocurrency represents freedom for the average African. For far too long, many people across the continent have been subjugated politically or economically by some form of centralized authority. Exchanges like Paxful, however, realize that the P2P finance element of cryptocurrency is sweeping away this subjugation and allowing individuals to forge their own economic destiny.\nCryptocurrency only requires a few elements that allow people to be an active participant in its ecosystem – a smartphone, a Bitcoin wallet , and an internet connection. As the infrastructure of many African countries leave a lot to be desired, the use of smartphones has exploded.\nThe use of such devices has doubled over the last few years, and half of the continent’s population has an active mobile phone subscription. People are now realizing that they no longer need access to a bank to be economically active. The millions of unbanked individuals in Africa can just pull out their smartphone to begin buying and selling in the crypto sphere.\nThe expanding use of Bitcoin in Nigeria and other nations highlights how people are realizing that cryptocurrency is a tremendous opportunity for the entire continent of Africa. It is true that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have a degree of volatility, but they are often far less than what the fiat of the various African nations undergo. Cryptocurrency is proving to be a stable store of value for many Africans.\nNot to mention that they can use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to transact business across national borders (as well as across the entire world) for extremely low costs and in a near-instantaneous manner. Instead of waiting days or weeks for a payment to go through via traditional financial institutions, with governments and banks slapping fees on every step of the journey, a person can use Bitcoin and their phone to complete the same process in a few minutes instead and for far cheaper.\nThe use of Bitcoin in Africa offers the opportunity of freedom. For one, it allows people to become part of the global cryptocurrency ecosystem. Individuals are no longer bound to their physical location’s socio-economic features (as well as any attendant red tape) when it comes to making financial decisions. In another use, cryptocurrency helps provide physical freedom to Africans. If a person feels oppressed and has the ability to flee somewhere else, they can easily take their financial wealth with them if it’s in the form of cryptocurrency. No longer is there the fear of a central bank closing its doors, not allowing account holders to gain access to their funds. A person can move across a border into a neighboring country and still be able to access their Bitcoin wallet .\nOverall, cryptocurrency is a tremendous opportunity for Africa. People can use their mobile phone, Bitcoin wallet, and internet connection to instantly join the global P2P finance marketplace of cryptocurrency. Lack of institutional financial access, rampant inflation, and political instability are all muted through the use of cryptocurrency.\nWhether one lives in Nigeria , Kenya, or Ethiopia, virtual currencies represent economic freedom to a region that has known far too little of said commodity. Virtual currency exchanges like Paxful understand the transformative power of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is having upon the continent.\nImages courtesy of Shutterstock\nBitcoinist does not endorse and is not responsible for or liable for any content, accuracy, quality, advertising, products or other materials on this page.

after 51% / double spend attacks Jun 7, 2018\nBitcoin Gold [BTG] has recently been hit by 51% / double spend attacks. The attack was in the middle of May and lasted three days. One important change that addresses this issue is a change in their Proof of Work [PoW] algorithm.\nIn addressing the topic of attacks, the BTG team said, on June 4th, that they will be using a newer version of the algorithm, called Equihash-BTG for the time being. The team also announced that most of the necessary components for the Network Upgrade had been coded, but needed more thorough testing.\nThey are still working on improving the mining software so that people can begin mining again, but this has to wait until the Network Upgrade is done. The progress on the update was going good, the team has told the readers to expect an announcement in the next three days.\nOther coins have been hit by similar attacks too, like Verge [XVG] and ZenCash [ZEN].\nThe team is also working on other safety features, like monitoring systems for the blockchain, mining network, and using established channels to rapidly communicate any risks to the exchanges. They are also co-operating with other coin development teams, both to share what they had learnt from the attacks as well as to work together for the safety of the crypto space.\nBitcoin Gold had chosen the Equihash as their algorithm. In early May, there was news that the dominant specialty crypto mining hardware maker, Bitmain , has released an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit [ASIC] miner for Equihash, which would allow it to mine BTG rapidly.\nASICs are cost-effective custom hardware built specifically for ‘mining’. This goes against the entire idea behind bringing about Equihash, a decentralized mining algorithm. The problem with traditional mining, like what occurs with Bitcoin, is that the mining is centralized. People with specialty hardware are the ones who can engage in mining, and specialty hardware requires investment.\nSo, the equihash algorithm was born, the brainchild of Prof. Alex Biryukov. Their intention was to remove mining from being localized to just a few members of the blockchain located in geographically small pockets. It is based on a computer science and cryptography concept called the Generalized Birthday Problem.\nOne way of bringing ‘mining’ back to non-specialized PCs was to return mining power back to GPUs, inbuilt in most of the PCs that roll out today. The PoW algorithm and its implementation could be changed so that an exorbitantly large amount of investment is required to efficiently mine said a coin. Equihash, for example, requires a certain ‘minimum’ amount of memory from hardware to run, but it needs several times more memory for efficiency.\nPaul, a Twitter user comments:\n“Great. It’d be even better if everyone was able to get their BTG and YOU were more committed to making that happen.”\nAnother Twitterati says:\n“Better technology will create all the luck we need :)”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin gold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T11:40:23.030+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd323185b6774ee957cae42298ee37feb5467e9e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRdc0wa1Lj_U7LBBIvU7.8PfYiQ25dhyJovJl3XNqpW2JrJj8O8iNaebtITghu78kPPOOmZlm8NL9yuB3Vf4bDPuO9uxvhMEV_Abz_VIVoOAsIaEyL1z5krKBl_IIKUDypWK2jtWYLmiYooKNJppuOy", "site_full": "hardforum.com", "site": "hardforum.com", "site_section": "https://hardforum.com/forums/h-ard-ocp-front-page-news.116/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "[H]ard|OCP Front Page News | [H]ard|Forum", "title": "Bitcoin Price Forecast to Double as Experts Revise Cryptocurrency Predictions", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Forecast to Double as Experts Revise Cryptocurrency Predictions | [H]ard|Forum", "published": "2018-06-07T09:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.224, "main_image": "https://hardforum.com/styles/hardforum/xenforo/avatars/avatar_male_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 15319, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dd323185b6774ee957cae42298ee37feb5467e9e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRdc0wa1Lj_U7LBBIvU7.8PfYiQ25dhyJovJl3XNqpW2JrJj8O8iNaebtITghu78kPPOOmZlm8NL9yuB3Vf4bDPuO9uxvhMEV_Abz_VIVoOAsIaEyL1z5krKBl_IIKUDypWK2jtWYLmiYooKNJppuOy", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Montu", "published": "2018-06-07T09:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Forecast to Double as Experts Revise Cryptocurrency Predictions", "text": "Some cryptocurrency experts say that bitcoin prices are going to double this year even though the prices have been stagnant for several months now.

Therefore, Wozniak joins Jack Dorsey, general manager of Twitter and Square, in his enthusiastic belief that Bitcoin will become the only world currency: \"I'm entering what Jack Dorsey says. I am not fully convinced that this will happen, but I certainly believe and I want it to be so \". At the Consensus Blockchain conference in New York, as reported by CNET, Dorsey also stated: \"Customers can now buy and sell Bitcoins using the application. We noticed that this is a trait that our clients seek and we support Bitcoin because we see it as a step in the long-term path towards greater financial access for all\".\nDorsey was right. Because Square, Inc. added BTC functions to its payment applications, the value of its shares increased significantly. As a result, in April last year, Dan Dolev, an analyst at Nomura Instinet, believing that this rising trajectory is likely to continue, raised Square's target price from $ 50 million to $ 65 million.\nDorsey and Wozniak remain faithful to their vision that the Internet will eventually have only one currency, most likely Bitcoin. Some time ago, Wozniak announced that Bitcoin is better than gold, and Dorsey added: \"Bitcoin will overtake the dollar in importance as it will become the global internet currency in a decade\".\nAs usual, time will tell.\nLet's now take a look at the Bitcoin technical picture at the H4 time frame. The marked has bounced from the weekly pivot support at $7,304 and now is testing the local technical resistance at the level of $7,752. If this level will get violated, then the bulls will have the chance to test the key technical resistance at the level fo $7,890 and the whole breakout higher will remain valid. Moreover, a breakout higher would indicate the low of the wave 2/B is in place.\n*The market analysis posted here is meant to increase your awareness, but not to give instructions to make a trade.

Moser clarified this suggesting that so far it had been “well tolerated” due in part to the crypto haven tag and a balanced approach to initial coin offerings (ICOs) and had become an attractive fintech magnet for many companies.\nMartin Etheridge, head of division at the Bank of England, somewhat hedged his bets expressing, “who knows what the future will hold”, although he did say that he saw little prospect of fiat being overtaken or replace by cryptocurrency:\n“[But] I think the odds are stacked very much in favor of fiat currencies. I think it would take a pretty fundamental shift of public perception or the existing market system for it to happen.”\nDr Marius Jurgilis of the Bank of Lithuania clarified that a central bank-issued cryptocurrency and a cryptocurrency are not the same things, adding that the main product of a central bank is “a matter of trust”:\n“…but if the society starts questioning, or it if it thinks that the things we are selling could be got in a cheaper, more convenient way, other things will appear.”\nHe added it was this level of trust that his country’s banks were guarding while admitting that the bank’s position was not totally entrenched. In mid-April, Lithuania’s central bank reportedly began looking into cryptocurrencies, round tabling points of view from all sectors, including regulators and investors.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews\nThe post 20/20 Central Bank Execs Forum Agrees Bitcoin No Threat Yet to Fiat appeared first on BitcoinNews.com .

Transliterating English words into a Slavic language written in Cyrillic, however, is not always a straightforward process. Two spelling forms have gained popularity in Russia, but which is the correct one? Other Slavic nations face a similar challenge. Besides, each one of them seems to have its own idea of how to write bitcoin with Cyrillic letters.\nAlso read: Russian Railways Eyes Crypto for Tickets, Blockchain for Cargo Биткоин, Биткойн, Біткоїн, Биткојн – Bitcoin\nTransliterating words from one language into another can sometimes spawn a number of spellings with none of the alternatives being a true original. This is often the case with borrowed terms describing new inventions that have to be written in a script different from the one they originated from. The word “bitcoin” is no exception – it is an invention, and it is a new term. Its introduction into Slavic languages using the Cyrillic alphabet has produced many spelling variations, with almost each nation “inventing” its own bitcoin, or биткойн I should say.\nBulgarians , who liked and adopted the Cyrillic script a millennium ago, have decided, unofficially, to spell bitcoin the way it is pronounced in English and in their Slavic language – “биткойн.” Their closest linguistic relative, the Macedonians, write it “биткоин,” true to their commitment to be different. The short unstressed i-vowel “й” (as in /aɪ/ or /kɔɪn/) is missing from their version of the Cyrillic alphabet. No worries, we can still read it.\nUkrainians , who probably have more “i”-s than just about any other Slavs (и, й, і, ї,) have chosen to use two or three of those in their spellings of bitcoin – “бiткойн” and “біткоїн.” That adds a little Latin flavor, although truth be told, the “dotted i” was indeed part of the early Cyrillic alphabets and they have kept it to this day. Belarusians also write it “біткойн.” Serbs, who use a Latin script alongside the Cyrillic, spell it “биткојн” in. Gosh, now there is a “j” in it… Bitcoin Making its Way into the Russian Spelling Dictionary\nRussia , by far the largest Slavic country and most famous user of the Cyrillic script, has a dilemma. Both “биткоин” and “биткойн” are used to refer to the cryptocurrency in Russian media and by the local crypto community, although “биткоин” is more popular. The question about the correct spelling has sparked multiple discussions in Russian crypto forums. The rule applied to other English loanwords says bitcoin in Russian should be spelled with the short “й” in the second syllable. But as it often happens with living languages, people prefer the incorrect “и” version.\nA high-ranking representative of the Institute of Russian Language, under the Russian Academy of Science, has recently spoken in favor of adding “биткоин” to the Russian Orthographic (spelling) Dictionary, local media reported. “The question of including the word “биткоин” in the dictionary seems to me well-grounded,” Oksana Grunchenko, senior researcher and head of the referral service at the Institute, told the Moscow News Agency .\nGrunchenko expressed regret that bitcoin didn’t make it into the Russian Explanatory Dictionary. Its “Б” (B) volume went out without it. “But since the word “биткоин”, or “биткойн”, represents a spelling challenge too, I think it will find its place on the pages of the orthographic dictionary,” she added indicating that both spellings may be accepted. “If both are included, we can talk about variability of the norm,” she explained, noting that there are other examples of that in Russian.\nI don’t want to say that but maybe we, the Slavs writing in Cyrillic, do need some central authority to sort things out… Although, that has never really worked well here. Besides, it’s not just bitcoin – I am pretty sure we have the same issue when spelling “core” and “cash.”\nDo you think adding bitcoin to a dictionary is a recognition of its importance?

Advertisements\nAlso Read: Cryptocurrency Exchanges Are Drowning in Tokens Latin American NGOs Team Up to Launch Bitcoin Awareness Campaign\nNon-government organizations Bitcoin Argentina and Bitcoin Americana have begun ‘Bitcoineta‘ – a minivan tour across Argentina designed to bolster bitcoin awareness and adoption.\nThe tour will see the van visit numerous Argentine villages and small cities, with the tour seeking to emphasize the use-cases for bitcoin at a grassroots level. After traveling across Argentina, Bitcoineta then hopes to embark on an awareness campaign across Latin America.\nThe project seeks to target disparate social demographics that can benefit from greater cryptocurrency adoption. Gabriel Kurman, one of the founders of the Bitcoineta project, stated, “It’s a dream to bring bitcoin and blockchain technology to Latin America to those people who do not have access to knowledge. The [goal] of ​​Bitcoineta is to reach every small town and city in Argentina, and then the rest of America, teaching people how they can benefit from this technology.”\nThe two organizations purchased the minivan together, and equipped the vehicle with necessary amenities, and installed a projector that will be used to screen educational films. Sowing the Seeds of Bitcoin Adoption\nThe Bitcoineta van began its journey on June 1st. The first destination for the campaign is Chascomús, a small city located 123 kilometers (approximately 76.4 miles) south of Argentina’s capital of Buenos Aires. After Chascomús, Bitcoineta is then scheduled to visit Las Toninas, Tandil, Necochea, Tres Arrollos, Villa Ventana, Bahía Blanca, Pergamino, Junín, Chacabuco and Chivilcoy in Buenos Aires, and various destinations in the provinces of La Pampa, Santa Fe, and Córdoba.\nJulian Drangosch, a university professor from the National Technological University of Argentina, offered praise to the Bitcoineta project, stating, “The first times you hear about these technologies, it is difficult to understand all the implications that you have today and in the future, and to start sowing this blockchain seed in the different communities will allow us to collect the fruits in a few years.”\nDo you think that bitcoin will see widespread adoption across Latin America in coming years?

That wild eyed bull that had been away, has reappeared as Bitcoin price just broke $7,700! Question is, will the bears go quietly or will BTC continue trading sideways as the bears maul it into submission? Market Overview\nIt’s in tumultuous times such as these that investors should just kick back and relax. Take a deep breath, read a book, binge watch Netflix or just listen to Thin Lizzy as we at Bitcoinist love to do…hence the not so subtle mash up of the Thin Lizzy’s chorus in the title.\nBitcoin had been doing so well, climbing past $7,500 USD late last week and the move toward $7,700 was especially pleasant. For a moment, it almost appeared that McAfee’s prediction was coming true before our eyes, then with one fell swoop bitcoin price collapsed and it looks like we’re going back under $7,500 again.\nAnyhow, let’s get to it and see what’s happening with bitcoin. Daily Chart\nOn June 4th, BTC dropped from the ascending wedge, signaling a bullish-to-bearish trend change as the cryptocurrency failed to find footing above $7,500 and $7,650.\nFollowing the rising wedge breakdown, BTC nearly closed below $7,500 and the downtrend that started on May 5th continues as bears have mauled BTC back into the descending channel.\nAt the time of writing, BTC trades below the ascending wedge trendline, inside of the descending channel and a quick glance at the moving averages shows the 20-day MA well below the 50 and 100-day MA. The 100-day MA slopes downward, touching the 50-day MA at $8,482, which is a sign of bearish pressure.\nA glance at the the 1 hour chart (not pictured here) shows the 5 and 10-day MA crossed in steep descent and the RSI has fallen from 58 to 44 without any signs of a turn around. The Stoch also resides in overbought territory and appears to be reversing direction as the signal lines have crossed and begun to descend.\nThe general outlook portrays bears as having the advantage and a BTC close below $7,500 is likely to bring on further decline in BTC price. 4HR Chart\nGenerally, the 4 hour chart is quite similar to the daily chart, except for the 5-day MA ever so slightly above the 10 and 50-Day MA, though at the time of writing the 5-day MA has also rounded down and is hiding behind that big red candle.\nThe 10-day MA is beginning to put some distance between itself and the 50-day MA by inching its way up toward the 5-day MA; and while this does not appear to be a period of consolidation, the slope upwards in combination with a series of doji candlesticks at least shows the presence of some bullish pressure as BTC struggles to overtake $7,600. Bitcoin Price: Looking Ahead\nBTC will need to reach $7,850 in order for bulls to regain control.\nA close below the 50-day MA ($7,530) could see BTC drop to the nearest support at $7,365 and the absence of buyers could see the price drop as low as $7,200 – $7,000 again.\nAs suggested last week , if bears manage to retake control, BTC could re-enter the ascending wedge at $7,800 and in the event of high volume buying BTC could rise as high as the 50-day MA at $8,450 (daily chart). Traders should keep an eye on volume in order to gain insight on the strength of any upward movement.\nIn the meantime, it’s safe to assume that the majority of buyers are waiting patiently on the sidelines and since it’s good to always try and end things on a high note, we’ll leave you with this…\nThe 12th of June is a mere 5 days away and in the event of a miscast prediction , the cryptocurrency community can at least look forward to McAfee’s 2020 run for POTUS .\n[Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are not intended as investment advice.

Bitmain’s founder, cryptocurrency billionaire Jihan Wu, told Bloomberg that Bitmain is considering an initial public offering as it expands into producing hardware for AI computing.\nBitmain Technologies, the world’s largest producer of mining chips, might be considering an IPO, Bloomberg reports.\nThe company, which is run by 32-year-old cryptocurrency billionaire Jihan Wu, has become a global force in the burgeoning cryptocurrency mining industry since it was founded five years ago. In June, Wu told Bloomberg that Bitmain made $US2.5 billion in revenue in the year 2017 alone. Now, the company’s success might have Wu considering taking it public.\nRecently, Bitmain has been tinkering with another kind of hardware beyond mining chips. The company has expressed interest in developing custom chips to compute in the field of artificial intelligence, called application-specific integrated circuits.\nWu suggested to Bloomberg that Bitmain’s interest in expanding into AI hardware might eventually lead to an initial public offering. The listing, Wu said, would most likely occur overseas; Hong Kong was mentioned as a possible option.\n“Bitmain is trying very hard to maintain its advantage,” Wu told Bloomberg.\nRead the full story over at Bloomberg here.

He said a segment about buying Ripple’s XRP epitomized the “peak nonsense” of the bitcoin mania that swept financial media and markets.\nMike Novogratz, the famed hedge funder turned crypto-enthusiast, poked a little fun at a segment on financial news network CNBC when describing to rival Bloomberg News the crypto hype that marked the very start of 2018.\n“ CNBC, not to pick on CNBC, but I think I can since I am here, they literally had a show where they were one by one walking people through how to buy the Ripple, the XRP coin, literally when it was trading at $3.20 having moved from $0.20 8 weeks earlier,” Novogratz said speaking to Bloomberg’s Erik Schatzker .\nNovogratz said that was “peak nonsense.”\nRipple’s XRP, a bitcoin rival, was technically trading above $2.57 when CNBC broke down how to buy it on exchange operator Poloniex on January 5 . Still, the crypto market was red-hot then, with the entire market racing towards an all-time high market capitalization above $830 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. XRP ultimately fell to $0.49 on April 5.\nTo be sure, many publications created walk-throughs for readers and viewers on how to purchase crypto-assets during the run-up. Business Insider published “Ripple’s XRP is the hot new cryptocurrency – here’s how you buy it” in January when Ripple was trading at approximately $2 a token.\nThe second-half of 2017 also saw the rise of initial coin offerings, a quick way to raise funds using cryptocurrency. Many of these fundraisers were promoted by celebrities such as Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather.\nNovogratz said this phenomenon might be the reason regulators started to clamp down in 2018. But it is something Novogratz, who is building out a crypto merchant bank, thinks is a positive sign for the market.\n“So we are going to knock out some of the crap from the system,” he said. “It is healthy.”\nNotably, the Securities and Exchange Commission hit a number of cryptocurrency company with subpoenas . It also recently promoted V alerie Szczepanik to lead its new cryptocurrency enforcement unit. The New York Attorney General’s office earlier this year launched an inquiry into cryptocurrency exchanges.\nThe question now hanging over the space is whether regulators will deem crypto assets as securities, which would require entities that facilitate crypto trading to subscribe to a whole range of regulations.\n“I bet dimes to donuts [regulators] will say ‘ethereum probably was a security but it is not anymore,'” Novogratz said.\nNovogratz said there are about 200 tokens in regulatory “no-man’s land.”\nJay Clayton, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, didn’t provide additional clarity during an interview Wednesday with CNBC.\n“ I’m not going to comment on specific crypto assets and whether they are a security or are not a security,” Clayton told CNBC’s Bob Pisani.\nCNBC declined to comment.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/01/05/crypto-class-how-to-buy-ripple.html", "http://www.addthis.com/help/api-spec", "http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-buy-ripple-xrp-a-step-by-step-guide-2018-1", "http://www.businessinsider.com/the-top-financial-watchdog-is-going-after-the-ico-market-with-a-wave-of-subpoenas-2018-2", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2018-06-05/novogratz-says-regulators-caught-flat-footed-on-cryptocurrencies-video"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mike novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erik schatzker", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T10:24:51.070+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d77f9ff29d9a9cf682cf8aad163446d989cdd997", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCA3M_123tl5.wuprp7KtCn74cx2J2MfDXL74eAnP2xjzQimW1AyywhRlU_X89XXLuPyXIX3gWxZ87G85f.Tvdn3LU7jruFREJhH7K2aNGI_gPQEFSqW.i8D", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "CryptoCurrencies", "title": "Texas Serves Bitcoin Investment Company with Cease and Desist Order", "title_full": "Texas Serves Bitcoin Investment Company with Cease and Desist Order : CryptoCurrencies", "published": "2018-06-07T08:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.111, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d77f9ff29d9a9cf682cf8aad163446d989cdd997", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCA3M_123tl5.wuprp7KtCn74cx2J2MfDXL74eAnP2xjzQimW1AyywhRlU_X89XXLuPyXIX3gWxZ87G85f.Tvdn3LU7jruFREJhH7K2aNGI_gPQEFSqW.i8D", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CryptoCoinCache", "published": "2018-06-07T08:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Texas Serves Bitcoin Investment Company with Cease and Desist Order", "text": "submitted by /u/CryptoCoinCache\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cryptocoincache.com/texas-serves-bitcoin-investment-company-with-cease-and-desist-order/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T04:08:38.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3bf86a12cad66126b93c7f28916086e49a6a7f0e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNCfTz9qqsYGWNaWwiHyCw5sdwPKha7YAwJ1dZqIWdYqz62DZCHdyV2KWILwWPABaTEct3390cxDQdvnnlvIYg0yp0TH1mVniwQ--", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/news-btc", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "NewsBTC -

Technical indicators, however, show mixed signals as the moving averages are bullish while oscillators suggest another drop.\nBitcoin price has resumed its climb after another dip to the bottom of its short-term channel, indicating that bulls are not letting up.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is still above the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the upside or that the uptrend is more likely to resume than to reverse. These moving averages are also close to the bottom of the channel to add to its strength as support.\nHowever, RSI is starting to turn lower to signal a return in bearish pressure. Stochastic is moving up but in the overbought region to reflect slowing bullish momentum and a potential drop back to support.\nIf bulls continue to stay in the game, bitcoin price could resume the climb to the top of the channel near the $8,000 mark. An upside break could lead to a steeper climb while resistance holding could spur another pullback to the bottom around $7,700.
