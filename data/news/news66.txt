Mr. Hanyecz describes his dealings with Satoshi as having been \"kind of weird.\"\nAlso Read: Moon Missions and Custom Wallets: Bitcoin Community Celebrates Pizza Day\nEarly BTC Developer Discusses Email Exchanges with Satoshi Mr. Hanyecz, a programmer known in the bitcoin world for paying a man from Bitcointalk.org 10,000 BTC to order him two pizzas from Papa John's in 2010, discussed his personal interactions with Satoshi Nakamoto in a recent interview .\nAfter mining bitcoins on his laptop for some time, Mr. Hanyecz reached out to Satoshi to express his desire to contribute to the development of bitcoin. \"I thought bitcoin was awesome, and I wanted to be involved, but I had a regular developing job,\" Hanyecz said. \"Nakamoto would send me emails like 'Hey, can you fix this bug?' 'Hey, can you do this?'\"\nMr. Hanyecz \"Didn't Want the Responsibility\" Despite his enthusiasm for bitcoin, Mr. Hanyecz saw his contributions to the cryptocurrency as a side project of secondary importance to his career, and felt as though Satoshi had unrealistic expectations of his involvement.\n\"He'd say, 'Hey, the west side's down,' or 'We have these bugs – we need to fix this.' I'd be like, we? We're not a team,\" Mr. Hanyecz said. \"I thought that it was approval from him, that maybe he accepted me as a member. But I didn't want the responsibility. I didn't really understand all of the forces that were going on at the time.\"\nOn occasion, Mr. Hanyecz would express his dissatisfaction, recounting that he would say \"Hey, you're not my boss.\" Despite the irritation, Mr. Hanyecz states that he \"didn't take it too seriously.\"\nInteractions with Satoshi Consistently Gave Mr. Hanyecz \"A Weird Feeling\" Mr. Hanyecz describes the majority of his interaction with bitcoin's creator to be \"kind of weird.\"\nMr. Hanyecz found Satoshi to paranoid in many of their exchanges, stating \"There were a few times when I got messages that seemed off-base. I brushed them off because I was like, who cares if this guy tells me to go pound sand and go away? This wasn't my job or anything – it was a hobby. I was trying to be friends with him. He seemed very paranoid about people breaking the software. He kept calling it 'prerelease,' and I was helping him get it to release.\"\nLooking back, Mr. Hanyecz can empathize with Satoshi's apparent paranoia, stating that \"If anything had happened to the code early on, we wouldn't be having this conversation today.\"\nSatoshi Weary of Mining Centralization According to Mr. Hanyecz, Satoshi Nakamoto was aware of the potential for mining to lead to centralization in bitcoin ownership, stating that Satoshi told him \"Well, I'd rather not have you do the mining too much.\"\nMr. Hanyecz stated that \"[Satoshi] was trying to grow the community and get more commerce use cases. He fully recognized that mining would become a thing where a few people would get wealthy.\"\nMr. Hanyecz also stated that Satoshi was careful to maintain anonymity, stating \"He or she or whoever it was never told me anything personal. I asked a few questions, but he always dodged them. Those questions never got answered.\"\nWhat's your interpretation of the person behind the Satoshi Nakamoto enigma?

Sparks is a big believer in Bitcoin technology and thinks that someday in the future it will revolutionize the entire adult industry. Furthermore, Sparks is planning to film a few tutorials on how to use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but with a catch — Brenna plans on filming the educational videos naked. We decided to chat with Brenna about cryptocurrencies so our readers can get an in-depth view of how digital currencies like Bitcoin could transform the sex industry from someone who has a close perspective on how these business models operate.\nAlso read: Bitcoin Ownership: Your Private Keys to Financial Sovereignty\nCryptocurrency Will Solve All of the Current Problems in the Adult Industry News.Bitcoin.com (BC): Can you tell our readers how you first got into bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?\nBrenna Sparks (BS): Silkroad! I lived in a boring old town with nothing to do, and I wanted to get weed but didn't know any dealers. I heard about Silkroad and was guided to using Bitcoin like that, spending hundreds of Bitcoins like it was nothing. Back then I bought my Bitcoins from Silkroad members, using Greendot Moneypaks. I literally gave them money and hoped that I could trust this criminal to give me the Bitcoins! Ahhh…good times. At least, I wasn't Goxxed.\nBC: You recently wrote a blog post about cryptocurrencies providing workers in the adult industry censorship resistance from payment processor discrimination. What prompted you to write that post?\nBS: It's something that isn't talked about often. Most of the people in the industry don't really discuss how we can make our industry more advanced and safer from a tech perspective. Everyone, just sort of deals with it and has an \"if it ain't totally broke, it doesn't need fixing\" perspective. Also, because of the taboo nature of the adult industry, many of the industry issues have a hard time getting heard by the rest of the world, so problems have been slowly piling up in the background over the years.\nMy belief is that I should alert the world of potential opportunities, because if the current people in the industry don't want to build it further, someone else will. The crypto industry is full of visionaries, so I believe sharing these problems with the crypto community will gain attention from one of these visionaries who could actually make these changes happen, because it's become obvious that no one in the adult industry will do it. As time goes on, I'll grow to be more elaborate on the matter.\nBC: What do you think about libertarian and free market views involved with cryptocurrencies?\nBS: This question reminds me of a time a while back when I thought to myself, \"What if I could choose where my tax money went to? What if I could see exactly where it all went and when?\" A few years later, this started becoming a clear reality with cryptocurrencies. The technology that exists today can completely turn the government upside down, and that would be a good thing. Technology is the way of the future.\nTechnology brings order, brings stability, brings growth, brings hope for a better future, not a government.\nI believe cryptocurrency provides many of the things a libertarian wish they could have. It's a medium that allows us, merchants of the world, to exchange in a modern and reliable way that is free from the government, built on protocols that are open to the public to view and contribute to. Cryptocurrencies are changing the way we interact at an increasingly massive scale. We can fund whatever we wish to fund, we can raise money in ways and speeds that were never possible, and for things that we, as individuals, want or need. It provides visionaries the ability to test the most ambitious ideas that no investor would ever be able to fund, which in my opinion translates to an increase in technological growth rate.\nFinally, cryptocurrencies automate a giant list of tasks that we unnecessarily delegate to our government. In other words, the government is doing too many things that it doesn't actually need to be doing. Humans may have various views on what is important to them, but we also share many as well. For example, a majority of human beings can agree that we need hospitals, we need proper health care, we need safe roadways and safe buildings. Even if some disagree, it doesn't matter, it'll get funded because that's something a majority mass will agree with, we don't need a government to \"guarantee\" that. Just as well, we don't need a government to tell us what is legal tender, we can do that ourselves.\nWe don't need a government producing that legal tender either, computers do a far better job at producing an acceptable medium of exchange. Finally, we don't need a government deciding what matters on our behalf. I believe a country of millions is much more capable of making decisions than a small handful of \"elected\" individuals. Governments of the past and present serve as a means to an end, that's all. The future is in less governing, and eventually no governing or autonomous governing that corresponds to a successful self-governed society (or societies). This is not to say that we don't need a government, but rather that we need a lot less of it.\nWorking at a Crypto-Friendly Establishment Felt Futuristic BC: What are your favorite cryptocurrencies right now?\nBS: Besides Bitcoin, I would say – SONM (SNM), Odyssey (OCN), Spankchain (SPANK), and Ark (ARK).\nBC: How do you envision cryptocurrencies helping individuals in the adult industry in the future?\nBS: I talk about this further below, but basically cryptocurrency will solve all of the current problems in the adult industry without creating major new problems in the process.\nBC: You recently tweeted that you planned on giving cryptocurrency lessons naked. Do you still plan on giving these lessons?\nBS: Yes, I'm in the process of filming it right now. At first, I thought about filming and releasing each video at a time, but I've decided to film multiple videos to ensure and schedule each release. My calendar is all over the place so I figured this is the best way to approach it.\nBC: When you work at clubs like the Legends Room how many tips have you gotten in cryptocurrency, and can you tell our readers what it's like working at a crypto-friendly establishment like that?\nBS: I was tipped pretty often in cryptocurrency, mainly because the clients had crypto and wanted to actually use it.\nWorking at a crypto-friendly establishment felt futuristic, for lack of a better word. It really feels like you're in a new world and it just feels right. When it came to using it, everything was straightforward and comfortable.\nCryptocurrency Takes the Best Parts of Cash and Debit Cards and Removes the Other Junk BC: Do you still use the Bitcoin.com Wallet?\nBS: As of this moment, no. Reason being is that most of my coins are in deep cold storage.\nBC: Are there any other people you know that work in the adult film industry that also accept cryptocurrencies?\nBS: Yep! There is a growing number of talent, both male and female, like Shelby Paris, Holly Hawkes, and Kyle Mason. I also have directors approaching me for help regarding crypto on set and on my social media. It's growing quietly, but noticeable. I believe camgirls and individual content produces will be the ones that utilize it the most though, especially in the early stages. I can only see it becoming a standard in the adult industry once a large number of people have become familiar enough with it.\nBC: Do you envision cryptocurrencies taking over the adult industry online in the future as far as payments are concerned for subscriptions, cam shows, pics, movies, and other services?\nBS: I definitely think so. For one, cam sites already use a token system so it'll be quite easy for camgirls to pick up on it. Escorts can perform a transaction safely and discretely, especially when using a privacy-oriented coin like Monero or Bitcoin Private. Production companies can skip using checks and performers can get paid same day. Production companies won't need to pose under different company names to get around bank etiquette. Performers don't need to explain where their legally obtained funds came from. Individual content producers can easily set up a reliable payment method for their customers without running through a processor that will shut them down and take their money.\nThese are just common issues and aren't even all that creative. This whole industry can be flipped around by cryptocurrency, for the betterment of it. Bottom line is, people love cash, but it's becoming more and more inconvenient to carry it. If a company like Brazzers had to pay everyone on set using cash, it'd be a nightmare for whoever is responsible for distributing the money. Our evolving lifestyle is pushing us to move our cash into a bank account and turn it into digital money which we can then use with a debit card, but then that has its plethora of problems and limitations attached to it too, many of which severely impact the adult industry.\nCryptocurrency takes the best parts of cash and debit cards and removes the other junk. I think life has shown that humans are very flexible with what they consider is money and what isn't. Cryptocurrency is just the natural step forward when it comes to using money in a modern society and I am convinced that that majority of us will adapt to it.\nBC: Since you got into bitcoin do you have a lot of cryptocurrency followers now on social media?\nBS: There has been a growing number of crypto followers on my twitter and it's all been pretty gradual. One day I figured I'd start mentioning crypto in passing, which led to more and more engagement from the crypto community. Now I'm starting to think that the future of my social media will consist mostly of crypto fans, which I'm okay with!\nCheck out our podcast series 'Humans of Bitcoin' featuring Brenna Sparks below.\nWhat do you think about cryptocurrencies transforming the adult industry?

News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system .

Bitcoin (BTC) Passed by 35mil Ethereum Unique Addresses", "text": "Bitcoin – Flippening? Bitcoin (BTC) Passed by 35mil Ethereum Unique Addresses 1 June 2018 8553\nIs the flippening upon us? Ethereum (ETH) advocates are citing block explorer Etherscan claim to passed 35 million unique addresses, a doubling in something like five months, averaging reportedly 100K a day. The last available figures for bitcoin core (BTC) addresses had them at roughly 25 million as of spring this year. ETH enthusiasts are insisting this is a positive step in the march to eventually snatch the number one coin by market capitalization spot.\nAlso read: India Rejects Venezuelan Crypto Despite 30% Discount Flippening Close or Just Hopeful Hype?\nHopeful hype is starting again in pockets of the crypto ecosystem, especially among Vitalik Buterin fans and ETH followers. It’s due to their long held belief the world’s second most popular cryptocurrency by market capitalization must eventually replace bitcoin core (BTC) at the top in what’s been dubbed the flippening. Hype is arguably the best word at the moment, if only because of that pesky market capitalization: as of publication , BTC has nearly three times the market cap of ETH, and 24 trading volume seems to follow a similar ratio.\nWhat is causing a restirring of such flippening just might be a relatively recent milestone. According to Etherscan, ETH has pulled out ahead of BTC in unique addresses, gaining something in the neighborhood of one hundred thousand per day. The number floating around is rather eye popping: 35 million uniques.\nBTC stopped marking the number earlier this year for a variety of reasons, so ETH followers’ celebrations are based mostly on supposition, inference. The last figures available for BTC had unique addresses around 24 million. Still, the leap passed BTC also includes active addresses, perhaps a more profound metric when attempting to make the ETH flippening case: ETH has over 500K, BTC about 25K less. BTC Might Have Only Itself to Blame\nAddresses do not equate to actual users, however. One ETH user can hold many addresses, and in the case of ETH smart contracts are also being smuggled in the numbers. Yet, wallets for the respective cryptos can be telling when placed against the above stats. Ethereum wallet address are reused as a matter of course, while bitcoin core wallet address are frequently particular to each transaction. By every rational theory, BTC should far outstrip ETH in at least this category. As explained, that’s not the case. Caveats include how the 100K per day number is actually quite a fall off from as soon as the beginning of this year when ETH was clocking 300K per day at times. The Crypto Winter sapped much of those records, and truth is only on-chain activity is being measured (to the exclusion of exchanges, for example). In terms of raw transaction numbers, ETH is crushing BTC, 800K to 200K.\nFor BTC enthusiasts, however, who insist including the counting of ETH smart contracts to be gilding the lily, cooking the books or whatever, are probably on the weak side of that argument. After all, as bitcoin cash (BCH) is beginning to show, increasing block size would allow for such use cases to have taken place, something the bitcoin core community has stubbornly refused to concede. Add to it gaffs in transaction fees and times, mempool congestion, plaguing BTC at the height of its price and corresponding media coverage only compounded block size issues. Should the flippening happen, the BTC community would have itself to blame.\nDo you think anything like the flippening is happening?

As I’ve mentioned many times, I do NOT recommend investing money that you can’t afford to lose. Nobody knows if Bitcoin will go up or down tomorrow – it’s just speculation. For me personally, I consider the money I invest to be my “Vegas Money”– meaning, I’m gambling it. If I win, then I win big. If I lose, then I’m not surprised and it was money that I could afford to lose. That’s why it’s important not to invest a significant porition of your money into it. So if you do invest, I believe it’s smart to start with smaller amounts.\nIn this video I share with you my bitcoin investment strategy. Have you been questioning whether you should buy bitcoin & other cryptocurrencies? If so, I’m here to give you my perspective on it. I’m not an expert on the topic, but my bitcoin investment strategy may help guide you in the right direction. Read Also: Market Segmentation - Oxford College of Marketing\nBitcoin is a form of digital currency that has gained popularity in the last few years. It is the first example of a growing category of money, known as cryptocurrency. Personally, I see bitcoin as a risky and volatile investment to make, as the government has yet to regulate it.\nThat being said, I do feel that there is a place in someone’s investment strategy for more risky investments that have the potential for a very high return or reward. Because of this, I have recently been investing in bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin.\nAre you ready to learn what my bitcoin investment strategy is? In the words of Warren Buffett, one of the world’s most successful investors of all time, “Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.” Make smart investments and build the financial foundation for your future today!

One of the aspects of bitcoin that you are likely to be able to take to the bank in the coming years, in regards to bitcoin is volatility and instability because as of now, and into the foreseeable future, bitcoin is continuing to experience an ongoing battle which is also about it's price and also relates to it's adoption.\nIt is quite likely that bitcoin has considerably less than 1% world-wide adoption, so even if there might be pockets of greater than 1% adoption, the overall adoption remains quite small, which is likely to continue to result in ongoing battles over BTC price - even while there may be periods in which BTC prices don't appear to be moving very much (periods of price consolidation, which might feel like less price movement for periods of time and corrections), but the battle is going continue, and as long as bitcoin continues to exist and does not get broken, the adoption will continue and likely stability would come once the market becomes somewhat mature and adoption is high.. such as 80% adoption? I am not proclaiming to know where bitcoin is going exactly, but it seems a lot more difficult to move the price when the overall market cap increases - and even beyond the market cap of gold, which is still 50x larger than bitcoin's current market cap.\nIf bitcoin's market cap would equal the market cap of gold, then each bitcoin would be valued in the $500k arena, and depending on how fast bitcoin reaches those kinds of prices might depend on whether bitcoin becomes stable (which also seems doubtful to be stable any time soon). Perhaps 100x the market cap of gold might bring some longer term \"stability\" to bitcoin?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T07:08:23.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d210b4c36d76854973e2366f40a7d37a7581861d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSkSRzXVgyOZ2hIgtD9UShSHIN.sHXG2n3.QBQqQgE.uC1b4SCExndgt6Scxisxl8obDv_.96M5D6EvZmwMQy4qQYK33p3tM04sFyZAPRnYCWrgt8RHwNrQ", "site_full": "thecurrencyanalytics.com", "site": "thecurrencyanalytics.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/IpNewsflash-IpNewsWithinTheLast24Hours", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "IP Newsflash - news of the week", "title": "UK-Based Firm Successfully Trademarks the Name “Bitcoin” - The Cryptocurrency Analytics (0 visits)", "title_full": "UK-Based Firm Successfully Trademarks the Name “Bitcoin” - The Cryptocurrency Analytics (0 visits)", "published": "2018-06-02T09:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d210b4c36d76854973e2366f40a7d37a7581861d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSkSRzXVgyOZ2hIgtD9UShSHIN.sHXG2n3.QBQqQgE.uC1b4SCExndgt6Scxisxl8obDv_.96M5D6EvZmwMQy4qQYK33p3tM04sFyZAPRnYCWrgt8RHwNrQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-02T09:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "UK-Based Firm Successfully Trademarks the Name “Bitcoin” - The Cryptocurrency Analytics (0 visits)", "text": "UK-Based Firm Successfully Trademarks the Name “Bitcoin” June 2, 2018 Off By Steven Anderson\nPublic filings and multiple reports have shown that the A.B.C IPHoldings South West has successfully acquired a trademark for the name Bitcoin.\nA UK Company successfully copyrights the name bitcoin as their trademark. This week, crypto enthusiasts found out that the name Bitcoin had been trademarked using the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) in the UK last December.\nThe update came as a shock to a merchant who was selling t-shirts on Etsy with the Bitcoin name and was commanded to stop the operations and be held liable against the law. The letter states:\n“It has come to our client’s attention that you are offering for sale a wide selection of clothing bearing the Bitcoin trademark on Etsy.co.uk. You are not authorized to use the Bitcoin trademark and about clothing. Such use, therefore, is against the trademark infringement under Trademark Act of 1994.”\nContacting the company is quite a difficult task as there is a little information listed on the firm’s website. The trademark itself was filed last December 2017, reveals a list of goods that can’t bear the name without permission such as infant’s clothing, adult clothing, socks, headbands, shoes and everything that can be manufactured into the product. With the trademark number UK00003279106, the Bitcoin was officially registered into the IPO’s records last April 13, 2018.\nThe said filing of trademark seems to be the first successful attempt using the name Bitcoin as there have been other attempts in the past. Way back March 2015, The United States Patent and Trademark Office, (PTO) rejected the Urban Trend’s attempt and requested to get the trademark Bitcoin (Reg 86135516). A year after and with the same month, the Russian Patent Agency Rospatent denied the Moscow-based firm M-Group after its attempt of earning the copyright of the Bitcoin name.\nMany crypto enthusiasts have been angry about the latest news before all the attempts denied during the past. Back in 2015, the Bitcoin Foundation – a nonprofit organization published a plea to businesses and individuals asking them not to copyright the term or the name Bitcoin.\n“The name Bitcoin alone should not be the intellectual property of any entity or any individual.” Explained by the organization.\n“Rather it is a generic term used for other money currencies such as euro, yen or dollar, etc. The foundation is committed and dedicated to doing what it can do to protect the term “Bitcoin” for public use.” Share", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steven anderson public", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cryptocurrency analytics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "a.b.c ipholdings south west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intellectual property office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "etsy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk company", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T07:12:06.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "413e8dbf586b89148e2a798e2bbc06d70513d400", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSkmXhZO_05BfXCl1ekjUholZFMzxxbaTCRBEHyeeLZQ1.3mgn8Ce.B17WkHGZS25hYD6Ngf8_m22YQqoPONTRYF_yBKC6L0oU-", "site_full": "freeq.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://freeq.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Current price of Bitcoin is $7515.01 – FREEQ Crypto News", "title": "Current price of Bitcoin is $7515.01", "title_full": "Current price of Bitcoin is $7515.01", "published": "2018-06-02T08:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "413e8dbf586b89148e2a798e2bbc06d70513d400", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSkmXhZO_05BfXCl1ekjUholZFMzxxbaTCRBEHyeeLZQ1.3mgn8Ce.B17WkHGZS25hYD6Ngf8_m22YQqoPONTRYF_yBKC6L0oU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FR33Q", "published": "2018-06-02T08:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Current price of Bitcoin is $7515.01", "text": "Current price of Bitcoin is $7515.01\nJune 2, 2018 at 07:59AM\nvia Chain", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T08:59:30.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "753df525878b8ddb655d6b80f3fd674772750f55", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSS1KyjLFtb912x4fVOTYOv8BBMWiwvPeaFfnJBqO_j69L_RLA_JgQINhCcZuwWTvoA--", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Istanbul to Amsterdam in 5 days, crossing as many countries as possible and only using bitcoin.

Für die bib-Leser berichtet er in jeder Ausgabe über Nützliches und Kurioses, Aktuelles und Steuerbares.\nDie Verluste privater Darlehen: Sie kennen das vielleicht? Sie haben einem „guten“ Freund ein privates Darlehen gegeben (3F-Finanzierung: Family, Friends and Fools) und am langen Ende kann dieser es nicht zurückzahlen. Auf der Basis eines neuen BFH-Urteils kam es nun zu einem Paradigmenwechsel: Solche Verluste können jetzt bei Ihren Einkünften aus Kapitalvermögen geltend gemacht werden! Vielleicht hat ein BFH-Richter Ähnliches erlebt?\nDer Bitcoin: Das Handelsblatt schrieb unlängst nach der Talfahrt des Bitcoin-Kurses von 20.000 auf 10.000 Dollar: „Vielleicht ist das ja das Wesen einer virtuellen Währung: Sobald man nach ihr greift, fasst man ins Leere. Wahrscheinlich ist der Bitcoin gar nicht Teil der Finanzwirtschaft, sondern eine Spielart der Illusionskunst. Enttäuschte Anleger sollten sich mit David Copperfield in Verbindung setzen.“ Aber vor allem: Der Bitcoin ist kein steuerfreier Raum.

Wilfried Pimenta, IOTA Foundation’s Business Development Head, announced the partnership in a post on the company’s blog. DNB is the largest bank in Norway and ranks as one of the most prominent financial institutions in the Nordic region. Den Norske Bank is no Stranger to DLT and Blockchain Technology\nDNB is no stranger to the world of decentralized ledger technology. Before partnering with IOTA, the bank previously engaged in numerous collaborative efforts with a slew of blockchain-based firms including R3, Hyperledger, EOS, and Ethereum. Speaking on the MoU (memorandum of understanding) with IOTA, Lasse Meholm, the Head of the DLT division at the bank, said:\nAs the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine to Machine (M2M) communication and payment for microservices seem to escalate in the future, we think engaging in a Distributed Ledger based technology like IOTA gives us valuable experience and know-how on future revenue streams and business models. We are looking forward to diving into the IOTA space. The IOTA – DNB Partnership\nIOTA and DNB aim to work closely together, developing useful solutions based on Tangle technology implementations. As part of the MoU, both partners will work in tandem with important stakeholders in their respective ecosystems. The partnership has three critical focus areas: the formulation of new business models, data privacy management systems, and collaborative cross-silo hackathons. Commenting on the MoU with DNB, the IOTA foundation founder, David Sønstebø stated:\nNorway has always been a vanguard in adopting cutting-edge technological paradigm shifts that improve the efficiency of our society; I am very excited at the IOTA Foundation which is spearheading Distributed Ledger Technology and IoT payments working with Norway’s largest financial institution on carrying this tradition onwards.\nIOTA focuses on decentralized implementations tailored towards the actualization of the Internet of Things via its Tangle technology. Exciting Times for IOTA\nThis IOTA – DNB partnership comes firmly on the heels of IOTA’s partnership with the United Nations on May 22. The joint venture between IOTA and the UN is expected to improve the latter’s efficiency and transparency. The focus areas of the collaboration are on the effective management and tracking of supply chain activities and UN documents. In late 2017, the Bosch group also invested in IOTA.\nDo you think these recent IOTA collaborations will lead to mainstream utilization of the Tangle DLT?

They’re More Alike Than You Think 2 junio, 2018,02\nBalancing The Ledger: Amber Baldet Gives A Clovyr Update, EOS Hits $4 Billion\nBy ROBERT HACKETT\nToday, people tend to view the world of blockchains as inhabited by two broad factions: One favors “permissionless” ledgers like Bitcoin, where anyone can join, while the other camp, backed by many in the business community, prefers a pre-approval, or “permissioned,” system. The two sides typically talk past each other and, frequently, regard the other with suspicion and resentment.\n“It’s very divided,” says Amber Baldet, CEO and co-founder of Clovyr, a startup that’s creating a platform—not unlike Salesforce’s Heroku—for developers and businesses to build and manage decentralized apps across both public and enterprise blockchains.\nThe former blockchain leader at JPMorgan Chase visited Fortune’s studios to discuss the intra-industry, ideological clash on the latest episode of Balancing The Ledger, a new show about the intersection of finance and technology. (You can read more about Baldet in this month’s Fortune 500 issue of the magazine.)\nThis controversy is rooted in whether one of the most prized qualities of Bitcoin—its wide decentralization among unnamed users—should be inherent to all blockchains. While corporations favor permissioned blockchains so they can control who they do business with, critics argue that the centralized nature of such a system undermines the original purpose of the technology.\nIn Baldet’s view, part of the problem is rooted in the terminology. “I really think that nomenclature just isn’t helpful,” Baldet says, referring to the commonplace partitioning of public versus enterprise blockchains. “It creates this kind of animosity where we’re saying that big business is on one side and the people and the proletariat are on the other side.\n“Really, it should just be about information residing where it makes sense and creating security boundaries that are logical,” she says.\nGet The Ledger, Fortune’s weekly newsletter on the intersection of finance and tech.\nRather than a black-and-white, public-vs.-enterprise scenario, consider a gradient of options. Imagine a setup where a variety of interconnected, cryptographically-sealed ledgers—a mix of permissioned and permisionless databases, depending on their purposes—interact. This arrangement could have advantages, creating separation between network layers and limiting the effect of potential security breaches.\n“If you have something that’s going to infect an entire network, and you have a security boundary around that, well, if you’re on the other side of that boundary, then you’re potentially protected,” Baldet explains.\nIn other words, if a catastrophic vulnerability were found in a public blockchain protocol, then a business wouldn’t want that problem affecting its internal, mission-critical operations. And vice versa: Businesses might find it useful to keep fingerprints of its internal chains on a public blockchain so that it has an auditable record in the event that its network becomes compromised.\nBaldet is betting, through her business Clovyr, that these supposedly opposing realms of the blockchain universe will commingle. “Creating an ‘Internet of value’ that’s a bunch of networks connected together—much like the Internet is a network of networks—it’s just a lot more pragmatic,” Baldet says, meaning that the end state doesn’t have to be either-or. There’s room enough, in her philosophy, for both the cryptocurrency bulls, who favor public blockchains, and the business blockchain acolytes, who prefer permissioned systems, to cooperate.\n“It’s not about being a maximalist on either side of the fence,” she says.\nhttp://fortune.com/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://fortune.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clovyr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert hackett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salesforce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baldet", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jpmorgan chase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fortune", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T09:15:02.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "87692ab58454a80f1eb87f5237ce4706bbe033c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS6L7nbyxruQ4RXWMSg4._Y-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "title_full": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "published": "2018-06-02T08:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.16, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "87692ab58454a80f1eb87f5237ce4706bbe033c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS6L7nbyxruQ4RXWMSg4._Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sirazimuth", "published": "2018-06-02T08:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "text": "Quote: from: realr0achasshole on June 01, 2018, 03:04:26 PM\nI remember the good old days when I'd have 5 pages in a row covered with swastikas and Jews roasting in ovens and there would still be 10:1 more complaints about JayJuanGee posts than mine.\nabsolute fucking bullshit you lying sack of shit", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T03:09:03.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b454151332217e5232a5971240e390f10280a929", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWEsBSwHveWIn3TDL2_DWNI-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Which is more risky?

Stripe Founders Remain “Fascinated by Cryptocurrencies From a Technology Point of View”\nJohn Collison echoed his brother’s sentiment, emphasizing that “the speed and cost” of conducting “transactions on the bitcoin network was the main” issue. “Our determination was that bitcoin is not a good payment method, which is a very different discussion than cryptocurrencies generally,” John said.\nRegarding the current state of the cryptocurrency sphere broadly, John stated that he believes “there is a ton of promise that has not actually been shown in real-world applications yet, and while we are waiting for those real-world applications, I think people are getting a little distracted by some of the hype.”\n“I see tons of companies, and tons of people, getting distracted by almost vanity projects of ‘we’ll put this database on the blockchain or things like this’ because people are not really weathered in the technical details,” John continued.\nDo you think that BTC will see an increase or further decline in its adoption as a means of payment?

The hacker who called himself IsHakdz vandalized the site by replacing the website’s content with an image of Guy Fawkes from the film V for Vendetta along with the phrase “Your security down I’m not sorry.” The page also contained links to files allegedly containing customer information, prompting Eventbrite to temporarily shut down Ticketfly until the security situation could be assessed and resolved.\n“Following recent site issues, we determined that Ticketfly has been the target of a cyber incident,” the company said in a statement. “To protect our clients and fans, and to secure the website and related data, we have temporarily taken all Ticketfly systems offline.”\nIn addition to breaching Ticketfly while keeping the site’s HTTPS certificate intact, the hack also affected Brooklyn Bowl, Pear Street Warehouse, and Lafayette Theater, according to The Verge. And because Ticketfly was unable to comment on what information may have been compromised during this attack, if you’ve recently made any transactions through Tickefly or any of the affected sites, you may want to keep an eye on your credit card statements and credit report. Motherboard was able to confirm that home addresses, emails, and telephone numbers of customers were part of the files leaked by the IsHakdz. Additionally, the hacker said that he may release more stolen information on his website, PCMag reported.\nThe hacker claimed to have initially warned Ticketfly about the site’s vulnerability that would allow him to take control of the site and all its database, but he demanded a payment of one Bitcoin to reveal the details. Ticketfly didn’t reply, and it appears that the hacker went ahead and put his knowledge to use in hacking Ticketfly’s site, Motherboard reported.\nIf you had purchased a ticket for an upcoming event from Ticketfly, a support page notes that these tickets may be available at the door. You’ll need three forms of ID, Ticketfly advised, which includes an original photo ID and a copy of the printed digital ticket. If you’re not the original purchaser, you’ll also need a note from the buyer authorizing you to pick up the tickets.\nEditors’ Recommendations\nMalware attack hits Chili’s restaurants, customer payment info nabbed\nHackers could have credit card numbers of 880,000 Orbitz users\nInfected online chat service stole payment info at Best Buy, Delta, Sears, more\nFacebook acts as unwitting sales platform for identity thieves\nEmail encryption flaw gives hackers full access to your secret messages\nTicketfly goes offline after refusing to pay hacker’s Bitcoin ransom ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ticketfly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pear street warehouse", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lafayette theater", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn bowl", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T00:17:06.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7feb0a8ac0644941f965799923cd246f679b9544", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaPonTgwAjQK2N1uwu64kw0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why does bitcoin have value?", "title_full": "Why does bitcoin have value?", "published": "2018-06-02T07:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.359, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7feb0a8ac0644941f965799923cd246f679b9544", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaPonTgwAjQK2N1uwu64kw0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ale88", "published": "2018-06-02T07:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why does bitcoin have value?", "text": "I think that the question \"Why does bitcoin have value?\" can be applied to any other kind of value/payment: simply it has its own value because the people accept it and recognize it as something with a value.

Lightning Payments Meet Android The release, called simply Lightning Wallet , incorporates a fully operational Lightning node, providing for both on-chain Bitcoin and off-chain Lightning Network transactions. Users will be able to take advantage of the increasingly well-populated network, benefits including near-instant sending and receiving of Bitcoin via dedicated channels for fees of less than one satoshi ($0.0000755141) – Bitcoin’s smallest unit. The app has received six positive 5-star user reviews so far. “It is crucial to understand that Lightning Wallet is a completely standalone app, it is not a thin client to some centralized service,” the wallet’s description to potential users reads. This most importantly means that your money is stored right on your phone and nowhere else which gives you a ultimate censorship resistance: no one can ‘freeze your account’ or cancel your transactions, but at the same time this makes you the only one responsible for securing your funds. Mitigating Funds Loss Concerns As Bitcoinist has reported throughout 2018 since Lightning’s mainnet release went live, both support and adoption have been brisk, despite the underlying technology remaining in an experimental phase. While the potential for funds to go missing due to technical inconsistencies remains, Lightning Wallet developers claim they have mitigated such risks using a mnemonic passphrase setup. “This is [the] first Lightning wallet on [the] market which offers off-chain data loss protection: in case of emergencies such as phone loss you will only need a mnemonic phrase to recover both on-chain Bitcoin balance and off-chain Lightning balance,” its Google Play description confirms. In April, Lightning passed the symbolic adoption mark of 2000 nodes, with over 6000 channels currently open, handling a total network capacity of over $160,000. Various consumer tools have gone live, while payment processor CoinGate recently announced it had also pivoted to add compatibility for merchants. “Although still in its early stages and more suited to advanced, technical users, LN is, without doubt, the most awaited upgrade to the Bitcoin network,” the company wrote in a statement.

Sparks is a big believer in Bitcoin technology and thinks that someday in the future it will revolutionize the entire adult industry. Furthermore, Sparks is planning to film a few tutorials on how to use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but with a catch — Brenna plans on filming the educational videos naked. We decided to chat with Brenna about cryptocurrencies so our readers can get an in-depth view of how digital currencies like Bitcoin could transform the sex industry from someone who has a close perspective on how these business models operate. Cryptocurrency Will Solve All of the Current Problems in the Adult Industry\nNews.Bitcoin.com (BC): Can you tell our readers how you first got into bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?\nBrenna Sparks (BS): Silkroad! I lived in a boring old town with nothing to do, and I wanted to get weed but didn’t know any dealers. I heard about Silkroad and was guided to using Bitcoin like that, spending hundreds of Bitcoins like it was nothing. Back then I bought my Bitcoins from Silkroad members, using Greendot Moneypaks. I literally gave them money and hoped that I could trust this criminal to give me the Bitcoins! Ahhh…good times. At least, I wasn’t Goxxed.\nBC: You recently wrote a blog post about cryptocurrencies providing workers in the adult industry censorship resistance from payment processor discrimination. What prompted you to write that post?\nBS: It’s something that isn’t talked about often. Most of the people in the industry don’t really discuss how we can make our industry more advanced and safer from a tech perspective. Everyone, just sort of deals with it and has an “if it ain’t totally broke, it doesn’t need fixing” perspective. Also, because of the taboo nature of the adult industry, many of the industry issues have a hard time getting heard by the rest of the world, so problems have been slowly piling up in the background over the years.\nMy belief is that I should alert the world of potential opportunities, because if the current people in the industry don’t want to build it further, someone else will. The crypto industry is full of visionaries, so I believe sharing these problems with the crypto community will gain attention from one of these visionaries who could actually make these changes happen, because it’s become obvious that no one in the adult industry will do it. As time goes on, I’ll grow to be more elaborate on the matter.\nBC: What do you think about libertarian and free market views involved with cryptocurrencies?\nBS: This question reminds me of a time a while back when I thought to myself, “What if I could choose where my tax money went to? What if I could see exactly where it all went and when?” A few years later, this started becoming a clear reality with cryptocurrencies. The technology that exists today can completely turn the government upside down, and that would be a good thing. Technology is the way of the future.\nTechnology brings order, brings stability, brings growth, brings hope for a better future, not a government.\nI believe cryptocurrency provides many of the things a libertarian wish they could have. It’s a medium that allows us, merchants of the world, to exchange in a modern and reliable way that is free from the government, built on protocols that are open to the public to view and contribute to. Cryptocurrencies are changing the way we interact at an increasingly massive scale. We can fund whatever we wish to fund, we can raise money in ways and speeds that were never possible, and for things that we, as individuals, want or need. It provides visionaries the ability to test the most ambitious ideas that no investor would ever be able to fund, which in my opinion translates to an increase in technological growth rate.\nFinally, cryptocurrencies automate a giant list of tasks that we unnecessarily delegate to our government. In other words, the government is doing too many things that it doesn’t actually need to be doing. Humans may have various views on what is important to them, but we also share many as well. For example, a majority of human beings can agree that we need hospitals, we need proper health care, we need safe roadways and safe buildings. Even if some disagree, it doesn’t matter, it’ll get funded because that’s something a majority mass will agree with, we don’t need a government to “guarantee” that. Just as well, we don’t need a government to tell us what is legal tender, we can do that ourselves.\nWe don’t need a government producing that legal tender either, computers do a far better job at producing an acceptable medium of exchange. Finally, we don’t need a government deciding what matters on our behalf. I believe a country of millions is much more capable of making decisions than a small handful of “elected” individuals. Governments of the past and present serve as a means to an end, that’s all. The future is in less governing, and eventually no governing or autonomous governing that corresponds to a successful self-governed society (or societies). This is not to say that we don’t need a government, but rather that we need a lot less of it. Working at a Crypto-Friendly Establishment Felt Futuristic\nBC: What are your favorite cryptocurrencies right now?\nBS: Besides Bitcoin, I would say – SONM (SNM), Odyssey (OCN), Spankchain (SPANK), and Ark (ARK).\nBC: How do you envision cryptocurrencies helping individuals in the adult industry in the future?\nBS: I talk about this further below, but basically cryptocurrency will solve all of the current problems in the adult industry without creating major new problems in the process.\nBC: You recently tweeted that you planned on giving cryptocurrency lessons naked. Do you still plan on giving these lessons?\nBS: Yes, I’m in the process of filming it right now. At first, I thought about filming and releasing each video at a time, but I’ve decided to film multiple videos to ensure and schedule each release. My calendar is all over the place so I figured this is the best way to approach it.\nBC: When you work at clubs like the Legends Room how many tips have you gotten in cryptocurrency, and can you tell our readers what it’s like working at a crypto-friendly establishment like that?\nBS: I was tipped pretty often in cryptocurrency, mainly because the clients had crypto and wanted to actually use it.\nWorking at a crypto-friendly establishment felt futuristic, for lack of a better word. It really feels like you’re in a new world and it just feels right. When it came to using it, everything was straightforward and comfortable. Cryptocurrency Takes the Best Parts of Cash and Debit Cards and Removes the Other Junk\nBC: Do you still use the Bitcoin.com Wallet?\nBS: As of this moment, no. Reason being is that most of my coins are in deep cold storage.\nBC: Are there any other people you know that work in the adult film industry that also accept cryptocurrencies?\nBS: Yep! There is a growing number of talent, both male and female, like Shelby Paris, Holly Hawkes, and Kyle Mason. I also have directors approaching me for help regarding crypto on set and on my social media. It’s growing quietly, but noticeable. I believe camgirls and individual content produces will be the ones that utilize it the most though, especially in the early stages. I can only see it becoming a standard in the adult industry once a large number of people have become familiar enough with it.\nBC: Do you envision cryptocurrencies taking over the adult industry online in the future as far as payments are concerned for subscriptions, cam shows, pics, movies, and other services?\nBS: I definitely think so. For one, cam sites already use a token system so it’ll be quite easy for camgirls to pick up on it. Escorts can perform a transaction safely and discretely, especially when using a privacy-oriented coin like Monero or Bitcoin Private. Production companies can skip using checks and performers can get paid same day. Production companies won’t need to pose under different company names to get around bank etiquette. Performers don’t need to explain where their legally obtained funds came from. Individual content producers can easily set up a reliable payment method for their customers without running through a processor that will shut them down and take their money.\nThese are just common issues and aren’t even all that creative. This whole industry can be flipped around by cryptocurrency, for the betterment of it. Bottom line is, people love cash, but it’s becoming more and more inconvenient to carry it. If a company like Brazzers had to pay everyone on set using cash, it’d be a nightmare for whoever is responsible for distributing the money. Our evolving lifestyle is pushing us to move our cash into a bank account and turn it into digital money which we can then use with a debit card, but then that has its plethora of problems and limitations attached to it too, many of which severely impact the adult industry.\nCryptocurrency takes the best parts of cash and debit cards and removes the other junk. I think life has shown that humans are very flexible with what they consider is money and what isn’t. Cryptocurrency is just the natural step forward when it comes to using money in a modern society and I am convinced that that majority of us will adapt to it.\nBC: Since you got into bitcoin do you have a lot of cryptocurrency followers now on social media?\nBS: There has been a growing number of crypto followers on my twitter and it’s all been pretty gradual. One day I figured I’d start mentioning crypto in passing, which led to more and more engagement from the crypto community. Now I’m starting to think that the future of my social media will consist mostly of crypto fans, which I’m okay with!\nCheck out our podcast series ‘Humans of Bitcoin’ featuring Brenna Sparks below.\nWhat do you think about cryptocurrencies transforming the adult industry?

Unlike in bitcoin, you don't really need a big capital to start investing on it, because even in a small amount you can already start investing.\nYeahh, I fully agree with U )) You can take a small funds to start investing in BTC. Its real for anybody! =)\n:-) :-) :-) :-)\nIf you are ambitious to invest your money into the crypto currencies like that of the bitcoin, then you must look for the ways which can help in having that much amount of money which you can then use for the sake of buying of the bitcoins. You need to gather some huge amount of money so that you can then manage to make some handsome amount of profit and that you need to learn.\nWe never stop because we need to secure our family's future.
