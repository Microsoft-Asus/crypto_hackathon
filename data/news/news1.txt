During the joint interview, both Dimon and Buffett were asked about their views on cryptocurrency – a subject that, for the two, has sparked more than a degree of controversy – and which one “hates bitcoin more?”\nIndeed, Dimon infamously branded bitcoin a “ fraud ” last fall – though he later reportedly said that he regretted those comments.\nToday, his remarks were far more measured, with Dimon telling the network (according to a published transcript):\n“I– I don’t wanna be the Bitcoin spokesman. You know, just beware.”\nBuffett remarked Thursday that “I set a high standard” with his commentary – he said in January that cryptocurrencies “will come to a bad ending”– and added that “I don’t know whether Jamie can top me or not.”\nThe outspoken billionaire said in May that bitcoin, to him, is “rat poison squared.”\n“[Bitcoin] itself is creating nothing,” he told CNBC at the time. “When you’re buying nonproductive assets, all you’re counting on is the next person is going to pay you more because they’re even more excited about another next person coming along.”\nImage Credit: CNBC\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

(Image: Reuters) To make his fortune on cryptocurrency, Jake Benson doesn’t have to choose a winner among the hundreds of firms hawking digital tokens. He just needs to do their taxes. Benson is following the ’49er model — as in 1849. Like industrious shopkeepers during the California Gold Rush, he’s offering the digital equivalent of picks and shovels. In his case, accounting services.\nThe world of digital currency is poised to draw billions of dollars from institutional investors if it can provide boring back-office services like custody banking and trading systems along with tax accounting. While the functions are essentially the same as in traditional businesses, crypto presents unique challenges.\n“Just to name one difference, the number of decimal places in a crypto asset can be up to 18-plus digits,” said Benson, whose Libra back-office firm caters exclusively to the crypto crowd. “That fact alone actually breaks a lot of accounting systems.”\nHundreds of firms like Benson’s are competing to sell the nuts and bolts of the burgeoning market. Startups financed by venture capital and token sales are fighting for advantage as the field begins to get crowded. Like the sellers of mining implements during the Gold Rush, they plan to profit whether or not Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies turn out to be digital treasure.\nTraditional Solutions\n“What really excites me is this whole picks-and-shovels approach,” said David Wills, chief operating officer of Caspian, a Hong Kong-based provider of crypto trading systems and related technologies for hedge funds. “As long as the asset class has a pulse, those companies will be the ones to succeed.”\nIf established firms such as State Street Inc. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. decide to do business with the virtual-currency world, it would lend credibility to the industry even if the firms aren’t that knowledgeable about crypto, said Morgan Hill, a partner at the $30 million Turing Funds in New York.\n“There are no off-the-shelf solutions from traditional finance,” Hill said. “Everything is still getting pieced together. The expertise in this space are people who got in early and have learned the pitfalls.”\nAt a trio of crypto conferences in New York last month, hundreds of companies clamored for one of two things, Hill said: investors in their initial coin offerings or customers for their back-office businesses.\nAlmost all the companies are startups, and most have yet to create what Hill calls an “MVP” — a minimum viable product. A few, like Libra, Benson’s firm, have been around a few years and are adding clients and staff as demand surges. The trick is to get customers to stay, said Caspian’s Wills.\nCreatures of Habit\n“Human beings are creatures of habit,” Wills said. “Once a trading system is built into your operational workflow, it’s hard to remove it. In crypto, there are many different levels of workflow that need to be in place.”\nWills said Caspian is planning to sell a so-called utility token that can be used to pay trading fees. It will also be used to compensate developers of applications available through Caspian’s system.\nSince money managers are required to keep customer assets secure, a pressing need is a custodial bank. Custody banks such as BNY Mellon and State Street would fit the bill, but they haven’t committed to crypto.\nJob Opening\nThat leaves the job open for digital-money companies. Omega One, an agency brokerage for cryptocurrencies that’s opening an office in Bermuda, says it will work with insurers and the island’s government to set up a custody business there.\n“Bermuda has an incredibly strong legal, technical, reputational jurisdiction for financial services in general, but particularly for custody of assets and reinsurance,” said Alex Gordon-Brander, Omega One’s chief executive officer.\nToday’s crypto scene looks a lot like the birth of the dot-com boom in the mid-1990s, Gordon-Brander said.\n“Obviously, not everybody survives the cut,” he said. “But it’s clear that the revolution is happening and the leaders are emerging.”\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/FinancialXpress", "https://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jake benson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "libra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T16:22:41.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "46cbb5d50d50b5ec21d8adfb82a59fa878a7342a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYhr.7_6CWmgnJVBgJUaBhUPqSfGIFhwDu_I_x3p77rPS5ImdrsR8GcEL2la9.hNwvyAYOsdiJbXMsO8ogmf61VuHy09a7B0xs-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Debunked: \"Bitcoin Cash is centralized and easily destroyed by an attacker.\" : btc", "title_full": "Debunked: \"Bitcoin Cash is centralized and easily destroyed by an attacker.\" : btc", "published": "2018-06-09T02:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "46cbb5d50d50b5ec21d8adfb82a59fa878a7342a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYhr.7_6CWmgnJVBgJUaBhUPqSfGIFhwDu_I_x3p77rPS5ImdrsR8GcEL2la9.hNwvyAYOsdiJbXMsO8ogmf61VuHy09a7B0xs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "fruitsofknowledge", "published": "2018-06-09T02:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Debunked: \"Bitcoin Cash is centralized and easily destroyed by an attacker.\" : btc", "text": "Since Bitcoin Cash is a fork that follows the original Bitcoin design as presented by its creator (and first temporary 51%+ miner) Satoshi Nakamoto, I will let him break down the basics of the system for you. -Do note the use of brackets, since of course no need for a contentious fork actually existed at the time.\nSatoshi:\n[ Bitcoin Cash is an] electronic cash system that uses a peer-to-peer network to prevent double-spending . It's completely decentralized with no server or central authority .\nSource\n[The P2P cryptocurrency uses] cryptography and a distributed network to replace the need for a trusted central server .\nSource\nThe steps to run the network are as follows:\nNew transactions are broadcast to all nodes.\nEach node collects new transactions into a block.\nEach node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.\nWhen a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.\nNodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.\nNodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.\nNodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on extending it.\nSource\nIt is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network nodes until he’s convinced he has the longest chain . . .\nSource\n[A] system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale. That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server . The design supports letting users just be users .\nSource\nIndeed, Bitcoin [Cash] is a distributed secure timestamp server for transactions .\nSource\nThe proof-of-work is a Hashcash style SHA-256 collision finding. It's a memoryless process where you do millions of hashes a second, with a small chance of finding one each time. The 3 or 4 fastest nodes' dominance would only be proportional to their share of the total CPU power.\nThere will be transaction fees, so nodes will have an incentive to receive and include all the transactions they can .\nSource\nWe consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain. Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes , such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker.\nNodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment , and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them .

Last month, a malicious miner executed a double-spending attack on the Bitcoin Gold network (BTG), whose digital currency Bitcoin Gold (BTG) is the world’s 26th most valuable cryptocurrency. The miner acquired at least 51 percent of the network’s total hashpower, which provided them with temporary control of the blockchain. Then they deposited BTG on exchanges, withdrew those same crypto coins, and reversed the initial transactions. The attacker was estimated to steal over 388,200 BTG, or $18.6 million. Under such circumstances, the blockchain industry needs to understand the double-spending problem in Bitcoin profoundly. DxChain has a deep understanding of this problem. Here is our analysis: T he bitcoin white paper “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” marked the beginning of cryptocurrencies. This paper described the system infrastructure of Bitcoin network extensively from a technical point of view. Many fundamental concepts in the paper, such as transactions, incentive mechanism, and Merkle tree were then adopted by following cryptocurrency systems. The Bitcoin system is designed to prevent double-spending in a decentralized environment where there is no trusted third party to mediate disputes. First, let’s figure out what the double-spending problem is. If a crypto coin is used for twice or more times, we call it double-spending. In the real world, we use fiat money — US dollar, Chinese yuan, and Euro — to make an exchange. When we pay someone with $100 in cash, for example, we cannot spend the same $100 somewhere else to make another purchase. And when we use a credit card for the payment, all transactions are recorded in a centralized database by the credit card company. However, as Bitcoin is neither physical cash nor traded within a centralized database, it raises challenges on preventing the double-spending issue in a Bitcoin system. Ledger and account are two critical concepts in Bitcoin system. Ledger records how much money each account still has. Imagine you pay someone with Bitcoins. This transaction will be sent to the whole peer-to-peer network and be recorded in the ledger as a type of verification process, which takes time. That means you might be able to send another payment using the same Bitcoin token you spent in the first transaction. This operation results in one Bitcoin being paid twice. Therefore, you have no ways but wait to confirm the validity of a deal. Although the Bitcoin white paper gives a mathematical proof, it only results in a simple conclusion. This article will provide you with a more detailed explanation. The Bitcoin ledger is technically an implementation of the blockchain. As such, a blockchain is also regarded as a distributed ledger. Bitcoin nodes are distributed around the world so different nodes will receive transactions at a different time, generating a variety of blockchains in the system. Bitcoin protocol always selects the longest chain. In the double-spending problem, payees will wait for a while (the block where its transaction located is very deep in the longest chain) to confirm the validity of the transaction. But how long will the payee have to wait (how deep the block containing its transaction is in a chain) to ensure the security? Let’s start the proof. Let’s explain the double-spending problem more technically. When a transaction is recorded in the blockchain, after z blocks appended in the blockchain, attackers start to re-generate a new blockchain. If the new blockchain works faster than the existing one, attackers will get back the coins they spent earlier because Bitcoin protocol will always select the longest chain. If we describe this problem in a mathematical language: An honest chain is z blocks faster than an attack chain. If the honest chain produces a new block in the next moment, the distance of 2 chains is +1. If the attack chain produces a new block, the distance of 2 chains is -1. The problem is whether the attack chain can catch up with the honest chain. The Bitcoin white paper gave the following definitions: We add all the equations in this series together. Then we will get, We add the first z-1 equations in this series. Similar to the above, we will get the following results, According to the equations, we discover that if the probability of an honest node finding a block is less or equal than the probability of an attacker node finding a block, the attacker will catch up the honest chain. Otherwise, the probability of the attacker catching up is decreasing exponentially. The above conclusion is based on two assumptions: 1) we explicitly knew p and q, 2) the attacker starts to generate new block after the honest chain generating Z blocks. Let’s apart from these assumptions. When the attacker sends out a transaction, they(he/she=they) start to generate attacking blocks. After the honest chain generates z blocks, the progress of the attacker chain is k, and the gap between these two chains is z-k. The expectation of k is: k is represented with Poisson distribution. Under this more realistic scenario, the probability of the attacker catching up is When q = 0.1, p = 0.9 and z = 6, the probability of the attacker catching up is 0.0002. In the real Bitcoin network, p is much bigger than q. In general, after a payee waited for z=6 blocks, it is very difficult for attackers to double-spend what they paid earlier. This article explains how the Bitcoin system prevents double-spending problems from mathematical theory. This conclusion lays the theoretical foundation of Proof of Work(PoW) and a good foundation for the future Proof of Stake (PoS) theory.

I wrote some about it here .\nIf you convert Bitcoin to fiat, pay income tax on it if your country has income tax. Simple.\nBitcoin ATM's bring up some legality concerns. Technically you are selling them for fiat, so you should also pay taxes like it's income instead of like it's a bank.\nI'm in the United States. That's how it is here, as well as pretty much anywhere. It's just a question, is there income tax?\nYes mate. We have a different country that we live in but the same way on how the taxes can be collected from us. And i guess many countries does the same way as ours. We cannot use bitcoins in a lot of transactions everywhere, so what we need to do is to convert our bitcoins into fiat.

Both companies have previously tried to launch a Bitcoin ETF offering but failed to receive regulatory clearance.\n'A Clear Understanding of the Potential of Bitcoin' VanEck and SolidX have entered into a partnership to list a \"physically-backed Bitcoin ETF.\" VanEck will be responsible for the marketing services function while SolidX will handle the ETF sponsorship. The ETF application was filed with the SEC on June 5, 2018.\nCommenting on the partnership, John van Eck, the CEO of VanEck, told Business Wire :\nI believe that bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of 'digital gold' that may make sense for investors' portfolios. The SolidX team has in-depth experience with bitcoin, cryptography, and capital markets. We're pleased to join with them in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market.\nIn 2017, VanEck filed the first ever 40-Act Bitcoin ETF. In 2016, SolidX filed the first-ever physically-backed Bitcoin ETF. The two firms are now hoping to get approval this time around.\nDaniel Gallancy, the CEO of SolidX, expressed optimism at the new approach, stating:\nIn determining a marketing partner, we looked for a firm with a clear understanding of the potential of bitcoin and the role it can play in an investment portfolio. VanEck is deeply involved in this space, understands its potential, and has a long track record of successfully opening new avenues for investors to access unique and compelling investment opportunities. We're excited to work with the team at VanEck.\nIf the filing sails through, the ETF will be listed on the Cboe BZX Equities Exchange under the ticker \"XBTC.\"\nThe Quest for Bitcoin ETFs Despite concerted efforts by both cryptocurrency and fintech firms, the SEC has resisted the clamor for Bitcoin ETFs.\nWith the emergence of Bitcoin futures in December 2017, many observers thought ETFs would soon follow . However, that hasn't been the case. For the SEC, issues over fair pricing, asset valuation, and custody — as well as sufficient liquidity — continue to be a concern.\nIn the past, the SEC has asked some firms to withdraw their Bitcoin ETF applications while indefinitely delaying the approval of others.\nWill the VanEck-SolidX Bitcoin ETF partnership obtain the necessary regulatory greenlight?

What makes this ETF unique is that if it does come into existence, it will be an ETF backed by actual Bitcoins ( BTC-USD ) and not Bitcoin futures. Before you get too excited about the possibility of a physical Bitcoin ETF, there is a big catch! The catch is that, to help get approval, the companies bringing the fund to market would price it way out of reach of the average retail investor. The trading price of the ETF would be around $200,000/share (25x current Bitcoin price). As is noted in the SEC filing , the share price would be equal to the value of 25 Bitcoins, which, at its current level of $7,700, would mean the ETF would have a share price $192,500.\nThe initial Basket[s] [were/was] created at a per share price equal to the value of [25] bitcoin on.\nThat large of share price is obviously way out of range for the average retail investor and is a different strategy taken in comparison to physically backed Gold ETFs. For example, the SPDR Gold Trust ETF ( GLD ) trades at around 1/10th the price gold, and the iShares Gold Trust ETF ( IAU ) trades at around 1/100th the price of gold. Both these funds are priced for the average retail investor, so they can have easy access to the asset class. In the case of the proposed Bitcoin ETF, the goal is the opposite since the SEC has issues with having the average investor being able to access Bitcoin through an ETF. In a great interview between the two companies bringing the ETF to market, this was their take on the subject of retail investors owning a Bitcoin ETF.\nThe price of the fund will be around $200,000, which is meant to alleviate any concerns that the SEC may continue to have around retail investors getting involved in Bitcoin via an ETF package, ETF.Com . On the other hand, they do leave open the possibility of doing a split to lower the share price in the future if the SEC were to change their minds.\nQuestion:\nRegarding the share price, is there any guarantee you won't do a reverse split to bring it down?\nAnswer:\nThat's a conversation we need to have with the regulators to see whether or not that's an effective answer to one of their concerns.\nImpact on GBTC The most popular way the average investor is currently gaining access to Bitcoin is through Bitcoin Investment Trust ( OTCQX:GBTC ). In the event the physically backed Bitcoin ETF is actually brought to market at the high share price, it is likely that GBTC would initially fall on the news headline but would likely recover as it would still be the only option available for the average retail investor to have exposure to Bitcoin. The popularity of GBTC will last only as long as there is no affordable Bitcoin ETF on the market.\nRisk And Insurance With Bitcoin, there are some added risks highlighted in the filing, which need to be taken seriously even though the fund would have insurance for the Bitcoin holdings. These risks include potential \"fat finger\" transfers, theft, technology disruptions, and computer infrastructure. As was seen on the flash crash, some stocks fell to such extremely low prices, and those trades were canceled. With Bitcoin, that can't happen since Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. Bitcoin thefts have been occurring for years and will continue to be risk to anyone that holds Bitcoins. Technology disruptions do occur when upgrading a system. An example of this was when Windows 10 came out, and it caused issues with running certain software programs and connecting to hardware. Finally, computer infrastructure is susceptible to viruses/failures, and, as is noted below, if bad enough, the ETF could simply cease operations.\n**Sorry about all the following long quotes. However, it is important information that needs to be covered. These quotes are on page 25 of the ETF filing.\nTransactions in Bitcoin are Irreversible\nBitcoin transactions are irreversible. An improper transfer, whether accidental or resulting from theft, can only be undone by the receiver of the bitcoin agreeing to send the bitcoin back to the original sender in a separate subsequent transaction. To the extent the Trust erroneously transfers, whether accidental or otherwise, bitcoin in incorrect amounts or to the wrong recipients, the Trust may be unable to recover the bitcoin, which could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.\nThe Trust's Bitcoin May Be Lost, Stolen, or Subject to Other Inaccessibility\nThere is a risk that part or all of the Trust's bitcoin could be lost, stolen or destroyed. Although the Trust will secure the Trust's bitcoin to minimize the risk of loss, the Trust cannot guarantee that such a loss will be prevented.\nTechnology Disruptions\nThe Trust uses a sophisticated technology system specifically designed to secure its bitcoin. The Trust will monitor its technology and may develop and redesign its technology, including enhancements and alterations that may be implemented from time to time. In doing so, there is risk that failures may occur and result in service interruptions or other negative consequences.\nThe Trust is not liable to shareholders for the failure or penetration of the technology system absent gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. To the extent the technology system fails or is penetrated, any loss of the Trust's bitcoin or loss of confidence in the Trust's ability to safeguard its bitcoin may adversely affect an investment in the Shares.\nComputer Infrastructure\nThe Trust's computer infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic computer break-ins, viruses and similar disruptive problems and security breaches. Any such problems or security breaches could give rise to a halt in the Trust's operations, and expose the Trust to a risk of financial loss, litigation and other liabilities. In the event of a security breach, the Trust may cease operations, suspend redemptions or suffer a loss of bitcoin or other assets.\nInsurance Given all the Bitcoin-specific risks that would be associated with the fund, the insurance policy is a key aspect of the fund, given there have been plenty of thefts of Bitcoin, exchanges closing down, etc. The fund would have an insurance policy on the Bitcoin holdings as detailed below.\nTo the extent the value of the Trust's bitcoin holdings exceeds the total $125,000,000 of insurance coverage as discussed below, the Sponsor has made arrangements for additional insurance coverage with the goal of maintaining insurance coverage at a one-to-one ratio with the Trust's bitcoin holdings valued in U.S. dollars such that for every dollar of bitcoin held by the Trust there is an equal amount of insurance coverage.\nClosing Thoughts In closing, the thought of a physically backed Bitcoin ETF is a very appealing idea to investors. However, it is likely that at least initially only the wealthy will be able to access it given the high share price. I'm not a fan of Bitcoin or any crypto. However, for those who are, in the future, the proposed fund could split to make it affordable for the average investor, another physically-backed fund could launch with a lower price, or a futures-based Bitcoin ETF could launch, until such time as one of those occurs, GBTC remains the cheapest way for the average retail investor to gain access to Bitcoin.\nDisclaimer\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Currently, the price per BCH is around $1,120 after dropping below the $1K range the week prior. Moreover, since the fork this past May the BCH-ecosystem has seen all types of application development and community projects launched with a new announcement nearly every day. Advertisements\nAlso Read: IMF Says Bitcoin Could Create Less Demand for Regular Debt-based Fiat Money Today’s Bitcoin Cash Statistics\nIt’s been over 10 months since the August 1 fork and today the BCH chain is roughly 7201 blocks ahead of the Bitcoin Core (BTC) chain. Since then, the decentralized cryptocurrency ecosystem has performed two successful hard forks, one of which changed the currency’s difficulty algorithm, while the other fork added new OP_Codes, and raised the base block size to 32 MB. Over the past year, the BCH hashrate has grown exponentially and this week the hashrate is averaging close to 5 exahash per second between roughly 12 different mining pools. This Friday, June 8, the Bitcoin Cash chain is 1.5% more profitable to mine according to Coin Dance statistics. Further Coin Dance data details that it is 5.95x more expensive to transact on the BTC network today.\nMarket data shows that BCH is down 2 percent today but has gained 13 percent over the last seven days. The market has a lot more trade volume today than a few days prior with $516Mn BCH swapped over the past 24-hours. The top exchanges trading the most BCH liquidity include Okex, Binance, L Bank, EXX, and Huobi. Bitcoin Cash is the fourth highest market capitalization still but also holds the fourth highest trade volume for June 8, 2018. The strongest currency pair with BCH is BTC which captures 41 percent of trades. This is followed by tether (USDT 30.8%), USD (15.1%), KRW (7.9%), and ETH (1.3%). New Platform Announcements, the Miners Choice Initiative, and Development Funding\nOverall, the sentiment within the BCH community has been very positive, as there have been lots of announcements over the past couple of weeks. For instance, this past week 100+ coders met in China to develop BCH-based applications and organizers detail the event was a huge success. The Cryptonize.it team announced the launch of a new BCH-centric wallet called Cash Pay that allows anyone to purchase anything online. A few days later, the Cryptonize.it founder Ari explained to news.Bitcoin.com about how his team helped an anonymous developer create a new decentralized fundraising platform called Lighthouse.cash.\nEarlier this week, we reported on a “Miners Choice” initiative started by the mining pools operated by Nchain, and Coingeek which aims to remove the BCH dust limit if 546 satoshis, alongside allowing some free transactions per block. Nchain’s Dr. Craig Wright spoke with news.Bitcoin.com about the initiative and he encouraged other mining pools to join the cause. So far since we reported on the topic, the mining pools Bitcoin.com and Viabtc have pledged to support the initiative. In addition to this, the Bitcoin.com pool has started to donate a fraction of block rewards to BCH development and has donated the funds to the Bitcoin ABC development team this week. Bitcoin Cash Community Energy Still at Full Throttle\nOther BCH announcements include the popular streaming gaming platform Twitch now allows BCH tips by utilizing the Streamlabs app tethered to their Coinbase accounts. An encrypted messaging service was launched this week that’s tethered to the BCH network called Keyport. Bitcoin Cash was featured in the UK’s popular financial magazine Moneyweek two days ago in an editorial detailing why investors should invest in BCH. Last but not least, the trading platform Boaexchange has added BCH as their base currency and default values. The Coinex exchange is another trading platform that also offers BCH trading pairs with other popular cryptocurrencies. The trading platform Boaexchange offers BCH pairs.\nOverall, the BCH community is optimistic about the future and pleased with the latest developments and announcements concerning the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem. One unique headline this week came from the Philippines, as there’s a decked out customized BCH Jeepney that drives between Philcoa in Quezon City and T.M. Kalaw in Manila every day.

The previous bullish momentum was capable of printing its all-time high near $20,000, but many questions have arisen since then, particularly in regard to regulatory grey areas. Adoption and compliance to governments regulation for the cryptocurrency market and initial coin offerings (ICOs) are expected to drive the price of Bitcoin upwards. Advertisements Fundstrat’s Tom Lee Says Bitcoin Could Shoot up as Coinbase and Circle Seek SEC License\nCoinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, is attempting to become a fully SEC-regulated brokerage firm and electronic-trading venue in order to better navigate the financial system and become a valuable option for retail and institutional players. For that purpose, the operator has announced it will acquire Keystone Capital.\nThis move is evidence that regulation is smoothing out and could be an uplifting variable for Bitcoin prices, according to Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, in a note to clients. Here he calls the announcement an implicit recognition that the regulatory tide is shifting.\n“We believe the regulatory picture is now improving — best evidenced by Coinbase and Circle ‘running towards’ regulation. We are basing this on the notion that Coinbase and Circle would only take these actions if such was the case.”\nCircle, a cryptocurrency platform backed by Goldman Sachs, is seeking a federal banking license as it looks to make moves into the highly regulated realm of U.S. banks and brokerages. As of yet, however, no crypto-related organization has obtained such status with U.S. regulators.\n“We believe both companies would only make these moves if their perception of regulatory risks in crypto was improving”.\nA key issue yet to solve is that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not decided which cryptocurrencies are to be considered securities. The regulatory body has explained that the Howey Test, created by the supreme court in 1946, is able to determine whether a digital token can be subject to the same regulations as stocks and bonds.\nSEC chair Jay Clayton has recently admitted that digital tokens from ICOs are securities. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has previously stipulated that cryptocurrencies are commodities and subject to the Commodity Exchange Act.\nAt the New York Blockchain and Digital Assets Summit, the SEC’s cyber unit division chief Robert Cohen has said the regulator does not wish to hurt the development of the ecosystem.\n“We want to encourage innovation and new ways of raising capital. If there’s a new and exciting tech people should have an opportunity to invest in it (…) Every time there’s an exciting new technology, people are afraid of missing out they see people becoming millionaires overnight, there’s a high risk of people falling victim to fraud.”\nAdding to Coinbase and Circle, Templum LLC has also registered with the SEC to operate as a licensed brokerage firm and alternative trading system. The operator plans to offer a trading platform for regulated tokens.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keystone capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fundstrat global advisors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-09T00:03:39.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f78059d6142217ca7439677bcdc446a59dae3461", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgz6tqUIJgu8Pt1lxiG2bCnzhByomA8jyv6pkSzkR1MMmLALZa2a25MzUhrrtZFrnftFwBGD5MvJKUOoq0O_sTTSfN0da9ViDhw-", "site_full": "fortune.com", "site": "fortune.com", "site_section": "http://fortune.com/index.rdf", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Fortune", "title": "The Ledger: Bitcoin Billionaires, R3’s Woes, and ‘Silicon Valley’ Blockchain Advisors", "title_full": "The Ledger: Bitcoin Billionaires, R3’s Woes, and ‘Silicon Valley’ Blockchain Advisors", "published": "2018-06-08T23:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/the-ledger-feat-image1.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1196, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f78059d6142217ca7439677bcdc446a59dae3461", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgz6tqUIJgu8Pt1lxiG2bCnzhByomA8jyv6pkSzkR1MMmLALZa2a25MzUhrrtZFrnftFwBGD5MvJKUOoq0O_sTTSfN0da9ViDhw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Robert Hackett, Jeff John Roberts, Jen Wieczner", "published": "2018-06-08T23:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Ledger: Bitcoin Billionaires, R3’s Woes, and ‘Silicon Valley’ Blockchain Advisors", "text": "By Robert Hackett , Jeff John Roberts , and Jen Wieczner 4:55 PM EDT\nSitting down with Jihan Wu, one gets the sense that the crypto-tycoon might be more at home in a college AV club than in the ranks of the world’s youngest, richest businesspeople.\nThe 32-year-old cofounder and co-CEO of Bitmain, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency mining firm, displays a strikingly reserved and gawky demeanor. At the start of an interview in Manhattan in mid-May, when posed with the opening question “What’s up?”, Wu merely remains silent. After a second prodding, he replies, “Um.”\nSeveral seconds later, the conversation starts. Despite Beijing-based Bitmain being only five years old, the privately-held company brought in $2.5 billion in revenue last year, Wu says, largely through sales of specialized, cryptocurrency-mining, computer chip hardware. It also takes a cut of the funds generated via its market-dominating cryptocurrency mining pools, BTC.com and AntPool. Bitmain’s private market valuation has now ballooned to $12 billion, he says (although Bloomberg estimates it’s closer to $9 billion , with Wu and his cofounder and co-CEO, Micree Zhan, jointly owning about 60% of the business).\nWu is on a mission not only to maintain Bitmain’s throne, but to pad it. He has designs on diversifying the firm’s dominance with an entrée into the booming field of AI; he says the company plans to release an AI chip product as early as later this year.\nThe cryptocurrency billionaire also addressed some of the controversy and conspiracy theories that have swirled around Bitmain. Below is a partial excerpt of Fortune’s interview lightly edited for brevity and clarity. ( Read the rest of the interview here. )\nFortune Ledger: Why did decide to put all of your money into Bitcoin when you heard about it in 2011? What made you take that leap?\nJihan Wu: I very quickly grabbed the idea, apprehended it, and thought it would work. Money is not a binary thing—money, or not. It’s more like a scale from zero to one. Something is more like money than other things. That’s the first thing we need to know.\nDo you ever mine cryptocurrency internally before you release a new miner onto the market?\nNo, we don’t do that. As in, sell a second-handed mining rig? If we sell a second-handed mining rig, we would be transparent that this is second-handed. We don’t do mining first and then make the mining rigs old and then sell them as if they’re new. If it was second-handed, we would tell the customer it’s second-handed.\nIt’s against our principles inside our company to do such things. This is absolutely bad rumors about us. From day one, we are transparent. We have ways to sell used rigs on the market. We don’t have to pretend that some mining rigs are unused ones.\nNot even used—I mean, would you ever, before you release a new miner, have a few months where you have an effective monopoly on that hardware, because it hasn’t been released publicly yet?\nNo, it never happened. We have a small-scale test. We don’t do that. That is not our strategy.\nI ask because there have been reports and rumors .\nI read those stories as well. There’s some kind of group of people that controlled the majority of the hash rate of Monero for a long time. I would like to say that to develop such a kind of ASIC [specialized computer chip] is not a kind of secret skill that only Bitmain has. Lots of people can do that. For large companies like Bitmain, and especially myself, I do not even have the time, attention or resources to have such a kind of plan to do this. If we develop hardware, we just release and sell it on the market. Right after we have sample machines working, we start sales to market. We don’t have such kinds of advantages.\nDo you speak much with regulators?\nNot that much. Just sometimes, in conferences, we meet with some of them. Our business is semiconductor design. Circle [a U.S. cryptocurrency startup privately valued at $3 billion after Bitmain led it’s most recent financing round] has been much more experienced with regulators. That’s why Bitmain is interested in Circle as well. We see in the future that negotiating and working with regulators is quite important. We need to push those heavy regulations back a little bit. But we need to work with them, not just try to get around it.\nWhat do you think the Chinese regulatory regime is going to look like in a few years? What do you predict to happen?\nI’d rather not give any comment on the regulatory policies of the Chinese.

It’s more like a scale from zero to one. Something is more like money than other things. That’s the first thing we need to know.\nSo when Bitcoin was invented, it only mattered how many people recognized Bitcoin as money. Two years since it was invented, there were already thousands of registered users on forums like btctalk.org. They came from every corner of the world—German, Russian, American, Chinese, and other countries. Without the Internet, forget the idea because you can find no support—no companions. But with the Internet, people can live very far from each other, and you can find other people who accept the same idea and form consensus and an economy on the Internet. I think that’s a very fundamental catalyst for Bitcoin’s success.\nDo you ever mine cryptocurrency internally before you release a new miner onto the market?\nNo, we don’t do that.

If we develop hardware, we just release and sell it on the market. Right after we have sample machines working, we start sales to market. We don’t have such kinds of advantages.\nWhat are your priorities over the next few years?\nMy priority is, first, that we will continue to invest a lot of resources into the research and R&D of mining rigs to make sure we maintain an advantage over other competitors, like Avalon. We will also invest into our vision about the future of a crypto market. We think that it will start to support the real world economy, and to build more than this financial market on the Internet. Bitmain will also start to deploy lots of artificial intelligence products into the market—a totally new business selling hardware to do artificial intelligence accelerations.\nWhat will that look like?\nIt’s quite like Google’s TPU [Tensor Processing Units]. It’s just hardware.\nWhen will that be out?\nMaybe by the end of this year.\nDo you speak much with regulators?\nNot that much. Just sometimes, in conferences, we meet with some of them.

With millions of soccer fans world wide, we believe this will present a really good opportunity to bring these people into the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.\nThe first thing that I'm excited to share is that the development work of the game has already begun. We really hope to have the game launched before the World Cup ends so we're working extremely hard to get it out within the next few weeks.\nFor the early backers, this game is extremely competitive (because real Bitcoin Cash can be won!) so we're hoping that the competitive gamers will pay a good price for the limited edition players where you actually turn a profit from being an early backer of this campaign. Once the crowdfunding campaign ends, there is no other way within the game to get these limited edition players which means as the demand of the game grew, the value of these early backers rewards will only increase.\nAgain, the game is entirely free to play. However, as the gamers start to become more addicted to the game, they will eventually start to research how to get their hands on Bitcoin Cash to grow their club further. We will create an informative page where gamers will learn about Bitcoin Cash and what Bitcoin Cash can do. That's how we try to slowly bring these people into the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.\nSome quick updates on the game (subject to changes as the development work progresses). You can rename every single player in your team so feel free to put in your friends! There is also an RPG element in the game where you play the life of a soccer player (that's basically you!). And as you groom this special player, you can include him in your matches!\nAs in real life, players can be put up for sale and bought by other clubs. This is a multiplayer game so you're always facing real people around the world. Players are bought and sold using Bitcoin Cash. So guess what when competitive gamers join the game? They will have to learn about Bitcoin Cash and get some BCH to build a highly competitive championship winning club!\nWe tried to make the game engine as realistic as possible. If you put in some funny formation, like 9 defenders and 1 midfielder, you will likely lose the match even if you have an all star team. Formation is important because the game engine do a realistic play by play calculation and if you lack people in certain positions, you will lose the possession to the opponent. After every match, you will receive the play by play match report.\nThis game will be released for Android only. Whether we have sufficient resources to develop the iOS version depends on the demand.\nFor those who haven't backed the campaign, you may do so at https://coinfundr.co/product/soccer-management-mobile-game-using-bitcoin-cash-as-in-game-currency/\n submitted by /u/MobTwo\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://coinfundr.co/product/soccer-management-mobile-game-using-bitcoin-cash-as-in-game-currency/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T20:05:56.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5bea581b68eaeaf12afac7fdaff066d737c41159", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRJWqOWrOOWYx1z_zbEIPZqV9PAsIrLe21C3BitOIUPWka9NViXjGqdsDaL4rwvTSSRm4whHKy.K217t4bumTwvyxAoX1pk5qzTPYDS7br_cdPJh7OpA3rs_ZP8IxZssSI-", "site_full": "galido.net", "site": "galido.net", "site_section": "https://galido.net/blog", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Information Technology Blog", "title": "Bitcoin, The Number One Cryptocurrency – Who Accepts It As A Form Of Currency?", "title_full": "Bitcoin, The Number One Cryptocurrency – Who Accepts It As A Form Of Currency?", "published": "2018-06-08T23:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5bea581b68eaeaf12afac7fdaff066d737c41159", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRJWqOWrOOWYx1z_zbEIPZqV9PAsIrLe21C3BitOIUPWka9NViXjGqdsDaL4rwvTSSRm4whHKy.K217t4bumTwvyxAoX1pk5qzTPYDS7br_cdPJh7OpA3rs_ZP8IxZssSI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "galidon", "published": "2018-06-08T23:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin, The Number One Cryptocurrency – Who Accepts It As A Form Of Currency?", "text": "Fintech has developed greatly since the early 1900’s, and we have seen a range of important technologies emerge such as ATM’s, payment networks, and visa cards, to name a few. In the last decade, we have seen a new type of Fintech blossom – cryptocurrencies.\nCryptocurrencies are digital currencies that often use blockchain technology. This type of currency has no centralised control and no actual physical coins or banknotes. One of the most prominent cryptocurrencies to appear is Bitcoin. This article looks at what Bitcoin is and how it is being used in modern society.\nWhat Is Bitcoin? At its most basic, Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and a payment system. Bitcoins are “mined” using a mining process – servers or individual computers will perform a record keeping service and add new bitcoins to the Bitcoin blockchain network. Miners must comply with various rules and procedures such as providing proof of work.\nAll Bitcoin transactions are recorded and processed through blockchain, which is a form of public ledger. This ledger contains transaction data and is also used for validation. At any time there is only a certain number of bitcoins in circulation, and as with other currencies, the value of bitcoins fluctuates.\nWhy Is Bitcoin So Popular? Bitcoin as a currency offers numerous benefits over traditional currencies. Firstly, it provides extremely quick transactions in comparison to other online payment methods. Secondly, it provides a greater level of security as all transactions are encrypted and visible on blockchain ledger.\nFinally, Bitcoin transactions are extremely cheap. In most cases, there are no associated fees at all. In short, it is a faster and more secure form of payment that also carries less risk for merchants.\nHow Is Bitcoin Currently Being Used In Business? Although Bitcoin is not universally accepted as a form of currency, it is certainly gaining traction and many businesses are already accepting it as a type of payment. Many businesses refrain from using Bitcoin due to its unconventional nature. It is a departure from traditional currency and payment methods, and it does still remain volatile in its price.\nAs Bitcoin develops and more financial institutes provide backing to it, we should only see an increase in its usage.\nThe following are some businesses who already accept Bitcoin payments:\nPC distributor DELL Lingerie manufacturer Victoria’s Secret Online travel agent Expedia Hotel booking website Hotels.com Fast food chain Subway Telecommunications company T-Mobile Online coupon marketplace Groupon Electronics giant Apple As you can see, Bitcoin is becoming recognized in a wide variety of markets and industries. If you take a look at the infographic below, you can see a host of other businesses who are also accepting Bitcoin payments. Please note that there will be other companies who do accept it as payment, but this infographic represents some of the most well known and influential businesses who are currently setting the trend.\nURL: https://www.16best.net/blog/who-accepts-bitcoin-infographic/\nThe post Bitcoin, The Number One Cryptocurrency – Who Accepts It As A Form Of Currency? appeared first on Information Technology Blog .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "fintech", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T23:54:24.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5fd4bf37b127dfa59328e88e2ee4954e3b2b53e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYhr.7_6CWmgkHLkyNvjRP6QKLUdycTRm5VdU6wqx5hshwDoWcLVDLstz7i0_PKTE06oEooKR_Vji3aOlToNTOG6dsjzuQKLuM-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "If you think that killing Bitcoin to push transactions off-chain to centralized hubs (banking 2.0) is a fairly new idea like Lightning, think again.

Donnie wore a T-shirt emblazoned with a rocket logo, the symbol for bitcoin, and the slogan \"to the moon\".\nThe phrase, one that characterises the fervour espoused by bitcoin enthusiasts who say its price knows no bounds, was fitting.\nOver five years, the 39-year-old has made enough money from trading digital currencies to pay off his mortgage, buy a Mercedes, and now swap office life for managing his remaining crypto investments full-time.\nReceive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the Financial Times for just $1 .\n\"It was very euphoric . . . It's been life-changing for me at this point,\" says the California-based father of two, who has a cult-like Twitter following under the pen name bitcoin Dad.\nDonnie is just one member of a clubby community of early investors in bitcoin who have been able to reap the benefits of its dramatic bull run, cashing out some holdings as its value more than doubled in the space of a month to peak at around $20,000 in mid-December.\nHe will not reveal his exact returns because his new-found wealth has already left him the victim of hacking and extortion — part and parcel of the freewheeling digital currency marketplace.\nTweet\nSix months after its peak, bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency, though its price has sunk to about $7,500 at the time of publication. It follows that for each of the bitcoin millionaires, there have been numerous casualties; the \"get rich quick\" punters who entered the market a little too late.\n\"These are people that see something moving up and start buying — they jump on the bandwagon,\" says Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University and an investment strategy adviser for Man Group.\n\"Initially in the crypto space, you had people who really understood the technology. Then there was a typical bandwagon investor situation and you know how it ends — and it did.\"\nBut how many have gained — and lost — from the bitcoin bubble? Exclusive data from blockchain research company Chainalysis seen by the FT provides some tantalising answers.\nCoin exchange The Chainalysis data quantifies this distinct shift in the make-up of bitcoin owners from longer-term investors — those who held the asset for more than a year — to short-term investors who have traded more recently, by analysing how regularly coins have changed hands.\nLast November — before December's pricing peak — the amount of bitcoin held for investment was roughly three times that held by traders.\nHowever, by April 2018, the data show the amount held by investors — about 6m bitcoin — was much closer to the amount held by short-term speculators, with 5.1m bitcoin.\nIndeed, Chainalysis estimates that longer-term holders sold at least $30bn worth of bitcoin to new speculators over the December to April period, with half of this movement taking place in December alone.\n\"This was an exceptional transfer of wealth,\" says Philip Gradwell, Chainalysis' chief economist, who dubs the past six months as bitcoin's \"liquidity event\".\nMr. Gradwell argues that this sudden injection of liquidity — the amount of bitcoin available for trading rose by close to 60 per cent over that period — has been a \"fundamental driver\" behind the recent price decline. At the same time, bitcoin trading volumes have now fallen in tandem with the prices, from close to $4bn daily in December to $1bn today.\nSo will the price of bitcoin ever surpass December's peak? Part of the answer lies in who holds bitcoin now that the hype has died down.\nBorn in 2009 in the wake of the financial crisis, bitcoin is rooted in a libertarian quest for a means of exchange that is unshackled from the central banking system. Proponents — among them, computer experts and political activists — heralded the arrival of an alternative monetary system that could replace fiat currency.\nBut despite the recent crypto boom, there are few signs that this is happening. According to research published this month by Morgan Stanley, only four of the top 500 US e-commerce merchants accepted cryptocurrencies in the first quarter of 2018, compared with three at the beginning of 2017.\nChainalysis notes that the \"vast majority\" of transactions it analysed showed bitcoin being received from exchanges and rarely sent to merchant services to pay for goods or services.\nOnly a finite number of coin — 21m — can be created. Of this, about 4m are yet to be mined. Just as physical coins can be lost down the back of a sofa, so can bitcoins if users lose or forget the passwords needed to access their online wallets. The Chainalysis data separates out coins it deems to be lost or unused for years — which total 3.7m bitcoin, worth about $28bn.\nThe proportion of bitcoin it estimates to be held by groups such as exchanges or merchant services held steady between December and April at about 2.2m bitcoin.\nCritics argue that bitcoin's volatility and a lack of fundamental underpinnings disqualifies it as a reliable store of value, and that this is unlikely to change. This leaves droves of new opportunists dabbling in what has been dubbed a \"Wild West\" marketplace, with regulators still weighing up how best to tackle the space.\n\"Speculation remains the primary use case for these digital assets; merchant or institutional adoption does not appear to be a primary driver of price,\" says Preston Byrne, an English structured finance lawyer and cryptocurrency observer.\nGiven this breakdown in bitcoin owners, most market watchers do not rule out another rapid price run-up. However, they say this would likely be the random movement of pure speculation or market manipulation rather than anything else.\n\"It's very important to stress, this is not in any sense a rational market,\" says David Gerard, the author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain .\n\"It's very thinly traded, very badly structured . . . and it's stupendously manipulated,\" he adds. \"Anyone who goes in not realising just how manipulated the crypto markets are will get skinned.\"\nSome argue there is an art to trading bitcoin regardless — but it is a stressful business that takes nerves and can be addictive. Donnie, a.k.a bitcoin Dad, puts his successes down to careful research, \"patience\" and avoiding the trap of obsessive, leveraged day trading.\nBut others are unconvinced that bitcoin millionaires actually show investment nous, drawing parallels with gambling.\n\"It's the luck of the draw, where everyone who won the draw seems to feel like they deserved it for being smarter,\" Vitalik Buterin, the Russian-Canadian programmer who invented the smart-contract blockchain Ethereum, told the Financial Times recently.\nWhale watching The Chainalysis data also show that the bitcoin marketplace is skewed in terms of wealth distribution. A small cluster of investors — known colloquially as \"whales\" — capture a hefty proportion of the market, which stands at odds with bitcoin's mission to democratise finance. This brings its own risks.\nOverall, some 1,600 bitcoin wallets — managed by both speculators and investors — contained at least 1,000 bitcoin each in April, according to Chainalysis, collectively holding nearly 5m bitcoin, or close to a third of the available total.\nOf those, just under 100 wallets owned by longer-term investors contained between 10,000 and 100,000 bitcoin — so between $75m and $750m at today's prices.\n\"This concentration of wealth means that bitcoin is at risk of volatility, as the moves of a small number of people will have a large effect,\" says Chainalysis' Mr. Gradwell.\nHowever, the situation suggests bitcoin's volatility is \"of low risk to the wider financial system\", he adds, as \"only a small number of people will face large changes in crypto wealth\".\nStill, there are opportunities particularly for the larger players to engage in market manipulation, due to the dearth of regulation and existence of informal over-the-counter markets — and this leaves smaller players at a disadvantage.\n\"When you build up a big enough position in any asset you can move the price,\" says Dr Garrick Hileman, head of research at Blockchain and co-founder of Mosaic.io, a platform for market intelligence on crypto. \"A number of these larger holders do communicate with each other, they know [each other], they take stock of market activity.\"\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley echoed this concern in a note this month, saying that it was \"noteworthy\" that the more sophisticated investors were \"willing to give up traditional investor rights for potentially faster liquidity\".\nNevertheless, some point out that the excitement and influx of fresh funds into the market has allowed its infrastructure to mature — albeit gradually — which could be a boon for those looking to trade bitcoin more safely in future.\nTrading places Buying and selling bitcoin had traditionally been challenging for all but the most tech-savvy. As last year's cryptocurrency frenzy heated up however, some consumer finance businesses rushed to capitalise on the zeitgeist and offer their customers access to digital coins through apps they were already familiar with using.\nMany exchanges have strengthened their due diligence processes in response to customer concerns and invested in bigger customer services teams. Transaction fees have come down as technology has improved — but hacks are still commonplace.\nInstitutions have also been making inroads. These include prominent US futures exchanges, such as the CME Group and Cboe Global Markets, which now offer bitcoin futures. Meanwhile, Nasdaq's chief executive, Adena Friedman, said this year that the group would consider offering cryptocurrency exchange services in future.\nAlternative funds are also muscling in. Morgan Stanley data show there is now more than $3.5bn in estimated assets under management across 250 dedicated crypto-funds, although the pace of the creation of new funds has slowed recently.\nA more formalised over-the-counter market has started to develop, with players such as Cumberland, an arm of Chicago-based DRW, and Goldman Sachs-backed Circle growing rapidly.\nMuch of the future of bitcoin trading will depend on the approach that regulators take, experts say. There are stirrings across the world, though to date, little coherence. Asian financial centres such as Tokyo are now regulating crypto exchanges, while China has banned them outright. Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission last month announced a criminal probe into potential bitcoin price manipulation.\nBanks in particular have been reticent to engage with cryptocurrencies and the companies that handle them, partly due to the difficulty of conducting anti-money laundering checks on transactions.\n\"Bank compliance officers really, really hate cryptos . . . be prepared to demonstrate the provenance of every penny from every crypto,\" says Mr. Gerard.\nMr. Hileman predicts that one day there will be a \"legitimate regulated retail investment market\" in bitcoin, although not anytime soon. \"We're talking years,\" he predicts.\nAny more widespread adoption of bitcoin would need regulators, central banks and tax regulators to allow the transfer of wealth movement from the current financial system into the new one, says Gavin Brown, senior lecturer in financial economics at Manchester Metropolitan University and director of cryptocurrency hedge fund Blockchain Capital.\nNevertheless, there are those who still hold unwavering faith in bitcoin.\nSunnie, who has been investing in bitcoin since she started working for a crypto exchange back in 2014, did not cash out in December, burnt by a previous experience in 2016 when she sold thinking the price was high.\nWith 50 per cent of her assets currently in 10 bitcoin — bought initially at $3,000 a piece — she believes in its potential as the first project that uses burgeoning blockchain technology.\n\"If bitcoin can survive under such a high rollercoaster period, I have faith in it,\" she adds. \"When I reach six figures I'm probably going to cash out what I have and completely retire. The price will go to the moon again — maybe higher.\"\nAdditional reporting by Chloe Cornish\nMore from the Financial Times:\nRipple and Swift slug it out over cross-border payments\nBlockchain and cryptocurrency jargon buster\nSo the crypto, where we at?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ft.com/content/631af8cc-47cc-11e8-8c77-ff51caedcde6", "https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/06/04/1528132870000/So-the-crypto--where-we-at-/", "https://sub.ft.com/spa2_14/?segmentId=5f29555b-cfe0-3e40-9d3d-6c4e520fe546&utm_us=JJLAL", "https://twitter.com/bitcoin_dad/status/1004719046791532545", "https://www.ft.com/content/0f03ac3e-47cc-11e8-8c77-ff51caedcde6"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donnie", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "organizations": [{"name": "financial times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mercedes", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-09T00:41:46.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "619b7296414ede5535dc3cff7237ae70ec548e11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdnTmd6qa04TkRoYmaxo2b8-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Germany recognized the bitcoin", "title_full": "Germany recognized the bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-08T23:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "619b7296414ede5535dc3cff7237ae70ec548e11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdnTmd6qa04TkRoYmaxo2b8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "wantjokull", "published": "2018-06-08T23:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Germany recognized the bitcoin", "text": "Quote: from: Emin90 on March 04, 2018, 06:28:45 PM The Ministry of Finance of Germany signed the Decree on recognition of bitcoin legal tender.

I mean thats just making the Germany best country if they are not taxing it and people in their will love it a lot.\nMay be this will call for heavy transactions from the Germany side now and it could happen that many more crypto based projects will be formed in this country. :-)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T19:37:49.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "66a10814dd29f78e859fef82eaf5e16e5b12f180", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSZUXd4nph2IfJpPrM6pqmI7fORoFg8d7RWtGSFCWIioQhr33Byl5AkX4lzWyWRxhZNqh6jsDq1on", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin Price Breakout Days Away, Long-Term Trend Bullish: Analyst", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Breakout Days Away, Long-Term Trend Bullish: Analyst", "published": "2018-06-08T23:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "66a10814dd29f78e859fef82eaf5e16e5b12f180", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSZUXd4nph2IfJpPrM6pqmI7fORoFg8d7RWtGSFCWIioQhr33Byl5AkX4lzWyWRxhZNqh6jsDq1on", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-08T23:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Breakout Days Away, Long-Term Trend Bullish: Analyst", "text": "Bitcoin Price Breakout Days Away, Long-Term Trend Bullish: Analyst\nSamantha Chang\nBitcoin's price has bottomed and will break out over the next few days.
