Ủy viên điều hành và chiến lược gia đầu tư kỹ thuật của Fundstrat, Robert Sluymer dự đoán rằng sự kiện này sẽ đóng vai trò như một ngòi nổ tăng giá đối với bitcoin và những đồng tiền khác, làm xóa đi những tiêu cực về rủi ro điều hành. Dự báo giá Bitcoin & Altcoin CNBC: Rủi ro từ các nhà quản lý, rủi ro cơ bản xung quanh điều đang xảy ra đối với giới tiền kỹ thuật số vừa chạm đáy và hiện giờ chúng ta đang trong giai đoạn phục hồi về tổng quan”, ông nói trên chương trình “Fast Money. Ông giải thích rằng hằng năm bitcoin đều tăng sau sự kiện Consensus, mặc dù nó vẫn phải xem xét liệu thị trường có theo truyền thống trong năm nay.ăng giá đối với bitcoin và những đồng tiền khác, làm xóa đi những tiêu cực về rủi ro điều hành. BTC / USD Trong ba ngày qua, Bitcoin đã nhận hỗ trợ tại đường SMA 50 ngày. Những con bò sẽ mạnh mẽ bảo vệ vùng hỗ trợ giữa $ 7,900 đến $ 8.400 bởi vì nếu vết nứt này, một sự sụp đổ đến $ 7,000 sẽ được trên thẻ. Nếu vùng hỗ trợ được giữ, tiền điện tử sẽ nằm trong khoảng từ $ 7,900 đến $ 10,000. Đường SMA 50 ngày đã đi ngang trong vài ngày qua trong khi đường EMA 20 ngày đã đi ngang trong tuần vừa qua. Điều này cho thấy cặp BTC / USD sẽ sớm bước vào giai đoạn củng cố. Vùng kháng cự của dải này được thiết lập tốt ở mức $ 10,000, nhưng sự hỗ trợ vẫn chưa rõ ràng. Nó sẽ là $ 7.900 hoặc $ 6.700. Do đó, chúng tôi đề nghị chờ một vài ngày trước khi sự rõ ràng xuất hiện. ETH / USD Sự sụt giảm trong Ethereum dưới đường EMA 20 ngày đã được mua mạnh vào ngày 14 tháng 5, dẫn đến sự dịch chuyển trở lại vùng kháng cự trên $ 745. Hiện tại, cặp ETH / USD đang tìm kiếm mạnh mẽ vì nó đang nắm giữ trên mức 700 đô la. Điều này làm tăng khả năng thoát ra khỏi mức 745 $ một lần nữa. Các nhà đầu tư mạo hiểm có thể mất một vị thế dài hạn rất dài trên 750 đô la với một lệnh dừng lỗ gần. Mục tiêu là $ 838, nhưng đây là một giao dịch rất rủi ro, do đó, nên được thử chỉ với khoảng 30 phần trăm kích thước vị trí thông thường. Mặt khác, các ngưỡng hỗ trợ quan trọng là $ 637, $ 600 và SMA 50 ngày tại 570 $. BCH / USD Bitcoin Cash đã tăng mạnh trở lại từ mức thấp nhất vào ngày 12/5, nhưng nó đang vật lộn để duy trì trên đường EMA 20 ngày và phá vỡ khỏi đường xu hướng giảm nhỏ. Cặp BCH / USD có thể tạo thành mẫu hình đầu vai ngắn hạn, sẽ hoàn thành khi phân tích và đóng dưới mức $ 1,270. Mô hình giảm giá này có mục tiêu là 650 đô la, nhưng dường như không phải là một phiên giảm liên tiếp vì đồng tiền kỹ thuật số có hỗ trợ mạnh tại 1.221 đô la, sau đó là SMA 50 ngày ở mức 1.100 đô la và cuối cùng là 800 đô la. Nếu đường viền cổ áo của mẫu H & S không bị phá vỡ và giá phá vỡ trên mức 1,520 đô la, Bitcoin Cash có thể tăng trở lại mức 1.800 đô la. Nhà đầu tư nên chờ đợi giá phá vỡ và đóng cửa (UTC) trên đường xu hướng giảm trước khi mua. XRP / USD Ripple đã bứt xuống dưới đường SMA 50 ngày vào ngày 11 tháng 5 nhưng thấy lực mua mạnh ở mức 0.632 USD vào ngày 12/5. Hiện tại, nó đã tăng trở lại trên đường SMA 50 ngày. Ở phía tăng điểm, nó sẽ đối mặt với ngưỡng kháng cự mạnh tại mức 0,76 đô la, trước đây là ngưỡng hỗ trợ của dải này. Đường EMA 20 ngày nằm ngay trên ngưỡng này, cũng sẽ là ngưỡng kháng cự. Nếu cả hai mức này được vượt qua, cặp XRP / USD sẽ trở thành tích cực, và xác suất của một đợt tăng lên mức 0,9377 $ tăng lên. Nếu những con bò không vượt quá mức kháng cự trên, tiền điện tử có thể trượt tới mức 0,56- 0,58 đô la. XLM / USD Stellar bật lên khỏi đường SMA trong 50 ngày vào ngày 12/5, tuy nhiên lực cản đang đối mặt với ngưỡng kháng cự tại đường EMA 20 ngày. Nếu các nhà đầu cơ giá cao vượt qua đường EMA 20 ngày, có thể tăng lên mức 0,45 đô la. Nếu cặp XLM / USD giảm từ mức trung bình động nhưng sẽ nhận hỗ trợ ở mức 0,334 đô la, đây sẽ là một dấu hiệu tích cực và chúng tôi có thể kỳ vọng phá vỡ đường EMA trong 20 ngày trong vòng vài ngày. Tuy nhiên, một sự bứt xuống dưới đường SMA 50 ngày sẽ làm tăng khả năng mô hình đầu và vai, có thể phá vỡ đồng tiền kỹ thuật số ở mức $ 0,20. Do đó, các nhà đầu tư nên đợi mua để xuất hiện trước khi thiết lập các vị thế mua. LTC / USD Litecoin đã bứt xuống dưới đường SMA 50 ngày và ngưỡng hỗ trợ ngang ngày 11/5 nhưng nhanh chóng hồi phục từ mức thấp nhất vào ngày 12/5. Hiện tại, các nhà đầu cơ giá đang cố gắng duy trì trên ngưỡng 141 đô la, đây là tín hiệu tích cực. Bất kỳ sự dịch chuyển nào trong cặp LTC / USD sẽ đối mặt với mức kháng cự giữa mức 167 và 173 đô la. Đường SMA 50 ngày vẫn chưa xuất hiện và đường EMA 20 ngày cũng đang đi xuống. Do đó, chúng tôi không lường trước được sự bứt phá trên đường xu hướng giảm. Mặt khác, mức giá bứt xuống dưới mức 132.163 đô la mở ra một mục tiêu giảm giá là 115 đô la. Vì chúng tôi không tìm thấy bất kỳ thiết lập mua nào, chúng tôi không khuyến nghị bất kỳ giao dịch mua nào. ADA / BTC Cardano lao xuống dưới ngưỡng giảm thứ hai của chúng tôi vào ngày 12/5 nhưng đã nhận hỗ trợ tại đường SMA 50 ngày và đường xu hướng. Động thái tiếp theo đang đối mặt với ngưỡng kháng cự gần đường EMA 20 ngày. Hiện tại, giá lại trượt về phía ngưỡng hỗ trợ. Nếu cặp ADA / BTC phá vỡ hỗ trợ đường xu hướng, nó có thể giảm xuống mức 0.000025, đây là mức hỗ trợ mạnh. Mặt khác, nếu đường xu hướng giữ, Cardano sẽ cố gắng mở rộng trên mức 0.00003445. Không có thiết lập mua đáng tin cậy, do đó, chúng tôi không đề xuất bất kỳ giao dịch nào trên đó. IOTA / USD IOTA hiện đang bị kẹp giữa đường EMA 20 ngày và đường SMA 50 ngày. Các con bò đang bảo vệ ngưỡng hỗ trợ ngang tại mức $ 1.63 trong khi những con gấu đang bảo vệ đường EMA 20 ngày. Nếu cặp IOTA / USD tăng lên trên đường EMA 20 ngày và ngưỡng kháng cự trên $ 2.2117, cặp tỷ giá sẽ trở thành tích cực. Mặc dù có một kháng cự nhỏ tại $ 2,6977, chúng tôi tin rằng nó sẽ bị vượt qua nếu đồng tiền kỹ thuật số đóng (UTC) trên $ 2,2117. Chúng ta nên đợi cho sự bứt phá trước khi cho thấy bất kỳ vị thế lâu dài nào. EOS / USD Vào ngày 12 tháng 5, EOS đã thoát khỏi mức thoái lui Fibonacci 61,8% và đường xu hướng dưới cùng của kênh giảm dần. Trong ba ngày qua, nó đã phải đối mặt với kháng cự ở mức 15.1390 ​​$. Mặt khác, cặp EOS / USD sẽ đối mặt với kháng cự tại đường EMA 20 ngày và đường xu hướng trên cùng của kênh giảm dần. Một breakout và close (UTC) của kênh sẽ là một dấu hiệu tăng giá và có thể được mua bằng cách giữ một lỗ dừng dưới mức 12 tháng Năm. Nếu giá không thể vượt lên trên ngưỡng kháng cự trên thì nó có thể giảm xuống mức SMA 50 ngày. Một động thái bền vững dưới $ 12.4810 sẽ làm suy yếu đồng tiền kỹ thuật số.

lengthy correction in stock prices continues about 23 hours ago Proinsias O'Mahony\nMicrosoft co-founder Bill Gates said he would short bitcoin if there was an easy way to do it. Photograph: Rick Wilking/Reuters Bill Gates last week said he would short bitcoin if he could, prompting early bitcoin investor Tyler Winklevoss to point out that anyone who wants to bet against bitcoin has been able to do so since bitcoin futures trading began last December. “Put your money where your mouth is,” tweeted Winklevoss. That may not be wise. After all, there is, as Bloomberg’s Matt Levine points out, “no convenient way to express the view that ‘bitcoin will eventually go to zero but I have no idea what these crazy kids will get up to for the next few years’.” Still, many traders are prepared to bet against the cryptocurrency. That willingness, now facilitated by futures trading, may have burst the bitcoin bubble, according to new Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco research. only €1 first month Insightful opinion is just a away.\nSign up No obligation, cancel any time.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "http://www.iptc.org/ns/1.0"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "winklevoss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyler winklevoss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rick wilking/reuters bill gates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt levine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill gates", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "proinsias o'mahony microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T08:25:38.051+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "91ada6b9502295151eb3e1db21fcf95947fd3bf6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFQqL7fN8ia9Mz_zWeTVtpzvG5dQdvbsXrAZwSRBOsGHcxY4rpii28Vl7098lg_rAevtbGjNtOq_zA--", "site_full": "forextv.com", "site": "forextv.com", "site_section": "http://forextv.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "retirement_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "ForexTV", "title": "LedgerX Announces Bitcoin Options Trading Upgrade", "title_full": "LedgerX Announces Bitcoin Options Trading Upgrade", "published": "2018-05-15T07:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "91ada6b9502295151eb3e1db21fcf95947fd3bf6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFQqL7fN8ia9Mz_zWeTVtpzvG5dQdvbsXrAZwSRBOsGHcxY4rpii28Vl7098lg_rAevtbGjNtOq_zA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin News Editor", "published": "2018-05-15T07:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "LedgerX Announces Bitcoin Options Trading Upgrade", "text": "Home / Bitcoin News Wire / LedgerX Announces Bitcoin Options Trading Upgrade LedgerX Announces Bitcoin Options Trading Upgrade Posted by: Bitcoin News Editor in Bitcoin News Wire 1 min ago\nBitcoin derivatives platform LedgerX is launching a new, simplified interface that lets bitcoin investors earn interest on their holdings.

There is a short-term bullish trend line forming with support at $1,400 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is likely to consolidate in a range below $1,500 before making the next move. Bitcoin cash price is currently consolidating below $1,500 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD must stay above the $1,400 and $1,360 support levels to remain in a bullish zone.\nBitcoin Cash Price Upside Hurdle There were a couple of swing moves in bitcoin cash price above the $1,360 support level against the US Dollar. The price attempted to move above the $1,500 resistance on a couple of occasions. However, buyers failed to gain upside momentum above $1,500. It seems like the price is struggling to clear a strong sell wall near $1,500 and is currently following the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nIt recently traded as high as $1,493 before starting a downside correction. It moved down below the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $1,331 low to $1,493 high. However, the downside move was limited by the $1,400 support area. There is also a short-term bullish trend line forming with support at $1,400 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. Moreover, the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $1,331 low to $1,493 high also acted as a support during the recent slide.\nLooking at the chart , the price must settle above the $1,440 resistance and the 100 hourly SMA to gain momentum. A successful close above 100 hourly SMA could open the doors for a break above the $1,500 resistance in the near term.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is currently flat in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is still below the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $1,400\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,500\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Consolidating Below $1,500 appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T07:24:38.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7e1717db55692424e8609e245812212e712c1ca7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywqtwuJRJa5DTW2_4LEiHke5ViQsiHMCaqpL3k7PcjmdITuD93L9QOmg--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: How Low Can BTC Go?", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Watch: How Low Can BTC Go?", "published": "2018-05-15T07:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7e1717db55692424e8609e245812212e712c1ca7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywqtwuJRJa5DTW2_4LEiHke5ViQsiHMCaqpL3k7PcjmdITuD93L9QOmg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-15T07:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: How Low Can BTC Go?", "text": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights\nBitcoin price has bounced off the area of interest previously highlighted to signal that the selloff would resume. Applying the Fibonacci extension tool shows how low bitcoin could go from here. Technical indicators are showing mixed signals, with the oscillators reflecting more bearish pressure. Bitcoin price is bouncing off the downtrend line and looks ready to resume the drop to new lows.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside or that the selloff is more likely to continue than to reverse. The 200 SMA also lines up with the downtrend line to add to its strength as a ceiling.\nHowever, the gap between the moving averages is narrowing to signal a potential upward crossover or return in bullish momentum. The 100 SMA might also be able to hold as dynamic support. If so, a move past the trend line, swing high and $9000 mark could confirm that an uptrend is taking place.\nRSI is turning lower to show that sellers have the upper hand. Stochastic has also made its way out of the overbought zone and is heading south, so bitcoin price might follow suit. The 38.2% extension is at the $8400 area and the 50% level is close to the swing low. Stronger selling momentum could take bitcoin price to the 78.6% extension at $7913 or the full extension at $7650.\nBTC/USD 1-hour Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin price seems to be off to another shaky start for the week as another failed attempt at breaking past $9,000 has drawn more selling pressure and spooked some bulls. However, positive updates in the industry are still popping up and could ultimately allow the climb to resume.\nAt the moment, what's keeping investors on edge is the possibility that Mt. Gox will short another set of bitcoin to pay off its creditors. An estimated 8,000 coins are still up for selling, so this could have a huge weight on price.\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: How Low Can BTC Go? appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T07:24:29.136+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1b117e74b8f82f2457a5f04ad309743663cf06d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6X71ao3RyXwKY2spfCZloQBc8xKMkUvPecuMrgs2Q1218zlxnGsH8ELAV2DSE38ahumu7gTVEOeFQMmwpJ_nlKHUkNerbsMw-", "site_full": "bitco.in", "site": "bitco.in", "site_section": "https://bitco.in/forum/forums/bitcoin-discussion.2/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion | Bitcoin Forum", "title": "Intuitively feel your bitcoin transaction", "title_full": "Intuitively feel your bitcoin transaction | Bitcoin Forum", "published": "2018-05-15T07:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://bitco.in/img/opengraph.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b117e74b8f82f2457a5f04ad309743663cf06d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6X71ao3RyXwKY2spfCZloQBc8xKMkUvPecuMrgs2Q1218zlxnGsH8ELAV2DSE38ahumu7gTVEOeFQMmwpJ_nlKHUkNerbsMw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitrookie", "published": "2018-05-15T07:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Intuitively feel your bitcoin transaction", "text": "Interesting Website\nA website called TXhighway was recently known as a blockchain visualization tool.

The new provider, announced Tuesday, operates similarly to its existing bitcoin call options with a compact user encounter for investors, according to LedgerX chairman and Chief Risk Officer Juthica Chou. Chou explained: We are seeing increasingly more demand for those that want to earn some type of interest off their bitcoin and financing isn’t exactly natural to individuals – particularly lending where they earn their interest into bitcoin. So we are seeing participants return to trading. Basically, participants put a bet on what bitcoin’s cost will look like at some stage in the future.\nAt the event the purchase price grows to that amount inside time period, the participants recover their investment. At the event it does not, participants can sell their coins and receive fiat currency from the gain on that sale. This is by far the largest trade that we have seen individuals coming in to do, Chou said. I’d say that more than half of our quantity has been in this type of trade.” . The contract folks are entering into here’s that they are selling an upside phone option, therefore probably call it and application procedure standard LedgerX participants, said Chou.\nShe concluded: I think that given the cost action individuals are going to be increasingly more interested. We are very excited, since this is something we have seen a good deal of on the LedgerX platform” . Zach Dexter, Juthica Chou and Paul Chou image courtesy of Juthica Chou.

It hold the highest market cap in crypto industry. Also it use very advanced and secured technology, Block chain to operate. Lots of people's use bitcoin as a investment factor. This cause to maximize the capital of Bitcoin. But how long Bitcoin will survive in this industry ? Because lot's of government try to manipulate and control the crypto currency industry via introducing new regulation. As a country some one can do vast harm to bitcoin. We saw some of in past. If Bitcoin fail in this industry it will be a biggest financial crisis in this century.\nIt is true that bitcoin become more popular today in the world and in the indistry from a very low price and skyrocketing its marketcap to a vrry high price in the market but how long can it survive the industry i guess the pump or rhe history made by bitcoin is really a great thing and today the price of bitcoin is at stable price market range i guess it will be enough to for rhe bitcoin to survive the market as if becoming a open currency in a lot of counties.\nNobody could tell as life is very inevitable, it's market value is developing every single day, if it fluctuates it can absolutely bounce back. In fact, its volatility is what makes it more popular because it does not always give bad impact. It can be used as an advantage, like buying the dip, holding it and waiting for the appropriate time to sell.

chaintip here\nThat was 10 USD in Bitcoin Cash. the tx is https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/address/qpvqdpz0rk5xf7nq4t4qsy2cs6edj6tzsugyhe7ged\nBut at the same moment another tx was made that I can see in my Electron Cash wallet. The change went to 192SGgMXpzpjKyt4mnoNaAksvpA4y2HAKS\nWhich I don't recognise. I did not send 70 USD. I only send 10. But that same moment I lost 60 to an address I don't recognise.\nWhat is going on? I use Electron Cash with Linux Mint. My OS is fully up to date.\nedit: I don't get it anymore.\nFact: the 192SGgMXpzpjKyt4mnoNaAksvpA4y2HAKS is in my list of change address. I have the private key for it. I created a new wallet in Electron Cash and imported the private key for the 192SGgMXpzpjKyt4mnoNaAksvpA4y2HAKS address.\nFact2: my 60 USD that is missing went through chaintip. I rechecked my reddit message and I found this message from chaintip.\nBut I never made a 60 dollar chaintip to anybody? The last chaintip I made was 10 USD. How did the remainding 60 end up in chaintip's system?\nWho is the owner of 18Qfa5CuJyutA4oE13LGCY7ha4DRTqnLgE\nThat's where my 60 USD is now. I am not the owner of that address.\nIf I accidently hit max on Electron Cash and send 70 USD to the chain tip address, then why was this chaintip 10 dollars?\nI usually have multiple wallets open in Electron Cash. My kainniak wallet wich is mainly my 1Niak address. This one I use for tipping and chaintip and is my address I tell people for receiving payments.\nThen I have my yours wallet which is linked to yours.\nMy blockpress and memo.cash wallet which are linked to those two websites.\nNow recenly I have switched on change addresses and then swithc if back of. I sometimes misclick. I never wanted to use c hange addresses because my kainniak wallet is not a seed. It's imported private keys from all the way back to 2011. If a program generates a new change address then I need to make a new backup of a new private key.\nSo when I learned to work with Electron Cash and saw that change was being send to new addresses I turn it off and ever since my change has always been send back to it's own address.\nNow however for some reason a change address called 192SGgMXpzpjKyt4mnoNaAksvpA4y2HAKS became active. I have the private key for it. But from 192SGgMXpzpjKyt4mnoNaAksvpA4y2HAKS a tx was made to 18Qfa5CuJyutA4oE13LGCY7ha4DRTqnLgE\nMy 60 USD is still there.\nI can't find it in my own list of address in any of my wallet. Chaintip thinks it belongs to chaintip. They send me a message about that 60 dollars.\nWhat is going on?\nedit: I might just have been me making a copy past error and sending money to 18Qfa5CuJyutA4oE13LGCY7ha4DRTqnLgE/qpg59f8h38kht32m0n6ek0mf3chza5mwavufy53hgc instead of chaintip.\nAnybody that knows that address?\n submitted by /u/Kain_niaK\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/address/qpvqdpz0rk5xf7nq4t4qsy2cs6edj6tzsugyhe7ged", "https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/transaction/4424225e98b6ff2e5116426db3375708ebf7f8199783fd08217946a712b8f824"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T02:39:03.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "625b63c5fe018ecbae744e2b18491c3f7001aacc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va78MRez8OQVZpjW.XK.VU_1cUSntYqAv2..P25FUVsguq_1iRSnHa1YnQsbvqYg1LdPyVZGZFhCeo9Tak8KBLvamJKTnzCOYyAw--", "site_full": "bitcoin.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Bitcoin Stack Exchange", "title": "Bitcoins transaction is completed but I don't get the coins", "title_full": "Bitcoins transaction is completed but I don't get the coins", "published": "2018-05-15T07:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/bitcoin/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=462e8b9b382b", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 179, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "625b63c5fe018ecbae744e2b18491c3f7001aacc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va78MRez8OQVZpjW.XK.VU_1cUSntYqAv2..P25FUVsguq_1iRSnHa1YnQsbvqYg1LdPyVZGZFhCeo9Tak8KBLvamJKTnzCOYyAw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Yuma Yamamoto", "published": "2018-05-15T07:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoins transaction is completed but I don't get the coins", "text": "6 1 1 Can you share the error message in English?

Though the company has denied plans of adding another new product, speculation is rife that Ethereum futures may be added in the future. Ethereum futures will offer the institutional players an opportunity to diversify their trading into the top two cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Software developer Kx Systems has also launched cryptocurrency trading on its while label forex trading platform . The software supplier serves a few investment banks and hedge funds. Nasdaq is also not to be left behind. It is providing the technology to the new centralized crypto exchange, DX, which will offer trading in the market’s top six cryptocurrencies. The stage is being set for the institutional players to take the plunge. So, should the retail investors buy and hodl? We believe that the large players might first push prices down, accumulate at lower levels and then boost prices. Hence, retail investors should stagger their purchases instead of buying all at once. Let’s see if we find any buy setups on the charts. BTC/USD For the past three days, Bitcoin has been taking support at the 50-day SMA. The bulls will strongly defend the support zone between $7,900 to $8,400 because if this cracks, a fall to $7,000 will be on the cards. If the support zone holds, the cryptocurrency will stay range bound between $7,900-$10,000. The 50-day SMA has been flat for the past few days while the 20-day EMA has become flat in the past week. This shows that the BTC/USD pair will soon enter a period of consolidation. The resistance of the range is well established at $10,000, but the supports are still unclear. It will either be $7,900 or $6,700. Hence, we suggest waiting for a couple of days before clarity emerges. ETH/USD The dip in Ethereum below the 20-day EMA was aggressively purchased on May 14, resulting in a move back to the overhead resistance of $745. Currently, the ETH/USD pair is looking strong as it is holding above the $700 levels. This increases the possibility of a break out of $745 levels once again. Aggressive traders can take a very short-term long position above $750 with a close stop loss. The target is $838, but this is a very risky trade, hence, should be attempted with only about 30 percent of the usual position size. On the downside, the critical support levels are $637, $600 and the 50-day SMA at $570. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash bounced back sharply from the lows on May 12, but it is struggling to sustain above the 20-day EMA and break out of the small downtrend line. The BCH/USD pair may form a very short-term head and shoulders pattern, which will complete on a breakdown and close below $1,270 levels. This bearish pattern has a target of $650, but it is unlikely to be a straight fall because the digital currency has strong support at $1,221, then at the 50-day SMA at $1,100 and finally at $800. If the neckline of the H&S pattern doesn’t break down and prices break above $1,520 levels, Bitcoin Cash can rally back to $1,800 levels. Traders should wait for prices to break and close (UTC) above the downtrend line before buying. XRP/USD Ripple broke below the 50-day SMA on May 11 but found strong buying support at $0.632 levels on May 12. Currently, it has climbed back above the 50-day SMA. On the upside, it will face a strong resistance at $0.76, which was previously the support of the range. The 20-day EMA is just above this level, which will also act as a resistance. If both these levels are crossed, the XRP/USD pair will become positive, and the probability of a rally to $0.9377 levels increase. If the bulls fail to scale above the overhead resistance, the cryptocurrency can slide to $0.56-$0.58 levels. XLM/USD Stellar bounced off the 50-day SMA on May 12, but the pullback is facing resistance at the 20-day EMA. If the bulls break above the 20-day EMA, a rally to $0.45 levels is possible. If the XLM/USD pair turns down from the moving average but takes support at the $0.334 levels, it will be a positive sign and we can expect a break out of the 20-day EMA within a couple of days. However, a break below the 50-day SMA will increase the possibility of a head and shoulders pattern, which can sink the digital currency to the $0.20 levels. Therefore, traders should wait for buying to emerge before establishing long positions. LTC/USD Litecoin broke below the 50-day SMA and the horizontal support on May 11 but quickly rebounded from the lows on May 12. Currently, the bulls are trying to sustain above the $141 levels, which is a positive sign. Any up move in the LTC/USD pair will face resistance between $167 and $173 levels. The 50-day SMA has still not turned up and the 20-day EMA is also turning down. Hence, we don’t anticipate a break out above the downtrend line. On the downside, a break below the $132.163 level opens up a downside target of $115. As we don’t find any buy setups, we are not recommending any trade on it. ADA/BTC Cardano plunged below our second stop loss on May 12 but took support at the 50-day SMA and the trendline. The ensuing up move is facing resistance close to the 20-day EMA. Currently, prices are again sliding towards the trendline support. If the ADA/BTC pair breaks the trendline support, it can decline to 0.000025 levels, which is a strong support. On the other hand, if the trendline holds, Cardano will again try to scale above the 0.00003445 levels. There are no reliable buy setups, hence, we are not proposing any trade on it. IOTA/USD IOTA is currently sandwiched between the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. The bulls are defending the horizontal support at $1.63 while the bears are defending the 20-day EMA. If the IOTA/USD pair climbs above the 20-day EMA and the overhead resistance at $2.2117, it will become positive. Though there is a minor resistance at $2.6977, we believe that it will be crossed if the digital currency closes (UTC) above $2.2117. We should wait for the breakout before suggesting any long position. EOS/USD On May 12, EOS bounced off the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement and the bottom trendline of the descending channel. For the past three days, it has been facing resistance at the $15.1390 levels. On the upside, the EOS/USD pair will face resistance at the 20-day EMA and the top trendline of the descending channel. A breakout and close (UTC) of the channel will be a bullish sign and can be purchased by keeping a stop loss below the May 12 lows. If the price fails to rally above the overhead resistance it can again decline to the 50-day SMA. A sustained move below $12.4810 will weaken the digital currency.

If you do choose to play a slot game, however, make sure that the RTP is at least 97%. If the RTP is not available, then that is a warning sign to steer clear. When shopping around for a slot game, try to focus on the RTP instead of the theme.

Did you remembered when you are in school you always thought that you need to study hard to get a nice job in order to help your family and for you also to establish your own family. But at this generation you noticed that even though you are working with full time job it is not enough to make better way living. That's why you would try to look in another opportunities that helps you to earn more money for family.\nDo you think Investment in education is better or Investment in cryptocurrency especially in bitcoin is much better?\nBase of this articles which is better investment in future for you?\nShare your thoughts about this.\nBitcoin is viewed from an investment perspective, it is more often compared to gold than it is to other currencies. That is because bitcoin and gold have a lot in common as assets. Both are limited in supply, have functional use and are considered by many, despite their volatility, to be good stores of value. When gold and bitcoin were compared as investments over the last five years, bitcoin greatly outperformed the precious metal, generating an annualized return of 155 percent compared to golds annualized loss of 6 percent during the same period. These exuberant returns indicate that bitcoin is getting investors excited about the prospect of placing funds into a brand new asset class.\nBitcoins soaring value and its proven investor performance compared to the gold standard, are indicators that it is high time to weigh the opportunities and risks that come with investing in the worlds leading digital currency.\nOpportunities:\nMany argue that bitcoin, like other currencies, has value only because people perceive it to have value. It is for this reason that many critics view bitcoins price development as nothing more than a bubble. However, there are drivers behind bitcoins excellent returns that have nothing to do with hype or speculative opportunism.\nClickk Here to view source link https://www.google.com.ph/amp/s/www.nasdaq.com/article/bitcoin-as-an-investment-opportunities-and-risks-cm740800/amp?espv=1\nWhy an Education is the Best Investment you can Make\nWhether you consider your education a right, a privilege or something you just need to do as part of life, you should always consider it an investment. If you think of your future professional life as a business, your education is an integral part in the overall structure and quality of that business.\nAnd it doesnt matter if you end up working for yourself or someone else, the education element is an investment that provides the tools necessary for you to move forward and become successful. Every expert, leader and big shot in every industry started by learning the basic skills they needed to get the ball rolling, and the same will be true for you.\nThe Time of Your Life\nBesides having a great time with new experiences, connections are the first reason your education is a worthwhile investment. Quite often, college years are networking disguised as fun. It may not seem like youre making professional connections for the future, but its not uncommon to reconnect with the people you shared this experience with later on, especially in the age of social networks.\nDecision-Making Leverage\nSmart decisions are crucial for a business to excel, and getting a good education puts you in a position to make the right professional decisions at the right time. Being educated in your field gives you a sense of accomplishment and confidence, which enable you to make decisions with confidence moving forward.\nCareer Boost\nIt goes without saying that an education is a great investment if you plan to work in a career for someone else. Depending on your career choice, a formal education might be a must-have to even get into the field. But even if it isnt, taking that extra step will get you started higher up the ladder and will help you move up at a faster pace.\nFuture Security\nSecurity is a word you see come up regularly when speaking about education and employment. Whether you want to go out on your own or work for someone else, that education will be there to break your fall if something goes wrong or doesnt work out.\nIf you lose your job or your entrepreneurial attempt falls flat, an education means you get a second chance and it wont take nearly as long to make it happen. If you think of your career and your financial life like a business, its easy to see why an education is the best investment you can make in yourself.\nClick here to view source link http://www.cestarcollege.com/blog/news-and-events/why-an-education-is-the-best-investment-you-can-make/ Thank you!\nIt is more secured to have a future if you have achieved a good educational attainment like a bachelor's degree because you are more likely to have a good work. Investing in education is the usual go-to of people while investing in bitcoin is somehow unusual.Education is much safer and it does not only grant you good jobs in the future but knowledge which cannot be stolen by anyone, it is better if you are smart because you can think critically and you can also use your experience in school to other fields. Investing in bitcoin just make you earn money and that's it.\nThat's right, those achievers in school education is very suitable to have an assurance of reliable investment on education. But for those who wasn't able to have that professionalism, most of them were into low paying job and worst was jobless.

The Reddit community for Bitcoin is /r/bitcoin and the currency’s Github account can be viewed here . The official website for Bitcoin is bitcoin.org . Bitcoin’s official message board is bitcointalk.org .\nAccording to CryptoCompare, “Balances – block chain The block chain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions – private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing – mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends. “\nBitcoin Coin Trading\nBitcoin can be purchased on these cryptocurrency exchanges: IDAX, YoBit, Poloniex, Simex, Iquant, Gate.io, Coinroom, Kucoin, Coinone, Cobinhood, CoinBene, OKEx, CEX.IO, LakeBTC, Paribu, Kraken, Coinhub, OOOBTC, Octaex, Sistemkoin, BitMEX, Livecoin, Zaif, Quoine, Bibox, CoinTiger, Exrates, Trade By Trade, GDAX, OEX, Negocie Coins, C2CX, RightBTC, BitBay, Neraex, HitBTC, Bitinka, itBit, Bithumb, OTCBTC, Lbank, DragonEX, Tidex, Huobi, Binance, CoinsBank, Korbit, fex, Fatbtc, BCEX, Omicrex, bitFlyer, Bittrex, BTCBOX, EXX, CoinEx Market, Ethfinex, Exmo, WEX, Coinsuper, Fisco, BtcTrade.im, Upbit, B2BX, GOPAX, BTCC, Gemini, Bitstamp, Bit-Z, CoinEgg, BitForex, ZB.COM, xBTCe, Coinrail, Hotbit, TOPBTC, Bitbank, Bitfinex and Luno.

If we were to turn around and break above the $9200 level, then we will make another attempt at the $10,000 level. Bitcoin appears to be rolling over, and perhaps reaching towards the bottom of the overall consolidation for the long term, down to the $6000 level.

The bloc agreed on Monday to force cryptocurrency exchanges to identify users. That will make it harder for criminals to use virtual cash to hide their ill-gotten gains.\nThe EU’s bitcoin assault is part of a broader attack on money laundering and the financing of terrorism. To do so, the bloc is updating the existing anti-money laundering directive to shed light on opaque areas of the financial world. One key novelty is a requirement for the dozens of European exchanges which trade in currencies such as bitcoin or ethereum, and the technology companies that store the money in so-called wallets, to carry out the same know-your-customer checks as ordinary banks.\nThe new rules are an important step in the fight against illicit money flows. Anonymity, guaranteed via encrypted procedures, is probably one of the main reasons for the soaring popularity of digital currencies, which have seen their market values exceed $400 billion this year. Paying for goods and services in bitcoin or similar allows users to bypass regulated payment systems. That appeals to drug dealers or terrorists. BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink recently called virtual currencies an “index of money laundering”. The European transparency push could help change things. If transactions are no longer secret, this should deter usage for illicit means, and facilitate the work of law-enforcement agencies. It may also make it harder for criminals to hack exchanges, as happened with Slovenian group NiceHash last year.\nCriminals can still use exchanges outside the EU. There’s also a danger that more trading simply moves off exchanges. But Europe is not alone in the fight. South Korea imposed similar rules earlier this year, and the United States may not be far behind. If more trading happens out of the shadows, virtual currencies could become more respectable.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "reuters breaki", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "milan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T18:17:35.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "69724b9c11c111f655373e995d39c113c2e49389", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0czTP0YXtX.5.j_I21nXKFeHk7t4GErOcz1uaORn_7WW3PKa7rz6XB2OgDPw6Xl2bkS8E_OUMFW40xxhJ_c9obEbE0lsHRyc-", "site_full": "www.canadianprogressiveworld.com", "site": "canadianprogressiveworld.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheCanadianProgressive", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The Canadian Progressive", "title": "Bitcoin is eating Quebec", "title_full": "Bitcoin is eating Quebec", "published": "2018-05-15T06:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.canadianprogressiveworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "69724b9c11c111f655373e995d39c113c2e49389", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT0czTP0YXtX.5.j_I21nXKFeHk7t4GErOcz1uaORn_7WW3PKa7rz6XB2OgDPw6Xl2bkS8E_OUMFW40xxhJ_c9obEbE0lsHRyc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The Canadian Progressive", "published": "2018-05-15T06:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin is eating Quebec", "text": "Photo credit: Andreas Trojak via Flickr (CC BY 2.0)\nArticle by Kathryn Miles for MIT Technology Review | Posted May 14, 2018\nAt first glance, nothing looks particularly cutting-edge about this aging industrial park in Saint-­Hyacinthe, Quebec, about 60 miles east of Montreal. The air is thick with the smell of roasting cacao, which billows from a massive chocolate factory and seeps into tractor-­trailers and forgotten offices. Nearby, an audiovisual repair shop and an agricultural lab specializing in the detection of livestock pathogens vie for space with a massive disused dairy processing plant. Tucked behind all three sits a worn, low-slung building that previously served as a warehouse for a soup company and, before that, a factory producing diapers. You might think it, too, had since been forgotten, were it not for the plastic sheeting hinting at new construction inside and the small fleet of shining company cars stationed in the parking lot. But the biggest clue of all that something both new and decidedly high-tech is happening here can be heard while standing next to those cars: an omnipresent hum, audible well outside the building, created by thousands of computers, each one completing the same singular task again and again and again, day after day, without change or interruption.\nThese computers are the property of Bitfarms, one of North America’s largest cryptocurrency mining operations. Here in the once-abandoned factory, about 7,000 shoebox-size machines (as of April, but that’s expected to rise to 14,000 by July) sit tightly shelved in a single floor-to-ceiling row that bisects the building. On one side of the stacks, a mess of wires and routers exiting the rear of each computer sits exposed to the cold Canadian air. On the other, thousands of identical fans roar as they push hot air past a heap of empty cardboard boxes and into the otherwise vacant space. A handful of busy employees move between the two sides wearing thin T-shirts and jeans, their faces flushed. Even on a raw, gray day, the heat on the fan side is stifling.\nThese computers, often called “rigs,” are purpose-built. Able to withstand dramatic shifts in temperature and humidity, they are singularly programmed not only to perform just one computation trillions of times each second, but to repeat those computations around the clock and without pause. They are also energy hogs: the 7,000 in Saint-Hyacinthe alone consistently draw more energy than the Montreal Canadiens’ nearby hockey arena, even on a sold-out game night.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kathryn miles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andreas trojak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mit technology revi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "saint-­hyacinthe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quebec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montreal", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T07:03:16.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f693ff85fd3035be71b1941bb738a191416c8fea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY1yfFtVd3J8XMfjUWJdVZtPl4zRdN3usYbwia3xXpQkUkHuQI1d.nFzsTAVPBfdvhz37R1OpplSuhh0z982cZRK6tV_2Mk2EM-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Here is the Bitcoin-BCH countdown clock to the hard fork upgrade with new 32MB block limit capacity, and re-enabled op-codes.

However, BTC\\/USD is finding it difficult to break the $8,800-9,000 resistance zone. \\n Bitcoin Price Analysis \\n\nThis past week, we saw a downside reaction from well above $9,000 in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The price broke many support levels such as $9,000, $8,500 and $8,400 to trade close to $8,200. A low was formed at $8,226 before the price started an upside correction. It moved above the $8,400 resistance and even cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $9,391 high to $9,225 swing low. \\n\nHowever, the upside move was capped by the $8,800 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It was rejected from the 100 hourly SMA and declined back below $8,600. The BTC\\/USD pair broke an ascending channel with support at $8,450 on the hourly chart. The recent downside break indicates that the pair was rejected from the $8,800 resistance zone. It is currently trading below the $8,500 support with a bearish angle . However, there is a major support forming near $8,300. As long as the price is above the stated $8,300 support, it is likely to move higher in the near term. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the price seems to be consolidating above $8,300. Once the current consolidation phase is over, BTC price may either move above $8,500 or break $8,200 for more losses. \\n\nLooking at the technical indicators:\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\n\nHourly MACD \\u2013 The MACD for BTC\\/USD is now back in the bearish zone. \\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \\u2013 The RSI is currently well below the 50 level. \\n\nMajor Support Level \\u2013 $8,300 \\n\nMajor Resistance Level \\u2013 $8,600 \\n\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC\\/USD\\u2019s Upside Capped By 100 SMA appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin price analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T22:21:11.053+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2d73061f0b81a79a3bfb29da9d3109da68496b4c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbg5qYe8j86cYGMLg8Lb6II-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=180.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Haberleri", "title": "Milyarder Novogratz : Bitcoine Yatırım Yapmamak Neredeyse Sorumsuzluktur", "title_full": "Milyarder Novogratz : Bitcoine Yatırım Yapmamak Neredeyse Sorumsuzluktur", "published": "2018-05-15T06:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.064, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2d73061f0b81a79a3bfb29da9d3109da68496b4c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbg5qYe8j86cYGMLg8Lb6II-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "markandum", "published": "2018-05-15T06:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Milyarder Novogratz : Bitcoine Yatırım Yapmamak Neredeyse Sorumsuzluktur", "text": "İlk 10 veya 20 deki kripto paralara yatırım yapmak uzun vadede çok güzel kazançlar getirebilir.

Not surprisingly economists and bankers derided it, using the media at first to label it as a tool for criminals to deal drugs and fund terrorism. Yet when those allegations started to have less impact they began calling it a scam and a Ponzi scheme. \\n\nFor all the insults masters of the economic universe, like Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffet, heaped on it Bitcoin continued to grow partly because of its 21 million coin capacity. This part of its design, which ensures that it will always be scarce, made it an attractive store of wealth, like gold, and so investors started buying it up which led to the price surge of 2017. \\n\nNow that institutional money is demanding it’s piece of Bitcoin those same Wall Street stalwarts that were name calling only a few months ago are moving into the space. Starting in December 2017, the CME Group and Cboe Global Markets began trading in Bitcoin futures. JP Morgan Chase followed suit earlier this month opening the first Wall Street desk to deal in digital assets, and even the New York Stock Exchange has announced it will ‘setting up an online platform for buying and holding bitcoin.’ \\n\nHaving the same institutions that created the 2008 financial meltdown moving in and inevitably dominating the cryptocurrency space is as close to inviting a fox to guard the henhouse as possible. As the banks heavily influence the still developing regulatory aspects of crypto, such as anonymity and decentralization, which made it attractive to free thinkers in the first place they may well disappear. \\n The Potential of Blockchain Technology \\n\nWhat can’t be tampered with though is the potential of the blockchain to keep the egalitarian spirit, with which Bitcoin was conceived, alive. As it\\u00a0is described in Don and Alex Tapscott’s book, Blockchain Revolution , a blockchain ‘is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value.’ \\n\nThe take away from that description is, ‘not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value .’\\u00a0 Naturally, that ability will be used by corporations to maximize\\u00a0profitability but it is also already being used in developing countries to establish land titles , create energy sharing banks, distribute potable water, and track working conditions of the most exploited laborers. \\n\nBlockchain technology still has the potential of fulfilling the aspirations of Satochi and the early adaptors of Bitcoin to have a network of decentralized, trustworthy transactions, working outside of the reach of greed and ignorance to make people live better. \\n Featured image from Shutterstock. \\n\nThe post Blockchain Retains Potential to Disrupt Even If Bitcoin Gets Bought Out appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T22:21:28.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b14853ee7d48dee3d07262d64b821785ff84ea06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSuqbox6T2R2WbuFNVeYCVUPrMJXeheAPC7_7WbipgR5cWo4V1zz2AIYlhglQtzRZg-", "site_full": "www.mt5.com", "site": "mt5.com", "site_section": "https://uncumaison.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "\"Forex Analysis and Reviews\" RSS feed", "title": "Technical analysis of Bitcoin for May 15, 2018", "title_full": "Technical analysis of Bitcoin for May 15, 2018", "published": "2018-05-15T06:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10090, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b14853ee7d48dee3d07262d64b821785ff84ea06", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSuqbox6T2R2WbuFNVeYCVUPrMJXeheAPC7_7WbipgR5cWo4V1zz2AIYlhglQtzRZg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-15T06:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Technical analysis of Bitcoin for May 15, 2018", "text": "The Bitcoin after they test the Support Become Resistance Zone (SBR) 8617.77 - 8851.55 level they now going to moving down for a test their next support at 8320.63 level this already indicated and confirmed by:\n1.

tax collector would accept the cryptocurrency for payments of several services.\nCurrently, Bitcoin is trading at: 8,695.652344, +292.291016, or +3.478256% , a s of 3:56a BST, the market is open.\nJoel Greenberg, tax collector for Seminole County Florida, teamed up with Bitcoin payments processor BitPay to accept payments in both Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash for driver’s licenses, ID cards, automobile tags and titles and property tax, according to a statement released Monday. Mr. Greenberg said the cryptocurrency acceptance is a way to bring government services into the 21st Century. The upward move in the largest crypto came after marking a low of $8,204.50 Saturday, its lowest mark since 19 April 2018. The critiques continued Monday with the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis James Bullard commenting that growth in Bitcoin and other digital currencies is creating a “non-uniform” currency in the United States, which in the past has existed but was ultimately rejected and replaced. In other cryptocurrency news, CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) announced that it was embarking on launching an ether-dollar reference rate and a real-time ether-dollar index in partnership with UK-based digital asset trading service Crypto Facilities. Last week a San Francisco Fed research team published a report that said the launch of Bitcoin futures crashed the price of the underlying asset. In other crypto trading Ethereum rose 1.4% to $731.43 in the last 24 hours Ripple traded up 2.5% to $0.73826, and Bitcoin Cash fell 1.7% to $1,449.2.\nStay tuned…\nBitcoin Tested Support to a 3 Wk Low and Bounced added by Paul Ebeling on May 14, 2018", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.addthis.com/help/api-spec", "https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTCUSD%3DX?p=BTCUSD%3DX", "https://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "http://www.g-bit.io/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joel greenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cme bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitpay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve bank of st. louis james bullard", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seminole county florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T12:58:56.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "337c97affe6928db040dac2caa30fa8b7a35955b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5uVLlyanVHNt.DRj1xABH.XX_seqnGItsDnPxGs1kWknty5c56875ZWRp2tMZDQpp6FxB.oX79UMEbDVoVujj1ZMzCHZMl6P2VgXmrdhJzIPYoN2Oh4tLyje66hNdGXn5.f4xElXWxT9", "site_full": "cryptogeeks.com", "site": "cryptogeeks.com", "site_section": "http://cryptogeeks.com/news/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin: Blatant vandalism by Roger and his goon squad at Consensus 2018.

Sorry for any inconvenience.\nIsn't it wallet-related problem? I read in the FAQs of the wallet I'm using that \"Transactions sent from smart contracts are structured differently than those sent from externally-owned ETH accounts. Because of this, some external ETH wallets are not able to pick up transactions from smart contracts\", most of my friends with the same concern is using the same wallet/exchange (coins.ph). I tried to deposit using ShapeShift and it was credited immediately, so I assume this is wallet-related problem.\nThat should be fine, our ETH blocks were falling out of sync for some reason.\nQuote: from: Real14Hero on May 14, 2018, 08:51:13 PM Any chances of currencies like byeballs getting induced to the site?

As the event was getting started, a group of people could be found marching in front of the hotel hosting the 8,500-person-strong gathering. They chanted slogans like \"hey hey, ho ho, Bitcoin has got to go,\" and held signs informing anyone who passed by that \"paper checks use less electricity!\"\nAnd, as things often go in the world of Bitcoin, everything was not as it seemed.\nSome _intentional_ comedy outside the Consensus blockchain conference pic.twitter.com/GzLxFhdQPZ\n— Jack (@jmorse_) May 14, 2018\nThe \"protest\" was ostensibly organized by a group calling itself Bankers Against Bitcoin, which, as you have probably guessed, is not a 100-percent real protest group. It does have real backing, though. Specifically, that of Bitcoin mining company Genesis Mining .\nImportantly, it's not like Genesis Mining is trying to hide it. As the organizer's website explains, the company wants everyone to get on the cryptocurrency rocket ship before it's too late.\n\"This protest is representative of what will happen to those industries and companies that fail to understand times have changed,\" explained Genesis Mining CEO Marco Streng on the Bankers Against Bitcoin website. \"The consumer abuse that’s been possible due to a lack of competition is over. The biggest competitor big banks have ever faced has arrived and it’s not a company or organization, it’s a decentralized technology.\"\nBankers against bitcoin.

"text": "Transactions visualizer of Bitcoin [BTC] and Bitcoin Cash [BCH] made available by TXhighway May 15, 2018 Two Bitcoin Cash fans have created the website called TXhighway which is a Blockchain visualizer. The creators of the website wanted to find a simple way for normal users to visualize their transactions on both the chains while providing a comparison of the two competing chains of Bitcoin [BTC] and Bitcoin Cash [BCH]. The developers of this website strongly feel that the Big Blocks of the Bitcoin Cash [BCH] can provide fast confirmations, extremely low fees and has on chain scalability which would allow Bitcoin to become the peer to peer digital currency. The developers are of the opinion that there are wide open highways with Bitcoin Cash when compared to the Gridlocks on the Bitcoin legacy. The whole web-page of TXhighway is quite amusing. There are eight lanes of Bitcoin Cash which is 8MB in Block size, while the single lane is the Bitcoin legacy is the limited 1MB block size.

Greenberg said accepting bitcoin and bitcoin cash as a payment method will promote transparency and accuracy in payment.\n“There’s no risk to the taxpayer,” said Greenberg, who has often raised eyebrows since his 2016 election by moves including encouraging certain employees with concealed-weapons permits to carry a firearm openly as a security measure. “Blockchain technology is the future of the whole financial industry.” Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies like it, aren’t issued by the government or regulated by a bank and exist solely online.\nDetractors of the digital currency say its volatility makes it risky. Eddie Ayala, spokesman for Orange County Tax Collector Scott Randolph, said his office isn’t considering allowing bitcoin payments.\n“We haven’t had any discussion,” Ayala said. “Frankly, I think the currency is so volatile that I don’t think it makes sense.” David Jordan, chief deputy for Lake County Tax Collector Bob McKee, said no customer has asked to pay taxes in bitcoin.\n“Our staff would have called and mentioned that,” Jordan said. He said it was interesting but “not on our to-do list.” He also said he was unsure if there was a statutory provision in Florida law that allows a tax collector to accept cryptocurrency as payment.

The extra data also includes the block's location in the blk*.dat files (file number and byte offset within the file for the beginning of the block). So looking calling getblock just means that the key-value pair for the block hash is taken from the LevelDB database which I believe is O(nlog(n)) (IIRC it uses some kind of tree as the backing structure). To get the block itself, the lookup is O(1) as it just has to read a specific file at a specific offset.\nVery few RPC calls in Bitcoin Core actually do any sort of searching through the blockchain.

But the seven billion people not yet using Bitcoin might not care about any of that. With networks, convenience wins, and convenience is based on size. It窶冱 the reason you窶决e on Facebook rather than some other social-media site窶巴ecause everyone else is. If cryptocurrencies are to be widely used, it will be the habits of the masses, not the wishes of Bitcoin窶冱 early adopters, that determine what becomes of founder Satoshi Nakamoto窶冱 vision.\nIn 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto served the world an entirely new kind of currency. It was one that people could move over the internet instantaneously and nearly free of charge. Issued and distributed not by a central bank but by its own users, it drew the drapes of privacy around financial transactions while making forgery窶琶n theory, at least窶琶mpossible.\nIt窶冱 nine years later, continues Morgen Peck in MIT’s Technology Review, and there are now 24 million active Bitcoin wallets in use around the world. The value of a single bitcoin has risen from about a dollar in 2011 to as high as $19,700 in late 2017.\nBut success, of course, breeds competition. And Bitcoin is now clearly the dominant cryptocurrency; as of this writing, in early April, its market cap was three times that of Ethereum, its nearest competitor, and roughly equal to those of all other cryptocurrencies combined.\nYet while Bitcoin has established an economy in which it窶冱 impossible to forge transactions, it provides no defense against replication of the idea itself. No one can copy an individual bitcoin, but anyone can copy the idea of Bitcoin. So how might a government, or a corporation, or even ordinary people, go about doing so in a way that makes Bitcoin useless or redundant? Here are a few scenarios.\nThe year is two-thousand-something-big, and it窶冱 the day your taxes are due. But you don窶冲 file them. Instead an algorithm automatically makes a withdrawal from your electronic wallet, in a currency called Fedcoin.\nIt窶冱 the digital version of those crunchy bills you only vaguely remember from many years ago, back before the central banks began taking paper cash and redeeming it for fedcoins. Over the years, you窶况e seen less and less hard currency. You don窶冲 need it anymore, not when you can walk into a local bank, verify your identity, and set up a wallet on your phone. Sure, you still have a few dollar bills. But they are tucked away as souvenirs.\nThis hypothetical technology窶蚤 ﾂｭcentral-bank-issued digital currency built with a tweaked version of the Bitcoin blockchain窶背as described by David Andolfatto, a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and later refined by Sahil Gupta, who as an undergraduate at Yale wrote a study on how a currency like Fedcoin would work. With some colleagues, he wrote code to test a simulation.\n|笙認erd", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi nakamoto窶冱", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morgen peck", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "technology review", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T04:34:31.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "95ee4c233eaae2c572761cbeded46ca4fb83d615", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWE4Mt1H34qTBZ6VZWtV.JA-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin VS.
