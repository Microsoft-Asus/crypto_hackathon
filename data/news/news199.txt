This may not seem like a lot but when you add in the costs then you realize it is a big deal. Those costs are estimated at $40 Billion a year !! Now that gets your attention. ( This from the US and FBI as reported in Rough Notes magazine, May 2018). So the question is can technology stop the fraud? Blockchain may just be the ticket to put a stop to the fraudsters.\nBlockchain is the technology that powers bitcoin. Its use as a tool is spreading into various other applications. The insurance industry is no exception. Because of its recorded and public ledger, insurance companies see it as a way to reduce the frequency and severity of bogus claims. The transparency of blockchain will give claim adjusters an easier way to validate true claims and recognize the fake ones.\nThe technology behind blockchain is for another blog post. But you can surely bet that insurance companies will be sinking their teeth into making it part of their claims processing. Until next time be careful out there and know your risks.\nG.

So convinced is one man that cryptocurrency is the future, he’s given up his apartment and is living in his car while putting every spare cent towards his crypto portfolio.\nAlso read: Marvel, The Simpsons Go Crypto Crypto or Bust\nLast year, as bitcoin mania escalated, stories began to surface of men mortgaging their homes and going all in on crypto. But it’s not just homeowners that have given up everything in the pursuit of crypto glory: one man has forsaken his apartment in favor of living out of his car. It’s a life choice that even the most ardent of bitcoin maximalists would deem excessive, but then crypto has a tendency to attract extremists possessed with a fervent zeal.\nThe Canadian man, posting under the handle “Livinginmycar”, shared his sleeping arrangements on 4chan’s biz message board , where crypto traders assemble to shitpost and share portfolios. Some commenters were supportive of his cause, while others were less sympathetic, one writing: “How fucking retarded are you brainlet, when you think that crypto will make you rich?…Money was made and you missed the train. Good luck waking up with 30 and being broke.” OP (i.e the original poster who started the thread) remains undaunted however, explaining how he balks at paying $800 per month in rent because “that money belongs in my crypto stack”. Living in a Garage, Working in a Warehouse\nThe man explains that he parks his car in his friend’s garage to sleep, for which he pays $40 CAD per month. Despite the cramped conditions, he hasn’t forgone all home comforts, finding space to squeeze in a memory foam mattress and comfy quilts. He’s also able to shower at a friend’s house and store some items there. As for his crypto portfolio, the unnamed Canadian is currently pinning his hopes on Collosusxt, Fundrequest, Policypal, and Dero.\nDuring the day, the man works as a forklift driver in a warehouse and in the evenings he delivers food. His own meals come in the form of takeaway, but he claims to try and eat healthily. Some biz posters who had cheered the guy in the original thread, in which he first proposed his car living scheme, have since withdrawn their support after seeing the coins he’s coveting. OP’s portfolio reportedly stands at $6,000 CAD, but he professes to be adding an additional $2,500 per month.\nWhile commenters were divided on whether OP will make it in his quest to become crypto rich, it was widely agreed that he’ll have a memorable tale to tell years from now. As high risk strategies go, giving up your apartment and going all in on altcoins is about as perilous as it gets. Win or lose, OP will be able to look back and know that he gave it his all in his one shot for glory.\nWould you live in your car in exchange for crypto riches?

If you are a US person or an entity with at least one 25 percent owner who is a US person, please complete the appropriate FATCA form. You are required to provide us with such information,” said Bitfinex. Targeted Users\nWhalepool, a community of day traders focused mainly on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Bitfinex, emphasized that they strongly disavow the decision of Bitfinex and have withdrawn their funds from the exchange.\n“Bitfinex is now requiring users to give their tax information so that it can send it to BVI which will exchange it with your country’s tax authorities. We strongly disavow. If you also disagree with this decision, peacefully protest it by withdrawing your money from Bitfinex,” the Whalepool team said.\nIn response to the statement of Whalepool, the Bitfinex team noted that it has “deliberately targeted users” that it believes have an obligation to self-disclose and emphasized that only a portion of the Bitfinex user base was asked to disclose their tax identification and personal information.\nIn some regions like the US and France, capital gains tax on cryptocurrency investment is quite substantial. Until this month, the gains tax imposed on cryptocurrency trading was 45 percent, which was decreased to 19 percent by France’s Council of State because investors were not willing to disclose their earnings just to be taxed 45 percent.\nIn consideration of the high capital gains tax imposed on cryptocurrency trading, it is understandable that investors in the global cryptocurrency market try to avoid disclosing their tax IDs and prevent from being forced to pay abnormally large taxes on trades.\nThe abrupt decision of Bitfinex led the cryptocurrency market and investors that trade the bitcoin-to-USD, which is still the majority of investors in the market, to panic sell and withdraw their funds out of Bitfinex.\nAccording to CryptoCompare, a cryptocurrency market data provider, Bitfinex remains as the biggest bitcoin-to-USD exchange with more than 29 percent of the market share. Bitcoin Price Falls\nThe period in which Bitfinex sent out its official statement to its clients coincided with the fall in the price of bitcoin on May 17, when the bitcoin price reached a two-month low at $7,925. It is highly likely that the price drop of bitcoin was largely caused by Bitfinex and the sell-off of investors on the platform trading the bitcoin-to-USD pair.\nThe cryptocurrency market still remains extremely volatile. Over the past 24 hours, the daily trading volume of the cryptocurrency market has dropped $5 billion, from $21 billion to $16 billion. As such, it is possible that the bitcoin price falls further below from the current rate at $8,320. But, given that the market has already started to recover from the May 17 dip, it is likely that the bitcoin price rebounds soon, along with other major cryptocurrencies and tokens.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

However, the digital-currency market more broadly wasn't faring as well, with most virtual assets kicking off the week in decline.\nAfter reaching a weekend high of $8,575.99, bitcoin has retreated and a single bitcoin was last worth $8,468.71, down 1% since Sunday's levels at 5 p.m. Eastern Time on the Kraken exchange.\nDespite the sluggish start to the week, sentiment remains high. The CEO of Atlas Quantum, one of Brazil's largest crypto trading platforms, Rodrigo Marques, said in an email to MarketWatch that the move under $8,000 was an interim low for bitcoin, adding that he expects bitcoin to reach $20,000 in six months, recapturing levels it hasn't approached since December.\nRead:A recent shift in Uranus means big things for cryptocurrencies (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/people-are-buying-bitcoin-because-their-horoscope-said-so-2018-05-17)\nIn further positive news for bitcoin enthusiasts, futures trading showed most investors aren't giving up on the No. 1 digital currency. \"We saw many traders roll out from May to June over the past few days,\" wrote Peter Lusk, senior instructor at the Cboe Global Markets Inc. \"Rolling futures to a further-dated contract is typical when near-term futures move toward expiration.\"\nHolders of bitcoin futures could have opted to exit their position and settle.\nRead:The advent of bitcoin futures sparked the selloff from $20,000, says San Francisco Fed (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-advent-of-bitcoin-futures-sparked-the-selloff-from-20000-says-san-francisco-fed-2018-05-07)\nWhat are altcoins and futures doing?\nAltcoins, or those considered alternatives to bitcoin, have stumbled out of the blocks Monday.

By May 21, 2018 1,535\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were designed to be efficient, low-friction alternatives to traditional financial systems. But it seems their creators maybe didn’t think too hard about their sustainability.\nAn analysis published in the journal Joule this week predicts the Bitcoin network could be using 7.67 gigawatts of electricity by the end of the year. That’s half a percent of the world’s electricity and the same amount used by the whole of Austria.\nThe problem comes from the way Bitcoin verifies transactions. To avoid duplicate spending of coins, members of the network compete in tricky computational challenges for the right to create the next block of transactions in the chain in return for a reward—currently 12.5 bitcoins (roughly $10,000).\nBut solving these challenges—a process known as “mining”—requires you to run high-powered computers nearly continuously, which uses a lot of electricity. The paper’s author, economist Alex de Vries, estimates a single transaction uses the same amount of energy as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month.\nTo add to the problem, the mining challenges are getting harder, forcing miners to invest ever more power-hungry hardware. That’s because the network self-regulates to keep the rate of new blocks constant at around 1 every 10 minutes by increasing the difficulty of the calculations depending on the total computational power of the network.\nThis combines to create a situation where the energy use of the system can only really go one way—at least until the cost of mining bitcoins reaches equilibrium with the cost of the electricity and hardware required to do so.\nThe 7.67 GW figure is actually de Vries’ estimate for when this equilibrium will be reached, something he says could happen this year. But it’s worth noting that his estimates are based on some pretty big assumptions.\nDe Vries based his estimates on the energy usage of the Antiminer S9, the top-of-the-range specialized mining chip produced by market leader Bitmain. He then assumed a 1–2 year lifetime for these chips, an average electricity cost of 5 US cents per kWh, and a production cost of $500, based on estimates from a bitcoin developer.\nHe used these figures to work out what percentage of the lifetime cost of the chips went to electricity, coming to a ballpark figure of 60 percent after hedging for the uncertainty around the chips’ lifetimes. By combining this figure, his assumed electricity cost, and the value of Bitcoin mined on March 16 of this year, he reached his figure for equilibrium.\nThe reason he thinks we could reach this equilibrium point in 2018 is based on the fact that the number of Antiminers due to be produced this year would have a combined electricity consumption of 8.92 GW, so there should be enough devices to make it possible.\nThat’s a lot of assumptions, and the model relies on both the price of electricity and bitcoin staying the same until the end of the year, which the last 12 months suggests is unlikely. Marc Bevand, a bitcoin investor and entrepreneur who has also made efforts to forecast Bitcoin’s energy usage, pointed out to Gizmodo that de Vries’ estimate also assumes Bitmain is selling its chips at cost, which gives miners much more money to spend on electricity.\nStanford University energy economist Jonathan Koomey criticized previous estimates made by de Vries on his Digiconomist blog using a similar approach, because he said basing the analysis on estimates about manufacturers’ costs and revenues introduced lots of opportunity for error and uncertainty.\nBut with no publicly-available data on energy consumption from the miners themselves, making unambiguous claims about the electricity use of these networks is hard. Indeed, de Vries admits that there’s plenty of scope for disagreement, but he says it’s important to start doing these calculations now so we can start to think about the policy implications of Bitcoin’s energy use.\n“We don’t really have a common approach to getting to a future estimate of electricity consumption right now, which is why I am hoping to get this conversation started,” he said in a press release . “I’m doing this research, but a lot of people should be doing it.”\nIt’s not all a one-way street. The problems around Bitcoin’s energy consumption have been known for a while, and there are efforts underway to deal with the problem.\nThere are various proposals for more energy-efficient alternatives to the pointless computation used to verify transactions. Most notable is an approach currently being considered by the second-biggest cryptocurrency , Ethereum, that bases decisions on who makes the next block using a lottery, with your chances of winning based on how many coins you have.\nCompanies like Bitmain are also working on ever more efficient mining chips, and as demand goes up you can expect bigger players to pile in too. Intel recently applied for a patent on a high-efficiency specialized Bitcoin mining chip .\nBut it is worth noting that another Bitcoin boom like the one experienced at the end of last year would see that point of equilibrium shift far higher, incentivizing even greater electricity use.\nWhile we shouldn’t take the figures from de Vries’ analysis as gospel, they are a useful reality check for anyone assuming that cryptocurrencies, at least in their current form, are the future of our financial system.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T18:04:17.039+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8ccc7acd0d13ed8babc5e623469230f366b525e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSyyctu74_qR86LhZo8Ze3OA-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.137, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8ccc7acd0d13ed8babc5e623469230f366b525e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSyyctu74_qR86LhZo8Ze3OA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nTo take part in the promo, you need to make public post on your timeline in one of your social networks and keep it live at least before the promo ends.

The market cap now stands at US$144.86 billion, with US$1.64 billion traded in the past 24 hours. On the network side, hash rate and difficulty continue to push record highs, with ongoing shipments of ASICs from multiple mining companies, including Bitmain and Halong. Although the original Bitcoin Whitepaper described Proof of Work (PoW) as “one-CPU-one-vote,” the lead SIA coin developer David Vorick argues that “for any algorithm, there will always be a path that custom hardware engineers can take to beat out general purpose hardware.” Drastic increases in ASIC usage can have a detrimental long term effect as they increase the likelihood of smaller independent miners being squeezed out of the market. The highest percentage of mining will continue to concentrate in large mining farms, where economies of scale and cheap electricity are available. Furthermore, ASIC chips are typically manufactured by a small number of technology companies, meaning the bulk of the network is running on the same hardware. If that hardware is found to be faulty or exploitable, the entire network is at risk. Concerns over PoW have not been limited to ASIC proliferation. A recent presentation by Alex de Vries of Price Waterhouse Cooper in the Netherlands, “ Bitcoin's Growing Energy Problem ,” concludes that Bitcoin currently consumes at least 2.55 GW of electricity, and is on pace to consume 7.67 GW in the near future. This leaves the networks energy consumption comparable to countries such as Ireland now (3.1 GW) and Austria in the future (8.2 GW). Others see this as an energy revolution opportunity. Peter Van Valkenburg of CoinCenter, a non-profit research and advocacy center focused on the public policy issues facing cryptocurrency in Washington D.C., has argued that instead of destroying the planet, Bitcoin will push the energy market towards more sustainable alternatives , driving an energy revolution. Mining in Canada and Iceland uses hydro and geothermal power, while wind and solar are among the cheapest energy sources available. Bitcoin advocate Andreas Antonopoulos shares this view and has questioned the hidden resource needs required by other payment platforms. However, the number of network nodes has fallen slightly over the past few months after reaching more than 12,500 in November. These statistics include mining and non-mining nodes. Although archival nodes are not incentivized directly with a block reward, they ensure network consensus. Based on global distribution, the United States and Germany have the highest percentage of nodes. Source: https://bitnodes.earn.com Transactions per day remain down sharply from the record high in December, above 400k, and are currently below 200k per day. Transactions have not only declined due to a lack of usage but also transaction batching , where one transaction is sent to many addresses at once instead of each transaction being sent individually. Using an adjusted network value to transactions ( NVT ) ratio, BTC remains in the upper-third of historical NVT value. While NVT has not been this high since January 2015 it has begun to turn downward recently, which suggests increasing on-chain network utility based on the dollar amount being transacted. Although NVT is difficult to compare between coins, which use different transactions types, the ratio can be used to assess the network’s relative utility over time. DOGE is the only coin that has had an NVT consistently lower than BTC (not shown). Additionally, inflexion points in NVT ratio can be correlated to extreme highs or lows in price. Transaction fees, which increased dramatically throughout 2017, have also declined significantly. This fee reduction is also multifactorial. Although a decrease in transactions per day means fewer transactions needing to be cleared, SegWit, which currently accounts for 39% of transactions, has also been a significant contributing factor to the average fee decline. The SegWit soft fork also enabled second layer network upgrades like the Lightning Network. Since going live on March 15, the Lightning Network (LN) has continued to gain traction as new channels come online and apps are created. The software solution enables trusted, bidirectional, off-chain, hub and spoke payment channels and also promises the possibility of instant payments, microtransactions, and increased scalability. The channels work much like a tab at a restaurant, which remains open until the client settles the bill. This format allows for numerous transactions to occur without a network fee until the channel is closed. Source: https://p2sh.info At Consensus NYC, Square co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey and Lightning Labs co-founder and CEO Elizabeth Stark discussed their vision for the future of payments. Dorsey, who had an early interest in hacker and cypherpunk movements, was also an investor in a Lightning Labs seed round. Dorsey focused on the need to keep Bitcoin an open source project and the need for a native currency of the internet. He also hinted at a Square and Lightning partnership down the road saying, \"We want to go back to that original idea of being able to purchase a coffee with it. And that's why we're working with Lightning Labs. Whatever it takes to get there, we're going to make sure it happens.\" During his keynote speech at Consensus, eToro CEO Yoni Assia announced a new American crypto platform which will be trading Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP, Dash, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Ethereum Classic, NEO, and EOS. Cryptocurrency trading on eToro increased by 4,500% in 2017, according to MarketWatch . Bitcoin exchange traded volume this week has been led by the Tether (USDT) and USD markets for the fourth consecutive week, mostly on Binance, OKEX, and Bitfinex. In Asia, the JPY volume strongly leads the pack, thanks to friendly regulations and oversight, including declaring Bitcoin legal tender. The KRW premium is currently at 1.78%. CNY volume continues to fade. Globally reported over the counter (OTC) volume from LocalBitcoins.com remains sharply down from December and January but has begun to increase again. Venezuela continues to post record highs in Bolivar volume, fueled by hyperinflation . Thus far, the hyperinflation rate has followed an almost identical trajectory as the Weimar Republic. The Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro Moros, won the national election earlier today. Technical Analysis Bitcoin continues to drift sideways on low volume, with an inability to establish a clean trend on high timeframes. The status of any emerging or nascent trend can be determined using Moving Averages, Chart Patterns, Ichimoku Cloud, and Pitchforks. Further background information on the technical analysis discussed below can be found here . On the daily chart, open long/short interest on Bitfinex leans long, with shorts flat and longs rising (top panel, chart below). Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) have gone flat, suggesting price consolidation. Price has fallen below the 200EMA with a bearish 50/200EMA cross. Price structure shows a multi-month symmetrical triangle, or coil. In Technical Analysis of Stock Trends (1948), Edwards and Magee suggest that roughly 75% of these triangles lead to a continuation of the trend, while the rest mark reversals. In any case, this pattern will be a ‘trade the breakout’ situation because it will likely lead to weeks of trend follow through. Breakouts post consolidation typically occur after at least 66% of the triangle has completed (yellow highlight). Turning to the Ichimoku Cloud on the weekly chart, there are four metrics; the current price in relation to the Cloud, the color of the Cloud (red for bearish, green for bullish), the Tenkan (T) and Kijun (K) cross, and the Lagging Span. The best entry always occurs when most of the signals flip from bearish to bullish, or vice versa. The Cloud metrics on the weekly time frame are; price above Cloud, bullish Cloud, bullish TK cross, and Lagging Span above price and Cloud. Together, these signals suggest the trend is bullish, and will remain bullish until a bearish TK cross or price dips below the Cloud. Price itself is below the Kijun and, seemingly, in no-man’s land. Price and volume structures suggest the possibility of an unconventional inverted head and shoulders, a bullish reversal pattern. A long entry would not be warranted until price is above the Kijun, essentially also above the neckline of the head and shoulders chart pattern. The Cloud metrics on the daily time frame are; price inside Cloud, bearish Cloud, bullish TK cross, and Lagging Span above price but below Cloud. A long entry based on traditional Cloud rules does not occur until the Cloud is breached by price, currently at ~US$11,586. However, a long reversal trade opportunity known as the Edge to Edge (E2E) trade can be taken advantage of with the current Cloud structure. A long entry based on the E2E trade occurred several days ago, with a stop loss below the Kijun. Price dropped out of Cloud and below the Kijun, suggesting any active longs should be closed at that time. Although price has breached Cloud resistance for the second time, traders may avoid entering a second E2E trade this quickly as the previous E2E trade failed. An E2E failing to reach its target is often an indication of additional consolidation being needed before price momentum returns. Price typically follows through with the direction of the E2E trade, but not until the Kumo twist, which in this case will occur after June 19th. The Cloud metrics on the four hour time frame are; price below Cloud, bearish Cloud, bearish TK cross, and Lagging Span above price and below Cloud. A traditional long entry will not occur until price is above Cloud at ~US$8,942. An E2E long entry would trigger after a breach of Cloud at US$8,300. The previous four hour Kumo breakout led to a 27% price increase and both of the previous four hour E2E moves occurred in very few candles. Penultimately, price has returned to the original upward trending Pitchfork beginning in 2015, with anchor points in January, May, and August of that year. Price broke North of this trend in October 2017 and again currently sits in the upper limits. A downside target of US~$5,700 is possible should price return to the mean (red line) of the prior trend. Lastly, another Pitchfork on the daily chart starting in 2017, with anchor points in January, May, and July, shows price reaching a similar distance below the mean (red line) as was reached above the mean in December. Price has closed this pitchfork for several days suggesting bearish invalidation. If price returns to inside the Pitchfork, a return to the mean is possible. Conclusion ASICs continue to drive conversations about the network, both in terms of centralization and increasing power consumption. Network usage and fees remain relatively low with SegWit and Lightning metrics steadily increasing. Exchanges and go-to-market apps continue to be developed. Technicals suggest ongoing consolidation with several failed bullish reversal attempts, based on Ichimoku Clouds and a longstanding Pitchfork. The structure of price consolidation suggests bullish continuation, which may occur as early as May 31st. If the consolidation results in further downside a bearish target of ~US$5,700 is likely, based on a multi-year Pitchfork.

Unlike the fiat (physical) currency which can be printed, stored and controlled by the banks, cryptocurrencies can only be held electronically in wallets created solely for the purpose of their storage. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies is made possible through the blockchain. This is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently in a verifiable and permanent way.\nThe peer-to-peer methodology of cryptocurrency transactions are meant to be secure, and in most cases, anonymous. The peer-to-peer approach eliminates the need for a third party as in the case of conventional financial institutions (banks) which will usually oversee the transaction and charge a fee for the services rendered.\nSecurity and anonymity is achieved through cryptography. Cryptography is a process which is used to protect data or information from theft and alteration by converting them into undecipherable codes which can only be interpreted by the person it is meant for. It can also be used for user authentication.\nThe concept of blockchain and cryptocurrency was first introduced by a person (or group of persons) called Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Satoshi’s idea of a decentralized currency, devoid of manipulation and inflation caused by the world’s major financial institutions gave birth to the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin in 2009. Bitcoin became the first digital currency to enable a safe andsecure exchange of product/service between two parties without requiring a third party institution.\nThe process of creating bitcoin is called mining. Although the concept of bitcoin was innovative and ground-breaking, but just like other mother technologies, it had some shortcomings that had to be improved upon. The quest for these improvements that will eliminate the flaws noticeable in bitcoin has led to the creation of numerous other cryptocurrencies called ‘alternative coins’ or altcoins for short. Examples of altcoins are ethereum, ripple, digibyte, litecoin e.t.c.\nBENEFITS OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES\n1. Inflation: The fact that there are a maximum number of units of a certain cryptocurrency that will ever be available makes the issue of inflation of these digital currencies almost non-existent. They cannot be printed at will as in the case of the fiat currencies. Taking bitcoin as a case study, are only 21 million bitcoins that will ever be mined. As it becomes more widely accepted and adopted by the general public as a legal tender, there will be more people in demand for it, and since there is a limited quantity available, there will inadvertently be an increase in the value of the coin with increase in demand.\n2. Transparency: Transactions cannot be manipulated in the blockchain without letting others know about it.\n3. No boundaries: when talking about transactions using cryptocurrencies, there are no limits. The sender and receiver can be in two different parts of the world, and still exchange the digital currency for a product or service rendered without any hassles. The inter-country transaction is extremely easy with cryptocurrency because its function is not under the control of any central bank. There is also no limit to the amount of cryptocurrency that can be\ntransferred at any point in time.\n4. Low transaction fees: Compared to the transaction fees incurred when making use of the services offered by the banks, the fees paid for cryptocurrency transactions are usually negligible, and in some cases, even non-existent.\n5. No Charge-backs: Once a payment is confirmed in the blockchain, it cannot be reversed as in the case of charge-back transactions that are allowed by credit card companies. This considerably depletes the chances of being defrauded by unscrupulous individuals.\n6. Individual Ownership: In a traditional banking or credit card system, you effectively turn stewardship of your funds over to a third party that can exercise the power of life or death over your assets. Accounts may be closed without notice for infringements of a financial institution’s Terms of Service – requiring you as the account holder to jump through hoops in order to get yourself back into the system. Perhaps the greatest of all advantages of cryptocurrency is that unless you’ve delegated management of your wallet over to a third party service, you are the sole owner of the corresponding private and public encryption keys that make up your cryptocurrency network identity or address.\n7. Very Secured: The encryption provided by the use of cryptography makes it next to impossible for someone other than the owner of a particular wallet address to access the wallet and make payments with it, except it was hacked or the information was left where it could be easily accessed.\n8. A Way to Protect against Political Instability: Cryptocurrency is a great way to tuck away wealth outside of the risk of regular currency volatility. This concept probably doesn’t make a lot of sense for North Americans who enjoy fairly stable currency, but in countries with less political — and therefore monetary — stability, cryptocurrency offers an attractive avenue to protect your assets from the long hands of the government, bank and possibly, a currency collapse. If you live in a region where your money is becoming worthless in the global economy by the day, for example Zimbabwe where the Zimbabwean dollar was effectively abandoned as an official currency in 2009, cryptocurrency can protect your personal and family wealth while giving you an asset your government cannot seize.\nTHE DRAWBACKS OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES\nAs with all technologies, cryptocurrency has its shortcomings.\n1. Price Volatility: Just as the volatility of cryptocurrencies can lead to incredible gains, it can also lead to an unexplained drop in the value. In essence, what most people are actually doing in cryptocurrency is gambling. That is why in investing with cryptocurrency, one is advised\nnot to invest more than what he can afford to lose.\n2. Mass Adoption: The very uncertain nature of cryptocurrency is a reason why mass adoption of it as a legal tender is taking so much time.\n3. Possibility of Wallet Loss: If you lose your wallet ID or password, your money is as good as gone since there is no way to do a password recovery and the design of the blockchain ensures that only you know what your wallet ID is. The price for recklessness is steep. Get my video tutorial courses on cryptocurrency where in one of the videos I show you how to adequately secure your wallets from theft and get back access to your wallet if your password was misplaced or forgotten.\n4. Difficult to Understand: This is a relatively new technology but it already has lots of information on the internet. It is a complex concept that will require a lot of learning before it can be fully grasped, but most people just dive in without the appropriate knowledge and end up losing their invested money in the process.\n5. No Payment Reversal: If payment was made in excess for a particular product or service, it is only by dialogue with the receiving party that a refund can be made. That is if the receiving party agrees to send the funds back. In a case where the receiving party is unknown, there is no way to get a refund. Hence, utmost care must be taken when making payments in order to avoid such costly errors.\nAlthough cryptocurrency has not gained significant reception yet, it is slowly and steadily consolidating its position as a force to be reckoned with. With the cryptocurrency market capitalization of about $400 billion (coinmarketcap.com) as at the time of writing this report, we can see the effect it currently has on the world economy. Clearly, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages which is why the base of cryptocurrency will continue to grow as it gets more widely accepted.\nWHAT GIVES BITCOIN ITS VALUE?\nThere are a couple of factors that determine how bitcoin is valued. First of all, bitcoin has some of the characteristics of fiat money (fungibility, divisibility, uniformity, durability, portability). In the same vain, it has some other factors that gives it an edge over money. These factors are a reason why bitcoin has been termed by some as ‘digital gold,’ and also contributing factors to why the mass adoption of bitcoin will happen much sooner than anticipated. Highlighted below are some of those factors that make bitcoin valuable.\n1. Limited Quantity: The amount of bitcoin available, as with most real cryptocurrencies, is limited. As I mentioned earlier, only 21 million bitcoins will ever be mined. This can help curb inflation as more bitcoins cannot be printed at will beyond the cap that has been set at its\ninception.\n2. Decentralization: Unlike the fiat currencies, bitcoin transactions are not subject to approval or opinion of any external authorities. The fact that the blockchain network operates on a peer-to-peer basis makes it almost impossible to shut down. Being a censor-resistant alternative to our conventional payment system has made it an irresistible and disruptive technology.\n3. Elimination of Double-spending: Double-spending is a potential flaw in a digital cash scheme whereby a token of this digital cash can be spent more than once. This is possible when the digital file can be duplicated or falsified, thereby leading to an inflation. This is not the case with regards to bitcoin. The amount available cannot be altered.\nWHAT DETERMINES THE PRICE OF BITCOIN?\nLike every other commodity, bitcoin has its market where it can be bought and sold. Simply put, demand and supply is what drives the price of bitcoin. When demand for bitcoins increases, the price increases, and when demand falls, the price falls. There is only a limited number of bitcoins in circulation and new bitcoins are created at a predictable and decreasing rate, which means that demand must follow this level of inflation to keep the price stable.\nBecause Bitcoin is still a relatively small market compared to what it could be, it doesn't take significant amounts of money, a very sensitive news or information, to move the market price up or down, and thus the price of a bitcoin is still very volatile.\nHOW ARE BITCOINS ACQUIRED?\nThere are basically 4 ways by which one can come in possession of bitcoins:\n1. Trading on an Exchange: An exchange is a platform where cryptocurrencies can be bought, sold, stored and traded against one another. The most common cryptocurrency exchanges include Bittrex, Binance, Bitfinex, Cryptopia etc.\n2. Accepting Bitcoin as a Means of Payment: Bitcoin can be accepted as a means of payment in exchange for a product that is purchased from you or a service you rendered. People are beginning to see the wisdom in this method of payment because of the perceived potential increase in the value of that payment in the nearest foreseeable future. For instance, the famous musical artist, 50 Cent accepted bitcoins (about $400,000 worth) as payment for his album Animal Ambition in 2014. He left the bitcoins untouched until 2018. As at the time of writing this report they were worth between $7 million to $8 million. You can read more about the story here ( https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16930010/50-cent-rich-bitcointwitter- instagram-humblebrag).\n3. Mining: This is the peer-to-peer computer process used to secure and verify bitcoin transactions – payments from one person to the other on the blockchain. Mining is the mechanism used to introduce bitcoins into the system. Miners are rewarded with new bitcoins as a motivation for their role in processing transactions and ensuring that the network is always safe and secure.\n4. Buying from Someone Directly: If you know someone who sells bitcoins, you can simply make a request of the amount you would like to purchase. This individual has to be trustworthy because it is usually payment before service. You cannot afford to make a payment to someone who will run away with your money or someone who will try to short change you in the exchange.\nWHY YOU SHOULD TAKE BITCOIN AND CRYPTOCURRENCY INVESTMENT INTO CONSIDERATION IN 2018\nInvesting in your future is a smart move. For those in their 20s, you may not be thinking about the future and the need for investments. However, it is when you are young that you should begin to get into the habit of investing in your future. Whether you invest in stocks, real estate, or in cryptocurrency, starting your investments when you are younger is a great way to ensure that you have a plethora of funds when you are of retirement age. If you are new to investing, this section will highlight some of the reasons that you should consider before investing at least a small percentage of your net worth into cryptocurrency.\n1 .Easy to do if you know what to look out for: There are different ways to invest in cryptocurrency. You can choose the type of cryptocurrency that you want to invest in which means that you have just as much flexibility in this as you would in stocks. But because cryptocurrency is perhaps the newest way to invest in your future, you may think that it would be difficult to do. The truth, however, is that investing in cryptocurrency is actually quite simple once you get the hang of it. The first thing that you will need to do is to conduct some research on the types of cryptocurrency exchanges that are available. In addition, you will need to determine how you will store your cryptocurrency. Some choose to invest in a virtual wallet, while others prefer to store their currency on an exchange. Both options are quite simple and will not take a great deal of time to learn how to manage.\n2.Trendy: Cryptocurrency is the newest and latest craze when it comes to making investments and having assets. To invest in cryptocurrency, you can do so online and from the comfort of your own home. The level of accessibility to the internet is perhaps a major reason that has contributed to the success of cryptocurrency.\n3. Less transaction fees than other ways of investing: When you invest in stocks or forex, you will most likely need to work with a stock broker or a financial advisor to help you make sound decisions when it comes to your investments. While this is a smart move, doing so will cost you money as you will need to pay for the advice that you are given. However, if you plan to invest in cryptocurrency, you can do so on your own without having to hire a financial advisor or pay for the services of a stockbroker.\nOn a final note, Investing in cryptocurrency is a great way to start off planning for your future. With the accessibility to the internet, low fees, and the ease of making a sound investment with whatever exchange you choose to use, you will be off to a great start when it comes to planning for your future.\nWorld renowned billionaires like Bill Gates and Richard Branson have weighed in heavily and positively on the subject of blockchain technology and how they see it birthing a new era of financial revolution. Also, John McAfee, a computer programmer and founder of the McAfee Antivirus, has also predicted that price of one bitcoin will be worth $1,000,000 by 2020 ( https://bircoin.top ). Do not wait until it is 2020 to get your hands on some, no matter how little.\nMoney as we know it has moved. Your best bet is to figure out where it has moved to and get there before the rest of the world catches on. Position yourself now so that you won’t look back some time in the future and regret why you missed getting your own piece of the pie while it was still early and affordable. As the saying goes, success belongs to those who see opportunities before they become obvious.\nWould you like to learn how to make $200 - $300 monthly from trading cryptocurrencies?\nWould you also like to know what to look out for in order to invest wisely in winning ICOs?\nVisit http://onlinewealthacademy247.com/earlybird/ to get accesss to my hands-on video trainings on these cryptocurrency topics.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://onlinewealthacademy247.com/earlybird/", "https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16930010/50-cent-rich-bitcointwitter-"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T19:42:59.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1277c99d10ee8f1f8543546d1d0e8af2f7ee3c5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTOZ30YAUaYEKw8kAapRNCI9Lok_Ae.bAMZI4ENE2wrwK3vZaOFWI30omc_9N.oSvE3JXWNRuvAwFI1pKLWXVUcxQlJQm1iM4cJHVjgXXesGCtNeuIY_0gte5Tr3kjfD1_xp4x8wHN1a1WdaQEOmB20y8mUaacJ1UviaOViMDxPKdq129ht29cJD4F07vabyWOcS4DSsvjFYA--", "site_full": "www.complaintsboard.com", "site": "complaintsboard.com", "site_section": "https://www.complaintsboard.com/bycategory/online-scams.html", "site_categories": ["media", "shopping"], "section_title": "Online Scams - Complaints and Reviews", "title": "Bitcoin-India.org - bitcoin india / online scam of cryptocurrency by compromise my bitcoin india wallet, 999683", "title_full": "Bitcoin-India.org - bitcoin india / online scam of cryptocurrency by compromise my bitcoin india wallet, Review 999683 | Complaints Board", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.038, "main_image": "https://www.complaintsboard.com/thumb.php?src=compl_15265864377305.png&wmax=200&hmax=200&crop=1&complaints=999683", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 20893, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1277c99d10ee8f1f8543546d1d0e8af2f7ee3c5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTOZ30YAUaYEKw8kAapRNCI9Lok_Ae.bAMZI4ENE2wrwK3vZaOFWI30omc_9N.oSvE3JXWNRuvAwFI1pKLWXVUcxQlJQm1iM4cJHVjgXXesGCtNeuIY_0gte5Tr3kjfD1_xp4x8wHN1a1WdaQEOmB20y8mUaacJ1UviaOViMDxPKdq129ht29cJD4F07vabyWOcS4DSsvjFYA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "NAVNIT Toley", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin-India.org - bitcoin india / online scam of cryptocurrency by compromise my bitcoin india wallet, 999683", "text": "bitcoin-india.org\nI invested in bitcoin India from last 9.5month.

His forums have allegedly involved about 1,300,000 users from around the world, leading to massive fraud. Stealing Even From the Moon\nAccording to the indictment, the defendant established the forums in 2008 and managed them until his arrest at the beginning of the month. The entrance to the forums was free of charge, but users could purchase a VIP status to receive stolen details of “fresh” credit cards, which are more likely to be still working. Additionally he published manuals and guides that provided information and tools on how to commit various computer offenses, remotely hacking computers and taking over remote computers or servers.\nHalmi also allegedly committed crimes of fraud against users of his own forums. The defendant would offer selling cell phones at discounted prices, but once a user transferred him money he would block the user from the site and take his money without providing compensation. He would then publish a message, supposedly in the name of the deceived user, in which he thanked the defendant for providing the cheap mobile phone.\nApparently trying to convince investigators his actions were not motivated by specific malice towards Israelis, many of which were his alleged victims, Halmi is quoted as saying: “We are thieves, from wherever we can take money, we will take it – it does not matter where, from Israel, the US or even the moon, we will reach it and use it.” 1,071 BTC Seized\nAccording to the indictment, the defendant demanded that all payments to him be made through Bitcoin, to make it more difficult to locate him. In addition, Halmi acted consistently to disguise his identity by technological means, made many money transfers between different Bitcoin wallets for the purpose of covering his tracks, used online masking services to distance himself from his various accounts, and recorded parts of his property in the name of his relatives.\nThe Israeli State Prosecutor’s Office attributes to the defendant money laundering of at least 1,071 BTC, estimated at NIS 31,000,000. During the interrogation, in a precedent-setting move, the defendant’s Bitcoin wallet was seized and the amount found in it was transferred to a police wallet. The State Prosecutor’s Office intends to confiscate all the contents of the defendant’s Bitcoin wallets, if and when he is convicted. The case was investigated by investigators of the Israeli national cyber unit at Lahav 433.\nThe offenses with which Halmi is charged are: credit card fraud under aggravated circumstances (multiple offenses), receiving a thing fraudulently under aggravated circumstances, providing means for committing a crime, violating the Computers Law and money laundering.\nWhat should be the punishment for such an alleged crime?

Since then Ulbricht’s new legal team and his family continue to fight for Ross’s freedom with a filed a Petition of Certiorari with the United States Supreme Court.\nAlso read: BCH Miners Discuss Funding Development With a Fraction of Block Rewards The Fight to Free Ross Ulbricht Continues With a Petition of Certiorari\nRoss William Ulbricht is a 33-year old American who was convicted of drug trafficking, money laundering, and computer hacking crimes tied to the Silk Road website created in 2011. Ulbricht was accused of being the creator of the Silk Road under the pseudonym “ Dread Pirate Roberts ,” and was arrested in 2013. In 2015 Ulbricht was convicted of the aforementioned charges and sentenced to life in prison. The family has been fighting for their son’s freedom for years due to the fact that there were many investigation discrepancies, and government agents who were caught red-handed manipulating the case. However, last year the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the decision to keep Ulbricht in jail for life.\nThen this year Ulbricht’s new legal team, Williams & Connolly, tried to extend a fixed three year period with a motion called “Rule 33.” Although, the extension was not granted, and Judge Forrest denied the motion to extend the time for a Rule 33. The latest Petition of Certiorari with the Supreme Court argues two very important questions tethered to Ulbricht’s case. Whether the warrantless seizure of an individual’s Internet traffic information without probable cause violates the Fourth Amendment. Whether the Sixth Amendment is violated when a judge uses uncharged allegations, never brought to trial before a jury, to support an excessive sentence. Another Fourth Amendment Case May Determine the Fate of Ulbricht’s Latest Petition USP Florence Maximum Security Prison – September 2017\nAdditionally, the team at Freeross.org explain that twenty-one organizations have supported the petition and it was distributed for conference on April 13. Out of all the cases, that day 200 were denied except for Ulbricht’s case and another called Carpenter v. U.S . Ulbricht’s legal team believes the outcome of the Fourth Amendment Carpenter case will affect Ross’s petition conference. Freeross.org explains that the legal team may find out how the court’s rule by June 2018.\nAlongside this news, Ulbricht has been relocated from New York to a maximum-security penitentiary called USP Florence. The family says this prison is meant for some of the country’s most violent offenders and they don’t understand why Ross is being kept there for his life sentence.\n“Despite the horrors of his environment, Ross remains optimistic and strong, characteristically making the best of it,” explains Ross’s mother Lyn Ulbricht.\nHe has immersed himself in his case, spending a lot of time in the law library, and otherwise focusing on staying healthy mentally, emotionally, spiritually and physically.\nWhat do you think about Ulbricht’s latest attempt for freedom by filing a Petition of Certiorari with the Supreme Court?

(ADE) Is Yet to See Trading Action on May 21\nMay 21, 2018 - By Louis Casey\nShares of BITCOIN GROUP SE O.N. (FRA:ADE) closed at 42.28 yesterday. BITCOIN GROUP SE O.N. currently has a total float of shares and on average sees 124 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 6.1 and high of 90. What’s Behind Germany’s Economic Growth?\nGermany is one of the most influential economies in the world along with the US and Japan. Behind its success is a rich trade and commerce industry, particularly a thriving equity market. It is not easy for companies, including BITCOIN GROUP SE O.N. to become part of this market. Like in any other nation, Germany lies in its own trading environment to succeed and stay at par with international economic giants. The German Stock Exchange plays an important role in this economic success. Europe’s Thriving Giant\nThe German Stock Exchange, needless to say, is one of the best stock exchanges globally. And it gives its advantages to BITCOIN GROUP SE O.N. as well. It is composed of multiple stock exchanges situated throughout Germany such as the BÖAG Börsen AG, which is the resulting union of the Hamburg Stock Exchange and the Hanover Stock Exchange; the Börse Berlin-Bremen, which is the resulting union of the Berlin Stock Exchange and the Börse Bremen; the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, which is the biggest of all the components; and the Stuttgart Stock Exchange, which is the second biggest German Stock Exchange component.\nThe Frankfurt Stock Exchange, facilitating the trade in Frankfurt, alone represents about 80% of the overall market valuation in Germany. It is owned and operated by Deutsche Börse. A Powerful Trade Index\nThe Deutsche Aktien Xchange (DAX) 30 is the benchmark index in the country. It measures the top 30 companies listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange based on market valuation. That being said, the DAX 30 is a powerful indicator of the economy not just in Germany but also in the entire European region. Investors from across the world are looking for the reliable companies like BITCOIN GROUP SE O.N. there.\nThe base value on the DAX 30 is 1,000, which has been the case since December 31, 1987. Index prices on the DAX 30 are calculated using XETRA, an electronic trading system. It has been in the works since June 18, 1999. In January 2006, the system began calculating index prices every second, providing accurate, real-time results.\nThe DAX 30 can be quoted either in terms of price or performance. The price index is commonly quoted internationally while the performance index is commonly quoted domestically.\nEuro is the primary currency on the DAX 30. To trade, a margin of 2% and a minimum trading size of one index are required.\nThe DAX 30 had experienced its longest bullish period between 2003 and 2007. Having lasted for over 1,500 days, it is probably one of the longest bullish periods ever recorded by a benchmark index in history.\nIn 2009, the DAX 30 hit its all-time low of €3,580 after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. It had nonetheless attained a major comeback in 2013 when it recorded its all-time high of €8,736, beating its peak level of €8,105.69 seen during its glory years.\nIn terms of performance, the DAX 30 had reached its highest level of 12,374.73 in April 2015. Its lowest level of 372.30 has not been seen in more than four decades.\nBe it for long term or short term, investing in the German Stock Index is reasonable nowadays. And BITCOIN GROUP SE O.N. is on demand there. With Germany’s position in the global economy, investors will surely enjoy high returns.

The transaction then gets relayed to other goTenna devices, eventually reaching an Internet-connected node that also runs TxTenna, which passes it on to the bitcoin network.\nAccording to goTenna, simulations indicate less than 2 random nodes in a three-square-mile area can sufficiently provide a goTenna network.\nThe project offers an alternative communication layer that goTenna believes will provide a more resilient bitcoin network. Building On Blockstream Project\ngoTenna has integrated its device with the Samourai Wallet’s MuleTools project, an open source project that was influenced by Blockstream’s satellite initiative to use satellites to support bitcoin network transactions, an effort to support alternative transaction systems. Myers noted that Blockstream’s decentralization measure benefits transaction verification, but leaves the need to move transactions to the bitcoin network.\nThe bitcoin network currently relies on ISPs that are largely run by big companies that often place commercial interest over net neutrality, Myers claimed. In 2007/2008, for instance, Comcast undermined traffic for BitTorrent , a network for downloading and file sharing. In Search Of A More Resilient Blockchain\nShould a government prohibit bitcoin, that government could enlist ISPs to block local network nodes, Myers noted.\nInstances have already been recorded of private law firms, claiming alleged copyright infringements, identifying BitTorrent users based on ISP provided information.\nAccording to JW Weatherman in his “Bitcoin Threat Model,” a bitcoin node can be duped into thinking a transaction was not confirmed, Myers noted.\nThe fact that such ISPs are centralized also makes them prone to disasters, he noted. The communication layer itself needs to be more resilient.\nElaine Ou and Nick Szabo suggested using shortwave radio for transactions, a project that remains in prototype.\nLess common channels such as private microwave connections amateur radio repeaters, pager networks and satellites could also provide such resilience, Myers observed.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

Applying the Fibonacci extension tool on this potential bounce shows the next upside targets. Technical indicators are still suggesting that sellers have the upper hand.\nBitcoin price seems to be done with its correction and ready for a climb, but technical indicators have yet to catch up.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is still below the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This suggests that the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse. However, price has moved past the 100 SMA dynamic inflection point as an early signal of bullish momentum.\nRSI is on the move up to show that there’s some buying momentum left, but the oscillator is nearing overbought conditions to reflect exhaustion. Similarly, stochastic is heading north so bitcoin price could follow suit, but the oscillator is also approaching overbought levels. Turning back down could draw sellers in once more. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nIf bulls are able to stay in control, they could push bitcoin price up to the next potential resistance at the 38.2% extension or $9279. The 50% extension is near the $9700 major psychological level while the 61.8% extension lines up with the swing high around $10,000. Stronger bullish pressure could take it up to fresh highs at the 76.4% extension or $10,705 level or the full extension at $11,461.\nFor now, though, market watchers are paying extra close attention to the energy costs related to mining bitcoin. This casts doubts on the sustainability of this particular cryptocurrency, but the improved sentiment in the industry to start the week appears to be providing enough support.\nLooking ahead, the FOMC minutes could turn the spotlight back to dollar movements as stronger tightening hints could boost the US currency higher against bitcoin price once more. To top it off, a return in geopolitical risk could weigh on the riskier asset.

Bitcoin case: Will Shailesh Bhatt be booked? tnn | May 21, 2018, 04:31 IST Ahmedabad: The state police’s CID (crime) investigating the Bitcoin case says it has found ample evidence against Shailesh Bhatt, who had submitted a complaint of abduction and extortion. Sources aware of developments claim that there is evidence that Bhatt himself was involved in committing the crimes that he complained about. According to sources, a CID team has brought in Dilip Kanani, a businessman from Surat, who knows about the case involving a Surat-based crypto-currency firm. It is alleged that Bhatt, a Surat-based realtor, had illegally confined Dhaval Mavani and Piyush Savaliya, when he incurred losses in Bitcoins, and extorted crypto-currency. Bhatt has refuted these claims. Sources said that Savaliya has been questioned more than once in connection with the case by CID sleuths. If sources are to be believed, CID will register an FIR in its Surat office soon. The step will broaden scope of the current case, they said. “So far, the case was only about the extortion of 200 Bitcoins worth Rs 12 crore,” said an official. “But if a new case is registered, the scope will expand to 1,850 Bitcoins and cover more persons. If the investigation is extended from that stage, the investigators can check the transactions related to converting black money into crypto-currency after demonetization.” Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App .

Picture taken\nBy Alun John and Jennifer Hughes\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Bitcoins are worth less than half of what they were in December. Mining them is 60 percent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers.\nWhy, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world's biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date?\nCanaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.\n“Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public.\nThe offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world's second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment.\nThe Beijing-based company's profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin's soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand.\nBut the effects of bitcoin's volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong's central business district, where the IPO has been filed.\nBusinesses selling mining rigs there said demand - especially for high-end machines - was limping along.\nAlvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit.\n\"Since we weren't selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,\" said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district.\nThe change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming. [nL4N1PY242]\nBitcoin prices have fallen 40 percent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400.\nPROMISED LAND\nTo some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment.\n\"Investors are always looking for crypto 'picks and shovels', and that's what this is,\" said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm.\nCanaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock.\nHowever, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens.\nFast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 percent of their 2017 peak at roughly $17 million per day.\nLast month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), the world's largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain.\nCryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator's apparent approval.\nVisiting its factory, he said: “no matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you’re still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,\" according to mainland media reports.\nMARKET TEST\nBitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market - a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan's deal.\nAlthough the two sources were confident the IPO could raise $2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between $500 million and $1 billion.\nA lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price. In Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014. Eighteen months later, however, the company changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus to fintech software.\nLast year in Canada, listed miner Leeta Gold became HIVE Blockchain.\n\"Its not your everyday investment world,\" said HIVE chairman Frank Holmes, who is relatively new to the crypto world, but is a well-known investor in gold.\nHIVE, with a market capitalization of $318 million, mines bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Iceland and Sweden, favored for the energy-intensive process because of their cool temperatures and cheap power.\n\"We became the first public company that allowed institutions to play in this kind of space,\" Holmes added, pointing out that HIVE's second-largest shareholder is Fidelity, the giant U.S. fund manager.\nOther companies are also getting in on the act, with Canaan's smaller rival Ebang also considering a Hong Kong IPO, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.\n\"The excitement about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is not nearly finished, it is only just beginning,\" said Kenetic's Chu, who added that if successful, Canaan's IPO would encourage other cryptocurrency-related firms to list.\nPeople involved in Canaan's IPO say the prospects for the offering depend in part on the price of bitcoin over the next two months.\nWhile soggy prices, combined with rising mining capacity, will hit the hobby miners served by the Sham Shui Po shops far harder than Canaan's industrial-sized customers, they would still cast a shadow over the deal.\nIn Sham Shui Po, meanwhile, Alvin Wong says he will soon unplug his rig to put it and others back on the shelves - just as soon as customer demand returns.\n(Reporting by Alun John and Jennifer Hughes; additional reporting by Sijia Jiang and Fiona Lau of IFR; Editing by Gerry Doyle) More From Technology ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alun john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer hughes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "canaan inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T08:10:23.030+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9df1d95b1ddae0b40f7ce0cc8779c2c92f851b6b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwVfFkFrvLqViXiM88iBzM0-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9df1d95b1ddae0b40f7ce0cc8779c2c92f851b6b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwVfFkFrvLqViXiM88iBzM0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nWe are going to pay you 15% of your friends earnings from our own mining capacities as soon as they will install CryptoTab by your personal link.Also, we are going to pay you 10% bonus from our own funds when your friends will lead their friends by their own links.Referral network includes payments for up to 10 levels of friends.

The RSK project is continuing the legacy of Bitcoin pioneers by building Turing-complete smart-contract capabilities for the Bitcoin blockchain . By partnering with iExec, RSK pushes these capabilities further by allowing its decentralized applications to access on-demand and scalable cloud computing resources. Smart contracts are coming to Bitcoin\nThe world of smart contracts has emerged in recent years and is disrupting how modern business and trade are conducted across the globe. These self-executing virtual agreements have been popularized by Ethereum, but developers quickly saw the potential to enable them on the most famous blockchain platform as well: Bitcoin.\nWhile the traditional purpose of Bitcoin is to establish itself as a payment alternative, the developers under RSK aim at adding value and functionality to its ecosystem by enabling smart contracts, near instant payments and higher scalability.\nRSK is therefore the first general purpose smart contract platform secured by the Bitcoin network. The RSK platform uses Bitcoin as its native currency, thanks to a 2-Way Peg system that ensures a fixed conversion between BTC and SBTC (1 SBTC = 1 BTC). iExec’s smart contracts deployed on RSK\nMeanwhile, iExec is developing the first blockchain-based decentralized cloud computing network. This marketplace allows participants who need computing power to meet those who own computing power, thus supporting the most compute-intensive blockchain applications.\niExec’s technology relies on Ethereum smart contracts and allows the building of a virtual cloud infrastructure that provides high-performance computing services on demand. However, decentralized apps will ultimately rely on the execution of multiple smart contracts, across multiple blockchains , which has led iExec to adopt a blockchain-agnostic stance.\nRSK will allow developers around the globe to create decentralized personal and corporate solutions that work in the safest and most popular blockchain protocol, with low transaction costs that fit an ample range of needs. For these reasons, iExec has successfully deployed its V1 smart contracts on RSK as well. This SDK allows developers to build applications that will benefit from scalable and free cloud computing capabilities. The next steps of the partnership\nOn May 29, 2018, iExec will release its V2, the most-awaited component of iExec. This release consists of a decentralized marketplace for trading cloud resources and marks the very beginning of the possibility of monetizing one’s cloud resources in a peer-to-peer market.\nOnce V2 is made compatible with RSK as a next milestone, RSK applications and their smart contracts will be able to access the same decentralized cloud that Ethereum dapps make use of. Compute-intensive applications in the fields of fintech, artificial intelligence , scientific research or gaming will be able to leverage these resources, making RSK and iExec the backbone of the Bitcoin ecosystem. About RSK\nRSK is the first open-source smart contract platform with a 2-way peg to Bitcoin that also rewards the Bitcoin miners via merge-mining, allowing them to actively participate in the Smart Contract revolution. RSK goal is to add value and functionality to the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling smart-contracts, near instant payments and higher-scalability. About iExec\niExec aims to decentralize the cloud computing market by building the future of the Internet infrastructure. We are developing the first blockchain cloud computing platform, to support the most compute-intensive applications in the fields of artificial intelligence, big data, fintech, cryptography, or 3D rendering.\nWebsite: http://iex.ec\nThis is a sponsored press release and does not necessarily reflect the opinions or views held by any employees of The Merkle.

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

I see a decent probability that its price goes to zero.”\nThe head of the Vanguard Investment Strategy Group argues that bitcoin does not meet the criteria of a currency — which its creator(s) and proponents believe it to be — saying it’s a dubious medium of exchange and its excessive volatility does not make it a suitable store of value.\nRead: Bitcoin bull argues for rally to $20,000\nDavis, who works for the largest mutual-fund provider and second-largest provider of exchange-traded funds, said bitcoin doesn’t stack up as a traditional investment. “Unlike stocks and bonds, currencies generate no cash flows such as interest payments or dividends that can explain their prices,” wrote Davis.\nHe added that by adding bitcoin to a portfolio, you would have to reduce a “tried and true asset class.”\nWhile supporters of bitcoin and other digital assets see the technology as an alternative to central banks, Davis said bitcoin is not a true threat to them, arguing that there’s a good chance central banks will eventually adopt their own digital currencies, and will have the upper hand because they impose the regulations on exchanges.\nLike many cryptocurrency naysayers, Davis was more positive on blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that underpins bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but said the two do not go hand-in-hand like some argue.\n“Although cryptocurrencies are built using a blockchain, they are not necessarily tied to the value of blockchain applications that may improve the cost, speed and security of executing transactions or contracts,” wrote Davis.\n“Bitcoin is an investment in blockchain in the same way that Pets.com was an investment in the internet.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.etf.com/sections/etf-industry-perspective/vanguard-bitcoin-presents-quandary?EXCMPGN=EX:PC:FAS:Sustaining", "https://smartasset.com/snippet.js"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joe davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vanguard group", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vanguard", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vanguard investment strategy group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T03:59:51.130+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ce67929893dd1cbadf9d8944ef91abccfa93b1c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSfGp2oLwsUvYNmOb.WIUtr_Nri_ejEslL2aGd0.djpCBuwY1pcKzz6gG8sfvvIWx_CheJuyZSR.aDz9i6BK7cnZYYTu0sKuuNhFU37z4vURSC1abPLPT3GoB4BNDp0g.24uh3qr1eKV3mnjASemK00", "site_full": "www.namepros.com", "site": "namepros.com", "site_section": "https://www.namepros.com/forums/web-hosting-reviews.245/", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Web Hosting Reviews - NamePros", "title": "CRYPTO Bitcoin Cash/ BCH : BCHworld.com >>> CryptoWORLD.com price for $195,000", "title_full": "CRYPTO Bitcoin Cash/ BCH : BCHworld.com >>> CryptoWORLD.com price for $195,000 - NamePros", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.018, "main_image": "https://www.namepros.com/data/avatars/fb/1004/1004225.jpg?1527692620", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 12601, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ce67929893dd1cbadf9d8944ef91abccfa93b1c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSfGp2oLwsUvYNmOb.WIUtr_Nri_ejEslL2aGd0.djpCBuwY1pcKzz6gG8sfvvIWx_CheJuyZSR.aDz9i6BK7cnZYYTu0sKuuNhFU37z4vURSC1abPLPT3GoB4BNDp0g.24uh3qr1eKV3mnjASemK00", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sugianto", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "CRYPTO Bitcoin Cash/ BCH : BCHworld.com >>> CryptoWORLD.com price for $195,000", "text": "BCH World .com\nFor Marketplace of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) / Cryptocurrency.\nRegistered since 2006-April-09, when Bitcoin Cash has not been found yet\nRegistrar : GoDaddy.com\nExpire: 08 April 2019. ​\nWhy this domain name is most desirable and should be expensive?\nCrypto WORLD .com price for $195,000 at DomainMarket, February 2018.

The company says it developed LMAX Digital at the request of its existing clients who asked for a credible, efficient and trusted platform to trade with like-minded institutions.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin in Brief Monday: New EU Rules Kill Another Crypto Venture Institutional Grade Crypto\nLMAX Digital will offer access only to the most liquid crypto assets including BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP and BCH, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The company explains that trading is governed by similar rules and principles as LMAX Exchange’s FCA regulated MTF (Multilateral Trading Facility), meaning that the exchange offers the same level of security, compliance, KYC and anti-money laundering policies and procedures as its established operations.\nOther features of the service include keeping one public rulebook for all members; a central limit order book (CLOB) with streaming, firm institutional liquidity; safe and secure hot/warm/cold multi-signature wallets; and a full custodian solution. Execution details include a matching latency of under 350 microseconds; a high throughput greater than 100,000 messages per second; an uptime of 100%; and all orders time-stamped in microseconds (receipt to execution). After the launch of LMAX Digital in a London-based data center (LD4), the company intends to also roll out infrastructure in New York and Tokyo in the near future. Game Changer David Mercer, CEO, LMAX Exchange\n“We are furthering the legitimisation of the crypto currency market by offering institutions a platform on which to acquire, trade and hold crypto currencies securely with high quality, deep liquidity,” said David Mercer, CEO of LMAX Exchange. “Over $10 trillion of FIAT has been traded on our exchanges to date and we have institutional clients in over 100 countries. We’ve applied everything we’ve learned in the institutional FX market to LMAX Digital, to create a fundamentally improved, secure digital exchange based on our proven trading technology, market leading liquidity and transparent and precise execution.”\n“The rise of institutional trading of crypto currencies will be a game-changer for the industry. We believe our new exchange will support the transformation of the crypto market from the fringes to the mainstream. Digital currencies are, without a doubt, coming of age. Exchanges will play a crucial role in bringing the major crypto currencies into wider circulation, helping them to become accepted into conventional funds which in turn will help to support a normalisation of value,” he added.\nSerious institutional money has been pouring into the crypto market since 2017, leading to the recent launch of new services catered specifically to this segment from the likes of Coinbase and others.\nWhat do you think about this development in the institutional space?

And, truth be told, CNBC has been showing the decentralized cryptocurrency an inordinate amount of love lately. A segment by a popular analyst, where he forecasts even bigger things for BCH, only added fuel to some trolls’ fire. Chairman Mow is not amused.\nAlso read: Roger Ver and Ryan X. Charles Reveal the Future of Cash CNBC Predicts Bitcoin Cash to Moon, and Soon\nWednesday in the US is known colloquially as Hump Day, the point at which the weekend seems closer. It’s also the day more and more cryptocurrency enthusiasts are tuning in to CNBC’s Fast Money program, a self described “post-market show,” hosted by Melissa Lee with contributions from well regarded traders.\nTrader Brian Kelly , founder and CEO of BKCM LLC, was asked to detail just why it is he’s so bullish on bitcoin cash. In introducing his plasma-fronted segment, Ms. Lee read what appears to be a month-long trend, describing bitcoin cash as having “vanquished” the likes of bitcoin core (BTC), down 5%, litecoin down 9%, and ripple down 21% while BCH remained positive at 6% price growth.\nMr. Kelly asked viewers to simply look at what he refers to as catalyst factors, aspects of a digital asset, no matter what the asset, that might have caused it to gain traction in price going forward. In the case of bitcoin cash, Mr. Kelly cheered the latest development among its mining community to pool portions of rewards toward building a fund for future development. He compared it to an app store where devs pile on uses for a smartphone previously unthought of or dreamed of but not implemented. BCH, he insisted, wasn’t the only project to do something like this, and he even managed to sandwich in the word “potentially” when describing price prospects.\nHe also equated more on-chain development with potential use cases, and use cases, then, with, well, usability and appeal to more people in the eventual hope of more adoption. Curiously he described the mining community’s latest move as a kind of cartelization, though benevolent, words and phrases that immediately rile most cryptocurrency enthusiasts. He acknowledged it, however, as a potential negative. Let the Market Decide\nUltimately it all comes down to the market, Mr. Kelly noted. He turned to charting, where over the past year or so BCH has followed the broader crypto market with incredible highs back in late 2017, a precipitous drop in 2018, and a recent stabilization if not slight uptick. Drawing a horizontal line across the screen, Mr. Kelly described bitcoin cash as mostly holding support levels for the moment, a good sign. He called his squibbles and markings “a good looking chart” and a “place I want to buy.”\nMs. Lee then peppered Mr. Kelly with questions from viewers. Asked if he was in to bitcoin cash for the long term, he turned diplomatic. He reminded viewers he was a trader, moving in and out of positions quickly. He wants to invest in the coin that eventually becomes the global currency, living up to crypto hype. For now, Mr. Kelly said, bitcoin core (BTC) has a massive network effect advantage, but that could change.\nYet another viewer asked if Mr. Kelly had ever actually used BCH to buy something, and if not then what is its use? Mr. Kelly said he had not used bitcoin cash, but that his interest is only in its speculative value. He did say he’d used bitcoin core to buy things and to send money, and so he understands its ultimate power. The final question in the segment got Mr. Kelly laughing, as a person asked if he was indeed Roger Ver. When Ms. Lee effectively ended the spot, she was keen to emphasize CNBC and her program take exactly no money to promote anything on the show, and how no one has any connection to BCH beyond an investment.\nThe strangest reaction by far came from BTC ambassador Samson Mow. Mr. Mow’s personality in the debate between BTC and BCH is often dismissive, above-it-all. He knows, you don’t, and you simply need to get in line. Humorless. Uncharitable. Superior. That’s all excusable, and there’s always been such an element in tech (the more obnoxious sort tend to come from Silicon Valley), but his reaction to the CNBC segment described above places him in rarified air. With a picture of a shadowy figure behind bars, Chairman Mow typed, “Collecting some gems for @SEC_Enforcement @SEC_News to take a closer look at @CNBCFastMoney @CNBC pumping and dumping altcoins on their viewers. Enough is enough. If you have more tweets, post below and I’ll add them to the Moment.” That’s right, a lower-level crypto spokesperson is advocating use of jail to punish opinions different from his. Yikes.\nAre you excited about BCH adoption and innovation?

Wright made his entry into the stage at last week’s CoinGeek Conference in Hong Kong.\n“You’re going to see every month—shortly, ever week, and very soon after that, practically every day—one or two papers coming out from us.”\n“Bitcoin is cash,” Dr. Wright says. “If we want to use Bitcoin, if we want it to be something, it first needs to be cash,” he asserts. “The key behind Bitcoin, the key behind every single blockchain that will ever exist is economic.”\nAtomic swaps\nIn March, Dr. Wright mentioned the “atomic swaps” at another event in Hong Kong , but decided not to elaborate further until all the paper work was done. But he did say that he can drive exchanges to the ground, and hinted that it will all be free for users.\n“I can buy and sell Ethereum to Dash inside Bitcoin today. I can make exchanges obsolete,” Wright declared two months ago. “Right now, I can do a peer-to-peer exchange of Ethereum and Dash on Bitcoin Cash.”\n“I don’t want your money. There’s my scam: I’m not going to take a cent from anyone,” he added. “I’m not going to stop you. I’m just going to basically out-compete you. We’re going to release—freely—a whole [lot of things] that make all that you’re doing there obsolete.”\nAt last week’s conference, however, he was more than happy to talk more about it. The atomic swap would supposedly enable inter-blockchain conversion between different cryptocurrencies to happen on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.\n“I don’t just mean swapping secrets. I mean we can embed key exchanges and you can pre-sell Ethereum, pre-exchange Dash, and using Bitcoin Cash, you can exchange them. One hundred percent safe, one hundred percent secure.”\nReferring to the competition with other blockchains and cryptocurrencies, he added: “Here is my answer to competing with all this: we’ve patented [technology] and we’re going to subsume them.”\n“We’re going to make them a Bitcoin Cash sidechain,” Wright said. “It’s only ever going to run on Bitcoin Cash. We are going to make Ethereum a side chain for Bitcoin, if people want to use it. And we are going to make Bitcoin Core (BTC) a side chain to Bitcoin Cash,” Wright said, instantly prompting laughter and applause from the audience.\nDevelopers and project founders are welcome to build\nInviting developers and project starters to delve in, he added: “This technology will be there for developers, not so that we own it—so that you do . That’s what we want to see: we want to see you guys take what we’re doing and create the new environment.”\nDr. Wright adds that this means a whole world of possibilities for development, and that they will be helping developers get onboard and build projects for themselves. “In the next months, we’re going to start teaching you how you can not only tokenize basic things—we’re going to do the promise of Bitcoin. We are going to get common shares with dividends, with voting rights. We are going to allow you to make a registry that can never be deleted, can never be lost, can never be hacked, can never be subsumed, taken, or stolen by a government, by an individual. That’s what Bitcoin should be about—that’s what we’re going to help you build.” Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (segwit) Chain are Referred to as BTC coins. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is today the only Bitcoin implementation that follows Satoshi Nakamoto’s original whitepaper for Peer to Peer Electronic Cash. Bitcoin BCH is the only major public blockchain that maintains the original vision for Bitcoin as fast, frictionless, electronic cash.

By Telegram\nObtaining a banking license could help both Coinbase and Ivy Coin significantly expand their product and service offerings. Furthermore, it could help the startups gain greater trust from institutional investors who are currently keen to enter the cryptocurrency industry.\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal , in early 2018, Coinbase spoke to officials at the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. As for Ivy Koin, they met with officials from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the last few weeks. Advertisement\nBoth companies discussed their business models and sought to understand more about bank charters. Despite the benefits of federal banking licenses, cryptocurrency startups, however, may not go forward with bank charters because it could increase significant regulatory scrutiny. The decision is dependent on whether the benefits of being a bank can outweigh the costs.\n“Cryptocurrencies are strikingly innovative but also pose challenges associated with speculative dynamics, investors and consumer protections, and money-laundering risks,” said Lael Brainard, Federal Reserve Governor who oversees US banks and serves as one of the three members on the Federal governing board, on May 15 in a Speech. Federal licenses can help cryptocurrency startups gain consumer trust\nObtaining a federal banking license would enable the cryptocurrency startups to the minimize unclear regulations and replace it with one federal regulation. Coinbase and Ivy Koin could also offer their customers “federally insured bank accounts” and other products and services.\nA federal license could also help Coinbase work with hedge funds, especially since the company recently announced their new product offerings for institutional investors. With a bank license, instead of holding institutional investors’ money in custody, they could offer custody services themselves. Examples include a limited-purpose charter form the OCC. Coinbase is also looking to become a SEC-regulated brokerage.\nFurthermore, Coinbase is looking to grow and expand very quickly. In April 2018, Coinbase acquired Earn.com for 100 million . Earn.com’s co-founder and CEO Balaji Srinvasan has now become Coinbase’s first CTO. The cryptocurrency exchange has also introduced over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency trading services.\nAs for Ivy Koin, a blockchain -based technology for fiat and cryptocurrency business transactions, the company has implemented “know your customer” so they can detect money laundering activities. Unlike Coinbase, Ivy Koin is more interested in working alongside banks than becoming one. They have however asked regulators the conditions required for banking licenses so they can understand the requirements if they were to apply. “Our experience was really positive and [regulators] actually encouraged the discussion,” said Gary Fan, Ivy Koin’s President. Obtaining banking license may be quite complicated\nWhile a federal banking license could bring significant benefits for Coinbase and Ivy Koin, banks have a large number of rules that govern consumer-facing activities and funding sources from bank regulators on a state and federal level.\n“Most fintechs come to us because they have heard of this thing called a national banking charter that gives them pre-emption across state lines,” said Joseph Otting, Comptroller of the Currency as he spoke to the American Bankers Association in April. “When they come, and they speak to us, and they understand what it takes to be a bank, they kind of glaze over and often leave skid marks leaving the building.”\nFollow us on Twitter | Telegram | Facebook Featured Image from Shutterstock.

The broader digital-currency market fared even worse, with most virtual assets kicking off the week in decline.\nAfter reaching a weekend high of $8,575.99, bitcoin has retreated and a single bitcoin BTCUSD, -1.18% was last worth $8,402.63, down 1.8% since Sunday’s levels at 5 p.m. Eastern Time on the Kraken exchange.\nDespite the sluggish start to the week, some bulls remain unbowed. Rodrigo Marques, chief executive of Atlas Quantum, one of Brazil’s largest crypto trading platforms, said in an email to MarketWatch that the move under $8,000 was an interim low for bitcoin, adding that he expects bitcoin to reach $20,000 in six months, recapturing levels it hasn’t approached since December.\nRead: A recent shift in Uranus means big things for cryptocurrencies CFTC to publish guidance on virtual currencies\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, will soon provide tighter guidance on the digital currency market. Speaking at the North American Securities Administrators Association Conference in Washington, Chairman Christopher Giancarlo said the agency will publish a staff advisory that will provide a framework to both exchanges and clearinghouses when listing derivative contracts based on digital assets.\n“This advisory will reflect CFTC staff’s current thinking based on our growing experience with virtual currency derivatives. As new products are brought forth, staff will reevaluate and revisit the advisory, as necessary, to address any new and emerging issues,” said Giancarlo .\nRead: The advent of bitcoin futures sparked the selloff from $20,000, says San Francisco Fed What are altcoins and futures doing?\nAltcoins, or digital assets other than bitcoin, stumbled out of the blocks Monday and continue to trade lower throughout the day. Ether ETHUSD, -0.55% is down 3.2% to $695.53, Bitcoin Cash BCHUSD, -2.76% has lost 5.7% to $1,225.80, Litecoin LTCUSD, -0.09% is off 4.1% at $134.42 and Ripple’s XRP coin XRPUSD, -0.74% last traded at 68 cents, down 4%.\nFutures finished higher Monday after the spot rally over the weekend. The Cboe June contract XBTM8, -0.60% finished Monday up 1.7% at $8,395, while the CME May contract BTCK8, -0.60% closed up 1.8% at $8,375. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the regulatory body the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The error has been corrected.

NEW HAVEN, Conn. ( Project Syndicate ) — The cryptocurrency revolution, which started with bitcoin in 2009, claims to be inventing new kinds of money. There are now nearly 2,000 cryptocurrencies, and millions of people worldwide are excited by them. What accounts for this enthusiasm, which so far remains undampened by warnings that the revolution is a sham?\nOne must bear in mind that attempts to reinvent money have a long history.\nAs the sociologist Viviana Zelizer points out in her book “The Social Meaning of Money”: “Despite the commonsense idea that ‘a dollar is a dollar is a dollar,’ everywhere we look people are constantly creating different kinds of money.” Many of these innovations generate real excitement, at least for a while.\nAs the medium of exchange throughout the world, money, in its various embodiments, is rich in mystique. We tend to measure people’s value by it. It sums things up like nothing else.\nAnd yet it may consist of nothing more than pieces of paper that just go round and round in circles of spending. So its value depends on belief and trust in those pieces of paper. One might call it faith.\nEstablishing a new kind of money may be seen as a community’s avowal of faith in an idea, and an effort to inspire its realization. In his book “Euro Tragedy: A Drama in Nine Acts,” the economist Ashoka Mody argues that the true public justification for creating the European currency in 1992 was a kind of “groupthink,” a faith “embedded in people’s psyches” that “the mere existence of a single currency…would create the impetus for countries to come together in closer political embrace.”\nNew ideas for money seem to go with the territory of revolution, accompanied by a compelling, easily understood narrative. In 1827, Josiah Warner opened the “Cincinnati Time Store” that sold merchandise in units of hours of work, relying on “labor notes,” which resembled paper money. The new money was seen as a testament to the importance of working people, until he closed the store in 1830.\nTwo years later, Robert Owen, sometimes described as the father of socialism, attempted to establish in London the National Equitable Labour Exchange, relying on labor notes, or “time money,” as currency. Here, too, using time instead of gold or silver as a standard of value enforced the notion of the primacy of labor. But, like Warner’s time store, Owen’s experiment failed.\nLikewise, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels proposed that the central Communist premise — “Abolition of private property” — would be accompanied by a “Communistic abolition of buying and selling.”\nEliminating money, however, was impossible to do, and no Communist state ever did so. Instead, as the British Museum’s recent exhibit, “The Currency of Communism,” showed, they issued paper money with vivid symbols of the working class on it. They had to do something different with money.\nDuring the Great Depression of the 1930s, a radical movement, called Technocracy, associated with Columbia University, proposed to replace the gold-backed dollar with a measure of energy, the erg. In their book “The A B C of Technocracy,” published under the pseudonym Frank Arkright, they advanced the idea that putting the economy “on an energy basis” would overcome the unemployment problem. The Technocracy fad proved to be short-lived, though, after top scientists debunked the idea’s technical pretensions.\nBut the effort to dress up a half-baked idea in advanced science didn’t stop there.\nParallel with Technocracy, in 1932 the economist John Pease Norton, addressing the Econometric Society, proposed a dollar backed not by gold but by electricity.\nBut while Norton’s electric dollar received substantial attention, he had no good reason for choosing electricity over other commodities to back the dollar. At a time when most households in advanced countries had only recently been electrified, and electric devices from radios to refrigerators had entered homes, electricity evoked images of the most glamorous high science.\nBut, like Technocracy, the attempt to co-opt science backfired. Syndicated columnist Harry I. Phillips in 1933 saw in the electric dollar only fodder for comedy. “But it would be good fun getting an income tax blank and sending the government 300 volts,” he noted.\nNow we have something new again: bitcoin BTCUSD, -2.35% and other cryptocurrencies, which have spawned the initial coin offering (ICO). Issuers claim that ICOs are exempt from securities regulation, because they do not involve conventional money or confer ownership of profits. Investing in an ICO is thought of as an entirely new inspiration.\nEach of these monetary innovations has been coupled with a unique technological story. But, more fundamentally, all are connected with a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society. The cryptocurrencies are a statement of faith in a new community of entrepreneurial cosmopolitans who hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.\nAnd, as in the past, the public’s fascination with cryptocurrencies is tied to a sort of mystery, like the mystery of the value of money itself, consisting in the new money’s connection to advanced science. Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work.\nThat mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal. None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a compelling story may not be enough.\nThis article has been published with permission of Project Syndicate — The Old Allure of New Money.\nCryptocurrencies taking us back to the Stone Age Blockchain is one of the most overhyped technologies ever", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/cryptocurrencies-scientific-narrative-by-robert-j--shiller-2018-05", "https://global.oup.com/academic/product/eurotragedy-9780199351381?cc=us&lang=en&", "https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11007.html", "https://www.project-syndicate.org/", "https://data.flw.li/piwik/", "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/aug/14/british-museum-exhibition-communist-currencies-russian-revolution", "https://smartasset.com/snippet.js", "https://books.google.com/books?id=v1zqCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA121&dq=robert+owen+AND+%22time+money%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz0_PQ2ofbAhVktlkKHYstDzwQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&q=robert%20owen%20AND%20%22time%20money%22&f=false", "https://www.investing.com/crypto/currencies", "https://books.google.com/books?id=9hIsAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=equitable+commerce+and+warren&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiX9JaG2YfbAhXtt1kKHb9fAM4Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=equitable%20commerce%20and%20warren&f=false", "http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/61?msg=welcome_stranger"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "viviana zelizer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "conn.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T17:16:18.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c5e09e46e7869bd37e1c03c7b609369b409f2cff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS0B4GtboIC4EJy7F_UXws30-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c5e09e46e7869bd37e1c03c7b609369b409f2cff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS0B4GtboIC4EJy7F_UXws30-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nBecome the person, who referred the largest number of new users till the end of June 1, 2019 and we will give you 0.3 BTC.

Ontology, Tron, AirSwap\nThe majority of tokens in the space have experienced an intensified movement on the downside, mimicking the downward pressure of bitcoin but with larger margins. Consequently, even tokens like ONT, ICON (ICX), and 0x (ZRX), which have consistently outperformed most major cryptocurrencies throughout April and May, fell substantially.\nOn May 21, most of these tokens rebounded from their recent losses, recording large gains against bitcoin which recorded a 4 percent increase against the US dollar. Against bitcoin, ONT recorded a 10 percent increase, AST rose by more than 15 percent and TRX demonstrated a 9.5 percent rise.\nAST is a particularly interesting token to observe, especially as a long-term investment because despite its hype and media coverage it received, it still remains as the 198th largest cryptocurrency in the world with a $62 million market valuation. Although the market cap of AirSwap is relatively small in comparison to other tokens like ONT and ICX, AST has more room to grow in the long-term.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) of AST is at 53, signifying a neutral zone. Given that AST is still demonstrating a neutral condition after a 15 percent increase against bitcoin and both exponential and simple moving averages show a positive short-term trend, it is likely that AST continues to grow past its current price at 0.00004925 BTC. Strong Bounce\nBitcoin has been on a continuous downward trend ever since it failed to test the $10,000 support level in early May. Over the past 7 days, the bitcoin price has remained in the range of $7,900 to $8,785, struggling to gain momentum above $8,800, which is considered as a major support level that could allow the price of bitcoin to test the $10,000 support level again in the short-term.\nThe latest attempt of bitcoin to breach the $8,800 support level was on May 15, nearly a week ago. After surpassing $8,850, due to the pressure of bears, bitcoin dropped rapidly to $7,925 and bouncing back in the $7,900 region. If the bitcoin price can rebound to $8,800 in the upcoming days, possibly within the next 48 hours, it is likely that the bitcoin price tests the $9,600 support level soon after, eyeing an entrance into the $10,000 region by the end of May.\nOver the past week, bitcoin has been able to gradually build momentum from $7,900 to $8,500, which it has not done in previous corrective rallies. The stability in the price movement of bitcoin could provide more resilience in testing major support levels in the short-term.\nFollow us on Telegram .\nPublished at Mon, 21 May 2018 05:25:37 +0000\nAltcoin Analysis ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "airswap", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ast", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T09:06:59.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1b25dcf46e41ee762e86b0a0aa1cbc3191b5681f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQUzrJrnkTb5JUPGX8pgrqb6hWjVczMDOqlfBik1v3FfUtdShtAydHEq.GcHQIL_g9DTw9ZglaZO.ezwBTFvziuQs7EYwvWTFST11LMCdpjeunwxtIuiEiz", "site_full": "beat.10ztalk.com", "site": "10ztalk.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "You’re not alone!

No one understands Bitcoin or blockchain ⋆ Tech Talk", "text": "OldTwitter Now, lets focus on the Bitcoin network and briefly discuss the four technologies behind it: Peer-to-peer network — open to anyone, where you interact person to person and there is no central power or group(s) Proof of work consensus — A.K.A mining, whereby network participants use computer power to confirm network transactions Cryptography — technology that ensures secure transactions Blockchain — a type of ledger or database keeping track of transactions As you can see blockchain is only one of four pieces which makes the Bitcoin network possible. The Bitcoin network is open, distributed, trust-less, and unchangeable due to these four technologies working together, which results in its most important benefit of all, decentralization. Let’s take a pause here because this is where things get out of whack. The blockchain hype train Since the creation of Bitcoin the word blockchain has slowly become an omniscient and meaningless marketing term that is consistently thrown into interviews, ted talks, white papers, everyday conversations etc. whenever someone wants to sell you ‘consulting’ services or ‘explain’ why it is more important than Bitcoin. When in reality a blockchain is just a slow database that is not inherently decentralized. There are countless articles claiming that ‘Blockchain will change the world!’ Many of these articles describe the technology as follows: An open, distributed, trust-less, and immutable database that is decentralized! Hold on, that sounds a lot like…yes, all these articles are actually describing the Bitcoin network: An open (#1), distributed (#1), trust-less (#1, 2, 3), immutable (#2, 3, 4) database! (#4). These articles are incorrectly attributing the Bitcoin network’s properties to describe blockchain. Gasp! Blockchain was chosen for the Bitcoin network because it allows any individual to carefully (and slowly) track and confirm activity in the open and distributed network. This is to ensure consistency and trust among other things. Its block by block nature is clunky and inefficient by design, which works well to manage Bitcoin, a digital money and new asset class. Yet, using it for anything other than digital money will be extremely challenging — more on this later. I mean, can you really put farm cows on the blockchain? Should you even? Do you really want a blockchain? Sure, you can rip blockchain out of the Bitcoin network, make it more ‘efficient’ and provide ‘instant’ data transmission, but you immediately lose the trust-less, transparent, and unchangeable properties by using it this way. You could create a private and closed version such as IBMs Hyperledger. The problem here is that this will be controlled by consortiums A, B, C (limited network) and there is no mining because Mary, Juan, Bob etc. aren’t important, so it is way faster! Buuut… Even so, a blockchain is literally stacking blocks and blocks of data. This is a burden to maintain compared to other data structures such as an Oracle Database, which is private and fast! See, I just solved your problems without blockchain. In essence, when you use a private blockchain it is not really decentralized and an unnecessarily complicated and clunky database. Many companies want to appear to be ‘in the know’ by saying they use blockchain, but they are just capitalizing on a trend and taking advantage of uninformed consumers for their benefit. If you see companies or groups using it in this way, then understand that you are getting a product that does not provide all the magic of the Bitcoin network , it suits their own interests, they don’t understand how it works, and its an oversold promise of what it can actually do. The blockchain does not solve all problems my friend. Well then! Now you know a little more about the core technologies behind Bitcoin, the real value blockchain brings and to remain critical whenever it comes up in any context outside the Bitcoin network or digital money. If you want to take a deeper dive into this topic, then check out this great article . This is a long journey with many paths to travel, so join me next time as we dig deeper into this whole Bitcoin thing. Later!

HandCash is a Bitcoin Cash mobile wallet which uses near field communication (NFC) technology to make it as easy for users to send Bitcoin Cash to someone as if they were handing cash. The deal was made through nChain Group's investment entity, nChain Reaction Ltd.\nHandCash was co-founded in Spain by Alejandro Pascual Agut and Rafael Jiménez Seibane. With NFC technology, the mobile application allows mobile wallets to complete instant transfer of Bitcoin Cash funds with each other through \"contactless\" means once users' mobile devices are in close proximity to each other (similar to contactless credit card and Apple Pay functionality).\nHandCash co-founder Alex Agut explains: \"Bitcoin was conceived to be peer-to-peer electronic cash. We wondered why Bitcoin was not being used like cash. That gave us the idea to create a wallet application that allows you to send Bitcoin in a way that resembles handing someone cash, by merely placing a sender's mobile device close to the recipient's device. That's why we named our project HandCash. We also knew the application could only work on Bitcoin Cash, with its low fees and instant confirmations.\"\nHandCash also makes it easier to send Bitcoin Cash without having to ask for a complicated receipt address or even a QR code, as most current Bitcoin applications require. Instead, users can identify and send funds to each other using \"handle\" names. In addition, users can keep their funds safe with easy ways to back up their wallets on the cloud or inside any NFC chip.\nHandCash also supports growth of Bitcoin Cash for merchant payments, with plans to create easy \"contactless\" payment mechanisms at the retailer point-of-sale. Its anticipated payment features will ignite greater merchant adoption of Bitcoin Cash.\nHandCash co-founder Rafa Seibane remarks: \"In addition to financial investment, nChain will provide us access to its research, intellectual property and deep Bitcoin Cash expertise. We believe this technical support will give HandCash advantages in becoming a leading Bitcoin Cash wallet and payment system.\"\nnChain Group CEO Jimmy Nguyen comments: \"For Bitcoin Cash to grow, user interfaces need to become better and easier to use. We are impressed with HandCash and its vision for simplifying the Bitcoin Cash transaction process to a contactless approach. nChain is thrilled to support HandCash on its journey to make Bitcoin Cash wallets and payment systems easy to use around the world, and to ignite global adoption of Bitcoin Cash.\"\nnChain's deal with HandCash follows just days after the May 15, 2018 protocol upgrade for the Bitcoin Cash network. This recent upgrade implements two key changes:\nIncreasing the default size of blocks on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain from 8MB to 32MB; and Restoring certain OP_Codes for advanced functionality. The BCH 32 MB default block size is significantly larger than Bitcoin Core (BTC)'s small 1 MB block. This larger block size allows BCH network capacity to be over 8 million transactions per day, which is more than PayPal processes. This ensures usage of BCH can rapidly grow while maintaining the capacity needed to process greater transaction volumes, at fast speeds, but keeping fees very low. The upgrade validates HandCash's vision in creating its wallet product for Bitcoin Cash.\nWebsite: nChain.com\nTwitter: @nChainGlobal\nABOUT NCHAIN GROUP: The nChain Group is the global leader in research and development of blockchain technologies.

Some of us may recall being in a situation where something seems off, and we start to investigate, and then we discover that something was off. April Fools jokes are good examples, as well as satire and news reports from The Onion. The point of storing the entire blockchain history is to prevent any of that history being changed in a way that illicitly alters the UTXO Set. Whenever a memorable enough rendering of the UTXO Set is produced (which has happened exactly once - when Bitcoin started, it was empty, and after that, it just looks like a bunch of random computer data), the risk of altering the history before it goes up, even if you have the computing power to make subsequent block headers follow all the rules (and even to successfully execute a 51% attack!).

The company says it developed LMAX Digital at the request of its existing clients who asked for a credible, efficient and trusted platform to trade with like-minded institutions.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin in Brief Monday: New EU Rules Kill Another Crypto Venture Institutional Grade Crypto\nLMAX Digital will offer access only to the most liquid crypto assets including BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP and BCH, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The company explains that trading is governed by similar rules and principles as LMAX Exchange’s FCA regulated MTF (Multilateral Trading Facility), meaning that the exchange offers the same level of security, compliance, KYC and anti-money laundering policies and procedures as its established operations.\nOther features of the service include keeping one public rulebook for all members; a central limit order book (CLOB) with streaming, firm institutional liquidity; safe and secure hot/warm/cold multi-signature wallets; and a full custodian solution. Execution details include a matching latency of under 350 microseconds; a high throughput greater than 100,000 messages per second; an uptime of 100%; and all orders time-stamped in microseconds (receipt to execution). After the launch of LMAX Digital in a London-based data center (LD4), the company intends to also roll out infrastructure in New York and Tokyo in the near future. Game Changer David Mercer, CEO, LMAX Exchange\n“We are furthering the legitimisation of the crypto currency market by offering institutions a platform on which to acquire, trade and hold crypto currencies securely with high quality, deep liquidity,” said David Mercer, CEO of LMAX Exchange. “Over $10 trillion of FIAT has been traded on our exchanges to date and we have institutional clients in over 100 countries. We’ve applied everything we’ve learned in the institutional FX market to LMAX Digital, to create a fundamentally improved, secure digital exchange based on our proven trading technology, market leading liquidity and transparent and precise execution.”\n“The rise of institutional trading of crypto currencies will be a game-changer for the industry. We believe our new exchange will support the transformation of the crypto market from the fringes to the mainstream. Digital currencies are, without a doubt, coming of age. Exchanges will play a crucial role in bringing the major crypto currencies into wider circulation, helping them to become accepted into conventional funds which in turn will help to support a normalisation of value,” he added.\nSerious institutional money has been pouring into the crypto market since 2017, leading to the recent launch of new services catered specifically to this segment from the likes of Coinbase and others.\nWhat do you think about this development in the institutional space?

As news about the ICE platform continues to develop, Bitcoin Magazine spoke with lawyers Ben Sauter and Dave McGill of Kobre & Kim, a New York City law firm which specializes in disputes and investigations, to examine the regulatory issues surrounding the launch of such a platform, including swap contracts and the implications the ICE platform might have on cryptocurrency trading in the future.\nSauter and McGill are also participating lawyers in the Digital Currency & Ledger Defense Coalition (DCLDC), a coalition of lawyers and academics whose collaborated effort focuses on understanding the regulatory and legal issues surrounding cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to protect individual constitutional rights and civil liberties in connection with regulatory and law enforcement scrutiny.\nFor a large financial institution such as ICE or Goldman Sachs, figuring out how to develop a cryptocurrency trading platform is a potentially complicated analysis that begins with the question of whether or not a cryptocurrency is a security. If a cryptocurrency is deemed a security by the Howey test , “there are a lot more regulatory requirements,” according to McGill.\nWhile many people agree, including Peter Van Valkenburgh , director of research at the Coin Center, that the Howey test can act as the ultimate clarifier of which cryptocurrency is a security and which is not; the distinction is also important for another reason. Ultimately, the Howey test gives guidance in which regulatory agency polices which cryptocurrency. At this point, securities fall under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ’s (SEC) jurisdiction. Non-security cryptocurrencies — or commodities until proven otherwise — are in the realm of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). While this is obvious to anyone who can remember each agency’s full name, the distinction is also important because each agency has taken a different approach to policing cryptocurrency.\nThe SEC has gone after what McGill called “ low-hanging fruit .” These are the “pump-and-dump” ICOs that are scams or otherwise illegitimate in their offerings to investors. And, at least with ICOs, both agencies appeared to be on the same page in January 2018. More recently, the SEC has created a fake ICO . The token, aptly named HoweyCoin, is being used as a way to demonstrate potential signs of fraud in ICOs to cryptocurrency investors.\nOutside of the SEC’s scam scrubbing, Sauter and McGill have also seen regulator behavior that is not exactly encouraging for private sector participants:\n“The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) say they want to have an active dialogue with industry participants to understand the latest trends and developments. Unfortunately, we see a lot of regulators initiating those conversations with industry players by way of subpoena. Whenever you receive a subpoena from a regulator, you have to be concerned that it could be a lead-in to an enforcement action. This dynamic doesn’t exactly promote a free and healthy exchange of ideas,” said McGill. CFTC: The Prevailing Bitcoin Regulator?\nIn late April, SEC Chairman Clayton said bitcoin is not a security. According to both McGill and Sauter, because bitcoin will not likely be classified as a security, larger financial institutions like CME, CBOE, Goldman Sachs and now ICE are able to move forward with giving their clients exposure.\nNot being a security also means that the CFTC is the federal agency that most often acts as a watchdog over bitcoin transactions . But it is also not the only one. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has become involved in some bitcoin futures trading in pursuit of acts of perjury and obstruction of justice .\nEven if it is the prevailing regulator, how the CFTC will handle bad actors and fraud in bitcoin transactions is still up for debate. In the last year, there have been more aggressive actions such as CFTC v. McDonnell (CabbageTech) and, outside of cryptocurrencies, the CFTC’s prerogative to cut down on fraud and market manipulation ( Monex ). This could be evidence that there will likely be a crackdown on certain types of short-term trading behavior.\n“An underlying concern of the CFTC is that there are a number of people who can fairly easily impact prices with their trading. It makes it very difficult to regulate markets,” said Sauter, “but innovation is happening in futures and derivatives markets.”\nSpeaking toward how Bitcoin law will develop in the U.S., Sauter stated that industry cases which reach the court of appeals will be the ones that will ultimately shape U.S. regulation by either correcting case decision errors or clarifying and interpreting the law itself. Contract Swaps Aren’t New or Unregulated\nIf reports that ICE is considering using a model of trading bitcoin with swap contracts, this type of trading would remain under the regulatory realm of the CFTC. Furthermore, it would also decrease transaction speed.\nSwaps are a type of derivative contract where two parties trade based on a notional principal amount. Generally, one of these amounts is fixed while the other is variable, commonly based on an interest rate, floating currency exchange rate or index price. Swaps do not normally trade on exchanges but instead are over-the-counter contracts between different organizations. Sauter and McGill suggested that ICE would likely use an interest rate swap, though they are most likely still figuring out what they will pin bitcoin prices to.\n“Using the swap mechanism allows ICE to position themselves squarely under CFTC regulations, but getting that regulatory certainty looks like it will come at the cost of speed,” said McGill. “One of the ideas behind bitcoin and other digital currencies that made them so attractive as a concept was the idea that market participants could securely transact with one another almost instantly, without the need for intermediaries. But, if you have to create a swap product with a one-day settlement period to get regulatory clarity, then you lose a lot of what made digital currencies attractive in the first place.”\n“Bitcoin swaps aren’t entirely novel, either,” pointed out Sauter.\nTeraExchange began offering Bitcoin-based swaps in 2014. And, since launching its derivatives swap option in October 2017 after CFTC approval, LedgerX is reported to have increased their trading volume sevenfold.\nSauter stated that one reason why regulators have not moved more quickly to establish clear law around Bitcoin is that there still remains debate and uncertainty about regulators, the CFTC in particular, to police the markets.\n“One way regulators and institutional players are dealing with this is to move trading to regulated derivatives markets, be it swaps, futures or options,” said Sauter. “When that happens, the CFTC has a much more direct line of access to the markets and market participants. That’s part of the reason why we’re seeing such innovation happening in the derivatives markets.”\nAnother reason Sauter proposes for the interest in Bitcoin derivatives is that they are a much easier route by which big financial institution players can get involved. “ Institutional investors often have strict requirements concerning the types of markets and products they can trade, and they tend to like the idea of trading in markets that they know are being policed and that offer remedies in the event problems arise.” How Decentralized Proprietary Trading Could Be Affected\nThe implications of the rise in bitcoin-based swap contracts also means that the instantaneous transaction, so highly placed in the early value of bitcoin, might be a thing of the past for more mainstream investors to gain less-risky exposure. However, as McGill pointed out, “A lot of that early speed and eliminating transaction fees comes at the cost of added risk.”\nIt can be assumed that any cryptocurrency trader that is familiar with Mt. Gox is well aware of the risks associated with trading on unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges . Still, for some, the risks are worth it.\n“Some of this will just be decided by the market,” said Sauter. “Plenty of investors are weighing the risk of maybe not getting their money back when they need to unwind a trade. Traders who don’t want to deal with this will opt-into these trading platforms run by accredited institutional investors.”\n“There’s clearly more risk in operating on less regulated and decentralized exchanges ,” said McGill. “There may well be more lucrative opportunities as well, but there are all sorts of risks — including insider fraud — that a lot of traders want to avoid.”\nBy this estimation, bitcoin futures have brought the attention of regulators and that will inevitably alter the current space, whether making it more regulated or diversified remains to be seen.\n“CME bitcoin futures acted as the canary in the coal mine. From a regulatory perspective, it will be interesting to see if some of the fast-and-loose trading techniques that were being deployed on the nascent cryptocurrency exchanges carry over to the more mature and tightly regulated markets operated by CME and ICE,” said McGill. “Certainly, you’re going to get more players in the mix, and that alone will probably translate into more enforcement activity by CME and government regulators.”\nWeighing the risks of unregulated and decentralized exchanges draws back to the fundamental conflict that has been revolving around the cryptocurrency space since the Bitcoin white paper was first issued.\nWill bitcoin remain truly decentralized or will the desire to hedge against risk lead the majority of traders to accredited and regulated institutions? For many who are invested in bitcoin, not just for profit, but also ideological reasons, the answer appears obvious. Yet whether these Bitcoiners are early adopters of a movement or no more than fringe factions will be decided by the market. It would appear that less regulated and decentralized exchanges still need to develop strategies to match the greater security legacy financial institutions are championing to bring to cryptocurrency.\n“From a regulatory point of view, the idea of decentralized exchanges pose some interesting jurisdictional questions,” said McGill. “Ultimately, U.S. regulators tend to be less concerned about physical location and more focused on whether the activity interacts with and impacts U.S. commerce. I don’t think the notion of decentralizing an exchange will translate to immunity from regulators, but it has the potential to create a lot of headaches for regulators.”\nAnother factor in ICE and other legacy institutions hopping into bitcoin trading is an increase in the space’s technological innovation brought by increased competition.\n“Now you’re going to have the most sophisticated trading companies in the world trading in these products at an algorithmic level, which will substantially increase the volume of trading activity,” said McGill.\n“You’re going to get more players in the mix and probably many of those will have less regulatory experience and perhaps as a result more enforcement cases,” said Sauter. On New Competition and Shorting\nThough the involvement for big U.S.-based financial players will certainly affect the market, established cryptocurrency exchanges are optimistic about the future.\nTendai Musakwa, director of marketing at the Hong Kong–based cryptocurrency exchange , BTCC, believes that exchanges like BTCC “will remain the go-to cryptocurrency market for retail clients for the foreseeable future.”\n“We specifically designed our USD exchange to be accessible, drawing on our seven years’ experience operating the longest-running bitcoin exchange to create an effortless crypto trading experience. “\nMusakwa also pointed out that many legacy financial exchanges will have “high barriers of entry and inaccessible or confusing user interfaces.” Citing “real-person 24/7 customer support and deposit options such as credit cards,” he believes that cryptocurrency exchanges will continue to create value that institutional exchanges are unable to offer. “In addition, legacy fiat exchanges are geographically bound, while exchanges like BTCC offer customers worldwide easy access to BTC/USD trading.”\nAdded to this, Sauter attested that there are still many more regulatory hurdles for institutional exchanges — many of which have not yet been created.

But some influential investors and business leaders argue that investing in digital currencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) is a dangerous game. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin a “fraud” and later said he isn’t interested in the subject .\nWarren Buffett recently told Liz Claman on FOX Business that bitcoin has “produced nothing.” His longtime business partner, Charlie Munger, has called bitcoin “rat poison” and a “turd.”\nShiller, a Nobel-winning economist known for predicting the housing crisis and dot-com bubble, said much of cryptocurrencies’ appeal is driven by the mysteriousness that surrounds them.\n“Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work. That mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal,” Shiller wrote for Project Syndicate. “None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a compelling story may not be enough.”\nMore from FOX Business Bitcoin scams trigger SEC launch of phony website Cryptocurrency investing coming mainstream: Billionaire Mike Novogratz Bitcoin is ‘rat poison,’ Berkshire’s Charlie Munger says Advertisement\nShiller compared the emergence of cryptocurrencies with past experiments such as “time money.” In the 19th century, Josiah Warner opened the “Cincinnati Time Store,” which sold goods in units of hours of work, using “labor notes” as paper money. The store closed three years after it opened. A similar effort by the “father of socialism,” Robert Owen, also failed.\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels pushed for a “communistic abolition of buying and selling,” although no Communist state ever eliminated money, Shiller wrote. In the 1930s, a radical movement aimed to replace the gold-backed dollar with a measure of energy, but the Technocracy fad was short-lived. The economist John Pease Norton argued in 1932 for a dollar backed by electricity. That effort also gained little traction.\nShiller said these monetary innovations were connected to “a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society.” Likewise, cryptocurrencies “are a statement of faith in a new community of entrepreneurial cosmopolitans who hold themselves above national governments,” he wrote.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert shiller", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gary b. smith", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shiller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie dimon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonas max ferris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie munger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liz claman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fox business should", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kadina group", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fox business", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jpmorgan chase", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T03:07:18.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "27b81b99d9b88fbb8ffb0c823eaf324b61ea5f82", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS264hNLvrGh_mb04kMQZfT.Z0F4LEkHtwJqaw_GGdbo57V9nr8eaWT_XlwmuH0Wt12pbN1LlvCBMOZ.EaTK.XJf4LVCpSViHh.9jATgUCrPDTPs43.XPFjKyvfn1olpSX3vQSfs36_.A--", "site_full": "cryptovest.com", "site": "cryptovest.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "TEZOS Pressured by Class Action Lawsuit, Community Still Hopes on Official Launch | Bitcoin Insight", "title_full": "TEZOS Pressured by Class Action Lawsuit, Community Still Hopes on Official Launch | Bitcoin Insight", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.645, "main_image": "https://cryptovest.com/storage/upload/images/posts/3547/big/switzerland_city.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "27b81b99d9b88fbb8ffb0c823eaf324b61ea5f82", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS264hNLvrGh_mb04kMQZfT.Z0F4LEkHtwJqaw_GGdbo57V9nr8eaWT_XlwmuH0Wt12pbN1LlvCBMOZ.EaTK.XJf4LVCpSViHh.9jATgUCrPDTPs43.XPFjKyvfn1olpSX3vQSfs36_.A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "TEZOS Pressured by Class Action Lawsuit, Community Still Hopes on Official Launch | Bitcoin Insight", "text": "6 days ago | 552 shares About\nBitcoin Insight aggregates the latest stories, tweets and videos about Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Blockchain.

This column argues that the Vollgeld project and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin build on popular fantasies about money that are disconnected from the actual operation of the current monetary system. Unfortunately, the latter’s features remain underexplored even among economists. The cash comeback: Evidence and possible explanations Clemens Jobst, Helmut Stix\nMoney being one of the key symbols of the current economic system, and the monetary and the financial system being a key site of the Global Crisis, the idea that there is something wrong with money is one of the most popular explanations for the crisis among non-economists.\nThe desire to ‘put money right’ by introducing Bitcoin, Sovereign Money (or 'Vollgeld') or regional currency schemes is a result of this perception. Old debates in new guises\nAmong other issues, these initiatives revive two major age-old debates at the heart of monetary theory and history: Is money (or should it be) a pure asset (i.e. no one’s liability), or a claim on an issuer? Should money creation be governed by a responsible central entity, such as a central bank, or by a decentralised mechanism, such as markets or regional community governance (Weber 2018)?\nThe vision for an alternative currency underlying Bitcoin and similar crypto projects is based on replacing a central issuing entity by an automaton embedded in a technical architecture providing market incentives for economic subjects to animate and use it. Most cryptocurrencies are pure assets governed for the most part by market forces (Huberman et al. 2017, Fatas and Weder di Mauro 2018).\nSovereign Money is based on the view that money should be a pure asset, and that the creation of means of payment, subject to strict quantity control, is a prerogative of the state (Bacchetta 2018).\nBoth have received the greatest public attention so far among monetary reform projects. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have experienced headline-grabbing price movements in recent months. And a citizens’ movement in Switzerland has managed to enforce a plebiscite on the introduction of Sovereign Money to be held on 10 June 2018. Money, trust, and the crisis\nThe liquidity provided by money is a form of insurance against uncertainty, as long as the purchasing power of the currency concerned follows a stable pattern over time. At the cost of renouncing either the higher returns offered by riskier assets or the joys of consumption, money can be held without committing to a specific time, contract party, or commodity to spend it on.\nWhen money is a claim on an issuer, it is obvious that holding it puts you in a relationship with this issuer that involves trust issues. The instability triggered by the Global Crisis resulted in an increased desire among economic subjects to hold liquidity, and trust issues involved in financial affairs became the centre of public attention (Jobst and Stix 2017). While money has remained stable (in terms of general acceptance and purchasing power) in major currency areas in a context where many other financial instruments did not, the difference is not always acknowledged among observers.\nIn this context, projects like Bitcoin and Sovereign Money attract attention by suggesting that money is not safe unless it ceases to be a claim on an issuer. Instead, it should become a pure asset and be put under strict quantity control. Neglecting the inevitable dependence on others involved in holding money or any other non-consumable asset, the underlying idea is that commodity-like money would enable individual possession of money without dependence on an issuer which may suddenly become unable to make good on its promise.\nBoth concepts share the idea that controlling the quantity of money is key for securing a currency’s value, whereas the process of issuing it is considered of negligible importance. Therefore, both use the creation of new currency units to subsidise economic activities they consider useful.\nThe rule for receiving new bitcoins is dubbed ‘proof of work’ – miners obtain rewards from the issuing automaton for having contributed to the administration of Bitcoin’s payment system.\nBecause Sovereign Money is to be issued primarily as a donation to either the state or all its individual citizens, we could label its money-issuing rule ‘proof of status’.\nThey differ with respect to the preferred entity to exert the desired quantity control. In Bitcoin and similar projects, technology (i.e. rules encoded in an open-source software) is administering a transparent supply rule for digital units designed to attract decentralized activity. Under Sovereign Money, a state entity has the exclusive right to issue means of payments in official currency in order to control the money supply.\nA key reason for the popularity of both Bitcoin and Sovereign Money lies in the compatibility of their idea of money with a widely held perception among the general public (Mehrling 2015). Widespread ideas of sound money and its creation centre on a fixed homogeneous stock based on centralised quantity control. The crisis has shown that this view is at odds with the balance sheet-based realities of contemporary money and finance, their fragility and flexibility. Popular support for monetary reform projects can be considered one result of this. Unfortunately, much of current economics does not pay much attention to offering economists tools to address these issues (Goodhart 2018). Current hybrid monetary system\nWith respect to the two major debates in monetary theory referred to above, the current monetary system is a hybrid arrangement. It is based on the historical integration of sovereign coin-based with private accounting-based systems of issuing means of payment. Within each currency area, it combines both decentralised (i.e. market competition) and centralised governance mechanisms.\nToday, new means of payment are created when an issuer swaps liabilities with a debtor based on terms and conditions set by the issuer. The monetary system consists of several issuers creating means of payment that form a hierarchical relation of claims under the common roof of a single unit of account.\nMeans of payment issued by commercial banks are created against contractual payment commitments of a debtor or a third party (i.e. securities). Liabilities of commercial banks serving as means of payment for users are claims on cash issued by the central bank. A key function of banks is to offer liquidity to deposit owners operating with a small cash reserve, while a major part of the asset side of their balance sheet is committed to credit claims. Banks’ issuing behaviour is governed by profitability and risk concerns, subject to competition, regulation, supervision, and monetary policy.\nThe monetary system consists of a hierarchy of issuers, with means of payment issued by lower-ranking issuers being claims on higher ranks in the hierarchy. The top of the hierarchy in any currency area is central bank-issued money, serving as the final means of payment.\nBecause of its status as the exclusive means to settle tax obligations, official currency may be considered a form of claim on the state. More narrowly, cash and deposits of commercial banks at the central bank are the latter’s liability. Under current flexible exchange rate arrangements, these liabilities are usually not redeemable for users against assets held as counterpart on the central bank’s balance sheet. That gives them some features of a pure asset for the user. But it does not suspend the basic principle that new money is issued only against a counterpart asset that is subsequently held on the central bank’s balance sheet, based on terms and conditions set in view of a public mandate. Money creation is not unilateral wealth creation. Instead, it consists of swapping a new means of payment against a claim on future payments.\nMaking creditworthiness of counterparties a key criterion for issuing new means of payments establishes an important principle: new money only enters the economy when its initial user has extended a convincing promise to pay it back, or hands over the promise to pay by a third party (i.e. a security). Such contractual commitments of future income support the expectation behind the general acceptance of a currency and money’s stable purchasing power that future economic activity will take place resulting in goods and services available for money.\nEconomic models based on abstracting from these institutional details inadequately prepare economists to address a number of key concerns in current public debate. Conclusion\nMoney creation can be understood as being based on ‘proof of creditworthiness’. In contrast, issuing a ‘currency’ as a pure asset against either ‘proof of work’ (Bitcoin) or ‘proof of status’ (Vollgeld) severs the link between the creation of means of payments and commitments to contribute to future economic activity. Whether such an asset would be considered by potential users as a currency, a worthless token best avoided, or a kind of collector’s item inviting speculative activity is an open question. Over the last ten years, crypto users’ focus of activity (i.e. speculative activity) has already provided us with a clear answer on the status of Bitcoin and similar projects. Whether Swiss citizens are attracted by the invitation to subject their official currency to an experiment remains to be seen.

Bitcoin (BTC)\nBitcoin is currently sitting at $8,500, with a low of $7940 for the week. The local support level of $8,000 has held up remarkably well, meaning there are very few people willing to sell at that price. The trading volume is also extremely low, and in a clear downtrend since February. Decreasing volume demonstrated with a green trendline.\nLooking at the cloud, we see that $8,000 was the bottom of a flat cloud. Once again, the cloud is here to save the day – the longer the time frame of a chart, the more significant TA tools will be. This is because information is collected over a longer period, making outliers less effective.\nThe TK cross we discussed last week ended up forming inside the cloud, leading to some downside. Bitcoin is currently moving above Tenkan-Sen and could be attracted to the current flat top of the Kumo Cloud. Bitcoin fell through the cloud and quickly entered back in.\nBitcoin recently broke out of a falling wedge, which is a bullish pattern indicating a possible reversal. Credit: Twitter user @CRNBTC Ethereum (ETH)\nEthereum dipped under $650 briefly and is back at $720. Ethereum’s next price challenge will be its local high of $820. It has clear support around $355, and local support of around $650. Ethereum holds strong above its local support.\nEthereum made a move above the Tenkan-Sen and Kijun-Sen and looks to be heading towards the earlier mentioned local high of $820. Currently, the slower moving average is on top, indicating a bear trend.\nThis most recent move is causing the Tenkan-sen, which is the faster moving average, to slope back upwards. A TK cross above the cloud is a clear sign of a bullish trend. In combination with the bullish cloud and lagging span exiting the cloud, I would start looking for a trade on Ethereum if a TK cross occurs. Ethereum breaches the Tenkan-Sen and Kijun-Sen.\nRSI is used to tell if an asset is oversold or overbought. While being overbought or oversold alone isn’t the greatest indicators, it’s more useful case is to find hidden divergence. This week, however, there are no major divergences. Litecoin (LTC)\nLitecoin fell to $128 after bouncing off the cloud support. It has strong support at the $110 level and the next major obstacle will be around $180, which is the top of the cloud. Litecoin is resting above its local support.\nAdding Ichimoku Clouds to the picture, we learn a little bit more – the cloud is looking like it is going to flip bearish, and with price struggling to make it back into the cloud, this could indicate some more downside.\nThe cloud is formed by the Senkou spans, which are calculated by finding the midpoints between the Tenkan-Sen and Kijun-Sen over a period. Depending on the price action over the few days, we could see Litecoin flip even more bearish. Cloud is turning bearish, no divergence spotted.\nNo RSI divergence is found on the 1D Litecoin chart, as both price and RSI are consistent. This can be seen using the green trend lines. Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\nAfter being the biggest gainer over the past few weeks, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) had a rough week falling from $1800 down to $1150. It currently sits around $1300. This could have something to do with the Bitcoin Cash hard fork that occurred on May 15th.\nHard forks are very controversial in cryptocurrency as it can cause old versions of software to no longer work. In this case, the block size was quadrupled from 8 megabytes to 32 megabytes, which is an enormous increase compared to Bitcoin’s (BTC) one-megabyte blocks. While having a larger block size allows more and cheaper transactions, it comes with several downsides such as increased centralization. Bitcoin Cash falls over 40%.\nAdding Ichimoku Clouds to the picture we see a few things. There was a TK cross above the cloud which is a bearish signal. The Tenkan-Sen is sloping hard, indicating high momentum in the market.\nThe cloud is still bullish, and the price seems to have recovered somewhat well. It’s right under the Tenkan-Sen, so depending on how it reacts to the indicator it will be clear how to trade Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash is still above the cloud and is reacting to the Tenkan-Sen.\nAs far as RSI goes, no divergence can be spotted. Ripple (XRP)\nRipple fell from $0.92 down to $0.63 and is currently sitting above local support at $0.70 cents. Ripple’s resistance starts around its local high and is the top of a flat cloud shown in the next picture. Ripple is above its local support and moving sideways.\nRipple is currently outside of the cloud, and above the Tenkan-Sen. It is nearing the bottom of a bullish cloud, which is also flat. It would not be surprising to see Ripple retest the cloud as the price is usually drawn to flat parts of the cloud. There is also a bearish cloud forming supporting the downtrend. Ripple breaks out of the bottom of the cloud. Not a definitive indicator yet.\nSimilarly to Litecoin, if Ripple fails to break back into the cloud, and the cloud turns bearish, this could mean Ripple will see more sideways action or downside. Conclusion\nIn the past, the annual Consensus conference has lead to an enormous increase in market capitalization during and after the event. This is mainly due to the increased exposure and attention the event brings.\nThe next few weeks should give a better idea of where cryptocurrency markets are heading. The historically low volume indicates that traders are waiting on the sidelines to get a better idea of what is going to happen in the future.\nThere are no guarantees with technical analysis, and this post is simply an interpretation of the current market situation.\nTo see some more cryptocurrency and trading-related content, follow Austin on Twitter . Glossary\nHere are the definitions for each of the technical analysis terms used in this article. Senkou Span A – an indicator that is used to measure momentum, as well as future areas of support and resistance. Senkou Span A is always drawn in relation to Senkou Span B – together, they form the cloud. Senkou Span B – forms the cloud along with Senkou Span A. Traditionally when Senkou Span B is located below Senkou Span A, it is a symbol of bullish price movement. Senkou Span cross – The cloud is an area of uncertainty. Most traders do not make a move until price closes above or below the cloud – although, when the Senkou Spans cross one another, many traders use the indicator to predict the reversal of a current price trend. Kumo Twist – The Ichimoku Cloud is a Japanese trading strategy, and ‘Kumo’ means cloud in Japanese. The Kumo Twist is just a nickname for a Senkou Span cross. Tenkan-Sen – The Tenkan-Sen is used in conjunction with the Kijun-Sen to predict long and short positions. The formula for the Tenkan-Sen’s calculation takes the highest high and the lowest low and divides it by two over the last seven to eight time periods. Kijun-Sen – Similarly to the Tenkan-Sen, the Kijun-Sen is calculated using the same formula, but it usually includes the last 22 time periods. The Tenkan-Sen highlights short-term price movement, while the Kijun-Sen gives a better idea of long-term price movement. TK crossover – When the Tenkan-Sen crosses above the Kijun-Sen, it is an indication of bullish price movement. Conversely, the Tenkan-Sen crossing below the Kijun-Sen is a bearish sign. Both of these signals are known as a TK crossover. The location of the TK crossover impacts the strength of the signal. For example, a bullish TK crossover below the cloud is in bearish territory, and therefore a weak signal. On the other hand, a bullish TK crossover above the cloud is a strong signal. Chikou Span – Otherwise known as the Lagging Span, Chikou Span shows where the price was 26 periods before the most recent closing price. An upwards Lagging Span above price shows bullish momentum, while a Lagging Span below price shows bearish momentum. Volume – Is the amount of a stock, currency or asset exchanged in a given period of time. This can be expressed in terms of the unit (ex. Bitcoin) or standardized in terms of a currency such as dollars. Momentum – Momentum measures the strength or rate of acceleration of price action.

Why despite the massive increase in attendance the energy surrounding the conference felt so muffled and ultimately why it failed to provide the market bump that analysists and pundits predicted. Crypto Bull Tom Lee Owns His Bad Prediction\nIn hindsight, some of the problems are clear to see; the tickets were expensive and it didn’t support cryptocurrency for any event transactions. Those who attended said the discussions were outdated and even NPR’s Wait Wait Don’t Tell Me took a dig at the rented Lambos. Uber crypto bull Tom Lee though at least had the decency to own up to his misreading of the events influence on Bitcoin’s price.\nFundstrat’s Tom Lee predicted in a note to clients on May 7 that taking into account the low trading price of Bitcoin going into the conference which began on May 14th coupled with the way the market had reacted to previous years Consensus gatherings Bitcoin could gain anywhere from 10-70%. He wrote to Fundstrat’s clients;\n“ Already one of the largest crypto conferences in the world, attendance this year is up dramatically and coming at a time when Bitcoin/Crypto is down YTD. Hence, we expect the Consensus rally to be even larger than past years .”\nAs we know now Consensus did not create a market pump. In fact, Bitcoin slumped through the three day period about 10% taking the rest of the market down with it losing $45 billion since May 10, according to Coinmarketcap.com. Consensus was More of a Dump than a Pump\nLee owned up to his bad prediction in a new report to clients in which he exams why the annual gathering failed to push up the price of Bitcoin. Lee wrote his investors that the continued lack of clarity from regulators like the Securities Exchange Commission and the slow pace of adoption by traditional companies were factors. According to Bloomberg , he wrote;\n“Crypto still faces significant internal resistance and hurdles within traditional financial institutions, but it is encouraging, nonetheless, that a large share of incremental attendance are financial institutions.”\nOthers who attended Consensus 2018 would agree with Lee on some of his points but were less moderate in the way they expressed their disappointment with the conference. Reddit Poster U/korgijoe started a thread entitled “Consensus 2018: It sucked. Here’s why” in which he broke down the reasons he thought the conference was a failure which included clarity, presenters being out of touch with their core audience and the overall failure of presenters to deal with the most pressing issues of scalability and centralization.\nThe Reddit post which was followed by a stream of comments agreeing with and adding to the analysis ended with this conclusion as to why Bitcoin was falling during the gathering “It was embarrassing for crypto. The market spoke.” Ever bullish Fundstrat reports they still expect to see Bitcoin hit $25,000 by the end of 2018.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "john mcmahon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tom lee owns", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto bull tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "npr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T08:05:26.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0cf83d01ec622afad3ef6e65c5c6d92e5323399b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFRHYC08RnqbqDqNWopXb7MFkUgECa6zL1xGEozBjV.VdrQnpp3_KR6v9kejHwQM99E-", "site_full": "forextv.com", "site": "forextv.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "retirement_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin In ETFs Harder And Harder To Find - ForexTV", "title_full": "Bitcoin In ETFs Harder And Harder To Find - ForexTV", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.757, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0cf83d01ec622afad3ef6e65c5c6d92e5323399b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFRHYC08RnqbqDqNWopXb7MFkUgECa6zL1xGEozBjV.VdrQnpp3_KR6v9kejHwQM99E-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin News Editor", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin In ETFs Harder And Harder To Find - ForexTV", "text": "Home / Bitcoin News Wire / Bitcoin In ETFs Harder And Harder To Find Bitcoin In ETFs Harder And Harder To Find Posted by: Bitcoin News Editor in Bitcoin News Wire 1 hour ago\nThere are still no bitcoin ETFs on the market, but investors looking to access the cryptocurrency in an ETF wrapper could do so through a pair of ARK ETFs that, until recently, had bitcoin representing anywhere from 6% to 10% of their respective portfolios.

Picture taken\nBy Alun John and Jennifer Hughes\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Bitcoins are worth less than half of what they were in December. Mining them is 60 percent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers.\nWhy, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world's biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date?\nCanaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.\n“Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public.\nThe offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world's second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment.\nThe Beijing-based company's profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin's soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand.\nBut the effects of bitcoin's volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong's central business district, where the IPO has been filed.\nBusinesses selling mining rigs there said demand - especially for high-end machines - was limping along.\nAlvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit.\n\"Since we weren't selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,\" said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district.\nThe change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming. [nL4N1PY242]\nBitcoin prices have fallen 40 percent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400.\nPROMISED LAND\nTo some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment.\n\"Investors are always looking for crypto 'picks and shovels', and that's what this is,\" said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm.\nCanaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock.\nHowever, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens.\nFast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 percent of their 2017 peak at roughly $17 million per day.\nLast month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), the world's largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain.\nCryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator's apparent approval.\nVisiting its factory, he said: “no matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you’re still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,\" according to mainland media reports.\nMARKET TEST\nBitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market - a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan's deal.\nAlthough the two sources were confident the IPO could raise $2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between $500 million and $1 billion.\nA lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price. In Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014. Eighteen months later, however, the company changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus to fintech software.\nLast year in Canada, listed miner Leeta Gold became HIVE Blockchain.\n\"Its not your everyday investment world,\" said HIVE chairman Frank Holmes, who is relatively new to the crypto world, but is a well-known investor in gold.\nHIVE, with a market capitalization of $318 million, mines bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Iceland and Sweden, favored for the energy-intensive process because of their cool temperatures and cheap power.\n\"We became the first public company that allowed institutions to play in this kind of space,\" Holmes added, pointing out that HIVE's second-largest shareholder is Fidelity, the giant U.S. fund manager.\nOther companies are also getting in on the act, with Canaan's smaller rival Ebang also considering a Hong Kong IPO, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.\n\"The excitement about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is not nearly finished, it is only just beginning,\" said Kenetic's Chu, who added that if successful, Canaan's IPO would encourage other cryptocurrency-related firms to list.\nPeople involved in Canaan's IPO say the prospects for the offering depend in part on the price of bitcoin over the next two months.\nWhile soggy prices, combined with rising mining capacity, will hit the hobby miners served by the Sham Shui Po shops far harder than Canaan's industrial-sized customers, they would still cast a shadow over the deal.\nIn Sham Shui Po, meanwhile, Alvin Wong says he will soon unplug his rig to put it and others back on the shelves - just as soon as customer demand returns.\n(Reporting by Alun John and Jennifer Hughes; additional reporting by Sijia Jiang and Fiona Lau of IFR; Editing by Gerry Doyle) More From Technology ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alun john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer hughes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "canaan inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T04:47:32.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "74bb62a2919631232d6fb554c31cc7b95da96f2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvegbPgjwKU8hfjJPGzl.qtECqF9eR78FizgGw5felNYaZiZLf2iS9PfcODyZQVzMMAN9v6e.qC6.BMjpHQarSfXdFmWX21veXvR0TpR9yZ7BQdFFxtKMf82aRxBYbbfk6iIw4A2PPjXg--", "site_full": "mymixfm.com", "site": "mymixfm.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "music", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "As bitcoin world wobbles, mining rig company plans $2 billion IPO | News | MIX-FM", "title_full": "As bitcoin world wobbles, mining rig company plans $2 billion IPO | News | MIX-FM", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://radiocms-images.us1.eldarioncloud.com/resize/1200/https://storage.googleapis.com/media.mwcradio.com/mimesis/2018-05/22/2018-05-22T003641Z_1_LYNXNPEE4L00V-OUSTC_RTROPTP_3_TECH-US-CANAAN-IPO.JPG?upscale=False", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "74bb62a2919631232d6fb554c31cc7b95da96f2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvegbPgjwKU8hfjJPGzl.qtECqF9eR78FizgGw5felNYaZiZLf2iS9PfcODyZQVzMMAN9v6e.qC6.BMjpHQarSfXdFmWX21veXvR0TpR9yZ7BQdFFxtKMf82aRxBYbbfk6iIw4A2PPjXg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Midwest Communications Inc.", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "As bitcoin world wobbles, mining rig company plans $2 billion IPO | News | MIX-FM", "text": "As bitcoin world wobbles, mining rig company plans $2 billion IPO Monday, May 21, 2018 8:36 p.m. EDT High-end graphic cards are installed in a cryptocurrency mining computer at a computer mall in Hong Kong, China May 17, 2018.

Marvel Comics’ Hunt for Wolverine – Adamantium Agenda #1 and The Simpsons: Tapped Out video game are both working-in references to cryptocurrency into their respective storylines and quests in attempt to capture some of the excitement regarding money’s future. Way back in 1997, The Simpsons foreshadow The Simpsons are Crypto Cool\nMobile games have been the rage for years now, and among the so-called freemium games, The Simpsons: Tapped Out is a very popular choice within the genre. In the world of the game itself, Who Shot Mr. Burns, Part 3 (2018) is what’s known as the third minor event of this year, and is the 35th minor event in the game’s history. It comes directly after The Springfield Jobs 2018 Event which ends in just a few days. Crypto Cool is a limited-time quest-line, and it is the first quest in the series.\nCrypto Cool begins as per usual: Homer is not taking his nuclear power plant job seriously, playing games on his tablet instead of working. Players are to keep the nerdy character Martin talking about blockchain, mentioning it a zillion times, never explaining exactly what it is he’s talking about. At a key point in the game, Martin admits he’s only heard of of blockchain “last week. But now I act like I’m an expert on it,” echoing a very real occurrence in the current ecosystem.\nAvailable in iOS, Android, and Kindle Fire, The Simpsons: Tapped Out has been around for over half a decade, and is owned by EA Mobile. The game seems to print cash, having earned much more than $100 million due to in-game purchases as players attempt to progress. And at still another point in the game, Martin references the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, bitcoin. He brags at having “mined some bitcoin with my computer, and then the value went through the roof.” Players who complete the task with Martin are then asked to get three more characters to mine bitcoin on their devices.\nEnthusiasts are hip to the fact this isn’t the first cartoon-oriented theme to reference crypto. Bitcoin has seen light on shows like Supernatural, Family Guy, among others. The Good Wife, Almost Human, Person of Interest, and House of Cards have also kissed the phenomenon’s metaphorical ring, as it were. For The Simpsons, of course, this isn’t a first either. About five years ago, Krusty has to admit he’s busted because “all it takes is bad luck at the ponies, worse luck in the bitcoin markets.” A year later, Jimbo is advertising his bullying services, adding he “accepts bitcoin.” As far back as 1997, The Simpsons also alluded to cryptography with scenery in the background: a store called Crypto Barn, A Place for Codes. Marvel Comics’ Hunt for Wolverine – Adamantium Agenda #1\nWritten by Tom Taylor and illustrated by RB Silva, Marvel’s Hunt for Wolverine – Adamantium Agenda #1 is the story of how, at one point, Wolverine rescued New York City by essentially helping it avoid being hit by a bomb. The act evidently involved self sacrifice, saving the entire city. After, he is nowhere to be found. Iron Man, Spider Man, Luke Cage, and Jessica Jones all join in the adventure, involving black markets, familial cliffhangers, and more.\nMarvel has been around in one form or another for nearly 80 years. Now owned by The Walt Disney Company, Marvel Comics boasts creators such as Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and Steve Ditko. Black Panther, Spider Man, Iron Man, Captain America, Wolverine, the Hulk, Thor, Daredevil are among its most notable heros. Marvel has captured slightly more market share than chief rival DC Comics.\nBecause it is ruled by math, and its distributed ledger tech is immutable, Hunt for Wolverine assumes bitcoin as a universal power delivery system often used by robots. At one point, without giving too much away, Tony Stark needs to make payments. It is assumed, considering the type of characters he’s dealing with, he’ll used the usual unmarked cash. This time, instead, he must use cryptocurrency. And reference is made to crypto’s “risky” reputation, to which Tony Stark has a hilarious response.\nBoth The Simpsons and Marvel have incredible reaches, from average gaming Joes to nerds perhaps more inclined toward crypto. Any push into mainstream culture seems to help ease fears and dispels mystery surrounding decentralized money. And that can only be a good thing.\nAre video games and comics important avenues to encourage crypto curiosity?
