Starting in early 2017, the price of bitcoin ballooned from $1,000 to a record high of around $20,000 in mid-December. Currently, the price now sits in around $7,500.\nUnlike in Japan , where virtual currency exchanges are subject the same rules and oversight as any other financial institutions and are required to register with the government, in the U.S. and other countries, cryptocurrency exchanges are still largely unregulated, opening up the doors to fraud and manipulation.\nAs for the U.S. Justice Department, its probe will focus on practices like spoofing, where a trader puts in a large buy or sell order only to withdraw the order as soon as the price starts to go up or down; and wash trading, where an investor simultaneously buys and sells assets to increase the volume of trading.

Starting in early 2017, the price of bitcoin ballooned from $1,000 to a record high of around $20,000 in mid-December. Currently, the price now sits in around $7,500.\nUnlike in Japan , where virtual currency exchanges are subject the same rules and oversight as any other financial institutions and are required to register with the government, in the U.S. and other countries, cryptocurrency exchanges are still largely unregulated, opening up the doors to fraud and manipulation.\nAs for the U.S. Justice Department, its probe will focus on practices like spoofing, where a trader puts in a large buy or sell order only to withdraw the order as soon as the price starts to go up or down; and wash trading, where an investor simultaneously buys and sells assets to increase the volume of trading.

"text": "DOJ opens criminal probe into bitcoin price manipulation: report By Olivia Beavers - 05/24/18 12:57 PM EDT 15 © Getty Images\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) has opened a criminal investigation into whether traders in some cryptocurrency markets are using illegal tactics to manipulate the price of digital currencies like bitcoin, Bloomberg News reported Thursday.\nThe investigation will examine whether traders are seeking to influence the value of digital currencies by engaging in illegal practices that could prompt others into buying or selling from their online wallet, four sources familiar with the matter told the news outlet.\nAs part of the probe, sources told Bloomberg that the DOJ is teaming up with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), an agency that oversees derivatives markets. ADVERTISEMENT\nU.S. authorities are concerned that fraudsters are manipulating the nascent, unregulated virtual markets by sending up or shooting down the currencies' price valuations to make a profit.\nInvestigators are looking to see whether traders are exploiting the markets with tactics like spoofing of wash trades. Spoofing is when a trader makes a series of orders, but then cancels them after the price moves in the direction they want.\nThe other practice, wash trades, is when a trader only trades with him or herself in order to create the false illusion of market demand — a move that aims to draw more people to invest as well.\nThe investigation, which is in its early stages, will be looking to find traders employing these fraudulent practices in popular cryptocurrency exchanges like Bitcoin and Ether, according to the report.\nA Justice Department spokesman declined Bloomberg's request for comment and CFTC officials did not respond to their requests for comment.\nAs cyber thieves continue to target virtual currencies, which have spiked in value, questions have increasingly arisen over how the government should regulate the growing industry, particularly because dozens of such platforms are scattered around the world.\nWhile many digital trading platforms are not registered with the CFTC or the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, they agency can still issue sanctions if fraud is detected in some of the crypto-spot markets.

By JACK GUEZ (AFP)\nA South African teenager was found Thursday four days after he was kidnapped by a gang who demanded a ransom in bitcoin cryptocurrency worth about $123,000 (105,000 euros), police said.\nPolice declined to say if any ransom had been paid after the 13-year-old boy was taken in the eastern province of Mpumalanga while playing near his home and driven away in a car.\nLocal media published a ransom note left at the scene demanding 15 bitcoins and giving an address for a bitcoin \"wallet\" -- an internet location where the virtual currency can be stashed.\n\"I can confirm that Katlego Marite has been found,\" Mpumalanga police spokesman Leonard Hlathi told eNCA television news.\n\"I am not at liberty to divulge more details. Currently an investigation is underway.\n\"He was alone when he was found. He is 100 percent fine. The parents are by the side with their son and the police are also with him.\"\nThe case appeared to be the first ransom demand in South Africa made in virtual currency.\nIn March, US hackers demanding a ransom payable in bitcoin attacked computers of the Atlanta city government in the southern state of Georgia.\nPolice in South Africa, where violent crime is common, have reported a recent rise in kidnappings, although it is often wealthy business people who are targeted.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack guez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leonard hlathi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katlego marite", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "afp", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mpumalanga", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T18:59:10.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4d3dd3083e0f81c980b13e74e83ca6ad62d6b291", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbCUhF8SaCS1UajO5IgCs4o-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=180.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Haberleri", "title": "Bitcoindeki düşüşte OKExin de etkisi olabilir", "title_full": "Bitcoindeki düşüşte OKExin de etkisi olabilir", "published": "2018-05-24T19:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.214, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4d3dd3083e0f81c980b13e74e83ca6ad62d6b291", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbCUhF8SaCS1UajO5IgCs4o-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jeks", "published": "2018-05-24T19:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoindeki düşüşte OKExin de etkisi olabilir", "text": "Bitcoinde Mayıs ayının başlarında başlayan satış baskısıyla birlikte Bitcoinin fiyatı, Nisan ayının ortasından bu yana ilk kez, son altı haftanın en düşük seviyesine, 7500 doların altına geriledi.\nBugünkü düşüşte hacim bakımından dünyanın en büyük kripto para borsası konumunda olan OKExin etkili olmuş olabileceği belirtiliyor.

It has led to a lot of pushback and even court cases amidst crypto businesses closing.\nIndia’s relationship with Bitcoin is rocky at best, but also confusing and convoluted, and well worth examining as so much has happened in just the past few months. Bitcoin and blockchain in review\nIndia had a very productive 2017 in terms of the growth, adoption, and acceptance of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.\nOne of India’s leading trade associations, ASSOCHAM, held a global summit on Bitcoin and blockchain in March 2017.\nIn May 2017, the demand for Bitcoin grew exponentially and abruptly, so much that India’s largest exchanges had to put a limit on Bitcoin purchases due to lack of supply.\nIn June, Zebpay, one of India’s leading Bitcoin exchanges established back in 2012, became the seventh most popular app in the finance category on India’s Apple app store, even higher than the apps of many national banks.\nIn October, it was reported that the major Bitcoin exchanges in India were attracting more than 200,000 new users every month .\nThis was all going on with negative rumbling from the RBI already in the background, as it was issuing warnings throughout the year cautioning people about buying Bitcoin. The rumbling gets louder\nWhile there was huge growth and interest from individuals and companies in cryptocurrency and blockchain, the RBI was mostly unswayed, and in the government remained similarly unimpressed.\nIn the hopes of deterring buyers, India’s Ministry of Finance called Bitcoin a ponzi scheme and said it had no intrinsic value, but this was announced only a few days after Bitcoin topped a high of $20,000 , and mostly fell on deaf ears.\nBut those warnings started turning into actions as the banking sector took tangible steps to try to slow down Bitcoin’s growth and progress. Banks dig in their heels\nOn January 21, 2018, it was reported that a number of major banks in India had suspended or greatly curtailed functionality on exchange accounts.\nState Bank of India (SBI), Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Yes Bank had all taken strong actions against crypto exchanges, either closing accounts or severely limiting functionality. The reason given was the risk of dubious transactions, according to local reports .\nOn February 14, Citibank India banned its customers from using credit cards to purchase cryptocurrencies. It also took the measure one step further by banning the use of debit cards for crypto purchases, Quartz India reported .\nThemove by the banks, coupled with a negative mention about Bitcoin by finance minister Arun Jaitley during his budget speech, had an impact as Bitcoin businesses started feeling the heat and were unprepared to operate in such a negative climate.\nOn February 28, crypto exchanges BTCXIndia and ETHEXIndia then informed their customers via email that they were stopping trading activities, citing the “stress” on their business caused by governmental actions discouraging crypto.\nThis all led up to the RBI’s big announcement of its ‘ban ’. They explained in their statement that the move was justified by the associated risks that the government had been warning against all this time.\nThus, it has been decided that, effective immediately, entities regulated by RBI shall not deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling VCs. Regulated entities that already provide such services shall exit the relationship within a specified timeframe. Hope remains\nWhile the news was seen as semi-positive since it was not a direct ban on cryptocurrencies, it was still a blow for India’s burgeoning cryptocurrency environment.\nHowever, a day after the ‘ban’ was announced, hope was slightly renewed as the RBI also said that it was considering creating its own cryptocurrency . RBI Deputy Governor B.P. Kanungo had some positive things to say about the technology. He told The Times Of India :\n“Technological innovations, including virtual currencies, have the potential to improve the efficiency and inclusiveness of the financial system. We recognize that the Blockchain technology has potential benefits for the financial sector and we believe that they should be encouraged to be exploited for the benefit of the economy.” A big backlash\nDespite the positivity about the technology and the economic potential cryptocurrencies could offer India, the fact of the matter was that the damage was done, and already the fledgling crypto ecosystem was taking hits as exchanges closed.\nThis triggered a backlash from Indian citizens as well as some big crypto-influencers.\nTim Draper , the well-regarded tech investor, called the RBI’s decision a huge mistake and warned that it would drain India of cryptocurrency experts, which it would clearly need if it did see potential in the technology.\nFurthermore, a petition garnered over 17,000 signatures, urging the RBI to reverse its decision on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. The reason for signing this petition for many was expressed as:\n“It could lead to an increase of irregular cash trading of cryptocurrencies in India. In addition, the ban could take away potential revenue to the government from crypto exchanges, and instigate a crypto market price drop ‘due to the knee jerk reaction in which prices got impacted.’”\nThis unfortunately was not strong enough to sway the RBI’s decision, which then led to sterner measures being taken. Legal intervention\nOn April 22, 2018, the High Court of Delhi reportedly issued a notice to the RBI , the Ministry of Finance, and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council alleging that RBI’s decision to end dealings with crypto businesses violates the constitution.\nHowever, as this issue began to climb up the judicial ladder, it was halted when the Supreme Court of India was called upon. On May 12, the Supreme Court declined to grant an interim injunction against the RBI.\nLater on, the Supreme Court came forward again and said that no petitions could be filed in any High Court of India against the RBI crypto decision. This decision will be in place until July, when the Court will set a hearing date for the existing petition on July 20 . What’s happening on the ground floor?\nFor all the rumbling coming out of India from court battles and petitions to these bans on dealing with crypto, it is always important to see how the news is affecting the crypto-users on the ground floor.\nEvan Luthra, an Indian cryptocurrency investor and entrepreneur, spoke to Cointelegraph about what is going on, and how the government is really just looking to play it safe.\n“What most people need to understand is that the views and opinions of a few people in the government don’t make a law,” Luthra told Cointelegraph. “The Indian government is just trying to play it safe and actually bringing light to the whole industry.”\n“The process taken by the government is not the wrong intention. It is for putting a stop to people who are doing scams and running ponzi schemes. The actions taken will only slow down the process but it cannot stop the adoption. That’s the beauty of decentralization, that it cannot be stopped or controlled by any central authority. If people choose to adopt Bitcoin, crypto, or Gladage, or any other token, for example, directly without converting into fiat, it will next leap in the industry.”\n“The government has only put a stop to conversion into fiat but they are actively promoting the technology. Even the Prime Minister is going out in public and explains the benefits of adopting the technology. In the coming days things will get much better even on the regulatory side.”\nLuthra’s point, that the government has good intentions, does make sense. However, their implementation is rubbing people the wrong way in the short term. Still, down the line, when this move has cleared away scams and ponzi schemes, perhaps it will be viewed in a better light. The battle rages\nIt is a baffling situation that the Indian cryprocommunity finds themselves in as their central bank is slowing the progress of Bitcoin, blockchain, and cryptocurrencies in general. The government does not have a positive outlook on crypto, but they are not banning it.\nRather it is being choked out by the banking system which is now under pressure from the community, who is involving the courts. India is fighting internally about the future of cryptocurrency with even the banks admitting that there is a lot of promise in the technology.\nThe next step in India’s battle for cryptocurrency legitimacy will come on July 20, when the courts sit down and look over the new petitions, but until then, the cryptocummunity has to try to survive even with the banking squeeze.

The market pundits, although, are considering how low bitcoin price value can go. How Low Can it Go?\nThe bounces had been restrained in the freefall of Bitcoin rate within the final two weeks. The largest coin has breached a number of key helps ranges with out facing any resistance from bulls.\n“remaining week’s $ 9k help has turned into this week’s $ 8k support. And so far it is giving each indication that $ 7k will become subsequent week’s aid. i am hoping you see the style right here,” Jani Ziedins noted.\nTechnical analysts, on the other hand, are indicating the bearish vogue to lengthen momentum in the days to come.\nThey claim a brand new bearish crossover sample could kill Bitcoin expense. in response to technical charts, the 5-month relocating standard (MA) is set to reduce the ten-month relocating usual from the precise – which indicates a bearish pattern for bitcoin cost.\nThe old two bearish spells had pulled Bitcoin rate within the latitude of $ 6,000 before bouncing back to $ 10K latitude. This time market pundits have set a support stage at $ 7K. If price slid below that level, the next help level would be $ 6,000 for bitcoin price. Can it Crash to Zero?\nthe talk over the Bitcoin’s skills to work as a manageable forex has been impacting the cost of the complete cryptocurrency market. however Fed’s officers and other investing specialists declare an entire crash of the cryptocurrency market, any other experiences are showing the simplest handful of cryptocurrencies will survive in the future. And, Bitcoin is one among them. Tom Lee nevertheless holds his buying rating with the one-year expense goal of $ 25K.\nFeatured graphic: twitter", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jani ziedins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:19:38.130+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "95a8a41fab798d8c4044697de744303ffcb5a7b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaWgO5AdJyAB8KFANcRkWObtzVDjM4XYQT.yxRa75xfZHBGqyKkTDnvAlJy8tyY0k5Ie1RITDwu5lBUsOBzdXzoITBzaM2wYj5", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "U.S Justice Department to look into Bitcoin Price Manipulation, regulations coming soon?", "title_full": "U.S Justice Department to look into Bitcoin Price Manipulation, regulations coming soon? : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-24T19:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "95a8a41fab798d8c4044697de744303ffcb5a7b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaWgO5AdJyAB8KFANcRkWObtzVDjM4XYQT.yxRa75xfZHBGqyKkTDnvAlJy8tyY0k5Ie1RITDwu5lBUsOBzdXzoITBzaM2wYj5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ishan1121", "published": "2018-05-24T19:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "U.S Justice Department to look into Bitcoin Price Manipulation, regulations coming soon?", "text": "submitted by /u/Ishan1121\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://blockmanity.com/u-s-justice-department-look-bitcoin-price-manipulation/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T14:51:54.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "03cb3ca71552c75986e7075f3eff6e4268442b5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkgz6eTlVHKdmK77vMTDWx0Fv5Ia5LOr7Hvo3McQmF8HgHZmKjjqrBwlrYHb1I_nIVfC2BWqSirDsCRuXXSboJ4MaNR9TyrpLybki4XpGdwl_JulevaFEf", "site_full": "bitcoinwarrior.net", "site": "bitcoinwarrior.net", "site_section": "http://bitcoinwarrior.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Tom Lee still bullish on Bitcoin [BTC], gives 3 reasons why", "title_full": "Tom Lee still bullish on Bitcoin [BTC], gives 3 reasons why", "published": "2018-05-24T19:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "03cb3ca71552c75986e7075f3eff6e4268442b5a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkgz6eTlVHKdmK77vMTDWx0Fv5Ia5LOr7Hvo3McQmF8HgHZmKjjqrBwlrYHb1I_nIVfC2BWqSirDsCRuXXSboJ4MaNR9TyrpLybki4XpGdwl_JulevaFEf", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Warrior", "published": "2018-05-24T19:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Tom Lee still bullish on Bitcoin [BTC], gives 3 reasons why", "text": "Tom Lee still bullish on Bitcoin [BTC], gives 3 reasons why May 25, 2018\nFundstrat’s Thomas Lee appeared on CNBC Futures Now to make a bullish statement about the price of Bitcoin. He stood his ground on his previous prediction that Bitcoin would hit $25000 soon.\nAfter Bitcoin crashed yesterday to below $8000, the outcome looked bleak for BTC HODLers. It is currently trading at around $7500, undoing the profits it made this year for a new low in 2018. Lee believes that the drop is due to “typical crypto volatility”, identifying three factors that will make his prediction come true.\nWhile he did say that the charts are “pretty scary for folks”, he mentioned that the “notion of blockchain as a way to solve trust in the digital world has gained a lot of traction”.\nThe first of Tom Lee’s three factors is the cost of producing Bitcoin. He believes that it is trading at cost, with the cost of making Bitcoin being around $8000, unlike gold, which is being traded at double its extraction cost.\nLee also mentioned that he would keep an eye on institutional investors, believing that they would be one of the big catalysts in the crypto space.\nHe said:\n“I think institutional investors have gained a lot of interest, and they haven’t really come into crypto yet because there is still some regulatory uncertainty, but that sort of ultimate allocation into crypto as an asset class is going to be a powerful reason why bitcoin rallies.”\nCryptocurrencies are still waiting on regulators to develop new frameworks to accommodate digital assets in the real world. Lee believes that a declaration for the side of cryptos would push Bitcoin into a rally.\nHe also went on to say that only 10 days comprise all the performance in one year of Bitcoin’s price. Without those 10 days, Bitcoin is only down by 25% in a year. He also said:\n“So as miserable as it feels holding bitcoin at $8,000, the move from $8,000 to $25,000 will happen in a handful of days,”\nBitcoin is currently trading around the $7500 mark, after suffering a flash drop from $7918 to $7520.

After exciting markets, these traders simply cancel their orders before execution so they may buy or sell at advantage in their desired market atmosphere.\nUS regulators, says Bloomberg, have discouraged these practices in regular capital markets by requiring exchanges to monitor and prevent manipulation. Until very recently, many cryptocurrency exchanges functioned under the regulatory radar. They barely conducted identity checks on customers, let alone stepped in to intervene on spoofing and wash trading.\nThe anonymous blogger calling him or herself “Bitfinex’ed” has been documenting and alleging questionable trading practices on the Bitfinex exchange for over a year. Many, charts assembled on Twitter , YouTube and at Medium by “Bitfinex’ed” seem to indicate rampant trade manipulation at the exchange.\nThe Bitfinex exchange is closely associated with Tether, a company that produces a so-called “stable coin” cryptocurrency by the same name. The Tether company has allegedly failed to produce any credible audits despite indications that it does hundreds of millions of dollars worth of business every quarter.\nIn December of last year, the CFTC sent subpoenas to both the Bitfinex exchange and Tether. Despite this, the “printing” of tethers has barely slowed at all. CYBERSECURITY: CRIME AND ESPIONAGE:Another Cryptocurrency Target for U.S. Regulators: Tether. So what is the state of the CFTC subpoena of Tether/Bitfinex? Why has Tether been allowed to print another $1 billion of counterfeit money – USDT – since then? https://t.co/DOAdcAyqhp\n— Nouriel Roubini (@Nouriel) February 10, 2018\nMarc Hochstein at Coindesk reported in early March of this year that a lawyer for “Bitfenex’ed,” Stephen Palley, wrote a “stern” letter to the Bitfinex exchange that they’d be held liable if linked to any of the numerous threats made against the writer “Bitfinex’ed.”\n“As you know, threats have been made and continue to be made against @bitfinex’ed. If we learn that your client is directly or indirectly responsible for these threats, or if any harm should take place to @bitfinex’ed as a result of these threats, there will be legal consequences.”\nIn late March, Cointelegraph reported that the Bitfinex exchange has been negotiating moving registration of its operations from the British Virgin Islands to Zug, Switzerland.\nA number of anonymous crypto pump-and-dump traders are legendary in the crypto sphere. Reputable trader Nick Cote recently recounted the story of notorious pump trader Wolong on the Crypto Street podcast:\n“He was one of the early big market makers, manipulators, like Coolio, back in the day. And he had the private group that ran on IRC (messaging) that kind of eventually imploded. But he basically just took low-cap market coins and just pumped them up to extreme prices and at that time there wasn’t a lot of liquidity in these markets so there was less resistance to move these markets once they’d accumulated a substantial position in these markets to control it. And eventually he just cashed out his fortune…and hasn’t really been seen since.”\n<span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span> Sponsored Links by DQ Promote You may also like...

It seems only fitting to have the 2018 National Settlement Services Summit (NS3) close with a lively discussion of this topic.\nDuring the session titled “Blockchain, Bitcoin and You,” three industry insiders will discuss how the growth of Blockchain and cryptocurrency stands to benefit title agents, lenders, Realtors and borrowers.\n“I don’t want to sound too simplistic but it’s just going to change the way we do everything,” Crypto Realty Group CEO Piper Moretti said. “Rather than going to several different sources for all the information that we need as Realtors, we’ll be able to close on a house in a matter of a few days rather than a month to 45 or 60 days. Transactions will be infinitely faster. That’s the end goal, I believe.”\nMoretti will be joined by John Heck, director industry general manager at DXC Technology Co. and formerly of IBM, and Matt Einheber, principal at Transfer: Real Estate Intelligence.\nIn addition to speed, the speakers will detail how Blockchain could improve fraud mitigation, reduce errors, cut down on paperwork and much more.\nMoretti said she is working with some startups in the process of developing essentially a one-stop shop for all parts of the real estate transaction, from beginning to end. The efficiency of Blockchain enables them to dream big in terms of ushering in a new modern era of real estate transactions.\n“We’ll look at traditional recordkeeping, which is completely archaic, and what is hopefully coming down the pike,” she said. “It really just comes down to adoption. How fast can we do it and how fast can we learn it.”\nSome states already are taking steps to better accommodate Blockchain, she noted, such as Arizona and California. Both states have introduced legislation to make Blockchain a legal form of recordkeeping, which could alleviate issues with the use of cryptocurrency that continue to crop up.\nThe speakers also will touch on how companies can effectively protect borrowers’ sensitive information and keep them abreast of information that is pivotal to a smooth home-buying process.\nFor more information on the 2018 NS3, including the agenda and a list of speakers, click here .

"2018-05-24T19:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Forks Explained", "text": "Authored by Amity blog via Safehaven.com ,\nIn early November, while Bitcoin enthusiasts and investors were waiting for a long-anticipated update to the software that supports the famous digital currency, a mass email from the group behind the project informed everyone that they were canceling the update .\nFor months, Segwit2x , as the update was called, was at the center of a heated debate between different stakeholders in the Bitcoin community on how to address Bitcoin’s struggles in increasing the speed at which it handles transactions.\nIn their announcement, the Segwit2x leaders stated the update had not won sufficient consensus in the community, hence their decision to call it off.\nThe debate surrounding Segwit2x and the eventual withdrawal of the update proposal demonstrates how updating cryptocurrency software (called \"forks\" in the crypto-jargon) can be complicated.\nHere’s what you need to know about forks and how they affect Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. What is a fork?\nIn traditional software, where a single organization or company owns the code of an application and servers where it runs, pushing updates is straightforward: You update the code, compile it and deploy it on the server side and, if necessary, send patches to the users. Whoever installs the updates will be able to benefit from the new features.\nIn cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, however, things are not that simple. Instead of running on the servers of a single company, the Bitcoin software runs on thousands of computers called miners. These computers are scattered across the world and get compensated in bitcoins for verifying transactions and maintaining the network.\nWhen a group of developers creates an upgrade to the Bitcoin software, all (or a vast majority of) those computers must install the new software. This is called \"consensus.\"\nBut miners might not agree to update their software. Why? Because a change to the protocol might affect the rules of mining competition, favoring some types of mining hardware while negatively affecting others. In that case, those who stand to lose will probably refrain from installing the software, unless there’s already a strong consensus behind the update.\nIf a specific update doesn’t win consensus and a considerable number of miners don’t agree to install the new version of the Bitcoin protocol, the software \"forks.\" This means there will exist two concurrent versions of the software and, depending on how fundamental the differences between the two versions of the Bitcoin software are, the result might be a “soft fork” or a “hard fork.” What’s the difference between a \"soft\" and a “hard” fork?\nIf a new version of the Bitcoin protocol is backward-compatible, then the fork that results from the lack of consensus is a \"soft fork.\" This means that miners running both versions of the software will be able to continue mining bitcoins on the same blockchain.\nBlockchain is the distributed ledger where Bitcoin transactions are registered. Every few minutes, a number of new transactions that miners have confirmed are compiled into a block and registered on the blockchain, which is then replicated across all the computers in the Bitcoin network (read here and here for more on the process).\nAn example of a soft fork is the original SegWit , which came into effect last August. In a nutshell, SegWit changed the way transactions were packed into each block, but it did it in a way that allowed nodes running the old software to continue processing them.\nAlternatively, if the new version of the software is not compatible with the previous one, the resulting fork will be a \"hard fork.\"\nThe developers of a hard fork update usually specify a block number at which it will become activated, at which point a new blockchain and a new cryptocurrency are created. From that point on, the miners running the different version of the software will be registering transactions on their separate blockchains.\nAn example of a hard fork is the Bitcoin Cash fork , which took effect last August and created the new BCH cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Cash changed the blockchain block size from 1 MB to 8 MB to accommodate for more transactions per block, which means its blocks could no longer be registered on the original Bitcoin blockchain and needed their own separate version of the ledger. What you need to know about the extra hard fork money\nAs mentioned in the previous section, a hard fork creates a new cryptocurrency. What this means is that, for instance, when the Bitcoin Cash hard fork occurred, whoever held bitcoins received an equal amount of BCH on the new blockchain.\nHard forks will, as many like to publicize, double your cryptocurrencies and give you free money, which is true. That’s why there’s usually a hype and rush to buy b itcoins before a hard fork occurs, which sends bitcoin prices soaring.\nBut things are not that simple. When a hard fork splits the Bitcoin blockchain, it reduces its mining power. It will also split the community, which means demand for each individual coin will become lower. If the mining power diminishes too much, transactions will take longer to confirm, which can in-turn dissuade users from using that specific coin.\nAll these parameters can negatively impact the prices of a coin, and if transactions become too slow, the cryptocurrency might die altogether.\nIn fact, part of the reason that the Segwit2x hard fork (mentioned at the beginning of this article) was called off was that a lack of consensus threatened to create two very weak currencies that would endanger the very existence of all Bitcoin versions .\nBottom line: While after a hard fork your bitcoins might double in number, there’s a chance their collective value won’t be worth a lot more, and might even be worth less. And as the Bitcoin community grows, and individuals and organizations with differing (and often conflicting) goals enter the fray, many more forks will probably lie ahead.

If the mining power diminishes too much, transactions will take longer to confirm, which can in-turn dissuade users from using that specific coin.\nAll these parameters can negatively impact the prices of a coin, and if transactions become too slow, the cryptocurrency might die altogether.\nIn fact, part of the reason that the Segwit2x hard fork (mentioned at the beginning of this article) was called off was that a lack of consensus threatened to create two very weak currencies that would endanger the very existence of all Bitcoin versions .\nBottom line: While after a hard fork your bitcoins might double in number, there’s a chance their collective value won’t be worth a lot more, and might even be worth less. And as the Bitcoin community grows, and individuals and organizations with differing (and often conflicting) goals enter the fray, many more forks will probably lie ahead.\nTags Technology Internet", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "https://amity.io/blog/how-to-solve-bitcoin-mining-insane-power-consumption-problem", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://fortune.com/2017/08/11/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork-price-date-why/", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://fortune.com/2017/11/08/bitcoin-price-segwit2x/", "https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2017/09/13/fork-segwit-everything-need-know-bitcoin-scaling/", "https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-November/000685.html", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#", "https://www.coindesk.com/explainer-what-is-segwit2x-and-what-does-it-mean-for-bitcoin/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/cbovaird/2018/04/19/bitcoin-cash-approaches-1000-ahead-of-hard-fork/#7b6425102aeb", "https://amity.io/blog/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/10/23/will-this-battle-for-the-soul-of-bitcoin-destroy-it/#590c64be3d3c", "https://amity.io/blog/when-there-are-no-bitcoins-left-to-mine-what-happens", "https://safehaven.com/article/45475/Bitcoin-Forks-Explained", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T19:26:17.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "31c63c11dece5c1b4e85d9d48ab9e774d84a8a4c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_TeNkHpyovK1kpBXSJkx117aBnEJ.AXOnWQ8.oZPjcuR9RR.BIOHNG0A5nelj2LLPKjj4CJgPbIt8AK8hvTsEa3FqTDIisIZO6Hy3mDS.24A--", "site_full": "www.rttnews.com", "site": "rttnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.rttnews.com/RSS/EconomicNews.xml", "site_categories": ["media", "education"], "section_title": "RTT - Economic News", "title": "Bitcoin Sheds More Weight, Faces Drop To $7000", "title_full": "Bitcoin Sheds More Weight, Faces Drop To $7000", "published": "2018-05-24T19:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.rttnews.com/articleimages/ustopstories/2018/may/bitcoin-drop-052418-lt.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "31c63c11dece5c1b4e85d9d48ab9e774d84a8a4c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_TeNkHpyovK1kpBXSJkx117aBnEJ.AXOnWQ8.oZPjcuR9RR.BIOHNG0A5nelj2LLPKjj4CJgPbIt8AK8hvTsEa3FqTDIisIZO6Hy3mDS.24A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-24T19:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Sheds More Weight, Faces Drop To $7000", "text": "Bitcoin Sheds More Weight, Faces Drop To $7000 5/24/2018 12:16 PM ET\nBitcoin continued to lose its weight for the fourth consecutive day this week, pointing to the possibility of extending the slide further to $7,000 in the next 24 hours.\nThe most popular Cryptocurrency opened at $7,650 on Thursday, and was trading for $7272 at a later stage on Bitfinex - its lowest point since April 12. Although it recovered slightly within hours, BTC lost its value by 5 percent in the last 24 hours. It is the latest in a series of ups and downs for Bitcoin in recent months.\nThe bullish-to-bearish trend change that was evident in recent days, and relative strength index are signaling scope for further losses, according to crypto market experts. They see a possible drop to the $7,000 mark in the next 24 hours if not breaking down further.\nBTC has been showing a downward trend and touched a low of 6620 on April 6. Since then, the Bitcoin market saw a mid-term recovery, and rose by more than a third in value. Bitcoin jumped above $9,000 in late April, and it continued to climb up to nearly $10,000 on May 6.\nThen started the next phase of descent, reflecting a 20 percent drop over the past two weeks.\nCryptocurrency markets had a torrid day on Thursday as all the other major currencies continued to sink by considerable margins. Ethereum, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash suffered a huge decline. The cryptocurrency space is estimated to have shed about $16 billion off its total market cap, and now sits at the $328 billion mark.\nby Joji Xavier RTTNews Staff Writer\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "et bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T19:55:31.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "58f2b41ebe39d0a902aa75685c9ba5f51382362b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScP1WpxThAb4xzg.FXuv_Q1WWB4PtUxg.TpNqmyhT6r5zTPySZ7A_FCyGRhhOxqiZfPVhTYOShU5", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Buying a Home With Bitcoin Is 'Great Common Sense,' According to Shark Tank's Barbara Corcoran", "title_full": "Buying a Home With Bitcoin Is 'Great Common Sense,' According to Shark Tank's Barbara Corcoran", "published": "2018-05-24T19:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "58f2b41ebe39d0a902aa75685c9ba5f51382362b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScP1WpxThAb4xzg.FXuv_Q1WWB4PtUxg.TpNqmyhT6r5zTPySZ7A_FCyGRhhOxqiZfPVhTYOShU5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-24T19:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Buying a Home With Bitcoin Is 'Great Common Sense,' According to Shark Tank's Barbara Corcoran", "text": "Buying a Home With Bitcoin Is 'Great Common Sense,' According to Shark Tank's Barbara Corcoran\n/u/VY99\nsubmitted by /u/VY99\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barbara corcoran", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "shark tank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T19:15:02.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ce6da4087da0bb49c8b01280c97a4c727e210616", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhLgmZLbrEAI7anHIT6WcsgQ-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-24T19:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ce6da4087da0bb49c8b01280c97a4c727e210616", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhLgmZLbrEAI7anHIT6WcsgQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-24T19:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 24, 2018 NEWS Bitcoin value gyrates amid report of Department of Justice manipulation investigation USA TODAY Bitcoin prices see-sawed Thursday following a report that the Department of Justice and the nation's top commodities regulator are investigating ...

US begins investigation May 24, 2018 237\nThe United States Department of Justice has initiated a preliminary investigation into unknown persons. Accordingly, one wants to examine a possible price manipulation in Bitcoin trading. The practices suspected behind the moves in the Bitcoin course are called spoofing and washing.\nThere is something wrong!? If you look at the course of the Bitcoin course and other cryptocurrencies partially, it is sometimes quite close to pull the Aluhut. The courses fall within a short time, only to then rise again quickly. The conclusion of many: Someone manipulates the prices.\nThis question is now being addressed by the US Department of Justice. As Bloomberg reports, the investigation focuses on possible illegal practices in bitcoin trading. The practices in question are therefore primarily the faking of orders and the flooding of the market to influence the price. Evidently, the Department of Justice has statements from four people already involved in such practices.\nPrice manipulation through spoofing and washing\nIn addition, the Ministry of Justice is working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to investigate these possible manipulations of the Bitcoin rate. The practices that the two authorities fear are called spoofing and washing. When spoofing, traders place certain buy or sell orders until the price moves in the desired direction. Only to cancel them again. In the case of Washing, traders deal with themselves in order to manipulate prices through supply and demand. For the time being, we want to examine the cryptocurrencies of Ethereum and Bitcoin.\nHere it is above all the unregulated situation of the market, which seduces to such tactics:\n“Manipulative trading such as washing and spoofing is monitored very little here. It’s very easy to spoof this market “,\nsays John Griffin, Professor of the University of Texas.\nFurther details are not known yet.

This can be done for instance by occupying foreign countries and by that opening up new markets to the companies that are essential to the economy. Or this can be done by loose regulations with the derivatives markets, that will create wealth out of thin air and high hopes.\nCan it be that pumping of the crypto markets is just another financial shenanigan created to keep the old system afloat?\nThey are creating new wealth out of nothing with cryptos, just like with derivatives. The made up wealth that is created, is actually backing the value of fiat. This would make sense why regulators seem so blind on goxdollars and tether.\nthis is actually a good notion. if you think about it, to buy coins you still need fiats and you actually convert crypto currencies to fiat so there is a direct correlation to the two. but then again, our goal is to have crypto currency used around the globe in exchange for goods and services. cutting off the middleman (fiat) with projects and business that accept crypto currencies will be the downfall of fiat in the future.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T17:07:01.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3297bd5029741d8dd0204cc88c90b5ddabdad899", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCA3M_123tl5.wuprp7KtCn7umZU4pOlEeNlmtBUfiBV9cqny.a2pz4v.5x4fuJam6rDDVJbo4Soc2MOyTH5ZqWy.2pOM3ZgNYGCId.7Oxsrdw--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencies/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "CryptoCurrencies", "title": "Tech Giant GMO to Roll Out World's First 7nm Bitcoin Miner", "title_full": "Tech Giant GMO to Roll Out World's First 7nm Bitcoin Miner : CryptoCurrencies", "published": "2018-05-24T19:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.024, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3297bd5029741d8dd0204cc88c90b5ddabdad899", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCA3M_123tl5.wuprp7KtCn7umZU4pOlEeNlmtBUfiBV9cqny.a2pz4v.5x4fuJam6rDDVJbo4Soc2MOyTH5ZqWy.2pOM3ZgNYGCId.7Oxsrdw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "DedMozai", "published": "2018-05-24T19:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Tech Giant GMO to Roll Out World's First 7nm Bitcoin Miner", "text": "submitted by /u/DedMozai\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://telegra.ph/Tech-Giant-GMO-to-Roll-Out-Worlds-First-7nm-Bitcoin-Miner-05-24-2"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T14:50:40.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b02b5c5c8e90e5f28cbf2cb58bdae7ecfad642d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgz6tqUIJgu8Pt1lxiG2bCnz8LJ5PN.H1SE8lxgIq2ge5cg6NKkSi1HevU0evxOL8jnVS23QAgXzmmyQyIft7IJAwJrblR7chssZxaopmql44cfhdLv_uMVAGycqu1JiMW0-", "site_full": "fortune.com", "site": "fortune.com", "site_section": "http://fortune.com/", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Fortune - Fortune 500 Daily &amp; Breaking Business News", "title": "Bitcoin Slips As News Emerges of Federal Probe Into Price Manipulation", "title_full": "Bitcoin Slips As News Emerges of Federal Probe Into Price Manipulation | Fortune", "published": "2018-05-24T19:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/gettyimages-507405820.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1196, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 37, "comments": 0, "shares": 37}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b02b5c5c8e90e5f28cbf2cb58bdae7ecfad642d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgz6tqUIJgu8Pt1lxiG2bCnz8LJ5PN.H1SE8lxgIq2ge5cg6NKkSi1HevU0evxOL8jnVS23QAgXzmmyQyIft7IJAwJrblR7chssZxaopmql44cfhdLv_uMVAGycqu1JiMW0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "David Meyer", "published": "2018-05-24T19:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Slips As News Emerges of Federal Probe Into Price Manipulation", "text": "By David Meyer May 24, 2018\nBitcoin’s price fell by more than 3% on Thursday morning following the news of a U.S. Justice Department probe into price manipulation in cryptocurrency markets.\nThe investigation was revealed in a Bloomberg piece that said federal prosecutors were working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on the private review.\nThe investigation is reportedly focused on the possibility that some may be employing tactics such as flooding markets with fake orders, in order to manipulate prices.\nIt is certainly the case that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are frequently subject to wild swings that are not easily explained, so this might be why. It may also be true that not all exchanges implement strict controls to spot and stop this sort of cheating.\nBitcoin, currently at a price of just $7,380 (down 6.4% in the last 24 hours’ trading), almost hit $20,000 late last year. The subsequent tumbles in its price were largely precipitated by crackdowns on exchanges.\nChina took the most drastic steps , first by banning initial coin offerings—a form of fund-raising involving the issuance of cryptocurrency tokens—and then by banning exchanges outright. New exchange regulations in South Korea and Japan also caused drops in Bitcoin’s price.\nThe New York attorney general last month launched an initial probe into the measures that exchanges are taking to protect customers and provide transparency in their operations.

On April 5, India’s Central Bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) made a big move in the ongoing global regulatory push on cryptocurrencies as it decided to no longer provide services to any person or business that deals with cryptocurrencies.\nSince then, there has been a battle building up, with the latest skirmish set for July 20 - the Supreme Court of India’s next hearing date for the latest petitions against the bank’s decisions.\nThis decision followed confrontation between banks and Bitcoiners, and also came off the back of the Indian government claiming that “ Bitcoin is a ‘ponzi scheme ”, and that it lacks intrinsic value .\nMany commentators felt this was not a ban in the conventional Chinese sense , because the Indian government also announced that they would support blockchain and even look into potentially launching their own cryptocurrency.\nHowever, as time has gone on, those involved in cryptocurrency in India have felt the pinch of the RBI’s decision to cut ties with them. It has led to a lot of pushback and even court cases amidst crypto businesses closing.\nIndia’s relationship with Bitcoin is rocky at best, but also confusing and convoluted, and well worth examining as so much has happened in just the past few months. Bitcoin and blockchain in review\nIndia had a very productive 2017 in terms of the growth, adoption, and acceptance of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.\nOne of India’s leading trade associations, ASSOCHAM, held a global summit on Bitcoin and blockchain in March 2017.\nIn May 2017, the demand for Bitcoin grew exponentially and abruptly, so much that India’s largest exchanges had to put a limit on Bitcoin purchases due to lack of supply.\nIn June, Zebpay, one of India’s leading Bitcoin exchanges established back in 2012, became the seventh most popular app in the finance category on India’s Apple app store, even higher than the apps of many national banks.\nIn October, it was reported that the major Bitcoin exchanges in India were attracting more than 200,000 new users every month .\nThis was all going on with negative rumbling from the RBI already in the background, as it was issuing warnings throughout the year cautioning people about buying Bitcoin. The rumbling gets louder\nWhile there was huge growth and interest from individuals and companies in cryptocurrency and blockchain, the RBI was mostly unswayed, and in the government remained similarly unimpressed.\nIn the hopes of deterring buyers, India’s Ministry of Finance called Bitcoin a ponzi scheme and said it had no intrinsic value, but this was announced only a few days after Bitcoin topped a high of $20,000 , and mostly fell on deaf ears.\nBut those warnings started turning into actions as the banking sector took tangible steps to try to slow down Bitcoin’s growth and progress. Banks dig in their heels\nOn January 21, 2018, it was reported that a number of major banks in India had suspended or greatly curtailed functionality on exchange accounts.\nState Bank of India (SBI), Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Yes Bank had all taken strong actions against crypto exchanges, either closing accounts or severely limiting functionality. The reason given was the risk of dubious transactions, according to local reports .\nOn February 14, Citibank India banned its customers from using credit cards to purchase cryptocurrencies. It also took the measure one step further by banning the use of debit cards for crypto purchases, Quartz India reported .\nThe move by the banks, coupled with a negative mention about Bitcoin by finance minister Arun Jaitley during his budget speech, had an impact as Bitcoin businesses started feeling the heat and were unprepared to operate in such a negative climate.\nOn February 28, crypto exchanges BTCXIndia and ETHEXIndia then informed their customers via email that they were stopping trading activities, citing the “stress” on their business caused by governmental actions discouraging crypto.\nThis all led up to the RBI’s big announcement of its ‘ban ’. They explained in their statement that the move was justified by the associated risks that the government had been warning against all this time.\nThus, it has been decided that, effective immediately, entities regulated by RBI shall not deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling VCs. Regulated entities that already provide such services shall exit the relationship within a specified timeframe. Hope remains\nWhile the news was seen as semi-positive since it was not a direct ban on cryptocurrencies, it was still a blow for India’s burgeoning cryptocurrency environment.\nHowever, a day after the ‘ban’ was announced, hope was slightly renewed as the RBI also said that it was considering creating its own cryptocurrency . RBI Deputy Governor B.P. Kanungo had some positive things to say about the technology. He told The Times Of India :\n“Technological innovations, including virtual currencies, have the potential to improve the efficiency and inclusiveness of the financial system. We recognize that the Blockchain technology has potential benefits for the financial sector and we believe that they should be encouraged to be exploited for the benefit of the economy.” A big backlash\nDespite the positivity about the technology and the economic potential cryptocurrencies could offer India, the fact of the matter was that the damage was done, and already the fledgling crypto ecosystem was taking hits as exchanges closed.\nThis triggered a backlash from Indian citizens as well as some big crypto-influencers.\nTim Draper , the well-regarded tech investor, called the RBI’s decision a huge mistake and warned that it would drain India of cryptocurrency experts, which it would clearly need if it did see potential in the technology.\nFurthermore, a petition garnered over 17,000 signatures, urging the RBI to reverse its decision on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. The reason for signing this petition for many was expressed as:\n“It could lead to an increase of irregular cash trading of cryptocurrencies in India. In addition, the ban could take away potential revenue to the government from crypto exchanges, and instigate a crypto market price drop ‘due to the knee jerk reaction in which prices got impacted.’”\nThis unfortunately was not strong enough to sway the RBI’s decision, which then led to sterner measures being taken. Legal intervention\nOn April 22, 2018, the High Court of Delhi reportedly issued a notice to the RBI , the Ministry of Finance, and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council alleging that RBI’s decision to end dealings with crypto businesses violates the constitution.\nHowever, as this issue began to climb up the judicial ladder, it was halted when the Supreme Court of India was called upon. On May 12, the Supreme Court declined to grant an interim injunction against the RBI.\nLater on, the Supreme Court came forward again and said that no petitions could be filed in any High Court of India against the RBI crypto decision. This decision will be in place until July, when the Court will set a hearing date for the existing petition on July 20 . What’s happening on the ground floor?\nFor all the rumbling coming out of India from court battles and petitions to these bans on dealing with crypto, it is always important to see how the news is affecting the crypto-users on the ground floor.\nEvan Luthra, an Indian cryptocurrency investor and entrepreneur, spoke to Cointelegraph about what is going on, and how the government is really just looking to play it safe.\n“What most people need to understand is that the views and opinions of a few people in the government don’t make a law,” Luthra told Cointelegraph. “The Indian government is just trying to play it safe and actually bringing light to the whole industry.”\n“The process taken by the government is not the wrong intention. It is for putting a stop to people who are doing scams and running ponzi schemes. The actions taken will only slow down the process but it cannot stop the adoption. That's the beauty of decentralization, that it cannot be stopped or controlled by any central authority. If people choose to adopt Bitcoin, crypto, or Gladage, or any other token, for example, directly without converting into fiat, it will next leap in the industry.”\n“The government has only put a stop to conversion into fiat but they are actively promoting the technology. Even the Prime Minister is going out in public and explains the benefits of adopting the technology. In the coming days things will get much better even on the regulatory side.”\nLuthra’s point, that the government has good intentions, does make sense. However, their implementation is rubbing people the wrong way in the short term. Still, down the line, when this move has cleared away scams and ponzi schemes, perhaps it will be viewed in a better light. The battle rages\nIt is a baffling situation that the Indian cryprocommunity finds themselves in as their central bank is slowing the progress of Bitcoin, blockchain, and cryptocurrencies in general. The government does not have a positive outlook on crypto, but they are not banning it.\nRather it is being choked out by the banking system which is now under pressure from the community, who is involving the courts. India is fighting internally about the future of cryptocurrency with even the banks admitting that there is a lot of promise in the technology.\nThe next step in India’s battle for cryptocurrency legitimacy will come on July 20, when the courts sit down and look over the new petitions, but until then, the cryptocummunity has to try to survive even with the banking squeeze. ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ :

Wall Street’s biggest Bitcoin bull praised the move as the start of needed regulatory oversight.\nRead more: Bitcoin Manipulation Said to Be Focus of U.S. Criminal Probe\n“Weeding out the bad actors is a good thing, not a bad thing for the health of the market,” Novogratz, who is setting up cryptocurrency merchant bank Galaxy Digital LP, said in a telephone interview. “Plenty of exchanges have these inflated volume numbers to create some sense of excitement around coins,” he said, citing his own experience trying to trade.\n“We welcome any inquiry that serves to foster rules-based marketplaces and deter bad actors,” Winklevoss, president of the Gemini exchange, said in an emailed statement.\n“This is really welcome news ultimately because this means there is adult supervision coming/here,” Tom Lee, of Fundstrat Global Advisors, said in an email.\nThe world’s most valuable digital coin was down less than 1 percent as of 12 p.m. in New York, well off its lows for the day.\nBloomberg News first reported earlier Thursday that the DOJ opened a criminal probe into potential manipulation of the price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, citing four people familiar with the matter. The investigation could shed light on whether reported trading volumes across exchanges are accurate, on whether traders use illegal practices to move prices in their favor and on other market irregularities.\nBitcoin fell as much as 4.3 percent to $7,267 after the news was published. The cryptocurrency market has been under pressure all year as regulators clamped down on the sector, in part because of the concerns raised in the DOJ investigation.\nSpencer Bogart of cryptocurrency hedge fund Blockchain Capital said he wouldn’t be surprised if regulators found cases of fraud, given even the most highly scrutinized markets haven’t been immune to it.\n“I don’t have any first-hand evidence of manipulation of Bitcoin prices but given that even the most highly regulated and most liquid markets in the world (e.g. Libor, FX markets, commodities) have consistently proven to be manipulated, it wouldn’t be a huge surprise,” Bogart said in an email.\nSome market participants have already alleged that crypto manipulation is rampant. Earlier this year trader Sylvain Ribes wrote a post on Medium where he said he believes more than $3 billion of all cryptoassets’ volume is fabricated, after analyzing exchanges’ order books. Last year, a blogger flagged the actions of “Spoofy,” a nickname for a trader or group of traders who have allegedly placed $1 million orders without executing them.\nTrading volume for the total cryptocurrency market was at around $20 billion today, with Bitcoin accounting for about 30 percent of that, according to CoinMarketCap.\nThemis Trading LLC partner and co-head of equity trading Joseph Saluzzi said there should be cross-market surveillance in crypto markets to stop these practices.\n“The issue is that there is no one regulator monitoring the underlying exchanges and therefore there is no way to know if manipulation like spoofing is going on,” Saluzzi said in an email. “Some exchanges will say that they have information sharing agreements with each other, but again this is not enough to ensure that manipulation is not occurring. As we have seen in the equity market, exchanges are for-profit and can not be trusted to police themselves.”\n— With assistance by Lily Katz, and Olga Kharif LISTEN TO ARTICLE ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2018-05-24%2Fnovogratz-says-doj-bitcoin-manipulation-probe-a-good-thing", "https://bloom.bg/dg-ws-core-bcom-a1", "https://twitter.com/share?text=Novogratz%20says%20DOJ%20Bitcoin%20manipulation%20probe%20a%20%22good%20thing%22&via=markets&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2018-05-24%2Fnovogratz-says-doj-bitcoin-manipulation-probe-a-good-thing", "https://hackernoon.com/meet-spoofy-how-a-single-entity-dominates-the-price-of-bitcoin-39c711d28eb4", "https://assets.bwbx.io/s3/readings/P98PWR6TTDS31527180413662.mp3", "https://medium.com/@sylvainartplayribes/chasing-fake-volume-a-crypto-plague-ea1a3c1e0b5e"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "novogratz", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "winklevoss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cameron winklevoss", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "doj", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "focus of u.s. criminal probe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "galaxy digital lp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T19:52:45.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f7bb19b713a953a7badc540c9a3ab51ac835a6c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4ZKcsQdDPmnoJYfo1enrtK0ar_pGjhTuKTI53pUvo1jaogJhlt0IvmVhP2jAgMQRIOKazyPrYl9y.S2Vh9s6q0FX4Bfin9DhHbCOiyJuFNo_KcwrYp0Sx3uz0EUx2_zjTPT2qzd_WPxXUdyc2WoikUFGfwSM6O6Zo5rsmCsiKXQ--", "site_full": "www.crowdfundinsider.com", "site": "crowdfundinsider.com", "site_section": "http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "investors_and_patents", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "Crowdfund Insider", "title": "Crypto Trading Platform Caspian Announces Partnership With Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange", "title_full": "Crypto Trading Platform Caspian Announces Partnership With Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange", "published": "2018-05-24T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.crowdfundinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bitcoin-Currency-Coins-Money.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53446, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f7bb19b713a953a7badc540c9a3ab51ac835a6c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4ZKcsQdDPmnoJYfo1enrtK0ar_pGjhTuKTI53pUvo1jaogJhlt0IvmVhP2jAgMQRIOKazyPrYl9y.S2Vh9s6q0FX4Bfin9DhHbCOiyJuFNo_KcwrYp0Sx3uz0EUx2_zjTPT2qzd_WPxXUdyc2WoikUFGfwSM6O6Zo5rsmCsiKXQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Samantha Hurst", "published": "2018-05-24T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Crypto Trading Platform Caspian Announces Partnership With Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange", "text": "By Samantha Hurst\nCaspian , the full-stack crypto trading, portfolio and risk management platform for institutional and sophisticated investors, announced on Thursday it has formed a partnership with BitMEX (Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange) a bitcoin peer-to-peer trading platform, in order to further support and facilitate institutional investment’s move into crypto trading.\nAccording to Caspian, BitMEX offers 100 times leveraged trading of Bitcoin, Bitcoin futures, and swaps, along with altcoin futures for Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ripple, and 300% more Bitcoin/USD liquidity than any other platform.

According to Bloomberg , four unnamed sources revealed that federal prosecutors are worried that the market is overrun with misconduct. Fears of Rampant Spoofing and Wash Trading in Bitcoin\nThe two major points of inquiry for the probe are spoofing and wash trading. Spoofing refers to flooding the market with fake orders, tricking other traders in the process while wash trading involves creating false volumes that overvalue the market. Both of these malpractices drive up the prices in the direction desired by the manipulators.\nFor many years, financial regulators have worked hard to eliminate these illicit trading practices from the mainstream markets. However, in the predominantly Wild West crypto scene, it appears spoofing and wash trading is (allegedly) having the run of the mill.\nThus, the DOJ is partnering with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to investigate the matter. The CFTC only has oversight powers on crypto derivatives. However, the Commission has the authority to act if it spots fraud in the actual markets where digital coins are traded. Examining the Evidence for Crypto Price Manipulation\nIn 2017, a crypto blogger known as Bitfinex’ed presented evidence that a trader or group of traders known as “spoofy” was manipulating the price of Bitcoin. According to the blogger, Bitfinex was the platform of choice for the price manipulators.\nThe crypto market is mostly unregulated, making price manipulation a possibility. Commenting on the lack of regulation in the market, John Griffin, a professor of finance at the University of Texas, said :\nThere’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading. It would be easy to spoof this [the cryptocurrency] market. Stemming the Tide of Bitcoin Trading Malpractices\nSince the crypto boom of 2017, the SEC has stepped up efforts to sanitize the industry, investigating dozens of ICO campaigns. The Commission recently created a fake ICO project to demonstrate how easy it is to defraud investors in the crypto space.\nCrypto exchange platforms are even warming up to the reality of curtailing the activities of price manipulators. In April, Gemini announced a partnership with Nasdaq to fight cryptocurrency trading fraud on its platform.\nNeither the DOJ nor the CFTC provided any confirmation of the investigation as at the time of writing this article\nDo you agree that there is rampant spoofing and wash trading in the cryptocurrency market?

That in itself is not really surprising, given the ongoing declines in the Bitcoin world. Even so, it remains to be seen how long this dip will last. eToro UK Managing Director Iqbal Gandham certainly has some interesting opinions in this regard. Can the Bitcoin Cash Price Recover Quickly? When the going gets tough in the cryptocurrency world, panic selling becomes a very tangible trend. This has been a big problem for as long as people can remember, and it will not necessarily improve anytime soon. In the case of the Bitcoin Cash price , it is evident panic selling is helping to push the price below $1,000 and keeping it there. That situation may come to change in the near future, though. The most recent 6.48% Bitcoin Cash price decline comes at a rather unfortunate time. Some interesting developments are taking place to fund the future development of this altcoin. Even so, it isn’t sufficient to keep the Bitcoin Cash price afloat around the $1,300 mark. It is possible this trend reserves at some point. eToro UK Managing Director Iqbal Gandham thinks otherwise. He explains the situation as follows: “Though it recently upgraded its blockchain protocol, it seems that Bitcoin Cash has yet to reassure the crypto community that it can provide a more stable framework for transactions and that it really is ‘Bitcoin’. For over a year Bitcoin Cash has been fighting the battle to become the ‘default’ Bitcoin, a battle which traditionalists are not keen to lose. This lack of clarity, has repeatedly called into question the authenticity of Bitcoin Cash, and until that is resolved the direction of price movement will always carry an air of uncertainty.” Despite the $805.31m in 24-hour trading volume over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin Cash holders and buyers are fighting a losing battle, by the look of things. If this bearish pressure doesn’t relent sooner rather than later, it is not unlikely the Bitcoin Cash price will dip to $900 and perhaps even lower. While not catastrophic, it would certainly put things in a very different perspective altogether. The majority of trading volume originates from OKEx, which has been an important trading platform for various altcoins. Bitfinex and Huobi are competing for second place, although GDAX isn’t too far behind in this regard. HitBTC is in fifth place, which may come as a big surprise to a lot of people. Even so, two fiat currency pairs in the five is pretty significant for Bitcoin Cash, although the USDT pairs are clearly in the lead right now. For the time being, it remains to be seen how the Bitcoin Cash price will evolve in the near future. As of right now, things are not looking all that promising, but the volatility of cryptocurrency can easily work both ways. Sooner or later, things will improve for the different cryptocurrencies, but for now, it doesn’t appear that change will occur in the coming days or weeks.

Everything is in the deep red, with some currencies noting rather spectacular losses. The biggest concern is the Bitcoin price, which has effectively dropped below $7,500 for the first time in five weeks. The Bitcoin Price is Getting Battered It is evident things are not going according to plan as far as the Bitcoin price is concerned. While there has been some interesting momentum in early March and throughout late April and early May, things have fallen apart once again. More specifically, the Bitcoin price has roped below $7,500 for the first time since April 12th. This is not a positive development by any means. While the bears are thoroughly enjoying this new trend, the rest of the cryptocurrency community isn’t necessarily happy with this current development, for obvious reasons. At this point, it seems highly unlikely the Bitcoin price will hit $10,000 anytime soon, even though it successfully did so in late March. Due to this latest Bitcoin price decline of 5.76%, it remains to be seen where the bottom lies exactly. Some people speculate the Bitcoin price will drop to $5,500 or even lower in the coming days, although it remains to be seen whether or not this can effectively be reached. Most cryptocurrency holders don’t hope to see such a low Bitcoin price in the near future, but it is evident there isn’t much that can be done about this current trend. Even though the Bitcoin trading volume isn’t declining all that much lately, it seems the sellers are in full control of this market for quite some time to come. With $6.33bn in trades over the past 24 hours, the sellers vastly outweigh the number of buyers. It is still possible this situation will turn around in the coming days and weeks, but for now, the momentum will remain bearish. Looking over the exchanges ranked by Bitcoin trading volume, Bitfinex is clearly in the lead right now. Binance is not that far behind with its USDT pair OKEx closes out the top three with another USDT market. Huobi and bitFlyer are also in the top five, which means there are two fiat currency pairs and three USDT markets in this top five. An interesting mix, although not something that will improve the Bitcoin price anytime soon. It is evident volatility remains the name of the game in the world of cryptocurrency. With the Bitcoin price in the dirt, all alternative currencies are suffering as well. It will be interesting to see how things evolve in this regard. With all of the panic selling taking place right now, there will be a lot more losses to contend with moving forward, for obvious reasons.

Also Read: Indian Government Considering 18% Retroactive Tax on Crypto Trading, Mining Small Banks Love Bitcoin With major US banks too afraid to serve all American bitcoin users and businesses, smaller banks are picking up the slack and making a fortune doing so. New York-based Metropolitan Bank for example was able to build up deposits from crypto business without building costly new branches, and more than triple yearly fee income in 2017, largely from crypto transactions. And San Diego-based Silvergate Bank nearly doubled its assets to $1.9 billion in 2017, mainly because of 250 cryptocurrency-related businesses the privately-held company now serves. Silvergate Chief Executive Alan Lane told to the Wall Street Journal that “At what point as a banker do you pull your head out of the sand? Every banker should be learning about the technology.” Deutsche Börse “Deep at Work” With Bitcoin Deutsche Börse AG, which operates the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, is actively examining its options for launching cryptocurrency derivatives. This was revealed in London on Wednesday by Jeffrey Tessler, CEO of the post-trade services provider owned by Deutsche Börse Clearstream and member of the group’s executive board, responsible for Clients, Products & Core Markets, at an event organized by the Association for Financial Markets in Europe. “Before we move forward with anything like Bitcoin we want to make sure we understand the underlying transaction which isn’t the easiest thing to do,” explained Tessler. “We are deep at work with it,” however, “not at the same stage” [as the CME]. “We want to understand the volatility and make sure clients are in line and make sure regulators are in line.” Huobi Pro Launches Crypto Market Index Huobi Pro has announced on Wednesday the launch of a new benchmark called the Huobi Main Force Index. The company explains that it will select 10 top traded digital assets with high market capitalization and strong liquidity that reflect the market performance of Huobi Pro, in terms of USDT. The assets will be divided into four categories: Coins, Platforms, Applications and Physical Assets tokens, depending on the transaction volume value of the previous quarter. Huobi further states that the main force index will be published by Bloomberg and other communication organizations later on, and users may view the index by logging in on their devices. “The goal here is to provide a complete and organized tool which will help enhance the overall knowledge of the blockchain industry. We are committed to bringing more insights and data so key stakeholders can make the most knowledgeable decisions when it comes to their investments,” said Leon Li, founder and CEO of Huobi Group. US Megabanks Less Safe Than Crypto? Americans now have a new reason to consider moving their money away from big banks to cryptocurrencies – the expected decision by banking regulators to water down the Volcker Rule, which restricts the ability of banks to engage in proprietary trading with depositor funds. This according to the latest analysis by Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratings. They explain that due to the rule changes, banks will now be able to gamble more freely in a scheme that gives them the quick profits but gives depositors the ultimate risks. In contrast, holders of cryptocurrencies are not exposed to those kinds of risks as they can control their money directly with no custody by third parties and no need to trust a central authority. “With this rule change, the authorities will make it easier for megabanks to take big risks with other people’s money. But they are making the change precisely when global debt levels imply record risks,” the authors argue. “In the future, cryptocurrencies will do such a fundamentally better job as a safe depository of funds it’s difficult to envision a world in which this technology does not become a game-changer for money and banking.” What do you think about today’s news updates?

IJ works to slow the growth of government in the US in all its forms: economic freedom, education, private property, freedom of speech, not to mention amicus briefs to the Supreme Court. Now bitcoiners can help support IJ’s valuable work, a real world use case, through Bitpay and bitcoin cash (BCH).\nAlso read: Roger Ver and Ryan X. Charles Reveal the Future of Cash\nFreedom, a Use Case for Bitcoin Cash This year started very well for The Institute for Justice, a national law firm taking the terribly unsexy cases where government encroachment upon average folk goes largely unnoticed. The venerable Pineapple Fund donated to “only 58 charities so far selected to receive a grant,” including the IJ. In response to the January notice of receiving a grant, the Institute noted it would use the money to “help us defend and secure the rights of hundreds of thousands of people like those you will read about in this issue of Liberty & Law, protecting them from government abuse and enabling them to live as free and responsible individuals.”\nThe Pineapple Fund was a foundation of sorts lasting less than half a year. Started by a bitcoin core (BTC) whale, it garnered widespread praise in the cryptocurrency ecosystem for promoting the idea at least some of the recent years’ gains ought to be set aside for causes working for a brighter future. And it became yet another connection between crypto and the Institute for Justice.\nA Thirty Year History Meets Money’s Future In fact, the IJ has come to terms with crypto payment provider Bitpay, allowing supporters to donate in bitcoin cash (BCH) as well. The higher fees and lag times of bitcoin core (BTC) made it less hospitable toward microtransactions such as lower-level giving. A hundred bucks worth here, twenty there, were simply eaten alive by transaction costs. A much better match, at the moment, is BCH for those very reasons. And all donations are tax deductible.\nSupporting work of the sort IJ does is something crypto enthusiasts can feel good about. A cursory gloss over the cases during their near 30 year history is proof enough. Eminent domain, whereby governments bully property owners into selling, or worse, under the rubric of the ‘greater good’ are causes rarely heard by other groups. IJ regularly fights them.\nCrypto fans are especially sensitive about the subject of licensing and certification, as they’re often frictions and barriers to entry into the polite, proper economy — something enthusiasts can empathize with. The IJ is a lone advocate in this regard, making sure those who wish to simply offer a nice meal or a haircut are protected from petty bureaucrats. The IJ is also keen on providing support for landmark cases via amicus briefs, as in the case of Carpenter v. United States . The Carpenter case deals with the 4th Amendment violations and may be instrumental towards the pending Ross Ulbricht Supreme Court petition as well.\nFor the BCH Gang, giving to important causes is yet another perk of decentralized cash. Groups such as EatBCH are “collecting bitcoin cash donations for the past few months and have been using the funds to purchase food and feed Venezuelans who are in need of assistance. Nearly every single day for over three months the group’s Twitter handle shows pictures of children and adults getting all kinds of food — and it’s all paid for with bitcoin cash,” these pages reported.

(Reuters/Sergei Karpukhin) Share Joon Ian Wong May 24, 2018\nBitcoin Gold is a fork, or spin-off, of the original cryptocurrency, bitcoin. It shares much of the same code and works in a similar way to bitcoin, with Bitcoin Gold miners contributing computational power to process new transactions. That also means it faces the same vulnerabilities as bitcoin, but without the protections that come from the large, dispersed group of people and organizations whose computers are powering the bitcoin blockchain.\nIn recent days the nightmare scenario for any cryptocurrency is playing out for Bitcoin Gold, as an attacker has taken control of its blockchain and proceeded to defraud cryptocurrency exchanges. All the Bitcoin Gold in circulation is valued at $786 million, according to data provider Coinmarketcap . Blockchains are designed to be decentralized but when an individual or group acting in concert controls the majority of a blockchain’s processing power, they can tamper with transactions and pave the way for fraud. This is known as a 51% attack.\nThe possibility of a 51% attack has been one of the concerns institutions such as banks and tech companies have had over the years about using the blockchain for transactions; some have worried that the Chinese government could at some point endeavor to do that, ordering all of the Chinese bitcoin miners to act in concert. It’s unlikely for bitcoin, but for smaller cryptocurrencies, 51% attacks are a concern, one dramatized on a recent episode of HBO’s series Silicon Valley .\nCryptocurrency miners commit their computer processing power—or hash power—to adding new transactions to a coin’s blockchain. They are rewarded in units of the coin in return. The idea is that these incentives create competition among miners to add more hash power to the chain. The more hash power is added, the better the chances of winning a reward.\nSo what’s a 51% attack? It’s when a single miner controls more than half of the hash power on a particular blockchain. When this happens, that miner can mess with transactions in a bunch of ways, including spending coins twice. This is the “ double-spending problem ,” a puzzle surrounding digital money that has vexed computer scientists for years—and which was solved by bitcoin. But the solution only holds if no single miner controls the majority of the hash power on a chain.\nBitcoin Gold has been experiencing double-spending attacks for at least a week, according to forum posts by Bitcoin Gold director of communications Edward Iskra. Someone has taken control of more than half of Bitcoin Gold’s hash rate and is double-spending coins. Since an attacker must spend coins in his or her possession, and can’t conjure up new coins, the attack is somewhat limited.\nWhat’s happening now, according to Iskra, is that exchanges that automatically accept large deposits are being targeted. The fraudster deposits Bitcoin Gold into an account at an exchange, where coins are traded. Once the exchange credits the Bitcoin Gold to the attacker’s account, the attacker trades those coins for another cryptocurrency and withdraws it. The attacker can repeatedly make deposits of the same Bitcoin Gold it deposited in the first exchange and profit in this way.\nA bunch of other cryptocurrencies have been attacked in similar ways recently. Something called Verge has been hit twice in the last two months, leading to $2.7 million being stolen. The exotic-sounding coins Monacoin and Electroneum have also suffered from 51% attacks not too long ago.\nA 51% attack isn’t likely to hit bitcoin any time soon. Bitcoin Gold has a lot less hash rate securing it than bitcoin. Bitcoin miners are contributing about a million times more processing power than Bitcoin Gold miners at the moment. To give you an idea of how much money would be required to capture more than half of the bitcoin network, in 2013 the processing power on the bitcoin network was already greater than the 500 most powerful supercomputers combined— by eightfold (although it’s worth noting that the comparison isn’t entirely fair, since the specialized chips mining bitcoin can only perform one operation, instead of general computing). In the five years since, bitcoin’s hash rate has increased by about 1.4 million times.

IJ works to slow the growth of government in the US in all its forms: economic freedom, education, private property, freedom of speech, not to mention amicus briefs to the Supreme Court. Now bitcoiners can help support IJ’s valuable work, a real world use case, through Bitpay and bitcoin cash (BCH).\nAlso read: Roger Ver and Ryan X. Charles Reveal the Future of Cash Freedom, a Use Case for Bitcoin Cash\nThis year started very well for The Institute for Justice, a national law firm taking the terribly unsexy cases where government encroachment upon average folk goes largely unnoticed. The venerable Pineapple Fund donated to “only 58 charities so far selected to receive a grant,” including the IJ. In response to the January notice of receiving a grant, the Institute noted it would use the money to “help us defend and secure the rights of hundreds of thousands of people like those you will read about in this issue of Liberty & Law, protecting them from government abuse and enabling them to live as free and responsible individuals.”\nThe Pineapple Fund was a foundation of sorts lasting less than half a year. Started by a bitcoin core (BTC) whale, it garnered widespread praise in the cryptocurrency ecosystem for promoting the idea at least some of the recent years’ gains ought to be set aside for causes working for a brighter future. And it became yet another connection between crypto and the Institute for Justice. A Thirty Year History Meets Money’s Future\nIn fact, the IJ has come to terms with crypto payment provider Bitpay, allowing supporters to donate in bitcoin cash (BCH) as well. The higher fees and lag times of bitcoin core (BTC) made it less hospitable toward microtransactions such as lower-level giving. A hundred bucks worth here, twenty there, were simply eaten alive by transaction costs. A much better match, at the moment, is BCH for those very reasons. And all donations are tax deductible.\nSupporting work of the sort IJ does is something crypto enthusiasts can feel good about. A cursory gloss over the cases during their near 30 year history is proof enough. Eminent domain, whereby governments bully property owners into selling, or worse, under the rubric of the ‘greater good’ are causes rarely heard by other groups. IJ regularly fights them.\nCrypto fans are especially sensitive about the subject of licensing and certification, as they’re often frictions and barriers to entry into the polite, proper economy — something enthusiasts can empathize with. The IJ is a lone advocate in this regard, making sure those who wish to simply offer a nice meal or a haircut are protected from petty bureaucrats. The IJ is also keen on providing support for landmark cases via amicus briefs, as in the case of Carpenter v. United States . The Carpenter case deals with the 4th Amendment violations and may be instrumental towards the pending Ross Ulbricht Supreme Court petition as well.\nFor the BCH Gang, giving to important causes is yet another perk of decentralized cash. Groups such as EatBCH are “collecting bitcoin cash donations for the past few months and have been using the funds to purchase food and feed Venezuelans who are in need of assistance. Nearly every single day for over three months the group’s Twitter handle shows pictures of children and adults getting all kinds of food — and it’s all paid for with bitcoin cash,” these pages reported.

A hundred bucks worth here, twenty there, were simply eaten alive by transaction costs. A much better match, at the moment, is BCH for those very reasons. And all donations are tax deductible.\nSupporting work of the sort IJ does is something crypto enthusiasts can feel good about. A cursory gloss over the cases during their near 30 year history is proof enough. Eminent domain, whereby governments bully property owners into selling, or worse, under the rubric of the ‘greater good’ are causes rarely heard by other groups. IJ regularly fights them.\nCrypto fans are especially sensitive about the subject of licensing and certification, as they’re often frictions and barriers to entry into the polite, proper economy — something enthusiasts can empathize with. The IJ is a lone advocate in this regard, making sure those who wish to simply offer a nice meal or a haircut are protected from petty bureaucrats. The IJ is also keen on providing support for landmark cases via amicus briefs, as in the case of Carpenter v. United States . The Carpenter case deals with the 4th Amendment violations and may be instrumental towards the pending Ross Ulbricht Supreme Court petition as well.\nFor the BCH Gang, giving to important causes is yet another perk of decentralized cash. Groups such as EatBCH are “collecting bitcoin cash donations for the past few months and have been using the funds to purchase food and feed Venezuelans who are in need of assistance. Nearly every single day for over three months the group’s Twitter handle shows pictures of children and adults getting all kinds of food — and it’s all paid for with bitcoin cash,” these pages reported. The Institute for Justice is yet another use case.\nDo you donate crypto? Is it a good way to spread adoption?
