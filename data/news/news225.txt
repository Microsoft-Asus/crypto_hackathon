Part III", "text": "Print to PDF May 18, 2018\nIn my previous articles, I discussed the challenges of using Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (\"UCC\") to create and perfect a security interest in virtual currency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin. I also discussed how Article 8 of the UCC, which governs the ownership and transfer of securities, may provide a better regime to create and perfect a security interest in Bitcoin or other digital assets —if the owner is willing to hold bitcoin indirectly through a third party. I discussed the irony of this since a hallmark of virtual currency is the absence of third-party intermediaries. In this article, I discuss how distributed-ledger technology (i.e., blockchain) and smart contracts have the potential to eliminate the need for third-party intermediaries. With smart contracts and blockchain, it is possible for computer code to serve as the third-party intermediary. Bitcoin and Blockchain\nAs with the previous articles, I use “bitcoin” as a generic term for all virtual currencies. Virtual currencies are electronic representations of value that may not have an equivalent value in a real government-backed currency. They can be used as a payment system, or digital currency, without an intermediary like a bank or credit card company. While virtual currencies can function like real currencies in certain transactions, and certain virtual currencies can be exchanged into real currencies, a virtual currency itself does not have legal tender status. Virtual currency is virtual—there is no bitcoin equivalent to a quarter or dollar bill.\nBitcoin operates on a protocol that uses distributed-ledger technology. This technology often is referred to as blockchain. A blockchain is an immutable distributed ledger that records and verifies all transaction within a specific network. A blockchain can be public or private. A blockchain eliminates the need for intermediaries such as banks. Unlike a dollar, which is interchangeable, each bitcoin is unique. The bitcoin public blockchain records all bitcoin transactions to prevent someone from re-spending the same bitcoin over and over. Smart Contracts\nA smart contract is a computer-coded agreement operating on a blockchain that can encumber digital assets and also verify, monitor, execute, and enforce the agreement. Presently, Ethereum is the most powerful blockchain for smart contracting. To understand a smart contract, consider a functional but not-as-smart contract. Currently, you can set up automatic payments to your creditors from an online bank account. The code is simple: “When the 15th day of each month arrives, send $750 to Bank to pay my mortgage.” The code is not on a blockchain—it rests entirely within your bank’s private network. You can stop these automatic payments at any time if you choose. The bank that holds your mortgage can’t rely on the code to guarantee you will make all your payments on time.\nA smart contract is like that bit of computer code on steroids. Like a busy train station with multiple transfer points, a smart contract resides on a blockchain and can interact with multiple parties and execute multiple tasks and instructions. For example, if a bank wanted to make a loan to a borrower secured by bitcoin or other digital assets, a smart contract could be coded to: Monitor loan origination to ensure compliance with loan-closing conditions Store the digital assets on the blockchain Monitor payments Monitor the value of the digital assets (a critical function given the volatility of bitcoin) Alert the lender if the value of digital assets drop below an agreed-upon amount Trigger maintenance and margin calls Freeze the digital assets Liquidate digital assets upon default consistent with loan terms Terminate security interests in digital assets consistent with loan terms\nIn other words, smart contracts potentially could perform all the functions of a securities intermediary like a clearing corporation, bank, or brokerage, but with no securities intermediary. Smart Contract Efficiencies\nConsider the way banks operate now with loans secured by traditional Article 8 financial assets like stocks and bonds. If the borrower defaults, someone at the bank must contact the securities intermediary, provide them with notice of default and proof of a security interest in the account, and demand they take certain action regarding the collateral. The securities intermediary will need to confirm the bank has a valid security interest in the account and the right to liquidate by reviewing the original control agreement and the account information. Depending on the notice required, the borrower may get involved. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this process. It is routine practice and it generally works. But disputes can arise, especially when documentation is executed improperly or goes missing. Even when there are no documentation issues, the process takes time and requires the involvement of multiple people.\nThe goal of a smart contract would be to eliminate these inefficiencies and have the process occur almost instantaneously. If the borrower defaults, the smart contract could immediately freeze the digital assets, notify the borrower of any right-to-cure requirements, and then—if the borrower failed to cure—liquidate the digital assets and apply them to the loan. A smart contract could accomplish this with minimal involvement of bank personnel. If smart contracts live up their billing—if they are truly smart and error-free—they could provide lenders with greater efficiency and costs savings. Conclusion\nSmart contracts are not some fantasy of the future. They have arrived. Some companies already are using blockchain and smart contracts to pair borrowers who have digital assets with lenders willing to make loans secured, in whole or part, by those digital assets. Many analysts predict a steady increase in the number of people who will own digital assets, be it bitcoin, other virtual currencies, tokens, or CryptoKitties . If you are a traditional lender intrigued about lending against these non-traditional assets, you would be advised to think about and investigate smart contracts and distributed-ledger technology.\n--© 2018 Ward and Smith, P.A.

ICOs are straightforward to construction since of applied sciences just like the ERC20 Token Requirement, which abstracts a lot of the advancement e-Chat process required to supply a new cryptographic possession. Someone has to construct the blockchain, challenge the tokens, and keep some software, though. Coinbase is not ERC-20 friendly, meaning it will probably hold Ether, but not different Ethereum-based tokens. Verify the forex the ICO accepts (Bitcoin or Ethereum). For these reasons, ICOs are described as crowdsales. Bitcoin eliminates the necessity for a trusted central authority to mediate the change of worth—a echat for chato d.e.p credit card company or a central financial institution, say.

Though ICOs are sometimes described as crowdfunding contracts, it is possible that they don't seem to be being provided and offered in compliance with the requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding or with the federal securities laws usually. It's considerably similar to an Preliminary Public Providing (IPO) by which buyers purchase shares of a company. The workers discover on \"Cryptocurrency Choices\" from the Canada Securities Directors (CSA) - an echat umbrella group composed of the nation's regional and native securities watchdogs - provides the clearest indication yet as to how regulatory bodies plan to oversee the rising funding model. In the wake of the SEC's paper final week, and in any respect points before it, the blockchain industry's pondering has over-emphasised complying with rules that govern the initial issuance of tokens, and has neglected to address the influence of the entire laws that apply on a seamless foundation. During the ICO challenge, fanatics and supporters of the agency's effort purchase just a few of the distributed cryptocoins with fiat or virtual foreign money. The concept of funding initiatives with a token on Ethereum turned the blueprint for a brand new and extremely profitable era of crowdfunding initiatives. That tends to occur when an funding like bitcoin BTCUSD, +four.seventy two% surges nearly fourfold over the previous yr. In 2014, the Ethereum undertaking was revealed and its ICO raised $18 million in Bitcoins or $0.40 per Ether.

Nonetheless, while IPOs cope with financiers, ICOs handle advocates which are eager to buy a brand new undertaking very like a crowdfunding event. Traders also needs to be mindful of the potential risks involved in ICOs and investment arrangements involving digital tokens. An Preliminary Coin Offering (ICO) for cryptocurrency is like an Initial Value Offering (IPO) on the stock market, however instead of shopping for inventory in an organization you purchase digital coins. We're also seeing startups like healthcare startup Patientory proving to be break-out cases the place they raised vital funding via token sale as a substitute of the sometimes prolonged conventional fundraising. Coinlancer is a decentralized job market built on Ethereum platform, which empowers burgeoning freelancers and shoppers from throughout the globe. If the cash raised doesn't fulfill the minimum funds wanted by the firm, the money is gone back to the backers and the ICO is deemed to be unsuccessful. Because the identify suggests, a pre-ICO allows investors to buy tokens earlier than the official crowdsale begins. Start-ups world wide have raised more than a billion dollars this year in coin sales. Ethereum is presently the second hottest cryptocurrency after bitcoin. Whereas the SEC is looking into the latest fund raising FAD, it has also come out and introduced that they will begin to focus in ICOs should they become a significant factor of the market for investments and a triggering event takes place, with companies seeking to increase capital by means of ICOs becoming subject to both regulatory and enforcement action. This supplies the secondary market where early investors can promote their tokens. Each ICO is a little bit bit numerous, but normally there is a timeframe for the sale, and a set variety of maximum tokens that will likely be offered. Although there obtain success ICO transactions on document and ICOs are poised to be disruptive progressive tools within the digital era, investors are warned to be cautious as some ICO or crowdsale projects are literally fraudulent.

It has existed since January 1st, 2009, and can be used as payment method in webstores and for other online services. Bitcoin is not, like standard money, made by a central bank. Instead, all bitcoin that exist are created by having computers participate in solving specific mathematical problems. This works as follows: everyone can run special software on his or her computer that participates in solving such a mathematical problem. The owner of the computer that solves the problem receives 25 (newly created) bitcoin as a reward. Because it was the case that in 2014 such a problem is solved every 10 minutes, 25 new bitcoins were created every 10 minutes. On January 1st, there were (approximately) 12.2 million bitcoin.\"\nFollowing from the preceding introduction, students were asked to solve five different mathematical problems. The questions asked that students \"calculate in what year the amount of bitcoin exceeded 18 million,\" \"calculate from which year on the reward will be less than one bitcoin,\" \"determine the maximal amount of bitcoin that can be in circulation,\" in addition to posing addition problems based on the formula used to employed to solve the aforementioned questions.\nNetherlands Warming to Cryptocurrency The test has been offered to students following increasing recognition of cryptocurrency on the part of Holland's institutions.\nDuring March , the Court of Amsterdam determined that bitcoin possesses \"properties of wealth\" whilst adjudicating a civil rights case between an individual seeking repayment from an unfulfilled contract pertaining to bitcoin mining. The court concluded that \"bitcoin represents a value and is transferable\" and \"thus shows characteristics of a property right. A claim for payment in Bitcoin is, therefore, to be regarded as a claim that qualifies for verification.\"\nEarlier this month, the ambassador of the Dutch Blockchain Coalition, Rob van Gijzel, presented a national blockchain research agenda , which had been commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy. The ministry had created a designated committee, TopTeam ICT, tasked with analyzing the potential legal, economic, and ethical implications of distributed ledger technology in the Netherlands.\nDo you think that more schools across the world will seek to integrate themes pertinent to bitcoin into examinations as cryptocurrency adoption grows?

After opening the trading day at 41.84, shares of Bitcoin Group SE traded in a close range. Bitcoin Group SE currently has a total float of shares and on average sees 35,093 shares exchange hands each day. The stock now has a 52-week low of 16.58 and high of 89.45. What Makes The German Commerce?\nWith Germany being considered by the World Trade Organization (WTO) as the biggest exporter of goods worldwide, it is no longer surprising why the German Stock Exchange is one of the most important stock exchanges that make or break global commerce. Companies like Bitcoin Group SE enjoy to be the part of German stock exchange. German Stock Exchange\nThe German Stock Exchange consists of eight stock exchanges located throughout Germany. Bitcoin Group SE were included in one of its units as well. The biggest component of the German Stock Exchange is the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or the FWB Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse, which is owned and operated by Deutsche Börse in Frankfurt. These companies listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange alone represent 80% of the overall market capitalization in Germany. The second largest component of the German Stock Exchange is the Stuttgart Stock Exchange or the Börse Stuttgart. Most financial companies are listed here.\nOther major components of the German Stock Exchange include the Börse Berlin-Bremen, the BÖAG Börsen AG, and the Hamburg Stock Exchange or the Hamburger Börse.\nThe Börse Berlin-Bremen, which is located in Berlin-Charlottenburg, was established in 2003 from the union of the Berlin Stock Exchange and the Börse Bremen.\nMeanwhile, the BÖAG Börsen AG, which oversees trade in Hamburg and Hanover, was established in 1999 from the union of the Hamburg Stock Exchange and the Hanover Stock Exchange. Benchmark Index\nThe major index on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is the German Stock Index, commonly known as Deutsche Aktien Xchange 30 (DAX 30), which is the benchmark equity market index in the country.\nDAX 30 tracks the top 30 companies in terms of market capitalization listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Consequently, DAX 30 is a vital indicator of the health of the German economy and investor sentiment as well. Many investors are interested in such DAX companies as Bitcoin Group SE.\nThe companies tracked by DAX 30 are capped at 10% weight in order to meet its provisions. This also prevents index heavyweight that might result from mergers and acquisitions (M&As).\nDAX 30 has two versions: 1) performance index, which is usually quoted; and 2) price index, which is similar to indices quoted in other countries.\nThe index has a base value of 1,000 since December 1987. DAX 30 indices are calculated using XETRA since June 1999. Since 2006, they are being calculated after every second.\nThe movement on DAX 30 is in 0.50 increments. The margin requirement among most brokers is 2% while the minimum trade size is one index.\nDAX 30 had its longest period of glory days around 2003 to 2007. During that time, it had peaked at €8,105.69. However, after the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, DAX 30 had hit €3,580.\nBeing able to fully recover from the repercussions of the turmoil in the earlier decade, DAX 30 had recorded its all-time high in September 2013 at €8,736.\nThe performance index, on the other hand, had hit the 12,000 mark in March 2015. DAX 30 had attained its all-time high a month later at 12,374.73 after reaching an intraday high of 12,390.75. Its all-time low had been posted in November 1974 at 372.30.\nBecause of the world-renowned success of the DAX 30, more and more investors are betting on the German equity market. They pay close attention to Bitcoin Group SE shares. Existing investors have long been enjoying meaningful returns.

If you belong to this group, that’s okay—today we’re going to explain to you the story behind the world’s first cryptocurrency and where exactly you can get it. No More Double-spending\nAmong other things, bitcoin was created to avoid the problem of double-spending—an issue that often occurs in the standard monetary system. What does this mean? Due to the fact that all transactions are controlled by a central authority in the traditional system, this centralized database is highly vulnerable to fraud. Because of this weakness, it can be easy to take advantage of this flaw and spend the same amount of money more than once.\nBitcoin solves this problem by using peer-to-peer technology (aka blockchain). Here’s how it works: if you decide to buy something using bitcoin, all the users in the network need to verify your transaction first if you want it to be approved. This method is exactly what eliminates the possibility of fraud in your transactions and what makes bitcoin special. Buying and Storing Your Digital Money\nNow that you have an idea of what bitcoin is, you might be wondering where you can obtain it. The answer is on digital currency exchange platforms , which there are plenty of out there at the moment. These platforms are the place where you not only buy and sell your bitcoin, but also store it using the so-called digital (or bitcoin) wallets. Once stored, your money will be completely secured and only accessible by you.\nFor more useful information about bitcoin, blockchain, and digital wallets, check out the infographic found below.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T07:18:07.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "678b9ceffaead76f22d0594baef703a45b35630f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFuayR6ajeoTrpol9mUhayiqb64Iw2chtWSrUqFd.rUkdjQfTzUYZsqz6lM3WPcEvoldytNWDubfVBcyEkfTTGYvMnR.fj.fN7JVw--", "site_full": "www.livetradingnews.com", "site": "livetradingnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.livetradingnews.com/feed\r", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Live Trading News", "title": "The NYSE Bitcoin Index (.NYXBT) Oversold", "title_full": "The NYSE Bitcoin Index (.NYXBT) Oversold", "published": "2018-05-18T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.livetradingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bitcoin2-4.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "678b9ceffaead76f22d0594baef703a45b35630f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFuayR6ajeoTrpol9mUhayiqb64Iw2chtWSrUqFd.rUkdjQfTzUYZsqz6lM3WPcEvoldytNWDubfVBcyEkfTTGYvMnR.fj.fN7JVw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "HEFFX Australia", "published": "2018-05-18T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The NYSE Bitcoin Index (.NYXBT) Oversold", "text": "The NYSE Bitcoin Index (.NYXBT) Oversold\nOverall, the bias in prices is: Downwards.\nBy the way, prices are vulnerable to a correction towards 8,829.86.\nThe projected upper bound is: 9,298.83.\nThe projected lower bound is: 7,255.95.\nThe projected closing price is: 8,277.39.\nCandlesticks\nWARNING: These prices only contain closing prices.

Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators.\nStochastic Oscillator\nOne method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 0.1544. This is an oversold reading. However, a signal is not generated until the Oscillator crosses above 20 The last signal was a sell 7 period(s) ago.\nRelative Strength Index (RSI)\nThe RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 44.06. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 33 period(s) ago.\nCommodity Channel Index (CCI)\nThe CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -126.This is an oversold reading. However, a signal isn’t generated until the indicator crosses above -100. The last signal was a buy 3 period(s) ago.\nMACD\nThe Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line.

As a currency it can be very unique, especially for the fact that there is no physical version of any cryptocurrency . Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency that started it all, and it’s since become synonymous with the word cryptocurrency – but there are other coins, generally called AltCoins, such as Ethereum.\nWhat is Bitcoin?\nThe first cryptocurrency ever, it was originally introduced in 2009 by a programmer, or group of programmers, by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. It was introduced as a peer-to-peer form of transaction, which significantly differs from regular transactions. The technology behind Bitcoin, as well every other cryptocurrency, is called Blockchain, and it’s meant to be used as a decentralized form of exchange. Since traditional exchange relies on specific formal institutions – like banks – to be made, most information that takes behind the scenes is closed off from the public. This is where Blockchain comes into play. With Bitcoin there is no need for third party institutions to regulate every transaction. This technology is responsible for verifying and confirming every transaction.\nWhat is Blockchain?\nA decentralized database that constantly confirms and verifies every type of transaction that takes place in its network, to put it simply, is the Blockchain. Every user that is logged in the network is checked and verified with complex mathematical algorithms. To forego complex explanations, this means that the Blockchain is infallible when to comes to making sure if a transaction is valid, because every part of the network has to verify whether or not a transaction is legitimate. No one person or entity has control over this network, which is why it’s called decentralized, and can be trusted to regulate the transactions.\nCryptocurrency Wallets\nThere are different wallets to store your Bitcoin, all of which can only by accessed by you, and with your own decryption key. They’re stored absolutely safe, and no one will be able to access it without your permission. Online Web Wallet – these are wallets that store your coins online and can be accessed from any device, as long as you correctly login. Examples are CoinBase.com and Blockchain.info Mobile Wallet – This type of wallet can make your own mobile device into a wallet, but it comes with a risk. You might not be able to restore your coins if you lose the device. Hardware Wallet – The most preferred type of wallet, a hardware wallet is a physical device – like a USB – that’s used to store your cryptocurrency. The coins can then be accessed only with that very device, and it’s considered the safest form to keep Bitcoin in.\nMining\nMining means to discover and solve blocks along the Blockchain, which in the end gives a payment. To mine you have to have your own computer, and most who do, have their setups – which can be costly. There are companies that offer specialized setups if you’re not interested in building your computer made for mining. To mine, your computer has to be actively connected to the Blockchain, and depending on the computer or computers you’re using, you’ll solve blocks in different speeds.\nCryptocurrency might as well be the way transactions are done in the future. For now, while extremely lucrative, it’s still in its early stages. It is very speculative, so it’s not advised to rush because the risk factor of losing an investment is incredibly high.

Titled Bitcoin’s growing energy problem his paper is published in the energy journal Joule .\nThe Bitcoin blockchain uses an algorithm known as Proof of Work (PoW) to achieve its security and distributed consensus. So-called miners are paid in Bitcoin as they verify the agreed state of the ledger. It is this that gobbles up the lion’s share of the energy required to keep the cryptocurrency functioning.\nDe Vries acknowledges the difficulty in estimating the true energy consumption of the Bitcoin blockchain owing uncertainty about to the relative contributions of CPU work, cooling and other uses of electricity, and also the secrecy of Bitcoin mining operations and even of the manufacturers of the specialist machines they use; hard numbers are difficult to come by.\nThe lowest estimate for current energy usage is based on the assumption that the 10,000 nodes in the Bitcoin network are all single, highly efficient, purpose-built machines such as the Antminer S9. In this case, the total electricity consumed would be around 2.55 gigawatts – or a little less than that used by Ireland.\nHowever, most miners are likely to be considerably less efficient than this so 2.55 gigawatts should be considered a lowest-case scenario.\nPredicting future energy use is even more difficult since it will depend on loosely correllated factors such as the price of Bitcoin, efficiency improvements to the application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), electricity prices, the number of new miners, local restrictions and many other issues.\nDe Vries’ economic model matches the marginal costs of Bitcoin mining (electricity consumed by PoW and cooling as well as equipment purchase and depreciation) with Bitcoin earned, reasoning that most miners will not run at a loss. He arrives at a “ballpark figure” of 7.67 gigawatts, a little less than that for the country of Austria. This figure is likely to be reached within a year, and possibly even as soon as the end of 2018, de Vries says.\nThis would represent 0.5 per cent of global electricity usage. If this rate of increase ( doubling or more every 6 months ) continues, as seems likely, Bitcoin’s energy consumption will quickly become completely unsustainable. Bitcoin’s closest crypto rival, Ethereum, is showing a similar rate of increase according to Digiconomist ( a cryptocurrency analysis site founded by de Vries ) , but currently consumes about a third as much power as Bitcoin.\nThe enormous energy consumption of Bitcoin – the first blockchain-based cryptocurrency – has led to some other currencies and decentralised networks looking away from the energy-intensive PoW and towards alternative distributed consensus models such as Proof of Stake (something Ethereum’s developers have said they are working towards), Delegated Proof of Stake (EOS), Proof of Capacity (Burst) or Proof of Resource ( MaidSafe ).\nCryptocurrency miners travel the globe in search of cheap electricity. Iceland has become a popular location because of its cheap geothermal resources, but already miners are using more than the country’s citizens . And last year miners were chartering 747s to fly in the latest high-powered (ASICs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) to stay ahead of the competition.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption", "https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption", "https://gadgetrio.us/category/computing-computers-news/", "https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3014813/cryptocurrency-miners-are-hiring-boeing-747s-to-deliver-gpus", "https://gadgetrio.us/author/admin/", "https://gadgetrio.us/bitcoin-now-uses-as-much-energy-as-ireland-and-could-match-austria-by-end-of-2018/#respond", "http://rdf.data-vocabulary.org/#", "https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(18)30177-6?code=cell-site"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T14:51:32.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ac6f28121d0f32a043e17d3f972a224554db8b17", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywum.GWBkfWypM1VQWFCheKm0768HDFYfcxBG.arf12UNz0lX5tOpWTA--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Friday: UN Backs Crypto-Solar Project in Moldova, Malta Uses Blockchain in Public Transportation", "title_full": "Bitcoin in Brief Friday: UN Backs Crypto-Solar Project in Moldova, Malta Uses Blockchain in Public Transportation", "published": "2018-05-18T14:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ac6f28121d0f32a043e17d3f972a224554db8b17", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywum.GWBkfWypM1VQWFCheKm0768HDFYfcxBG.arf12UNz0lX5tOpWTA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-18T14:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Friday: UN Backs Crypto-Solar Project in Moldova, Malta Uses Blockchain in Public Transportation", "text": "Today's Bitcoin in Brief features several examples of harnessing crypto and blockchain technologies to improve quality of life around the world. The United Nations is involved in a crypto-funded project to power Moldova's Technical University with solar energy. Initiatives in Malta and India will employ blockchain technologies to create more reliable public transportation and land registry systems.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: OECD Explores Cryptocurrencies, Central Asian Powerhouse Calls for UN Crypto Rules\nUN Launches Crypto-Funded Solar Power Project in Moldova The United Nations Development Program ( UNDP ) is launching this year a crypto-funded initiative to power a university in Moldova with solar energy. The project, to be realized in partnership with the South African solar power marketplace Sun Exchange, will allow people to buy solar cells and then lease them to the Technical University in Chisinau, which is one of the largest in the country.\nAccording to a VOA report, the purchases will be made using Solarcoin, a crypto launched by the blockchain startup Electricchain. The idea is to find new sources of finance \"to help buildings go green overnight, in this case with rooftop solar panels,\" said Dumitru Vasilescu, program manager with UNDP in Moldova. \"One of the biggest obstacles to countries investing in renewable energy is the lack of financing, as you often have to wait 10 to 15 years before you get a return on your investment,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation .\nVasilescu added that the university will get a full 1 megawatt of energy installed in the summer as a result of the crowdfunding effort. The owners of the solar cells will in turn receive Solarcoins, as soon as the university produces energy, and will be able to earn about 4% interest on their investments. According to the UNDP representative, there is more than 10,000 square meters of unused rooftop space on public buildings in the country, which could potentially be covered with solar panels.\nMoldova, one of Europe's poorest countries, is heavily dependent on energy imports, mainly from the Russian Federation. Cryptocurrencies have been gaining popularity in the former Soviet republic which is economically and politically on a crossroad between East and West. The local crypto community has recently opened the country's first cryptocurrency exchange and presented a new digital token, both developed locally.\nMalta Uses Blockchain for Better Public Transportation Authorities in Malta, a country maintaining a crypto-friendly regulatory environment, are working on a project to use blockchain to improve the public transportation services. Maltese Minister for Transport and Infrastructure, Ian Borg, has announced a partnership with Omnitude, a multi-enterprise blockchain platform. According to a press release, the deal is part of the nation's blockchain strategy that will see the technology implemented to develop a transport and logistics platform using Omnitude's blockchain middleware technology.\nOn the first stage, the government will work with the company to introduce overall improvements in transport reliability. Omnitude is a tech partner of Formula 1 team Williams Martini Racing and is working to assess the benefits that blockchain can bring to advanced engineering. Their project is said to be the first example of using blockchain in F1.\n\"We believe in Omnitude's blockchain technology and its broad use-cases for the government […] It will improve the quality of life and enhance access to information for Maltese citizens. Blockchain technology is a key part of our overall technology strategy that will transform different sectors,\" Ian Borg said. Earlier this year, Malta became one of the first countries in the world to approve a national strategy on blockchain technology.\nLand Registry in India Made Reliable with Blockchain The potential of the technology underpinning the majority of cryptocurrencies is not left unnoticed in other parts of the world. In India , blockchain will be used to trace transactions in property sales almost in real time. A newly announced project aims to build a land registry using blockchain technology for the Indian city of Panchkula, according to a blog post on the website of the London School of Economics.\nThe people behind the initiative – Alexandru Oprunenco, innovation advisor for the UNDP in Asia, and Chami Akmeemana, CEO of the Blockchain Learning Group – say their small venture is actually a \"big deal\" that represents a \"meaningful and commercially viable solution\" for the region. They point out that in many cities across the developing world land registry systems suffer from inefficiency and corruption. People selling a piece of land are often unsure if they legally own it, even if they have a legitimate sale deed. Potential buyers, on the other hand, are also not sure if the seller owns the plot.\n\"With blockchain we have a chance to fix many of these problems. The solution we are building incorporates many key benefits of the technology, such as an immutable history of transactions, so that no one doubts the authenticity of the records or be able to forge them,\" Oprunenco and Akmeemana explain. Their project is using the Ethereum blockchain.\nThe Central Bank of Libya Says Bitcoin Is Illegal Obviously failing to recognize the potential of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technologies, the central bank of Libya has declared \"virtual currency\" illegal in the country. Those who use it cannot be protected by Libyan law, the financial institution said, quoted by The Libya Observer .\nOn Tuesday, the CBL warned all Libyan citizens and businesses of the \"security perils\" of cryptocurrency, saying that it could be used in crimes, financing terrorism and money laundering – arguments often heard from financial regulators and central banks around the world. According to the notice, any use of virtual currency requires prior permission from the central bank in Tripoli.\nWhat are your thoughts on today's topics in Bitcoin in Brief?

There, you could find out what else the fraudster is doing with that address (very possibly nothing informative, as explained in the other answer).

He helps financial services senior executives, board members, startup operators, hedge funds, and venture investors make strategic decisions about FinTech, Cryptocurrency, and Innovation.\nIn the 21st century, cryptocurrency is very controversial given its new technology which people know very little of but it is really here to stay, says Lex Sokolin.\nIn his expert opinion, he says the underlying technology is really fundamental for the types of companies people are building right now. For any person who is thinking about investing in Bitcoin, the understanding of what Bitcoin refers to is very important. He must understand how the blockchain works and also understand how payments work.\nHe further says an investor must know whether Bitcoin is fulfilling the promise of enabling digital payments. The price is very volatile in the market. Therefore, an investor must not go and fill his whole portfolio with cryptocurrencies but it is a good alternative to add to his general allocations. The total investment in cryptocurrency in the portfolio must be around three to five percent.\nLex Sokolin says:\n“For advisors when you think about cryptocurrencies. Your clients are going to buy Bitcoin whether you like it or not. So you can choose to say that this whole thing will fall apart not get educated on it, not help people but that’s really irresponsible.”\nThe advisors should start understanding the basics of how the blockchain works, understand why there are differences between the cryptocurrencies. For example, what is the difference between a payments coin like Bitcoin and Ethereum which is a smart contracts platform? All these things are different.\nThe advisors have to spend the time to formulate simple answers to the clients’ questions which can better the understanding of the client before investing and give them a logical reason to invest so that they can help the clients make sense of this new technology.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lex sokolin bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lex sokolin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "autonomous research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fintech", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T15:37:35.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1d8d31ac95886332b4dfe3530d375310773f5925", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOo5RFP8QS.zhH5B1lTN1VOyXRAvrsANC2FGcOe1O6hQs7vspuZxDmKtyuuD3q3lowdtcR59yVLxLEB4a1oKmx354sSifc15feShrWnqZvzE.N.Wq59p0bBGLxBEBL.YJqPIqYwbP2m5XA--", "site_full": "sgtalk.org", "site": "sgtalk.org", "site_section": "http://sgtalk.org/mybb/syndication.php?type=atom1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "SG Talk - All Forums", "title": "Bitcoin rally this week fails to materialize as New York conference brings more", "title_full": "Bitcoin rally this week fails to materialize as New York conference brings more", "published": "2018-05-18T14:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://sgtalk.org/mybb/webservice/threadimage/607005.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1d8d31ac95886332b4dfe3530d375310773f5925", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOo5RFP8QS.zhH5B1lTN1VOyXRAvrsANC2FGcOe1O6hQs7vspuZxDmKtyuuD3q3lowdtcR59yVLxLEB4a1oKmx354sSifc15feShrWnqZvzE.N.Wq59p0bBGLxBEBL.YJqPIqYwbP2m5XA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-18T14:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin rally this week fails to materialize as New York conference brings more", "text": "Bitcoin dropped about 10 percent this week despite calls that it would rally on the back of major blockchain conference held in New York City.

Bitcoin is currently quite weaker than expected as for retracement along the process. The bullish momentum which started after breaking above $6,500 was quite comfortable with the gains until the recent bearish pressure took over the market. As the bulls are still quite strong having the bears rejecting off the $8,000 price area currently, certain bullish momentum is expected in the coming days which is expected to push the price higher above $8,500 area. As of the current scenario, the impulsive bullish pressure can only be seen after the break above $9,000 with a daily close which will lead the price all the way towards $10,000 price area in the future. As the price remains above $8,000 with a daily close, the bullish bias is expected to continue.\n*The market analysis posted here is meant to increase your awareness, but not to give instructions to make a trade.

You may think how much is “a lot”? Well, think of it this way, our own electricity consumption in Pakistan is a lot less than what it takes to mine cryptocurrency around the world.\nThe price of bitcoin is not the only thing that soared over time as the energy required to mine cryptocurrency has also reached new heights\nLooking at the current situation, it might not be wrong to say that in the near future the energy consumption required to mine bitcoin would become too expensive for the cryptocurrency to bear profitability for its holder.\nEconomist Alex de Vries told Independent that by 2018, bitcoin mining will use 0.5% of the world’s energy. In a recently published articled called “Bitcoin’s Growing Energy Problem,” Vries reveals that currently, bitcoin mining consumes at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity and in the future, this number will grow to become 7.67 gigawatts in the future which is more than 3.1 gigawatts of energy consumed by Ireland and close to 8.2 gigawatts of energy used by Austria.\nDoes this come as a shock to you? It certainly shouldn’t as people have been comparing the bitcoin mining’s energy consumption to that of different countries for a long period of time.\nPreviously, providing more accurate estimates was not possible owing to the secretive nature of bitcoin mining facilities and their hushed operations which not many people were privy to.\nEarlier this year, Fortune also reported that bitcoin mining now uses more electricity than all the electric cars in the world and in this year, its power demand is expected to more than triple. Why Bitcoin Mining Needs Too Much Energy?\nNow you might be asking, why does it take so much energy to mine bitcoin? Well, producing each new bitcoin requires a person to solve a complex mathematical puzzle through a cryptic process which is performed by not ordinary but high-powered computers.\nThe mining computations are used to verify the bitcoin transactions on a blockchain which is a digital ledger that ensures security which is also energy intensive operation.\nWith this pace of electricity consumption, Bitcoin investors will have to consider energy as a factor of whether the virtual currency provides any profit or not. We can also assume that in the future, bitcoin’s price which is already volatile to different news/events will become vulnerable to energy price fluctuations which can become an even bigger nightmare for investors.

Approximately 200,000 Dutch students are estimated to have taken the OVW exam, a mandatory test for students seeking tertiary education in the Netherlands, which included five bitcoin-themed questions.\nAlso Read: Cryptocurrencies to be Called “Digital Money” in Russia, Tokens – “Digital Rights”\nDutch High School Examinations Feature Bitcoin-Themed Maths Questions According to a rough translation of the examination paper circulating on Reddit , students were given the following question introduction:\n“Bitcoin is a digital currency that only exists online. It has existed since January 1st, 2009, and can be used as payment method in webstores and for other online services. Bitcoin is not, like standard money, made by a central bank. Instead, all bitcoin that exist are created by having computers participate in solving specific mathematical problems. This works as follows: everyone can run special software on his or her computer that participates in solving such a mathematical problem. The owner of the computer that solves the problem receives 25 (newly created) bitcoin as a reward. Because it was the case that in 2014 such a problem is solved every 10 minutes, 25 new bitcoins were created every 10 minutes. On January 1st, there were (approximately) 12.2 million bitcoin.”\nFollowing from the preceding introduction, students were asked to solve five different mathematical problems. The questions asked that students “calculate in what year the amount of bitcoin exceeded 18 million,” “calculate from which year on the reward will be less than one bitcoin,” “determine the maximal amount of bitcoin that can be in circulation,” in addition to posing addition problems based on the formula used to employed to solve the aforementioned questions.\nNetherlands Warming to Cryptocurrency The test has been offered to students following increasing recognition of cryptocurrency on the part of Holland’s institutions.\nDuring March , the Court of Amsterdam determined that bitcoin possesses “properties of wealth” whilst adjudicating a civil rights case between an individual seeking repayment from an unfulfilled contract pertaining to bitcoin mining. The court concluded that “bitcoin represents a value and is transferable” and “thus shows characteristics of a property right. A claim for payment in Bitcoin is, therefore, to be regarded as a claim that qualifies for verification.”\nEarlier this month, the ambassador of the Dutch Blockchain Coalition, Rob van Gijzel, presented a national blockchain research agenda , which had been commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy. The ministry had created a designated committee, TopTeam ICT, tasked with analyzing the potential legal, economic, and ethical implications of distributed ledger technology in the Netherlands.\nDo you think that more schools across the world will seek to integrate themes pertinent to bitcoin into examinations as cryptocurrency adoption grows?

Spectacular price rises and huge amounts of publicity mean that this is an investment that is on many people’s minds. Yet, the first issue that you may come across is that of deciding how to invest in this way. Will you buy into Bitcoin or will you opt to take part in an ICO for a brand new currency? These are very different approaches, but which one is most likely to be a good investment? Ease of Purchase\nIs it easier to buy Bitcoin than to take part in an ICO? The fact is that both of these investments are very simple to get involved with. Anyone can do either of these things with no hassle. You don’t need to be a technology expert or know all about cryptocurrencies already.\nWhen it comes to Bitcoin, the key is to find a reputable, trustworthy place to buy them from. You can do this by looking at options such as eToro, BVC, and CryptoGo. The ratings for these and other exchanges can be seen at BestBitcoinExchange . As for ICOs, these are new companies or products that are being launched. ICO stands for Initial Coin Offering and these are easy to get involved with, although some are restricted to investors from certain countries.\nFor instance, many of them prohibit Americans from taking part. ICO teams tend to communicate with their community over Telegram. Their white paper will typically tell you if you can pay for coins with fiat currency or if it has to be with another cryptocurrency. The Price\nIf you have been following the financial news in the last year or so you will know that Bitcoin has enjoyed an incredible journey. It is now worth so much that most new investors only pay for a fraction of a coin to get started with.\nICOs vary widely in price. However, since they are new offerings they tend to be far cheaper than Bitcoin. If you get involved early on in the process then you may get a handsome discount that lets you buy more tokens for your money. Future Prospects\nOf course, the most important factor in any investment is how likely it is to grow over time. Clearly, there is no guarantee of this happening with any investment, but you will want to do enough research to feel confident of it doing well.\nThere are diverse opinions on what the future holds for Bitcoin. These include Wall Street analyst Tom Lee and venture capitalist Tim Draper predicting massive price increases. At the other end of the scale, Warren Buffet thinks that cryptocurrencies in general will “end badly”.\nIn terms of ICOs, the future prospects really depend upon what the project is like.

I'm asking how they forward the deposit from the deposit address to the address owned by exchange. – ninesalt 6 hours ago Sorry for not answering your question properly, The deposit address IS owned by the exchange, depending on the exchange it may be common to find that the funds you sent to your deposit address are later directly used, together with other user's funds, to pay someone else who you don't know. Though some exchanges may use an extra hop where they send the funds to an address dedicated to pool them, it's important to note that the bitcoin protocol allows spending from many previous outputs at once, so this hop is not requiered and the exchange can merge the funds all while doing the transaction. – Victor 5 hours ago I know its owned by the exchange.

Many Wall Street pros have dismissed the market as a speculative bubble, while Warren Buffett has likened Bitcoin to “rat poison squared.”\nThis week’s losses may have been the result of unmet expectations surrounding Consensus 2018, said Sunny Lu, the chief executive officer of blockchain-based logistics company VeChain Tech and one of the conference speakers.\n“The quality of projects and speakers were not really as good as expected,” Lu said. “I guess people just got disappointed.”\n© 2018 Bloomberg", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text="], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "arthur hayes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "snoop dogg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "blockchain week", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T14:22:22.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e7377435a3ee0e08ca781b390e621110cb47f25a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa7ArbOptpr_6DJJZjL7NtXHfzCbPYKPasgnkwFmyvxay2i1MjqQMNtlPOnU1pWLimvnsIT.Nvmqc10G.i.yTBvg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Is there anywhere I can buy bitcoin in the US with bank or card?

May 17, 2018 by johngrow\nIn addition to conventional trading, mining offers investors a chance to acquire coin for a reduce price then buying it. When you think about a conventional currency like a dollar, if I wish to transact something online, typically I require a bank account, I require a charge card, etc and so on. One of its special attributes that cannot be matched by fiat currency is it is decentralized. Hence, it’s often predicted that it may rise as a big player in the remittance marketplace. Theses transactions are wholly verified and then they’re recorded in what’s referred to as a public transparent ledger. A digital currency is called cryptocurrency. The banking business is not any different. To figure your mining rewards, you can search for cloud mining contracts to outline the precise ROI. Therefore, it is not ideal to locate and settle on a single cloud mining company without proper evaluation and comparison with a few of its other legitimate counterparts. The wallet available from this service is considered a hybrid EWallet.\nEvery significant city on earth has a Bitcoin ATM. As soon as you build trust into hashflare you may also suggest it to friends or loved ones. If a cloud mining provider accepts bitcoins then there’s an excellent chance it’s a scam.

Businesses that operate in the recent Bitcoin economy also delight in a complimentary publicity of their company within the Bitcoin community. The only company that’s legitimate is Genesis-Mining. Before discussing about the advantages of cryptocurrency, you will need to understand alternate coins which are becoming popular on online platforms. Your first step will be to choose an Ethereum mining pool.\nThere are many questions that those who need to begin working with cryptocurrencies ask. The expression blockchain has been utilized in numerous social and company conversations in the last several years and everyone appears to get heard about blockchain technology, but a better part of the population actually does not have any idea what it actually means. Most people know of the expression Bitcoin but don’t have a very clear idea about what it is in fact. You want a mining program and highly effective computer to address the issue. With Bitcoin, miners utilize special software to solve math difficulties and are issued a particular number of bitcoins in exchange. A scheme named Proof-of-work is utilised to learn the real state of the decentralized network. The cloud mining process is also confronted with the chance of closure of operation. The capacity for blockchain technology is massive.

Since two weeks have passed I figured I have a sufficient amount of information and info to supply a good report. All you will need is an online connection. It’s therefore imperative that we jump on www.cloud-mining-coupon.com the bandwagon when feasible get adjusted before we’re made to adjust. For example, you can occupy a part-time job for Bitcoin on Coinality or you may wind up getting a little gig on Coingig.

The digital currency is definitely on the increase and has the capacity to be the very first token to genuinely disrupt a market, and should it, expect XRP to achieve Bitcoin-like heights of ubiquity in the not too distant future. Unless you are ready to forfeit an outstanding deal of your cash and nerves, beginning your own blockchain mining company isn’t an intelligent thought.

Speaking on stage at the WeAreDevelopers World Congress in Vienna, Mr Wozniak said he believed the blockchain will have a huge impact on the technology sector, hailing it as “the next major IT revolution that is about to happen.” Despite his positive outlook for bitcoin and blockchain, Mr Wozniak said in a separate interview at the event that he was “bothered by what technology has become,” referencing Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal. “We used to be able to have conversations in secret with people. If I were to say something to you in private now, others wouldn't hear it — that isn't the case anymore,” Mr Wozniak said. “We lost our security a long time ago. We've lost our privacy and it's been abused. If I think I have a level of privacy that I don't, that's deceit. And that bothers me. I hit a limit. I can't take that. It's one step in a long series of steps that are all in the same direction.” Not all Silicon Valley companies came under fire from Mr Wozniak, with the Apple co-founder revealing his excitement about buying a Tesla after buying his wife a Mercedes. “Elon Musk emailed me, said that I bought a gas guzzler, said that I’m not a ‘true Silicon Valley boy’ – I love that phrase,” Mr Wozniak said. “After a few months, my wife came into my office one night and said ‘if you want a Tesla you can order it.’ 30 seconds later [I ordered it].” Steve Wozniak previously said he waved goodbye to his 5,000 Facebook friends in order to better protect his personal data (Getty Images for Discovery) More His proclamations about blockchain technology follow previous comments about how bitcoin is better in key ways to gold and the US dollar. At the Money 20/20 event in Las Vegas last October, Mr Wozniak described traditional currencies as “kind of phony” due to the fact governments and create new units of the currency for political reasons, while gold also lacked a fixed supply. “There is a certain finite amount of bitcoin that can ever exist,” he said. “Gold gets mined and mined and mined. Maybe there’s a finite amount of gold in the world, but cryptocurrency is even more mathematical and regulated and nobody can change mathematics.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-price-live-updates-latest-cryptocurrency-value-ethereum-ripple-usd-exchange-trading-invest-a8301651.html", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-price-live-updates-latest-cryptocurrency-value-ethereum-ripple-usd-exchange-trading-invest-a8301651.html&quot;", "http://uk.businessinsider.com/steve-wozniak-weve-lost-our-privacy-and-its-been-abused-2018-5?r=US&amp;IR=T&quot;", "https://www.tumblr.com/widgets/share/tool?posttype=photo&content=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fuu%2Fapi%2Fres%2F1.2%2FPekKwyh.x3IxpmM3fzpX7g--~B%2FaD01MTQ7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fmedia.zenfs.com%2Fen-GB%2Fhomerun%2Fthe_independent_577%2F4eb0b171c29c24a96a92b359b58e475f&url=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.news.yahoo.com%2Fapple-founder-steve-wozniak-hails-110154279.html%3Fsoc_src%3Dsocial-sh%26soc_trk%3Dtu&clickthroughUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.news.yahoo.com%2Fapple-founder-steve-wozniak-hails-11015427", "http://uk.businessinsider.com/steve-wozniak-weve-lost-our-privacy-and-its-been-abused-2018-5?r=US&IR=T"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anthony cuthb", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "facebook’s cambridge analytica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wearedevelopers world congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reblog apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vienna", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T14:35:49.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d1861b39603c113e59df34e6f9c52af36288f349", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTHsM0YwnPwIsxrYMw1LMrRiDA_aj4I2wS9WrXj9PBEL3NTxWnXwBqtiNrbq5skYmweqyGjIBAfqDw_Oua.X7CN2KImLaGpkBZOKyrzflyKqu98cVMPTkKng8USmparWdE-", "site_full": "www.greencarreports.com", "site": "greencarreports.com", "site_section": "https://www.thecarconnection.com", "site_categories": ["vehicles"], "section_title": "High Gear Media Network Feed", "title": "Bitcoin processing uses more power than Teslas do, for now", "title_full": "Bitcoin processing uses more power than Teslas do, for now", "published": "2018-05-18T14:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26138, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d1861b39603c113e59df34e6f9c52af36288f349", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTHsM0YwnPwIsxrYMw1LMrRiDA_aj4I2wS9WrXj9PBEL3NTxWnXwBqtiNrbq5skYmweqyGjIBAfqDw_Oua.X7CN2KImLaGpkBZOKyrzflyKqu98cVMPTkKng8USmparWdE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Eric C.

READ THIS: No, electric cars (still) aren't crashing the grid. Again.\nA new report by a Dutch blockchain expert estimates that Bitcoin mining—processing complex, secured mathematical transactions by computer—uses as much electricity as Ireland, according to a Bloomberg report .\nThe report corroborates a Morgan Stanley report released at the end of last year, which notes that Bitcoin transactions use more electricity than all the Teslas (and other electric cars) on the road.\nBitcoin\nAccording to the original report, Bitcoin miners are expected to use 140 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2018, or about 1 percent of total world electricity consumption. That's a sum that electric cars are not expected to reach until 2025. The new report ups that to 1.8 percent of worldwide electricity consumption this year.\nBloomberg notes that those estimates may taper off with the price of Bitcoins .\nThe Morgan Stanley report [ PDF summary ] notes other concerns surrounding cryptocurrencies, including money laundering, transparency, volatility, fraud, manipulation, and hacking.\nOther reports from rival banks also threw cold water on the Morgan Stanley report, noting that similar predictions of skyrocketing power use followed the rise of data centers and marijuana farms. As those businesses grew, their operators learned to be more efficient with electricity and growth in electricity usage came under control.\nBy comparison, analysts at Credit Suisse expect electric cars to consume 7 percent of global electricity by 2040. That amount, they say, will dwarf anything from Bitcoin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T14:09:24.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "399d8497e4d085629e64f407616d2bded13f2cf0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcqTlXYlnSbDQsscFqqlhdlmwFmuiRSy3tmbqFToFoVdvMtWvr.nPI.YdU8FUS5vTPedCWfUrhD3s8t6Fdcl84wU1e4TwxTwlp1lrXnsh8cXAD7yun9ZMo", "site_full": "www.leaprate.com", "site": "leaprate.com", "site_section": "http://leaprate.com/feed", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "LeapRate", "title": "RoboForex introduces an opportunity to buy Bitcoin using fiat currencies", "title_full": "RoboForex introduces an opportunity to buy Bitcoin using fiat currencies", "published": "2018-05-18T13:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.leaprate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/roboforexeaquant.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 71166, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "399d8497e4d085629e64f407616d2bded13f2cf0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcqTlXYlnSbDQsscFqqlhdlmwFmuiRSy3tmbqFToFoVdvMtWvr.nPI.YdU8FUS5vTPedCWfUrhD3s8t6Fdcl84wU1e4TwxTwlp1lrXnsh8cXAD7yun9ZMo", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "LeapRate Staff", "published": "2018-05-18T13:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "RoboForex introduces an opportunity to buy Bitcoin using fiat currencies", "text": "Home Cryptocurrency Bitcoin RoboForex introduces an opportunity to buy Bitcoin using fiat currencies RoboForex introduces an opportunity to buy Bitcoin using fiat currencies Bitcoin May 18, 2018 —by LeapRate Staff 0\nRoboForex, the Belize-based unit of the Retail FX brokerage group, has announced that it is introducing an opportunity for clients to buy Bitcoin (BTC) for fiat money.\nRoboForex stated that this innovation will allow the company’s clients to buy BTC, perform trading operations with this asset, and convert the cryptocurrency back to fiat money. Along with an opportunity to buy Bitcoin, RoboForex clients can benefit from the difference of BTC exchange rates. Clients are not obliged to trade cryptocurrency – they can merely deposit funds to their Bitcoin accounts and receive profits in case of the asset growth.\nThis innovation from RoboForex is actually similar to the exchange Bitcoin wallet, but has several essential differences and advantages, including: Depositing/withdrawing funds via many payment systems, including bank cards. Guarantee of funds security. RoboForex is a regulated broker, which has been successfully operating on the market for more than 8 years. Quick funds withdrawal. Opportunity to trade any currency pairs on Pro-Standard, ECN-Pro NDD, and Prime accounts using Bitcoin.\nWith these new opportunities to buy the cryptocurrency and deposit funds to Bitcoin Wallets, providing access to a new product to RoboForex clients, allows investment in Bitcoin quickly and securely.\nHowever, it should be clear that the new product is not intended for conversion of the cryptocurrency into fiat money. A client who deposited in his account in BTC cannot withdraw funds from the account in fiat currency. This is only available to the assets, which were acquired from the company when deposited to the account or earned when trading on it.\nDenis Golomedov, Chief Marketing Officer at RoboForex, believes this is a positive step towards adapting the revolutionary currency in today’s market:\nProviding the ability for clients to deposit into their accounts in Bitcoin is not only an additional service, which expands clients’ opportunities, but also a standalone product, which significantly dominates over its market counterparts. Security has become very significant issue recently, as more and more information appears about hacking cryptocurrency exchanges and stealing users’ assets. Using the cryptocurrency is much more convenient and safer for clients within the framework of their trading and investment activities using products and services provided by a regulated broker.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roboforex", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "roboforex", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leaprate staff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "retail fx", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T16:52:42.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7aa9922e9a06852db5bab6851ebf5bd583924f91", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS6L7nbyxruQ0JcdFSmouls-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "title_full": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "published": "2018-05-18T13:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7aa9922e9a06852db5bab6851ebf5bd583924f91", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS6L7nbyxruQ0JcdFSmouls-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "realr0ach", "published": "2018-05-18T13:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "text": "Quote: from: Icygreen on Today at 05:55:13 AM I'm still impressed we're up more than 4x from only 1 year ago and this is considered a low price, Euphoric indeed!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T09:09:27.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "198779f1762fd9130ba4674285fa5371cd8d142c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9TQrY8xdacywdPxYHTOJVVI.UvvYOT3YJgHT6YPoDqib7kOqOSpS._kdr3oMk_7G1e5nOA8gJbOta7NAZOCPWFJkCK4R1QZxv0sBce0LrtqVK88eClNheHwLstAojRwjJSeMAKvlTEVwRQnJ8jpx.D", "site_full": "www.cafedealtura.com", "site": "cafedealtura.com", "site_section": "http://www.cafedealtura.com/feed/rss/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Café de Altura", "title": "24 Hour Pharmacy – Best Place To Order Proscar cheap – BitCoin Accepted", "title_full": "24 Hour Pharmacy – Best Place To Order Proscar cheap – BitCoin Accepted", "published": "2018-05-18T13:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "198779f1762fd9130ba4674285fa5371cd8d142c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9TQrY8xdacywdPxYHTOJVVI.UvvYOT3YJgHT6YPoDqib7kOqOSpS._kdr3oMk_7G1e5nOA8gJbOta7NAZOCPWFJkCK4R1QZxv0sBce0LrtqVK88eClNheHwLstAojRwjJSeMAKvlTEVwRQnJ8jpx.D", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "alania", "published": "2018-05-18T13:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "24 Hour Pharmacy – Best Place To Order Proscar cheap – BitCoin Accepted", "text": "Café de Altura Comunicación, apoyo e innovación 24 Hour Pharmacy – Best Place To Order Proscar cheap – BitCoin Accepted 24 Hour Pharmacy – Best Place To Order Proscar cheap – BitCoin Accepted Best Place To Order Proscar cheap Generic Proscar Where To Buy Generic Proscar.

by Chris Dunkan\n“Square’s decision to allow users through mobile applications to buy and sell bitcoin was a” fairly controversial move within the company and is still a source of internal tensions, “said the company’s CEO yesterday Jack Dorsey.\nJack Dorsey, who is also Twitter’s head at a New York Cryptosynthesis conference, reiterated his support for the Bitcoin virtual currency, but noted that not everyone is agreeing with this venture at Square, including members of the Management Board.\n“In our company we have a lot of healthy skepticism over all the issues and therefore everyone has the right to express their opposition to this technology,” Dorsey said. “We never hide the fact that there is a lot of skepticism in the Square, a lot of intense conversations, disagreements, even quarrels, but there is the magic of things.”\nThe aforementioned added that the “sound discussion” about bitcoin was extended to the board of directors of the company, without so far looking at specific facts about this issue.\nIn January, Square, a US-based company based in San Francisco, widely known for its groundbreaking ideas, has begun to allow users on the platform to buy and sell bitcoin, which really made a great impression on the general public , as it happened to one of the world’s largest internet companies.\nBitcoin supporters say this action can help democratize the choices for people who want to trade, offering a way to bypass banks and governments, and so transactions are carried out at the lowest possible cost, without hidden fees and charges.",

:\nApple’s co-founder Steve “Woz” Wozniak has commented positively about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in his opening speech at the WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018 in Vienna, Austria.\nAccording to a report by Cointelegraph auf Deutsch Wednesday, May 16, Wozniak considers blockchain to be a “great idea.” He further said:\n“[Blockchain] is the next major IT revolution that is about to happen.”\nWozniak explained his positive outlook on blockchain by the fact that there are many useful applications for the technology in a number of areas.\nThe blockchain and cryptocurrencies will achieve their full potential in a decade, according to Wozniak. Apple’s co-founder quoted CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey, who had said in March that Bitcoin will become the world’s “single currency.”\nThis is not the first time that Steve Wozniak has made positive comments about cryptocurrencies and blockchain. At the “Money 20/20” conference in Las Vegas, back in October last year, he said that Bitcoin is better than gold and the US dollar.\nAccording to Wozniak, Bitcoin’s big advantage is that there is only a limited amount of coins, while fiat money, like the US dollar or euro, can simply be printed by banks.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://de.cointelegraph.com/news/apple-co-founder-blockchain-is-an-interesting-technology-but-not-yet-ready-for-the-market", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/steve-wozniak-bitcoin-and-blockchain-will-achieve-full-potential-in-a-decade"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "veronika rinecker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cointelegraph auf deutsch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vienna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T15:28:11.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0687208d21b5d50dd141ab018d708856f66414bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZGmEuD_g8EcJ1NW.yQ499ubW2mF96QVOiN3V3A1YFdmXZeIdOlaTAszZE4oGicDmWIectjquPIxeYs7dmhdVIeU5iTMsaCZCI-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Bitcoin to consume 1.8% of world's electricity by late 2019 - equivalent to the world's entire solar power output", "title_full": "Bitcoin to consume 1.8% of world's electricity by late 2019 - equivalent to the world's entire solar power output : btc", "published": "2018-05-18T13:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.449, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0687208d21b5d50dd141ab018d708856f66414bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZGmEuD_g8EcJ1NW.yQ499ubW2mF96QVOiN3V3A1YFdmXZeIdOlaTAszZE4oGicDmWIectjquPIxeYs7dmhdVIeU5iTMsaCZCI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Everything4Everyone", "published": "2018-05-18T13:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin to consume 1.8% of world's electricity by late 2019 - equivalent to the world's entire solar power output", "text": "submitted by /u/Everything4Everyone\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://grist.org/article/bitcoins-energy-use-got-studied-and-you-libertarian-nerds-look-even-worse-than-usual/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T09:09:07.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4f39e0d666068a8f4bc6f3dd2f2cb347734d90c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWjOrVwoand9T2lHpGsKdIZZVJzo3AV0SbfjXsfL8XmrKGP4bqTjLbFD48COBnsWC2ovKvBOnyhrRLOfvFBiZTs2HpFGqRYgFScwFoxMBIAw--", "site_full": "wahabali786.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://wahabali786.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Tips and Tricks About Computer And More", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Friday: UN Backs Crypto-Solar Project in Moldova, Malta Uses Blockchain in Public Transportation", "title_full": "Bitcoin in Brief Friday: UN Backs Crypto-Solar Project in Moldova, Malta Uses Blockchain in Public Transportation", "published": "2018-05-18T13:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4f39e0d666068a8f4bc6f3dd2f2cb347734d90c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWjOrVwoand9T2lHpGsKdIZZVJzo3AV0SbfjXsfL8XmrKGP4bqTjLbFD48COBnsWC2ovKvBOnyhrRLOfvFBiZTs2HpFGqRYgFScwFoxMBIAw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "OS Tech Tips (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-18T13:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Friday: UN Backs Crypto-Solar Project in Moldova, Malta Uses Blockchain in Public Transportation", "text": "Today’s Bitcoin in Brief features several examples of harnessing crypto and blockchain technologies to improve quality of life around the world.

The project, to be realized in partnership with the South African solar power marketplace Sun Exchange, will allow people to buy solar cells and then lease them to the Technical University in Chisinau, which is one of the largest in the country.\nAccording to a VOA report, the purchases will be made using Solarcoin, a crypto launched by the blockchain startup Electricchain. The idea is to find new sources of finance “to help buildings go green overnight, in this case with rooftop solar panels,” said Dumitru Vasilescu, program manager with UNDP in Moldova. “One of the biggest obstacles to countries investing in renewable energy is the lack of financing, as you often have to wait 10 to 15 years before you get a return on your investment,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation .\nVasilescu added that the university will get a full 1 megawatt of energy installed in the summer as a result of the crowdfunding effort. The owners of the solar cells will in turn receive Solarcoins, as soon as the university produces energy, and will be able to earn about 4% interest on their investments. According to the UNDP representative, there is more than 10,000 square meters of unused rooftop space on public buildings in the country, which could potentially be covered with solar panels.\nMoldova, one of Europe’s poorest countries, is heavily dependent on energy imports, mainly from the Russian Federation. Cryptocurrencies have been gaining popularity in the former Soviet republic which is economically and politically on a crossroad between East and West. The local crypto community has recently opened the country’s first cryptocurrency exchange and presented a new digital token, both developed locally.\nMalta Uses Blockchain for Better Public Transportation Authorities in Malta, a country maintaining a crypto-friendly regulatory environment, are working on a project to use blockchain to improve the public transportation services. Maltese Minister for Transport and Infrastructure, Ian Borg, has announced a partnership with Omnitude, a multi-enterprise blockchain platform. According to a press release, the deal is part of the nation’s blockchain strategy that will see the technology implemented to develop a transport and logistics platform using Omnitude’s blockchain middleware technology.\nOn the first stage, the government will work with the company to introduce overall improvements in transport reliability. Omnitude is a tech partner of Formula 1 team Williams Martini Racing and is working to assess the benefits that blockchain can bring to advanced engineering. Their project is said to be the first example of using blockchain in F1.\n“We believe in Omnitude’s blockchain technology and its broad use-cases for the government […] It will improve the quality of life and enhance access to information for Maltese citizens. Blockchain technology is a key part of our overall technology strategy that will transform different sectors,” Ian Borg said. Earlier this year, Malta became one of the first countries in the world to approve a national strategy on blockchain technology.\nLand Registry in India Made Reliable with Blockchain The potential of the technology underpinning the majority of cryptocurrencies is not left unnoticed in other parts of the world. In India , blockchain will be used to trace transactions in property sales almost in real time. A newly announced project aims to build a land registry using blockchain technology for the Indian city of Panchkula, according to a blog post on the website of the London School of Economics.\nThe people behind the initiative – Alexandru Oprunenco, innovation advisor for the UNDP in Asia, and Chami Akmeemana, CEO of the Blockchain Learning Group – say their small venture is actually a “big deal” that represents a “meaningful and commercially viable solution” for the region. They point out that in many cities across the developing world land registry systems suffer from inefficiency and corruption. People selling a piece of land are often unsure if they legally own it, even if they have a legitimate sale deed. Potential buyers, on the other hand, are also not sure if the seller owns the plot.\n“With blockchain we have a chance to fix many of these problems. The solution we are building incorporates many key benefits of the technology, such as an immutable history of transactions, so that no one doubts the authenticity of the records or be able to forge them,” Oprunenco and Akmeemana explain. Their project is using the Ethereum blockchain.\nThe Central Bank of Libya Says Bitcoin Is Illegal Obviously failing to recognize the potential of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technologies, the central bank of Libya has declared “virtual currency” illegal in the country. Those who use it cannot be protected by Libyan law, the financial institution said, quoted by The Libya Observer .\nOn Tuesday, the CBL warned all Libyan citizens and businesses of the “security perils” of cryptocurrency, saying that it could be used in crimes, financing terrorism and money laundering – arguments often heard from financial regulators and central banks around the world. According to the notice, any use of virtual currency requires prior permission from the central bank in Tripoli.\nWhat are your thoughts on today’s topics in Bitcoin in Brief?

Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter Inc. and Square Inc was also one amongst the long list of speakers at the event. During the event, he spoke to a crowd of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, to show he was completely in sync with their view that digital currencies are the way of the future.\nDorsey, said on Wednesday at Consensus, a blockchain and cryptocurrency conference:\n“The internet deserves a native currency; it will have a native currency. I hope it will be Bitcoin”\nMany in the audience at Square were skeptical about the technology and making access to digital currencies much easier. Dorsey also mentioned that there are debates and even fights over the topic, and some of the company’s board members are resistant to cryptocurrencies.\nDorsey has spoken with great enthusiasm about digital currencies many times before and propagated the new technology. He also tweeted in 2016 that he would ‘love to see a digital currency thrive’. In his role at Square, he has promoted cryptocurrency many times. In 2014, the payments company started letting merchants accept Bitcoin. Since then, Bitcoin trading was available for almost all users of its Cash App, which lets users send money to friends and family.\nAs Dorsey was about the move not everyone at Square was as enthusiastic.\nHe said:\n“I’ll be frank, this was a pretty contentious move in the company.” Square Reported:\n“In first-quarter revenue from selling Bitcoin at the beginning of this month the company made $34.1 million , but it cost the company $33.9 million to buy the tokens, meaning we only made about $200,000.”\nDorsey said at the Consensus conference, the biggest of about two dozen events during New York’s Blockchain Week:\n“This technology is a fundamental shift in our world and can have so many positive outcomes.

In a post on the /r/Bitcoin subreddit, gta3uzi shows how he has successfully used the system to heat bathwater.\nREAD MORE: Hot News for Bitcoin Fanatics: Welcome New Heater That Can Mine Cryptocurrency\nHe notes, however, that the system works a little too well, as the bath temperature eventually rose to a blistering 50C / 122F. That doesn't mean it's useless, though — he points out that with minor adjustments, his scheme can power a home radiator heating system or even a dishwasher.\nThe system is simple — normal air is used to cool the hot parts of the farm. Then the air, heated as a result, is pushed through an intercooler, which in turn heats the water running through it. © Photo : u/gta3uzi © Photo : u/gta3uzi ASIC water heater\nAccording to the online outlet Motherboard, which contacted gta3uzi, he has actually managed to increase his profits as a result of the innovation.

The United Nations is involved in a crypto-funded project to power Moldova's Technical University with solar energy. Initiatives in Malta and India will employ blockchain technologies to create more reliable public transportation and land registry systems.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: OECD Explores Cryptocurrencies, Central Asian Powerhouse Calls for UN Crypto Rules\nUN Launches Crypto-Funded Solar Power Project in Moldova The United Nations Development Program ( UNDP ) is launching this year a crypto-funded initiative to power a university in Moldova with solar energy. The project, to be realized in partnership with the South African solar power marketplace Sun Exchange, will allow people to buy solar cells and then lease them to the Technical University in Chisinau, which is one of the largest in the country.\nAccording to a VOA report, the purchases will be made using Solarcoin, a crypto launched by the blockchain startup Electricchain. The idea is to find new sources of finance \"to help buildings go green overnight, in this case with rooftop solar panels,\" said Dumitru Vasilescu, program manager with UNDP in Moldova. \"One of the biggest obstacles to countries investing in renewable energy is the lack of financing, as you often have to wait 10 to 15 years before you get a return on your investment,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation .\nVasilescu added that the university will get a full 1 megawatt of energy installed in the summer as a result of the crowdfunding effort. The owners of the solar cells will in turn receive Solarcoins, as soon as the university produces energy, and will be able to earn about 4% interest on their investments. According to the UNDP representative, there is more than 10,000 square meters of unused rooftop space on public buildings in the country, which could potentially be covered with solar panels.\nMoldova, one of Europe's poorest countries, is heavily dependent on energy imports, mainly from the Russian Federation. Cryptocurrencies have been gaining popularity in the former Soviet republic which is economically and politically on a crossroad between East and West. The local crypto community has recently opened the country's first cryptocurrency exchange and presented a new digital token, both developed locally.\nMalta Uses Blockchain for Better Public Transportation Authorities in Malta, a country maintaining a crypto-friendly regulatory environment, are working on a project to use blockchain to improve the public transportation services. Maltese Minister for Transport and Infrastructure, Ian Borg, has announced a partnership with Omnitude, a multi-enterprise blockchain platform. According to a press release, the deal is part of the nation's blockchain strategy that will see the technology implemented to develop a transport and logistics platform using Omnitude's blockchain middleware technology.\nOn the first stage, the government will work with the company to introduce overall improvements in transport reliability. Omnitude is a tech partner of Formula 1 team Williams Martini Racing and is working to assess the benefits that blockchain can bring to advanced engineering. Their project is said to be the first example of using blockchain in F1.\n\"We believe in Omnitude's blockchain technology and its broad use-cases for the government […] It will improve the quality of life and enhance access to information for Maltese citizens. Blockchain technology is a key part of our overall technology strategy that will transform different sectors,\" Ian Borg said. Earlier this year, Malta became one of the first countries in the world to approve a national strategy on blockchain technology.\nLand Registry in India Made Reliable with Blockchain The potential of the technology underpinning the majority of cryptocurrencies is not left unnoticed in other parts of the world. In India , blockchain will be used to trace transactions in property sales almost in real time. A newly announced project aims to build a land registry using blockchain technology for the Indian city of Panchkula, according to a blog post on the website of the London School of Economics.\nThe people behind the initiative – Alexandru Oprunenco, innovation advisor for the UNDP in Asia, and Chami Akmeemana, CEO of the Blockchain Learning Group – say their small venture is actually a \"big deal\" that represents a \"meaningful and commercially viable solution\" for the region. They point out that in many cities across the developing world land registry systems suffer from inefficiency and corruption. People selling a piece of land are often unsure if they legally own it, even if they have a legitimate sale deed. Potential buyers, on the other hand, are also not sure if the seller owns the plot.\n\"With blockchain we have a chance to fix many of these problems. The solution we are building incorporates many key benefits of the technology, such as an immutable history of transactions, so that no one doubts the authenticity of the records or be able to forge them,\" Oprunenco and Akmeemana explain.
