Right after that I purchased some bitcoin through simplex. So the transactions (I made two, on the same address) went through, i can also see it on blockchain.info. The thing is, that I can't see it in my wallet. Also, the address I sent myself is also not visible in the wallet. I still have the email tho. I went back and forth with bitcoin support (one guy named Steven), i cleared my chache, generated all the new addresses, scanned for funds, I tryed everything he said. He also said that the error message should not be showing, also stopped believing me about my issue. Ok, so here's the thing I want to know. How can I try to access my bitcoin just through the BTC address? Or at least, can I find out to wich wallet this address is linked to? Because if it is not linked to my wallet, which wallet is it linked then? Can a bitcoin address not be linked to a wallet? If so, can anyone retrieve the money then?

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. After listing Bitcoin futures in December of last year, CME launched two indexes tracking Ethereum on Monday. Though the company has denied plans of adding another new product, speculation is rife that Ethereum futures may be added in the future. Ethereum futures will offer the institutional players an opportunity to diversify their trading into the top two cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Software developer Kx Systems has also launched cryptocurrency trading on its while label forex trading platform . The software supplier serves a few investment banks and hedge funds. Nasdaq is also not to be left behind. It is providing the technology to the new centralized crypto exchange, DX, which will offer trading in the market’s top six cryptocurrencies. The stage is being set for the institutional players to take the plunge. So, should the retail investors buy and hodl? We believe that the large players might first push prices down, accumulate at lower levels and then boost prices. Hence, retail investors should stagger their purchases instead of buying all at once. Let’s see if we find any buy setups on the charts. BTC/USD For the past three days, Bitcoin has been taking support at the 50-day SMA. The bulls will strongly defend the support zone between $7,900 to $8,400 because if this cracks, a fall to $7,000 will be on the cards. If the support zone holds, the cryptocurrency will stay range bound between $7,900-$10,000. The 50-day SMA has been flat for the past few days while the 20-day EMA has become flat in the past week. This shows that the BTC/USD pair will soon enter a period of consolidation. The resistance of the range is well established at $10,000, but the supports are still unclear. It will either be $7,900 or $6,700. Hence, we suggest waiting for a couple of days before clarity emerges. ETH/USD The dip in Ethereum below the 20-day EMA was aggressively purchased on May 14, resulting in a move back to the overhead resistance of $745. Currently, the ETH/USD pair is looking strong as it is holding above the $700 levels. This increases the possibility of a break out of $745 levels once again. Aggressive traders can take a very short-term long position above $750 with a close stop loss. The target is $838, but this is a very risky trade, hence, should be attempted with only about 30 percent of the usual position size. On the downside, the critical support levels are $637, $600 and the 50-day SMA at $570. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash bounced back sharply from the lows on May 12, but it is struggling to sustain above the 20-day EMA and break out of the small downtrend line. The BCH/USD pair may form a very short-term head and shoulders pattern, which will complete on a breakdown and close below $1,270 levels. This bearish pattern has a target of $650, but it is unlikely to be a straight fall because the digital currency has strong support at $1,221, then at the 50-day SMA at $1,100 and finally at $800. If the neckline of the H&S pattern doesn’t break down and prices break above $1,520 levels, Bitcoin Cash can rally back to $1,800 levels. Traders should wait for prices to break and close (UTC) above the downtrend line before buying. XRP/USD Ripple broke below the 50-day SMA on May 11 but found strong buying support at $0.632 levels on May 12. Currently, it has climbed back above the 50-day SMA. On the upside, it will face a strong resistance at $0.76, which was previously the support of the range. The 20-day EMA is just above this level, which will also act as a resistance. If both these levels are crossed, the XRP/USD pair will become positive, and the probability of a rally to $0.9377 levels increase. If the bulls fail to scale above the overhead resistance, the cryptocurrency can slide to $0.56-$0.58 levels. XLM/USD Stellar bounced off the 50-day SMA on May 12, but the pullback is facing resistance at the 20-day EMA. If the bulls break above the 20-day EMA, a rally to $0.45 levels is possible. If the XLM/USD pair turns down from the moving average but takes support at the $0.334 levels, it will be a positive sign and we can expect a break out of the 20-day EMA within a couple of days. However, a break below the 50-day SMA will increase the possibility of a head and shoulders pattern, which can sink the digital currency to the $0.20 levels. Therefore, traders should wait for buying to emerge before establishing long positions. LTC/USD Litecoin broke below the 50-day SMA and the horizontal support on May 11 but quickly rebounded from the lows on May 12. Currently, the bulls are trying to sustain above the $141 levels, which is a positive sign. Any up move in the LTC/USD pair will face resistance between $167 and $173 levels. The 50-day SMA has still not turned up and the 20-day EMA is also turning down. Hence, we don’t anticipate a break out above the downtrend line. On the downside, a break below the $132.163 level opens up a downside target of $115. As we don’t find any buy setups, we are not recommending any trade on it. ADA/BTC Cardano plunged below our second stop loss on May 12 but took support at the 50-day SMA and the trendline. The ensuing up move is facing resistance close to the 20-day EMA. Currently, prices are again sliding towards the trendline support. If the ADA/BTC pair breaks the trendline support, it can decline to 0.000025 levels, which is a strong support. On the other hand, if the trendline holds, Cardano will again try to scale above the 0.00003445 levels. There are no reliable buy setups, hence, we are not proposing any trade on it. IOTA/USD IOTA is currently sandwiched between the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. The bulls are defending the horizontal support at $1.63 while the bears are defending the 20-day EMA. If the IOTA/USD pair climbs above the 20-day EMA and the overhead resistance at $2.2117, it will become positive. Though there is a minor resistance at $2.6977, we believe that it will be crossed if the digital currency closes (UTC) above $2.2117. We should wait for the breakout before suggesting any long position. EOS/USD On May 12, EOS bounced off the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement and the bottom trendline of the descending channel. For the past three days, it has been facing resistance at the $15.1390 levels. On the upside, the EOS/USD pair will face resistance at the 20-day EMA and the top trendline of the descending channel. A breakout and close (UTC) of the channel will be a bullish sign and can be purchased by keeping a stop loss below the May 12 lows. If the price fails to rally above the overhead resistance it can again decline to the 50-day SMA. A sustained move below $12.4810 will weaken the digital currency.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

It only has a limited supply so thats why when people buy a lot of the supply, the demand is high and the price goes up too. When people sell a large amount then thats the time when price goes down. It is just a basic law of supply and demand. Volatility is high in bitcoin due to its very limited supply.\nBitcoin volatility is cause of the limited supply where there are many investors that are trying to collect it and having more people demand to use it.

The news may be especially bullish for Bitcoin as Microsoft developers hint they will use the actual Bitcoin chain to build the platform.\nWhile Microsoft Founder Bill Gates has been an outspoken critic of cryptocurrencies, calling them ‘nonsense,’ the company has ventured into blockchain over the last twelve months in order to enhance its Microsoft Authenticator app. Ankur Patel, Principal Program Manager of Microsoft’s Identity Division, is leading these incubations and explained in a blog post the value of digital identity for the billions of people living today in the world, and how blockchain technology will provide an easy to use self-owned identity to completely control how data is accessed and used.\n“To achieve this vision, we believe it is essential for individuals to own and control all elements of their digital identity. Rather than grant broad consent to countless apps and services, and have their identity data spread across numerous providers, individuals need a secure encrypted digital hub where they can store their identity data and easily control access to it.” Patel made the case for decentralized identity in order to own and control one’s identity in a system where privacy is by design and built in from the ground up.\nMicrosoft’s project wants trust to be earned by individuals and built by the community, unlike traditional identity systems which are mostly geared toward authentication and access management. The company has been participating in the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) to set up a decentralized identity ecosystem built on standard, open source technologies, protocols, and reference implementations.\nPatel said his team is collaboratively developing Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Identity Hubs, Universal DID Resolver, and Verifiable Credentials. Patel said the team needs the underlying technology to be capable of scale and performance on par with traditional systems, but some blockchain communities have increased on-chain transaction capacity, which degrades the decentralized state of the network and fails to reach the millions of transactions per second the system would generate at world-scale.

Nearly all of the top cryptocurrencies by market value traded well into the red, too. Bitcoin had not previously notched a low under $9,000 since May 1. Friday’s trading put the cryptocurrency at its lowest levels in three weeks.\nHere’s what you need to know in cryptocurrencies for Friday, May 11.\nNvidia Puts a Damper on Crypto\nNvidia Corp. (NVDA) broke out its cryptocurrency sales for the first time in quarterly earnings released Thursday evening, and the company didn’t strike a particularly bullish tone on cryptocurrency. Action Alerts PLUS holding Nvidia said it sold $289 million in chips to cryptocurrency miners in the first quarter amid stronger-than-expected demand. The graphics processing units Nvidia makes are integral to cryptocurrency mining, which requires a great deal of both electricity and computing power. Despite a strong start to the year, Nvidia predicted cryptocurrency-related revenue could shrink about two-thirds in the current fiscal quarter. “Crypto miners bought a lot of our GPUs during the quarter, and it drove prices up,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on the earnings conference call. “And so we’re starting to see prices come down. We monitor spot pricing every single day around the world. And the prices are starting to normalize.”\nKorea’s Biggest Exchange Raided\nUPbit, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea, has been raided, according to Coindesk Korea. The firm is said to be accused of fraud for allegedly selling to customers cryptocurrency it does not actually hold. “We have secured hard disks and accounting books through confiscation. Analysis is expected to take days,” South Korea’s Prosecutor’s Office was quoted as saying. UPbit refused to comment on the seizure, but the exchange’s support site does confirm there was a raid at their Seoul office. The UPbit raid is the latest in what has developed into a string of crackdowns as South Korea aims to tighten regulatory standards for cryptocurrency firms.\nUK Startup Launches Ethereum Futures\nU.K.-based startup Crypto Facilities on Friday launched the first regulated platform for ethereum futures. Ethereum, the cryptocurrency that powers the ether blockchain, will now be available for investors to take long or short positions, facilitating the means to “broaden investment opportunities and manage risks more effectively,” Crypto Facilities said. Ethereum is the second-most liquid cryptocurrency after bitcoin, with what Crypto Facilities said is “billions of dollars” in daily trading volume. Crypto Facilities will work with Akuna Capital and B2C2 as liquidity providers to help back its contracts.\nCrypto Beer Vending Machine?\nPalo Alto-based startup Civic is using beer to demonstrate the many uses of blockchain and crypto in everyday life. The company has partnered with AB InBev (BUD) to create a beer vending machine that utilizes blockchain-based identity verification systems to serve beer to those who can use the technology to prove they are of legal age. “We’ve been thinking about practical ways of bringing crypto technology to a more mainstream audience, and how can we go so niche that it’s easy to understand for a regular individual. Proof of age seemed like the best low-hanging fruit,” Civic’s Titus Capilnean told Coindesk. This entry was posted in stocks on by admin .

The bloc agreed on Monday to force cryptocurrency exchanges to identify users. That will make it harder for criminals to use virtual cash to hide their ill-gotten gains. Representations of the Ripple, Bitcoin, Etherum and Litecoin virtual currencies are seen on a PC motherboard in this illustration picture, February 13, 2018. Picture is taken February 13, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\nThe EU’s bitcoin assault is part of a broader attack on money laundering and the financing of terrorism. To do so, the bloc is updating the existing anti-money laundering directive to shed light on opaque areas of the financial world. One key novelty is a requirement for the dozens of European exchanges which trade in currencies such as bitcoin or ethereum, and the technology companies that store the money in so-called wallets, to carry out the same know-your-customer checks as ordinary banks.\nThe new rules are an important step in the fight against illicit money flows. Anonymity, guaranteed via encrypted procedures, is probably one of the main reasons for the soaring popularity of digital currencies, which have seen their market values exceed $400 billion this year. Paying for goods and services in bitcoin or similar allows users to bypass regulated payment systems. That appeals to drug dealers or terrorists. BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink recently called virtual currencies an “index of money laundering”.\nThe European transparency push could help change things. If transactions are no longer secret, this should deter usage for illicit means, and facilitate the work of law-enforcement agencies. It may also make it harder for criminals to hack exchanges, as happened with Slovenian group NiceHash last year.\nCriminals can still use exchanges outside the EU. There’s also a danger that more trading simply moves off exchanges. But Europe is not alone in the fight. South Korea imposed similar rules earlier this year, and the United States may not be far behind. If more trading happens out of the shadows, virtual currencies could become more respectable.

Bitcoin Elliott Wave Analysis Talking Points: Bitcoin prices have been rallied from the 6,500 low in an impulse wave When an impulse wave starts a new trend, we anticipate a partial retracement followed by another bullish wave of similar size Above 7,800 anticipate a recovery up to 11,600\nBitcoin prices have been falling since the December 2017 high. Though we cannot say for sure if the multi-month correction is over, the rally that began on April 6 has taken the shape of a bullish impulse wave. Therefore, we know from our studies of Elliott Wave Theory that an impulse wave that begins a new trend typically means we are witnessing the beginning of a zigzag pattern or a larger degree impulse wave. In both scenarios, it is a high probability we see a partial retracement followed by another rally of similar size or Fibonacci proportions to the first wave. Fibonacci partial retracement\nThe first movement we are looking for after the impulse wave rally is a partial retracement and correction lower of the uptrend. The most common way to get started in estimating the retracement level is using the Fibonacci retracement tool .\nTherefore, we are looking for Bitcoin prices to dip, but most likely hold above 7,800. It is possible the correction lower is over and the secondary rally may be commencing soon. Bitcoin chart target levels\nSince the first wave measured 3,415, we look for the next wave to measure a similar distance pushing it up towards 11,600. The key level to this cryptocurrency forecast is the April 6 low of 6,511. Alternate Elliott Wave Forecast\nIf Bitcoin prices are unable to rally, one alternative chart we are considering is that a large Elliott Wave triangle is unfolding. Under this scenario, the Bitcoin chart level of 9,927 likely holds prices down as the market continues in a sideways grind. Triangles can appear in the bullish and bearish sequence. In this instance it could be a bearish triangle wave unfolding. Bitcoin Elliott Wave FAQs\nWhat is Elliott Wave Theory?\nElliott Wave Theory is a forex trading study that identifies the highs and lows of price movements on charts via wave patterns. Traders often analyze the 5-wave impulse sequence and 3-wave corrective sequence to help them trade strategically. We cover these wave sequences in our beginners and advanced Elliott Wave trading guides.\nDoes the Elliott Wave principle work on cryptocurrencies?\nWe think it does. Elliott Wave is a study of the waves, which are reflective of the mass psychology of the market. Right now, we think the mass psychology on Bitcoin and other altcoins diminishing . Any large market with a mass of humans behind it can be analyzed using Elliott Wave Theory. If you are new to Bitcoin, we have an introductory guide to help you get started.\n---Written by Jeremy Wagner , CEWA-M\nJeremy Wagner is a Certified Elliott Wave Analyst with a Master’s designation.

(NVDA) broke out its cryptocurrency sales for the first time in quarterly earnings released Thursday evening, and the company didn’t strike a particularly bullish tone on cryptocurrency. Action Alerts PLUS holding Nvidia said it sold $289 million in chips to cryptocurrency miners in the first quarter amid stronger-than-expected demand. The graphics processing units Nvidia makes are integral to cryptocurrency mining, which requires a great deal of both electricity and computing power. Despite a strong start to the year, Nvidia predicted cryptocurrency-related revenue could shrink about two-thirds in the current fiscal quarter. “Crypto miners bought a lot of our GPUs during the quarter, and it drove prices up,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on the earnings conference call. “And so we’re starting to see prices come down. We monitor spot pricing every single day around the world. And the prices are starting to normalize.”\nKorea’s Biggest Exchange Raided\nUPbit, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea, has been raided, according to Coindesk Korea. The firm is said to be accused of fraud for allegedly selling to customers cryptocurrency it does not actually hold. “We have secured hard disks and accounting books through confiscation. Analysis is expected to take days,” South Korea’s Prosecutor’s Office was quoted as saying. UPbit refused to comment on the seizure, but the exchange’s support site does confirm there was a raid at their Seoul office. The UPbit raid is the latest in what has developed into a string of crackdowns as South Korea aims to tighten regulatory standards for cryptocurrency firms.\nUK Startup Launches Ethereum Futures\nU.K.-based startup Crypto Facilities on Friday launched the first regulated platform for ethereum futures. Ethereum, the cryptocurrency that powers the ether blockchain, will now be available for investors to take long or short positions, facilitating the means to “broaden investment opportunities and manage risks more effectively,” Crypto Facilities said. Ethereum is the second-most liquid cryptocurrency after bitcoin, with what Crypto Facilities said is “billions of dollars” in daily trading volume. Crypto Facilities will work with Akuna Capital and B2C2 as liquidity providers to help back its contracts.\nCrypto Beer Vending Machine?\nPalo Alto-based startup Civic is using beer to demonstrate the many uses of blockchain and crypto in everyday life. The company has partnered with AB InBev (BUD) to create a beer vending machine that utilizes blockchain-based identity verification systems to serve beer to those who can use the technology to prove they are of legal age. “We’ve been thinking about practical ways of bringing crypto technology to a more mainstream audience, and how can we go so niche that it’s easy to understand for a regular individual.

Hey, we are taxpayers. They work for us. Don’t forget that!\nTheir response was not surprising, they said “That’s Classified”–\nWhile this is no surprise what we have started is a paper trail, hopefully that will lead to the revealing of the creator or creators of Bitcoin. For those who are not from the financial services community, it is important to note why anyone would go through such trouble – it’s called due diligence. When investors make investments they want to know every single detail about that investment. Some of these DD questionnaires can be 100 pages they can have 300 questions! It can take months, require multiple flesh meetings, they may bring in external advisers – it may seem like a circus but if someone is investing $100 Million then it’s really the least one can do. Anyway, do Bitcoin investors really understand what they are getting themselves into?\nThis article deserves a full read: Bitcoin Founder Satoshi Nakamoto was probably an NSA Employee — and the NSA may destroy Bitcoin\nBitcoin has a huge risk few consider: it can be destroyed overnight My second NSA related theory and prediction, is that the NSA will be tasked to take down Bitcoin. While relative to the Internet, blockchain is very secure and effectively unhackable for a criminal group — it is in fact quite capable of being cheated and manipulated if you have enough computing power. NSA probably has plenty of computing power and expertise to take the Bitcoin blockchain down. Why would the NSA want to take down Bitcoin? What NSA wants is irrelevant — it’s what government leaders want. And there are many scenarios that could lead to an order to take the Bitcoin blockchain down, with either minor disruption (letting it come back with just a few accounts robbed) or totally destroyed (stealing from many accounts and screwing it up so badly it is impossible to restore): 1. North Korea is a major owner, user, exploiter (for computer ransomware) of Bitcoin. As a sanction, punishment, or means of waging war, NSA could be ordered to rob accounts suspected of being NK owned.[1] 2. Bitcoin and many of its owners and advocates are Libertarian and anti-government. Bitcoin is an affront to national “fiat” currencies and handy for evading government rules and taxes. Big Government is very motivated to destroy Bitcoin. 3. Bitcoin has been used as ransom payments for computer hacking. I predict it will soon be used for human ransom as well. Rather than the high risk of transferring dollars, kidnappers may demand digital payment in Bitcoin. This could be a motivation, or excuse, for Big Government to take Bitcoin down. China or Russia also have the computing power to take down Bitcoin, and may want to do so. Why? China has outlawed Bitcoin, may want to take North Korea’s wealth down a peg (keeping them more dependent on China), and could make a huge profit doing this.\nThe point is that it is 1) POSSIBLE and 2) NOT PROBABLE this is a low-probability high-impact event but one that any Bitcoin investor needs to understand – it is possible. Just as it was very weird and surprising how Bitcoin suddenly rose to 20,000 it certainly is possible, that it can really go to zero. Not because of selling but because the network can be brought down. Whether NSA created Bitcoin or not is really irrelevant, they are the only agency in the world with the computing power and intellectual human capital (Cryptographers) capable of 1) understanding Bitcoin and 2) through their surveillance network identifying the real Satoshi if it was in fact NOT NSA and 3) Capable of actually monitoring Bitcoin users and identifying a real human based on Stylometry, a technique for analyzing big data.\nTo understand how the NSA really operates, they record both data and raw data such as encrypted and un-encrypted internet traffic IN BULK for later analysis. The computing power of the NSA is ridiculous, China and Russia don’t come close, nor do any corporations.\nGoing back to their answer; what did we expect them to say? Yes, we did it? Well if they did it certainly would be easy to say it, they have thousands of active projects who cares about MONKEYROCKET. NSA was created and NSA can be destroyed, if it no longer serves the purpose for which it was originally intended. And practically if NSA was doing useful projects like Bitcoin it may be a benefit to their argument proving the need for their existence. As most of us know, there are no real enemies anymore to fight, so having such a big and complex military intelligence apparatus is harder and harder to justify as the new generation of global idiots gets more and more peaceful and dumbed down.\nSo, we’ll appeal it, but will likely get another canned response. In the meantime, we ask anyone who has any documents pertaining to the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto to come forward.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-05-12/did-nsa-create-bitcoin-thats-classified", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://medium.com/@collapsesurvivor/bitcoin-founder-satoshi-nakamoto-was-probably-an-nsa-employee-and-the-nsa-may-destroy-bitcoin-2767c5c865c5"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sean adl-tabatabai news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "freedom of information", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T08:33:58.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "98ff71d6d4bef97495f5b8892fea121b808e69e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHJwElzdoKqcg4Ds6L8oaDsvcB82rtFoxy3gbaripB6Fw53z1liT80f9b.kOvq4WjT0-", "site_full": "wegobusiness.com", "site": "wegobusiness.com", "site_section": "http://wegobusiness.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "WeGoBusiness – Top business stories from around the internet", "title": "Bitcoin – Moldova with New Crypto Exchange and a Token", "title_full": "Bitcoin – Moldova with New Crypto Exchange and a Token", "published": "2018-05-15T03:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://wegobusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin-Moldova-with-New-Crypto-Exchange-and-a-Token.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "98ff71d6d4bef97495f5b8892fea121b808e69e0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHJwElzdoKqcg4Ds6L8oaDsvcB82rtFoxy3gbaripB6Fw53z1liT80f9b.kOvq4WjT0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "WeGoBusiness - Digital Business Academy", "published": "2018-05-15T03:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin – Moldova with New Crypto Exchange and a Token", "text": "Bitcoin – Moldova with New Crypto Exchange and a Token 14 May 2018 8533\nCryptocurrencies have been steadily gaining popularity in Moldova, a former Soviet republic that is economically and politically on a crossroad between East and West. The local crypto community has recently announced developments reflecting this trend – a new exchange and a new token have been presented, both labeled “Made in Moldova”. Add to that an indirect permission from the central bank.\nAlso read: Another Post-Soviet Jurisdiction Welcomes Crypto Miners 10 Cryptos, 8 Currencies\nDrachmae Market will be trading 10 digital coins initially, including leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Core (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Ethereum (ETH), as well as a couple of Moldovan tokens like Zozo coin and Drachmae’s own DTMI token. The trading platform also supports transactions of eight fiat currencies, among which euros, dollars, rubles, and of course, Moldovan leu (MDL). Drachmae Market, set up with the help of the local Digital & Distributed Technology Moldova Association (DTMA), has been announced as the country’s first crypto exchange. It is already accepting subscriptions.\nDTMA was created in the beginning of this year to facilitate the implementation of distributed ledger technologies in the country’s economy. It is also closely working with Moldovan authorities and regulators on a proposal to establish a special tech zone with tax breaks and incentives for blockchain startups. A similar project has been realized successfully in another former Soviet republic – Belarus, where a growing number of fintech companies are now taking advantage of their membership of the Hi-Tech Park in Minsk.\nThe news about the launch of Drachmae Market, which came out from a major blockchain and cryptocurrency event hosted by the Moldovan capital, was covered by both local and foreign crypto media. On Friday, the World Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Summit in Chisinau welcomed participants and speakers representing communities from countries across Europe and Asia, from Lithuania to India, according to Cryptovest . Founder and president of DTMA Lee Gibson Grant announced at the conference that the exchange had received a notice from the central bank, which could be interpreted as an indirect permission to operate legally.\nIn the letter presented at the summit, the National Bank of Moldova basically says that as there is currently no legal framework regulating cryptocurrencies in the country, no authorization is needed to provide crypto trading services, Mybusiness .md reports. At the same time, Drachmae Market will have to comply with the country’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws because it offers trading pairs with fiat currencies. This means its operator is required to share financial data about money flows and processed transactions. Central Bank Softens Stance\nThe correspondence also indicates some softening of the central bank’s position on cryptocurrencies. Last fall NBM released a statement to clarify its stance warning that cryptos are neither issued nor guaranteed by a central bank or a government agency. The bank acknowledged that the “virtual currency represents digital value” and is “used by individuals or legal entities as an alternative to cash,” but stressed that “it is not tied to the national currency.”\n“The use of virtual money is not regulated in Moldova. [Cryptocurrency] is not a form of electronic money in the context of the Law on Payment Services and Electronic Money, and the activities of issuing [digital coins] and executing transactions with them are not controlled by the competent authorities,” NBM pointed out.\nThe financial authority listed a number of risks, to which crypto users are exposed, including fraud, high commissions, loss of funds, market volatility, and last but not least – no guarantees that merchants would accept cryptocurrencies. Cryptos in Moldova, however, are becoming more popular with both users and merchants. For example, a large furniture store in Chisinau announced in December that it had introduced bitcoin payments.\nMoldova still has to catch up with strong regional competitors. Ukraine has a rapidly developing crypto sector whose expansion recently prompted the country’s securities commission chief to state: “The point of no return has been passed.” Moldova’s own separatist region, the unrecognized republic of Transnistria, has adopted crypto friendly legislation that legalizes mining and provides incentives for foreign investors in the sector. Pro-crypto sentiments are also strong in Moldova’s closest neighbor, Romania.\nDo you expect Moldova to quickly catch up with its neighbors in its crypto development?

I hope you don't mind me posting it here, to try and let it exist in a more neutral environment.\nYou may or may not be aware that I have a little podcast where I interview people in the Crypto and Bitcoin space.\nMy little place in the community is as someone who is not the most technically proficient but trying desperately to understand scaling. I know that from my community, there are many like me.\nOne thing most of us can agree on, is that we want Cryptocurrencies to grow, and be successful, therefore we want more people to join, buy coins and spend them. We also encourage people to do their research and understand what they are investing in.\nAs a non-technical person coming into the space, it is very hard to try and find an impartial view on the Bitcoin scaling debate. There are two very passionate camps who appear to have very passionate views on how Bitcoin should be scaled but the tribalism is scary. I have been sucked into this myself at times.\nFrom my experience of this, I have met various people from both camps. So far I have interviewed Jameson Lopp, Charlie Lee, Roger Ver and Craig Wright. Despite the opinions people have on who I choose to interview, I try to be fair and have both sides. Also, I am not perfect, interviewing is something I am learning and new to.\nAn awful lot of work goes into preparing each interview, trying to research as much as I can, so I can try and see the points of view and look for gaps for which I can question. Handling each interview is difficult to, especially trying to manage a discussion, get people to answer tough questions, accept that an interview might move into an unexpected area which I don't have the knowledge of, listen to and respond to the interviewee, while also keep to my own question structure. Trust me, it is much harder than you think, especially when you are up against experienced people, if you don't believe me, try it.\nIn the last week alone I have interviewed a journalist from South America, and thus have been researching the history of Venezuela and socliasm, I have interviewed Roger Ver and Samson Mow, so I have tried to understand the full history of the scaling debate and the current technologies being worked on. I have flown to Japan and back, into England to spend a day with my children and then out to New York. I am not looking for sympathy, I just want people to be aware of what goes into all this.\nI am trying to become more impartial but I will make mistakes and I will make judgements. There are many smart and clever people who have the debate and get into quite good technical detail, there are also many people like me who want things to be a bit simpler and want an impartial view.\nWhen a new investor goes onto Coinbase, they will see two Bitcoin's. If they want to research which to buy, they can be met with a wall of propaganda, hate and accusations. This is very difficult to navigate and I am yet to find a solid impartial breakdown of the two.\nFrom both sides of the debate, I have received abuse, false accusations, insults, heavy criticism of everything from my technical knowledge to my ability.\nThere has also been intimidation and threats.\nEverything which has happened has come from both sides of the debate and from people in both camps.\nYesterday when asking questions about Lightning Network I was told that Roger had got into my head and I was becoming a big blocker. Another person sent me a DM, relentlessly arguing with me, even though I explained I was busy preparing an interview, then told me I am a small blocker idiot. This doesn't help anyone.\nMy own view is that I can see positives and negatives from both sides and I am happy to explore this. There are really smart people working on both sides of the scaling argument, people I respect.\nI will continue to do what I do, whatever people say to me. What I do hope is that people can try and slow down a little, try and talk rather than aggressively pursue their own narrative.\nWhat the scaling debate appears to me is different philosophical, technical and economic views on what should happen and how it should be scaled. If you have a different opinion, that is what it is, a different opinion. All others arguments and accusations which come alongside this are just wrapping the opinion.\nNeither BTC or BCH are going away. It is a live split test and nobody can say with 100% absolute certainty, how this will play out. Both exist today, both will likely exist in a year, both will likely exist in 3 years but as time goes on each will face new challenges.\nMy hope is that both camps now just focus on themselves, focus on their approach and work on their solution. My expectation though is that it won't, the endless infighting, accusations, counter-accusations, abuse and trolling will continue.\nI will do what I do and I appreciate those who have not been abusive and have been thankful and supportive to what I am doing.\nGood luck, happy to answer any non-abusive questions.\nPeter PS I currently mine and own both BTC and BCH but am considering selling all of both to remain as neutral as possible.\n submitted by /u/mccormack555\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T22:19:08.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "75f91f72765d3a7ed1c2b7df484e5b4ec429730b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWlAO5eXvV0jd2Unsnu9Oc5R2u9pMpDcohO9ah6VKMrNGwEijgEmoQk5p23_bdJ4oLr5GgRqx_t2N5r.1ulae3HmmF_rZ9.YTB.HgZ3Gq.fgZImgQTH6Eqcaaroei0nkaMhZVBXBz7yWQ--", "site_full": "news.bitcoin-babe.com", "site": "bitcoin-babe.com", "site_section": "http://news.bitcoin-babe.com/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Joe Lubin and Jimmy Song Make Bitcoin Bet Over Blockchain ‘Magic Dust’", "title_full": "Joe Lubin and Jimmy Song Make Bitcoin Bet Over Blockchain ‘Magic Dust’", "published": "2018-05-15T03:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "75f91f72765d3a7ed1c2b7df484e5b4ec429730b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWlAO5eXvV0jd2Unsnu9Oc5R2u9pMpDcohO9ah6VKMrNGwEijgEmoQk5p23_bdJ4oLr5GgRqx_t2N5r.1ulae3HmmF_rZ9.YTB.HgZ3Gq.fgZImgQTH6Eqcaaroei0nkaMhZVBXBz7yWQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoinbabeau", "published": "2018-05-15T03:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Joe Lubin and Jimmy Song Make Bitcoin Bet Over Blockchain ‘Magic Dust’", "text": "15.05.2018 bitcoinbabeau Без рубрики 0 Post 1 - Advertisement\nSome of the cryptocurrency planet’s most outspoken figures are putting their money where their mouths. Joe Lubin, the founder of the ethereum startup studio Consensys, also Jimmy Song, a partner at Blockchain Capital, hit a handshake in front of an audience of hundreds, possibly thousands of people at the CoinDesk’s Consensus 2018 conference in New York on Monday. The exact terms of the bet haven’t still been sorted out – which will occur on Twitter, the participants stated.\nNevertheless, the broad outlines appeared on point. Lubin bet Song any number of bitcoin that five decades in the future, the blockchain distance will include a number of requests – maybe five – that have won a still to be defined number of consumers. Bitcoin maximalist Song took the wager. To describe how things got to the head, it is needed to back up about 20 minutes. Amber Baldet, former blockchain app lead at JPMorgan, unveiled her new project Clovyr, a decentralized application store which gives users access to projects tied to both people and permissioned, more venture concentrated blockchain networks.\nShe then brought Song and Lubin onstage to get a conversation that instantly took Fire, with Baldet asking what Song idea about Clovyr. His response was brutal: I did not see anything besides buzzwords.” . The reason, he contended, was an undercover disconnect between centralized enterprises and allegedly decentralized applications, which Song disregarded as magical blockchain dust” . A back and forth among Baldet, Lubin and Song cautioned. Lubin sarcastically predicted the next five decades of the cryptocurrency innovation would see only bitcoin 1.0. Song doubled down, saying that I do not really see a lot of this substance gaining much traction, he explained.\nBitcoin, he contended, is the real innovation here.” . Therefore, Lubin issued a challenge: I will bet you any number of bitcoins that you are wrong.” . For the time being, the number of all bitcoin is unknown, as are other terms of the bet. But Song accepted the bet, and Lubin tweeted Song soon afterward: Well which was entertaining. I will be in touch @jimmysong. Pic.twitter.com/HCMg0htspC. , Joseph Lubin May 14, 2018.

Bitcoin ABC Releases Version 0.17.0 For May 15th Hard Fork Network Upgrade https://t.co/3YFgpiS7LR\n— Bitcoin (@Bitcoin) April 5, 2018\nHow is Bitcoin Cash looking today?\nOverall, the value of Bitcoin Cash has diminished over a weekend of back pedalling, caused by a number of different things, namely yet another Mt. Gox coin dump and the raid of South Korean cryptocurrency exchange , UPbit. UPbit are accused of accounting for coins they don’t have, as news of this broke out, people panicked and thus, the markets saw some huge downward movements.\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash is valued at $1,426.59 and is up 2.35%. Ten days ago, Bitcoin Cash was valued at $1,818.63, therefore todays price is a little off reaching the recent highs of Bitcoin Cash, overall though things are now looking more positive.\nAssuming all goes well with the Hard Fork, we may very well see Bitcoin Cash make some positive movements, back up towards its current target of around $2,000.00.\nFor now, we will monitor the movements of Bitcoin Cash and will keep an eye on the impact this Hard Fork has.

NYDFS Approves Expanded Crypto Portfolio\nNew York State Department of Financial Services Superintendent Maria T. Vullo has announced on Monday that Gemini Trust Company LLC has been authorized to offer the custody services and trading of Zcash, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash on its exchange based in NYC. She said: “This action continues New York’s longstanding commitment to innovation and leadership in the global marketplace. With smart and thorough regulatory oversight, the development and long-term growth of the industry will remain thriving.”\nThe addition of Zcash especially seems to have taken the market by surprise, leading to its price jumping over 40% in the last twenty-four hours. Back in March, the founders of the trading venue revealed that adding new cryptocurrency options are high on the company’s agenda this year, with BCH and LTC at the top of the list. Tyler Winklevoss, CEO of Gemini, commented on Monday: “We are proud to be the first licensed exchange in the world to offer Zcash trading and custody services and look forward to providing customers with a safe, secure, and regulated place to buy, sell, and store Zcash, an incredible new form of digital cash.” Surprise CEO Resignation\nChris Lee, Chief Executive Officer at Chinese-run cryptocurrency exchange Okex , has reportedly left his position with the Hong Kong based company. Lee cited personal reasons for his departure, seeking to “start a new life,” the exchange stated on Monday. According to his spokeswoman, Lee added it had been the “greatest pleasure and an honor” to work at Okex and that he will return to the blockchain community after a short break to spend time with his family. The surprising move raised some speculations online as for the reasons. $1 Million Bitcoin Heist Foiled\nAccording to media reports from the state of Georgia, the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office found that five young men had conspired to break into a local home and steal nearly $1 million in bitcoin. Their robbery investigation has reportedly been ongoing since January, following a drug bust. The five young men, Justin Ellison, Trivette Adams, Matthew Schwartz, Jacob South, and Michael McDermont, have been charged with residential strong arm robbery and are being held in a detention center without bond. Australian Sexual Health Provider Held for Ransom\nFamily Planning New South Wales, one of Australia’s largest reproductive and sexual health service providers, has sent out an email to its clients on Monday notifying them that it reported a cyber attack on its website to Australian Federal Police.\n“I want to stress to people that this has absolutely nothing to do with, and has no impact on our clinical medical records, they’ve always been secure,” the organization’s chief executive Ann Brassil said at a press conference on Monday. “There’s no evidence that this cyberattack was on Family Planning NSW itself;…and it appears it was an attack for ransom, so it was financial. The ransom said we are shutting down your website and you pay us $15,000 in Bitcoin for us to release the website, and it had a clock ticking down.” Polish Propaganda\nPolish financial authorities have again been found to spend taxpayers’ money on a smear campaign on social media against investing in cryptocurrencies. Poland’s Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) has issued a new tender order to plan and conduct a campaign aimed at “building awareness” among the public for the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies, pyramid schemes and forex activities unsupervised by the KNF.\nEarlier this year it was reveled that the Central Bank of Poland and KNF had paid over 90,000 PLN (złoty) to, among others, a Polish Youtube content network which represents many popular young local content creators to produce anti-crypto videos .\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates?

So the New York-based startup goTenna, founded in 2012 by Brazilian siblings Daniela and Jorge Perdomo, is partnering with Samourai Wallet to launch an Android app this summer that allows users to send bitcoin payments without an internet connection.\nAnnounced Monday, the txTenna app will enable users to sync up their mobile with a goTenna device, which costs $179 per pair, then toggle the wallet app’s settings to transact offline and send the bitcoin.\n“You need to be able to spend your bitcoin even in disaster areas,” goTenna engineer Richard Meyers told CoinDesk, citing the Perdomo siblings’ recent work in Puerto Rico, where goTenna devices helped people reconnect after Hurricane Maria. “As long as you have a way to charge your phone, you can be up and meshed and communicating.” ALSO READ SportyCo Welcomes Luís Figo and Prepares to Host the World Sports BIockchain Summit\nThe signal needs to be within roughly a mile of another goTenna device to relay the message across the mesh network, a decades-old system for using the internet without wifi or a landline. So far, goTenna has sold more than 100,000 devices that let users tap into the mesh network.\nIf the offline bitcoin user is within a mile of another active device, the transaction could bounce across the mesh until it reaches a user with an internet connection.\n“It offers an alternative that is more censorship-resistant,” Meyers said, adding:\n“It’s going to obscure who you are and where you’re at when making these transactions. So that’s a big privacy advantage there.”\nThis system uses a free, unlicensed radio frequency, and it isn’t the first partnership to explore such potential for cryptocurrency networks. ALSO READ Everipedia Secures US$30M Investment For P2P Encyclopedia On The Blockchain It takes a village\nStepping back, a variety of projects since the Cold War have used relatively cheap and mobile radio setups to broadcast across firewalls and oceans.\nLast year, renowned cryptographer Nick Szabo and blockchain engineer Elaine Ou published a proposal detailing how weak-signal radio transmissions could help boost security and the diversity of connections across the bitcoin network.\nThen, in December, after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission repealed “net neutrality,” fans of ethereum, the world’s second most popular blockchain network, started flocking to mesh network technology meetups.\nWhen net neutrality rules expire next month, internet service providers will no longer be barred from favoring or blocking specific websites and communities. It’s an opportune moment for censorship-resistant tools for bitcoin transactions.\nPerhaps the most important aspect of txTenna is that the cryptocurrency wallet will be an open source project.\nIndeed, it was Samourai Wallet’s open source communication tools on Github that first inspired goTenna’s team to reach out to the bitcoin startup. The same txTenna code could theoretically be applied to iOS wallet applications as well.\nAs Meyers explained:\n“It absolutely could work with any software wallet and they [Samourai Wallet developers] are not writing it specifically for the Samourai wallet anyway. It will be something any wallet provider could send transactions through.”\nImage of Daniela and Jorge Perdomo with goTenna devices via goTenna ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "james bond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samourai wallet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jorge perdomo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard meyers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perdomo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniela", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "starbucks", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T06:40:41.061+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5599adb405ae0942fba4531d7a18c63b49cc9343", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS.sGHG1Lut55pdzN5bzJdEM-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn free bitcoins daily with no investment from internet", "title_full": "Earn free bitcoins daily with no investment from internet", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5599adb405ae0942fba4531d7a18c63b49cc9343", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS.sGHG1Lut55pdzN5bzJdEM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn free bitcoins daily with no investment from internet", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nUse your personal link to invite more people and increase your chances of winning.

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

And while digital currency is still not widely used or understood by many average consumers, Chicago's two main exchanges, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, became the first traditional exchanges to trade the financial products late last year, lending credibility to bitcoin and its lesser-known digital brethren.\nCoinbase is already one of the largest digital currency exchanges around the world. Coinbase's Chicago office will serve as a central hub for some back-office technology behind the company's products, said Paul Bauerschmidt, a former CME executive, who is leading the Chicago office.\n\"It's similar to an exchange that you'd see with ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) or CME or CBOE,\" he said.\nRecruiting people who are able to build and maintain these complicated systems, especially with financial experience, is difficult in other cities, Bauerschmidt said.\n\"The talent that's here in Chicago, you can't find anywhere else,\" he said. \"And especially getting as many of the key staff as we need. It's really exciting to be able to build it here.\"\nThe Chicago office also will focus on courting institutional investors, which manage assets on others' behalf, like banks, hedge funds, mutual funds or pension funds, Bauerschmidt said.\nIn concert with the Chicago launch, Coinbase is unveiling Coinbase Prime, a collection of tools and services specifically for those institutional investors. The products make it easier for these large investors to start trading and manage sophisticated trading systems, Bauerschmidt said.\n--Sponsored Video--\nThe Chicago office currently has just six employees, but it plans to get that number up to 30 this year and reach 100 within three years.\nBitcoin's initial trading value was just pennies in 2010, surging to more than $17,000 at one point in late 2017. It's now trading at just under $9,000. At this point last year, a single bitcoin was worth about $1,800; two years ago it was $445.\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as an alternative to government-issued currency. A number of big companies accept it, from travel website Expedia.com to Subway sandwich shops and even online dating site OkCupid. But because it isn't regulated by a country or other single entity like traditional currency, the price can be volatile.\n(c)2018 Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://ads.memevideoads.com/sas/player/audio.php?sCampaignID=88888889&noSub=t&subColorTo=000000&subColorFrom=000000&inbanner=t&category=Business&page_url=www.arcamax.com&txt=Business%20News%20Sponsored%20Audio%20Content", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-2080632", "https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-2080632&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul bauerschmidt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "business news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "intercontinental exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago mercantile exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago board options exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T20:38:30.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fe3fd023fdcb7e82bf1ca1a98e142f4f07532f11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxyX75Ph4S9SvzB9MTq8pMg8TQlYtY7oXpfUSLtpYYJ11TC.WhzsDNGXij5izyOuuP0FI547ZVCYRr_NGuSl6iez.axbQb__lf5QlTMrvRzoA--", "site_full": "financialanalytics.220w.net", "site": "220w.net", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Nodechain, Inc.

Mr. Wensheng also discussed his investments in alternative cryptocurrencies, and compared the present state of the cryptocurrency sector to that of the internet of the early 2000s.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Is Not Used by Organized Crime Syndicates Says Hong Kong Government Meitu Founder Accumulates Approximately 10,000 in 2018\nIn a recent interview with entrepreneur Wang Feng, Mr. Wensheng revealed that his goal of owning 10,000 BTC had been achieved following extensive accumulation during the bear trend of 2018. “When I clearly saw the future of blockchain and bitcoin, I set a goal for myself – owning 10,000 bitcoins, and now the goal has been achieved,” he said.\nMr. Wensheng claimed that “Back in this January I only had several bitcoins, just to follow the trend.” Mr. Wensheng states that he then “realized that blockchain and bitcoin are the future,” leading to the entrepreneur to “set the goal of accumulating 10,000 bitcoins.” ALSO READ Bitcoin Popularity Surges in South Africa Amid Political, Economic Turmoil\nDespite being enticed by the meteoric gains made by the bitcoin markets in 2017, Mr. Wensheng patiently waited for the markets to retrace. “Last December saw the great spike and I didn’t buy any bitcoin at that time. Later when the price corrected to normal in January, I began the career by buying in bitcoins at low cost,” he recounted. Mindset Critical to Successful Investment\nMr. Wensheng stated that in his view, “the big difference between investment and speculation is the mindset. Suppose you buy in a stock share or a cryptocurrency but the price keeps falling after that, if you are an investor, you will be delighted at the stumble for it means good time to buy more in; on the contrary, if you keep complaining of the slowdown, no offense but I think you are actually a speculator.” ALSO READ A cup of crypto: Starbucks and Dunkin' both discussed bitcoin in their analyst days\nDespite his assertions surrounding the requisite psychology for successful trading, Mr. Wensheng emphasizes the need for new investors to exercise due diligence and caution when entering the markets. “Of course, before you get started, thorough research and analysis is a must,” he said. Cai Wensheng Compares Cryptocurrency Markets to Early 2000’s Tech Boom\nIn the interview, Mr. Wensheng described the current state of the cryptocurrency markets to the boom and bust-prone internet sector of the early 2000’s, stating “It is the similar case with Internet in 2000, startups die away in batches when the Internet bubble burst back then, few made it. While if you bet the right one, the returns are beyond your imagination.”\nMr. Wensheng states that he has “invested in a dozen of blockchain projects,” including “Theta, Ontology, Cortex, Arcblock, Zipper, Yeecall, Dxchain, [and] Charter.” ALSO READ Will Cryptocurrency Replace National Currencies By 2030?\nSo far, Mr. Wensheng claims that “some” of his cryptocurrency investments have yielded “fairly high returns and some are still losing money” – describing the markets’ performance as “reasonable […] as blockchain is still in its early phase and practical applications are lacking, in this way, it needs more support and patience. In the long run, it’s promising and time will tell.”\nDo you agree with the comparison between the cryptocurrency markets and the tech boom of the early 2000’s?

A lot of people value those individuals’ opinions more than anything else. John McAfee is quickly making a name for himself in the cryptocurrency industry. One of his most recent comments will irk a lot of people, though. Calling Bitcoin Private superior to Monero is a very interesting opinion. McAfee Favors Bitcoin Private\nNo one will deny there have been many hard forks of Bitcoin in the past few months. All of these forks attempt to do something different at this stage, but it has become apparent most of these new creations are lacking in one key aspect. More specifically, there are virtually no Bitcoin forks focusing on the features people have been asking for.\nThe main feature Bitcoin lacks at this stage is privacy. Although it offers pseudonymity, there is no privacy to speak of. That is, unless users decide to rely on third-party services such as coin mixers and instant exchanges to convert to and from altcoins. By default, Bitcoin has no privacy or anonymity features, nor will it have such traits anytime soon. Developers are working on potentially implementing such tools, but it is not a big priority at this stage.\nJohn McAfee is a very bullish individual when it comes to specific cryptocurrencies. Despite Bitcoin’s apparent flaws, he expects the world’s leading cryptocurrency to hit a value of $500,000 pretty soon. He is also keeping close tabs on all of the Bitcoin hard forks to determine if any of them have any long-term potential. So far, he hasn’t jumped on board the Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, or Bitcore bandwagons just yet.\nInstead, McAfee does what he is best known for: throwing a curveball. In a recent interview, he stated that Bitcoin Private is the “best hard fork of Bitcoin” to date. That is a very peculiar statement, as very few use cases for BTCP exist at this time. Then again, cryptocurrency speculation has nothing to do with use cases, but rather with hyping up projects.\nThat is not all, though. In the same interview , McAfee said he is confident Bitcoin Private has the potential to ultimately replace Monero. That’s a very peculiar statement, considering that Monero and Bitcoin Private are nothing alike. They both provide privacy, but Monero is mainly focused on anonymity through proper technology. It is a bit unclear how Bitcoin Private plans to handle that aspect in the future.\nThis comment by John McAfee will undoubtedly trigger another major Bitcoin Private price pump.

The new service is expected to provide “reliable, real-time information” for six digital coins across major crypto exchanges. The stated goal is to encourage efficiency and transparency for cryptocurrency investors within the global market place.\nAlso read: Thomson Reuters and Marketpsych Launch Bitcoin Sentiment Index Six Cryptocurrencies Will Be Tracked\nThe new Cryptocurrency Real Time Rates are already accessible through a customized API interface on Thomson Reuters Eikon platform. The application is providing trading data from various crypto exchanges including Bitflyer and Bitpoint . More trading platforms will be added in the future, according to a Reuters report.\nThe announcement comes after a recent Thomson Reuters survey found that cryptocurrency trading by financial firms is likely increase this year. About 20% of 400 finance companies participating in the study are considering entering trading crypto assets within 12 months. That means that one in every five of the undisclosed businesses plans to establish direct contact with cryptocurrencies in 2018.\nPricing data for the real-time rates will cover six cryptocurrencies, not mentioned in the report. The launch of the service could be interpreted as an indication that Reuters is considering embracing the digital asset class on ‎its own trading platforms. In December, the mass media and information giant added bitcoin cash (BCH) to Eikon. BCH became only the third cryptocurrency to list on the platform after bitcoin core (BTC) and ethereum. ‎\nThe latest release comes after an announcement from CME Group which is launching a daily price benchmark for ‎Ethereum, as reported by Finance Magnates . The service will be provided in partnership with the cryptocurrency trading platform Crypto Facilities.‎\nEarlier this year, Thomson Reuters Corp. announced the launch of a new version of the Marketpsych Indices sentiment data feed, which includes analysis of bitcoin market sentiment. The service is provided in cooperation with Marketpsych Data LLC, as news.Bitcoin.com reported in March. 400 news and social media sites, including many specific to cryptocurrencies, have been added to the feed. Each one of them is scanned and scored in real time to ascertain market-moving sentiments and themes. Immense Growth Highlights Strong Momentum\nAccording to Michael Go, head of FX Market Development for Asia Pacific at Thomson Reuters, the immense growth in the cryptocurrency market in the last decade highlights the strong momentum around the new technology and the tradable asset class. “Thomson Reuters Cryptocurrency Real Time Rates enhances our rate offering and helps create a transparent and efficient global marketplace, vital to the future stability of cryptocurrency trading to support the investor,” he commented.\n“As the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Bitflyer has made efforts to facilitate the development of cryptocurrency markets,” said Yuzo Kano, CEO and co-founder of the trading platform. He noted that Bitflyer is the first company to obtain license to trade cryptocurrencies in Japan, the US and Europe. “We are delighted to be able to provide valuable data to customers worldwide through Thomson Reuters,” Kano added.\nPresident and representative director of Bitpoint, Genki Oda, also expressed satisfaction with the partnership on the real-time rates. “We are pleased to cooperate with Thomson Reuters in the further enhancement of its services and hope that our data will become a benchmark for the cryptocurrency industry as a global cryptocurrency trading exchange,” Oda said.\nDo you think the introduction of services like the real-time crypto rates helps the adoption of cryptocurrencies?

The annual Consensus New York conference is underway at the moment and traditionally has a positive impact on the Bitcoin price.\nThe Ethereum (ETH) price hasn’t moved since this time yesterday and remains flat at US$734.81. Ethereum has a market capitalisation of just under US$73.1 billion. Futures exchange CME launched indexes for Ethereum overnight, which many are interpreting as a sign that Ethereum futures could be on the horizon.\nThe Ripple (XRP) price is down 0.5% over the last 24 hours to 74.4 U.S. cents, reducing its market capitalisation to just over US$29.1 billion.\nThe Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price has tumbled 1.5% since this time yesterday to US$1,465.31 per token, leaving it with a market capitalisation of US$25.1 billion. The Bitcoin Cash price has weakened ahead of its highly anticipated Bitcoin ABC upgrade later today. That upgrade will increase the coin’s block size fourfold to 32MB, allowing it to handle more transactions than many of its peers. Experts believe this could lead to increased adoption in the real world.\nThe EOS (EOS) price is down almost 5% over the last 24 hours to US$14.29, reducing its market capitalisation to US$12.2 billion.

Proceeds from selling the “verde” token will be used to reforest a 250-square mile patch of rainforest on the island of Borneo in Indonesia.\nThird-party carbon credits have existed for some time, but they’re difficult to value and hold on a traditional balance sheet. The verde token, in contrast, is fungible and can be redeemed and traded on the public Stellar network, removing friction and opacity from the carbon credit supply chain.\n“For years, we’ve been trying to mitigate environmental impacts at every point in the value chain, however previous solutions still presented significant complexities and costs. said Todd Lemons, CEO and co-founder of Veridium. “Our digital environmental assets are designed to help companies and institutional investors purchase and use carbon credits to mitigate their environmental impacts today, and even hedge their potential carbon liabilities risks in the future.”\nSignificantly, the initiative is not just a proof-of-concept or a pilot program. Nor will the tokens be confined to a private blockchain only available to select companies. Rather — building on IBM’s previous partnerships with Stellar — the credits will be traded across the public Stellar network, enabling the program to have a global reach.\n“By using a public, permissioned blockchain network, we can help Veridium create a new sustainable marketplace that is good for business and good for the world,” said Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president of IBM’s industry platforms and blockchain division.\n“This is a great example of how industries are being reinvented by blockchain, in this case establishing a far more efficient and transparent approach to carbon accounting and offsetting that will empower individuals and companies to play a role in improving our environment,” she concluded.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Arrest Warrants for Crypto Exchange’s Employees\nOn Monday, local media reported that arrest warrants have been issued to employees of a South Korean cryptocurrency exchange. “Three of the company’s executives, who operate virtual currency trading site HTS Coin, were arrested for [suspicion of] fraud and embezzlement,” Money Today wrote.\nThe Financial Investigation Division 2 of the South Korean Prosecutor’s Office “demanded a warrant for three employees, including…[the] CEO of HTS Coin,” Token Post detailed, adding that the other two employees are a program developer and a system operations manager. The news outlet elaborated:\nAccording to the prosecution, Shin [the representative director] and his employees are suspected of taking money out of their accounts by transferring customer funds from a bank account to another account.\nThe publication explained that the three are also suspected of “deceiving investors, [by] pretending to” have cryptocurrencies “on the computer side without having real cryptocurrencies.”\n“The prosecution believes that they have falsified” records and “used the money in the customer’s account as a personal account of the exchange,” Joongang added.\nResponding to media reports, the exchange posted a notice Monday on its website maintaining that “All services except Korean won deposits, such as Korean won withdrawals, coin deposits, and coin withdrawals, are operating normally,” clarifying:\nHTS Coin is currently under investigation by the prosecution and we are working diligently…Unlike external concerns, we still have 100% of your deposits and coins. We keep customer deposits and coins that can be withdrawn promptly even if all customers request a withdrawal at the same time. On-Going Investigations\nAccording to Asiae, an “interrogation of the suspects before the arrest was held in the southern part of Seoul on the morning of the same day,” adding that in March the “prosecutors searched three virtual currency exchanges including Coinnest, and it was reported that HTS Coin was included in the seizure investigation at that time.”\nJoongang confirmed this report, stating that “prosecutors searched three virtual currency exchanges including HTS Coin, Coinnest, and Komid last March.”\nThe news outlet further conveyed that “the prosecution has been investigating the illegal acts of virtual currency trading sites” in collaboration with the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) under the supervision of the Financial Services Commission (FSC). In March, “the investigation resulted in the arrest of four executives including CEO Kim Ik-hwan [of] Coinnest…Kim was handed over to trial last month.”\nLast week the prosecution also started investigating South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Upbit as the regulators announced the widening probe of crypto exchanges.

There is a short-term bullish trend line forming with support at $1,400 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is likely to consolidate in a range below $1,500 before making the next move.\nBitcoin cash price is currently consolidating below $1,500 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD must stay above the $1,400 and $1,360 support levels to remain in a bullish zone. Bitcoin Cash Price Upside Hurdle\nThere were a couple of swing moves in bitcoin cash price above the $1,360 support level against the US Dollar. The price attempted to move above the $1,500 resistance on a couple of occasions. However, buyers failed to gain upside momentum above $1,500. It seems like the price is struggling to clear a strong sell wall near $1,500 and is currently following the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nIt recently traded as high as $1,493 before starting a downside correction. It moved down below the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $1,331 low to $1,493 high. However, the downside move was limited by the $1,400 support area. There is also a short-term bullish trend line forming with support at $1,400 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. Moreover, the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $1,331 low to $1,493 high also acted as a support during the recent slide.\nLooking at the chart , the price must settle above the $1,440 resistance and the 100 hourly SMA to gain momentum. A successful close above 100 hourly SMA could open the doors for a break above the $1,500 resistance in the near term.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is currently flat in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is still below the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $1,400\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,500 Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Consolidating Below $1,500 was last modified: May 15th, 2018 by Aayush Jindal ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "newsbtc bitcoin cash price analysis", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T08:16:18.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bf481972d65f8f2bb14ec49bc02fcd1a771e9e79", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg99LIY.PCY8OGxdlwg4ePu8sRqkbfUb9Q4Xa5Bn6ukhDaRr8Qu1ocNXl5B9v81MVgfLSXK_3KybKhxzuF_JFKY0cS0YDa0CynVZY8bx_6vMxNepVTlwY9rgMNpYA.MfnL0bfT4q14SiOc68tkvmKLfmsHRly5aW0HQ-", "site_full": "wtvbam.com", "site": "wtvbam.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Two Chinese bitcoin mining equipment makers plan $1 billion Hong Kong listings: IFR | News | WTVB", "title_full": "Two Chinese bitcoin mining equipment makers plan $1 billion Hong Kong listings: IFR | News | WTVB", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.631, "main_image": "http://radiocms-images.us1.eldarioncloud.com/resize/1200/https://storage.googleapis.com/media.mwcradio.com/mimesis/2018-05/15/2018-05-15T053349Z_1_LYNXNPEE4E095-OUSTC_RTROPTP_3_TECH-US-BITCOIN-HONGKONG-IPO.JPG?upscale=False", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bf481972d65f8f2bb14ec49bc02fcd1a771e9e79", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg99LIY.PCY8OGxdlwg4ePu8sRqkbfUb9Q4Xa5Bn6ukhDaRr8Qu1ocNXl5B9v81MVgfLSXK_3KybKhxzuF_JFKY0cS0YDa0CynVZY8bx_6vMxNepVTlwY9rgMNpYA.MfnL0bfT4q14SiOc68tkvmKLfmsHRly5aW0HQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Midwest Communications Inc.", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Two Chinese bitcoin mining equipment makers plan $1 billion Hong Kong listings: IFR | News | WTVB", "text": "Two Chinese bitcoin mining equipment makers plan $1 billion Hong Kong listings: IFR Tuesday, May 15, 2018 1:33 a.m. EDT FILE PHOTO: A token of the virtual currency Bitcoin is seen placed on a monitor that displays binary digits in this illustration picture, De\nBy Fiona Lau\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Two Chinese bitcoin mining equipment makers plan to raise up to $1 billion each from Hong Kong listings this year, riding on strong global interest in cryptocurrencies, IFR reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the plans.\nCanaan Creative filed a listing application to the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong on Monday, IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication, reported.\nZhejiang Ebang Communication has also started working with advisers on a proposed Hong Kong float of up to $1 billon, reported IFR.\nEbang listed on China’s National Equities Exchange and Quotations, also known as the New Third Board, in 2015 and was\ndelisted from the over-the-counter market in March after announcing in January that it would seek a Hong Kong listing.\nChinese bitcoin mining equipment makers are hungry for capital to fund their growth as the heightened interest in cryptocurrencies has led to a surge in demand for their machines.\nCanaan, which sells \"Avalon\" mining machines with customised super-fast ASIC chips, made revenue of more than 1 billion yuan in 2017. Although cryptocurrencies can be mined using regular computer equipment, specialised processing devices dedicated to mining are more effective and can generate more income.\nThe company's co-chairman Jianping Kong told Reuters in April that he expected China’s push to promote the domestic chip industry to help drive growth for the company.\nCredit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Canaan's float, according to IFR.\nCanaan Creative declined to comment. Ebang could not be immediately reached for comment. All the banks didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCanaan’s IPO valuation has yet to be set as there is no listed comparable and the prices of cryptocurrencies have\nfluctuated a lot, reported IFR. It was valued at $500 million in mid-2017, IFR said, attributing it to one of the people.\n(Reporting by Fiona Lau at IFR; Additional reporting by Sijia Jiang; Writing by Julie Zhu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman) More From Technology ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ebang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fiona lau", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ifr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national equities exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomson reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhejiang ebang communication", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T09:27:19.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dfd8efc3e383385ec8ab383a7b3242278acc28a8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWYeQ7j8epcUqYumFNcNqp5xK.JgUlw79UPR85JRev6d7QtJ_19OCW9C", "site_full": "helpscoin.cryptograbber.com", "site": "cryptograbber.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Cryptocurrency Exchange Stages Rented Lamborghinis In Front Of NYC Crypto Conference – Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and Fintech Headlines", "title_full": "Cryptocurrency Exchange Stages Rented Lamborghinis In Front Of NYC Crypto Conference – Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and Fintech Headlines", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.079, "main_image": "https://i2.wp.com/helpscoin.cryptograbber.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/cryptocurrency-exchange-stages-rented-lamborghinis-in-front-of-nyc-crypto-conference.jpg?fit=600%2C600", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dfd8efc3e383385ec8ab383a7b3242278acc28a8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWYeQ7j8epcUqYumFNcNqp5xK.JgUlw79UPR85JRev6d7QtJ_19OCW9C", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cryptocurrency Exchange Stages Rented Lamborghinis In Front Of NYC Crypto Conference – Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and Fintech Headlines", "text": "by HELPSCOINADMIN · May 15, 2018\nThere's a big cryptocurrency conference raking in about $3,000 a ticket in New York City this week (we're totally going, obviously) and, as prices … You may also like...

The pair even broke the last swing low and it could continue to decline towards the $1,200 level.\nBitcoin cash price tumbled below key supports against the US Dollar. BCH/USD is now trading well below $1,300 with a bearish angle in the short term. Bitcoin Cash Price Decline\nYesterday, we discussed how $1,480 and $1,500 levels stopped the upside move in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price failed to move above the mentioned levels and declined sharply below $1,400. The decline was such that the price even broke the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,330 low to $1,495 high.\nIt opened the doors for more losses and there was a break below a key connecting bullish trend line with support at $1,410 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair even settled below the $1,300 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average. These are bearish signs below $1,300 and it seems like the price may continue to trade lower in the short term. It is currently trading near the $1,240 level with a lot of selling pressure. If it corrects higher it could test the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,495 high to $1,240 low.\nLooking at the chart , the price may continue to accelerate declines towards the $1,200 level. Any further declines would depend how buyers react around the stated $1,200 support level in the near term.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is accelerating momentum in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD has reached the oversold levels.\nMajor Support Level – $1,200\nPublished at Wed, 16 May 2018 04:08:32 +0000\nAnalysis ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T07:15:52.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d6c613d758bed645827396dc9371fc40cf5366f8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSmCL_6f2hFuztsGaImkvxdh1MJXFRcQV7amLYsgQGQZta.iZqD.rZYLaAde2YYQNygdGiJTD1vcshvEt9XQp.Vrxepta_OB8xgDJHBzjseZvAOE0DKlcI88W36EIjuy87OjcFVphEUtA--", "site_full": "www.cryptofinancenews.com", "site": "cryptofinancenews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Circle Becomes 'Bitcoin Unicorn' With Bitmain-Backed Mega-Round | Crypto Finance News", "title_full": "Circle Becomes 'Bitcoin Unicorn' With Bitmain-Backed Mega-Round | Crypto Finance News", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.267, "main_image": "https://www.cryptofinancenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3131-e1526263523799.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d6c613d758bed645827396dc9371fc40cf5366f8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSmCL_6f2hFuztsGaImkvxdh1MJXFRcQV7amLYsgQGQZta.iZqD.rZYLaAde2YYQNygdGiJTD1vcshvEt9XQp.Vrxepta_OB8xgDJHBzjseZvAOE0DKlcI88W36EIjuy87OjcFVphEUtA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Crypto Finance", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Circle Becomes 'Bitcoin Unicorn' With Bitmain-Backed Mega-Round | Crypto Finance News", "text": "Circle Becomes 'Bitcoin Unicorn' With Bitmain-Backed Mega-Round By © 2017 Crypto Finance News.

What is clear for sure is that EOS, Tron and a host of other cryptos under our radar are reversing their two or three days gain. Spearheading this depreciation is EOS which is down eight percent in the last 24 hours and quickly approaching our main support line at $13.\nLet look at these charts: EOSUSD (EOS) EOS Daily Chart by Trading View\nI mean, with a market capitalization of $15 billion, stakes are high for EOSIO and its co-founder. As we near the launch, investors expect nothing short of success. After all, we might take confidence from Block.One VC partnership and the more than “100” startups that will launch their projects on the new super fast and “near free” EOSIO blockchain. Demand is there yes and the right thing to do by all accounts is to search for coin under-valuation before riding with the trend-at the right times.\nRegardless of the positive sentiment, May 11 candlestick is of significance in our analysis. Then again, in the short term-following EOS ATHs print on April 29, bears are obviously in charge. In line with our previous trade plan , buyers should remain neutral until we see an up-thrust accompanied by strong volumes past $16. Otherwise, consistent EOS sellers might push prices back to our first potential reaction point at $13 and later $9.7 as visible in the daily chart. LTCUSD (Litecoin) Litecoin Daily Chart by Trading View\nAmong other coins, Litecoin is one of the coins under monitor from CCID and published in their monthly Global Public Chain Assessment Index . There are several criteria that the Chinese department shall use to generate reports. This is surely good news and some sort of endorsement for Charlie Lee and Litecoin.\nTechnically, Litecoin is ranging and oscillating between a $70 range defined by $180 and main support at $110. Well, it’s obvious that sellers are in charge considering those series of lower lows in the last four months or so. While fundamentals over the past week have been encouraging, there is no impetus to push prices past the mid range resistance at $160.\nThis means the last four candlesticks are short covering events and as such, every high is a selling opportunity as yesterday’s four percent slide and bear candlestick shows. I recommend trading with the trend today and selling with stops at $155 and targets at $110 looks good. XLMUSD (Stellar Lumens) Stellar Lumens Daily Chart by Trading View\nEven as we continue to rock back and forth, we haven’t heard much from Stellar Lumens in the last couple of weeks despite it being a high liquid coin with a market cap of $6.5 billion. Should those be red flags? Or is there something happening behind the scene? Well, what we do know is that Stellar is down five percent in the last week and four percent in the last 24 hours alone .\nFrom the charts, Sellers are in charge just like most coins under our radar. We can see a brief appreciation in Stellar Lumens prices but the accompanying volumes are low. On May 14 for example, there was a surge in volumes but prices moved lower with yesterday being a follow through. Because of this, trading with the trend can increase our odds of turning in a profit. Risk averse traders shall trade when there is a break below 30 cents while others can sell now with stops at 40 cents. Targets should be at 20 cents. TRXUSD (Tron) Tron Daily Chart by Trading View\nThe cool thing that should excite Tron investors is that BitBNS , an Indian Cryptocurrency exchange shall support EOS and Tron mainnet launch. This is nice as both blockchains seek to gain independence from Ethereum.\nIt is quickly turning out that May 12 and 13 candlesticks were short coverings considering the appreciation without sufficient below average volumes in those two days of hope. Simply following the trend in this case can be profitable and in line with yesterday’s trade plan, our sell triggers lies at 6.5 cents or May 13 lows. Thereafter, targets of 5.5 cents and stops at 7.2 cents look reasonable. IOTUSD (IOTA) IOTA Daily Chart by Trading View\nAfter Michel and Andrew, Andrea Villa is now a member of the IOTA Foundation. Andrea is an IT security expert, a hacker, entrepreneur and a developer. His expertise would be needed to secure the Tangle protocol and other security layers that the IoT leader depends on.\n— IOTA News (@iotatokennews) May 15, 2018\nNow, IOTA is likely to deep if May 11 lead bear candlestick shall define price action. From the chart it is clear that its high low at 2.14 and 1.77 largely define range in the last four days. What is of importance to me is that supply spike which was well over 25M pushing prices lower. The best approach now is to sell IOTA and aim for $1.5 and $1.1 in the short to medium term in line with the existing bear trend. If not, then up thrust and rejection of lower lows above $2.2 shall signal bulls.

The Colorado blockchain-based cash loan provider is launching the SALT Bridge Foundation to create a financial leg up for the estimated two billion unbanked and underbanked people around the world.\nSALT ( named after salt — historically the first commodity-based money) uses blockchain technology and smart contracts to offer a lending program based on cryptocurrencies as a collateral.\nThe mission of the SALT Bridge Foundation is to use blockchain technology and cryptocurrency education and lending services to financially empower those without banking services in the developing world.\nThe SALT Bridge Foundation will provide students with courses in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, and the opportunity to work with nonprofit organizations to implement blockchain technologies in communities around the world.\nDescribing the foundation’s mission as “creating a bridge to cryptocurrency and the understanding of blockchain,” SALT Executive Director Dan Moore said in a release:\n“Blockchain allows us to truly implement the long-held vision of utilizing technology to improve the economic standing and the autonomy of everyone on this planet. I am honored to lead the Salt Bridge Foundation as we contribute to a greater shared future.” Education and Training\nThe foundation is already running a pilot project jointly with Denver-based Regis University College of Business and Economics . Students are learning the basics of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies with courses on financial literacy and the benefits of cryptocurrency and blockchain-based financial systems.\nIn an interview with Bitcoin Magazine , Moore said:\n“We are working with underbanked students at Regis University to provide financial literacy education and aid to be a part of this amazing experience. We are excited to see this program grow and deepen our partnership with such a respected and influential university.”\nHe added, “The chance to apply what you learn in the classroom to the real world for a meaningful and tangible impact changed my entire perspective and this program provided a natural partnership for the work of the SALT Bridge Foundation.”\nAfter completing the course, scholarships enable students in this pilot project to go into the field in Uganda to participate in a social-impact program aimed at improving financial inclusion.\nMoore explained why SALT chose Uganda for their first project:\n“We initially targeted West Africa for a number of reasons: first and foremost, the lack of access to formal financial services results in substantial levels of poverty and with approximately 350 million unbanked adults in Sub-Saharan Africa, there is a tremendous need for the opportunities financial inclusion can provide.”\nHe added, “We have seen progress through the burgeoning mobile ecosystem, which has demonstrated varying levels of success, and we believe the SALT Bridge Foundation can augment that work.”\nThe foundation also plans to train staff from voluntary and nonprofit organizations in how best to use blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies for donation management. Providing a Financial Blockchain Platform for the Unbanked\nThe other component of the foundation involves using the SALT platform by providing access to blockchain-based financial services where traditional systems are out of reach.\nMoore told us they will be using SALT’s own proprietary lending platform, the Secured Automated Lending Technology platform, which operates a lending marketplace for blockchain-based assets, for the pilot project:\n“We plan to use the SALT Lending technology to capitalize on the crypto-collateral we provide in our programs; however, we are not committed to any one blockchain and instead will use whatever tools [are] available to us that fit each program. As this technology progresses and we see increased adoption rates, we’re optimistic about the new possibilities that may become available.”\nMoore expressed a preference for Bitcoin at this stage of the program, saying:\n“At this time, we believe that Bitcoin is the most logical cryptocurrency emphasis; however, in the future, we will utilize the tools that will best help us achieve our vision. Much like SALT Lending, we are blockchain agnostic, and our mission and focus is providing opportunity for the financially excluded; therefore, we welcome any future innovation that aids that mission.”\nLenders are accredited investors in accordance with SEC federal regulations and have passed SALT’s Lending Suitability Test.\nThe foundation hopes to expand its program to other countries and regions and is also exploring ways that it can more effectively help other foundations use, manage and obtain advantage from cryptocurrency holdings.\n“We are passionate about the global social impact we can provide in bringing financial inclusion to this region and look forward to showing the world the true value of this technology,” concluded Moore.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "world", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "salt bridge foundation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T15:28:43.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "980d4275c4a73c6de0bf9e6a0a0ddd9ddec1de28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvegbPgjwKU8hfjJPGzl.qtECqF9eR78FizgGw5felNYagoqiOI.UtGilS6QcHkwKlsY2XSoyTH0LW3va0Ry5bjHz91ecmK..x2YCLM0kCh1cY0.bnmrx_AhZztkVawSRd4uoFGgnEt_.q5q.bnharV32aPEAzfotY-", "site_full": "mymixfm.com", "site": "mymixfm.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "music", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "Two Chinese bitcoin mining equipment makers plan $1 billion Hong Kong listings: IFR | News | MIX-FM", "title_full": "Two Chinese bitcoin mining equipment makers plan $1 billion Hong Kong listings: IFR | News | MIX-FM", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.434, "main_image": "http://radiocms-images.us1.eldarioncloud.com/resize/1200/https://storage.googleapis.com/media.mwcradio.com/mimesis/2018-05/15/2018-05-15T053349Z_1_LYNXNPEE4E095-OUSTC_RTROPTP_3_TECH-US-BITCOIN-HONGKONG-IPO.JPG?upscale=False", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "980d4275c4a73c6de0bf9e6a0a0ddd9ddec1de28", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApvegbPgjwKU8hfjJPGzl.qtECqF9eR78FizgGw5felNYagoqiOI.UtGilS6QcHkwKlsY2XSoyTH0LW3va0Ry5bjHz91ecmK..x2YCLM0kCh1cY0.bnmrx_AhZztkVawSRd4uoFGgnEt_.q5q.bnharV32aPEAzfotY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Midwest Communications Inc.", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Two Chinese bitcoin mining equipment makers plan $1 billion Hong Kong listings: IFR | News | MIX-FM", "text": "Two Chinese bitcoin mining equipment makers plan $1 billion Hong Kong listings: IFR Tuesday, May 15, 2018 1:33 a.m. EDT FILE PHOTO: A token of the virtual currency Bitcoin is seen placed on a monitor that displays binary digits in this illustration picture, De\nBy Fiona Lau\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Two Chinese bitcoin mining equipment makers plan to raise up to $1 billion each from Hong Kong listings this year, riding on strong global interest in cryptocurrencies, IFR reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the plans.\nCanaan Creative filed a listing application to the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong on Monday, IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication, reported.\nZhejiang Ebang Communication has also started working with advisers on a proposed Hong Kong float of up to $1 billon, reported IFR.\nEbang listed on China’s National Equities Exchange and Quotations, also known as the New Third Board, in 2015 and was\ndelisted from the over-the-counter market in March after announcing in January that it would seek a Hong Kong listing.\nChinese bitcoin mining equipment makers are hungry for capital to fund their growth as the heightened interest in cryptocurrencies has led to a surge in demand for their machines.\nCanaan, which sells \"Avalon\" mining machines with customised super-fast ASIC chips, made revenue of more than 1 billion yuan in 2017. Although cryptocurrencies can be mined using regular computer equipment, specialised processing devices dedicated to mining are more effective and can generate more income.\nThe company's co-chairman Jianping Kong told Reuters in April that he expected China’s push to promote the domestic chip industry to help drive growth for the company.\nCredit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Canaan's float, according to IFR.\nCanaan Creative declined to comment. Ebang could not be immediately reached for comment. All the banks didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCanaan’s IPO valuation has yet to be set as there is no listed comparable and the prices of cryptocurrencies have\nfluctuated a lot, reported IFR. It was valued at $500 million in mid-2017, IFR said, attributing it to one of the people.\n(Reporting by Fiona Lau at IFR; Additional reporting by Sijia Jiang; Writing by Julie Zhu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman) More From Technology ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ebang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fiona lau", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ifr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national equities exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomson reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhejiang ebang communication", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T11:42:16.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "086fc2f8f2ce91e926b219ec1f7572abacaa3c1f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQZfW3IdHroeZ4OqT78FEOu9ISM6fHMSLNTBYSxDuyV21onH357KXQBlAl0LvUGQJYzlPnhSa32SFmlqGbBPGm6", "site_full": "www.etftrends.com", "site": "etftrends.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance", "mutual_funds"], "section_title": "", "title": "Consensus Conference: A Catalyst for Bitcoin? - Nasdaq.com", "title_full": "Consensus Conference: A Catalyst for Bitcoin? - Nasdaq.com", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.012, "main_image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/images/dreamit.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "086fc2f8f2ce91e926b219ec1f7572abacaa3c1f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQZfW3IdHroeZ4OqT78FEOu9ISM6fHMSLNTBYSxDuyV21onH357KXQBlAl0LvUGQJYzlPnhSa32SFmlqGbBPGm6", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tom Lydon", "published": "2018-05-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Consensus Conference: A Catalyst for Bitcoin? - Nasdaq.com", "text": "Bitcoin Bears Prowling Despite $9K Trading\nThe fourth annual Consensus conference, one of the largest digital currency and blockchain industry gatherings, kicks off Monday. By some estimates, the conference, held in New York, tripled in size from last year and ticket sales topped $17 million.\nSome crypto market observers also view the Consensus conference as a potential catalyst for bitcoin prices. As of this writing midday Monday, bitcoin, the largest digital currency by market capitalization, was up more than 1.60%.\n“A look at the previous three Consensus Conferences shows significant crypto price movements during and immediately after. This trend has been maintained in all three conferences so far,” reports Bitcoinist . “Thus, it stands to reason that the pattern could continue in 2018. Blockchain conferences create a lot of hype and buzz. Traders are less likely to sell during the duration of these important crypto gatherings as important announcements are expected.”\nSome cryptocurrency market observers believe that if bitcoin can make it back to $10,000, rallies fromt there could be significant. Recently, the Bitcoin Dominance Index has been rising, confirming the dominant perch of the cryptocurrency. After bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrencies are Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Historical View on Bitcoin\n“In 2015, bitcoin prices increased by 23 percent during the conference and continued on a 121 percent rally in the two months that followed. About 500 people attended the 2015 gathering, which took place on September 10,” according to Bitcoinist.\nHistorical data suggest that was not a one-off event.

The state's Department of Financial Services said it also approved Gemini to offer custody services and trading of Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin in the future. Zcash's market value was roughly $1.3 billion on Monday, according to CoinMarketCap.com, while Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin's respective values were $25 billion and $8.3 billion. Bitcoin's <BTC=BTSP> market value was about $150.1 billion. \"With smart and thorough regulatory oversight, the development and long-term growth of the industry will remain thriving,\" Financial Services Superintendent Maria Vullo said in a statement. Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens that use encryption techniques to secure transactions. Industry critics say the market is opaque and vulnerable to risks such as money laundering. Last month, then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman asked Gemini and 12 other cryptocurrency trading platforms to provide details about their operations and safety measures. Zcash incorporates the technology \"zk-snark,\" short for zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge, which lets people trade with each other in anonymity. Gemini said it expects to begin accepting Zcash deposits on Saturday, May 19, with trading to begin three days later. \"We are proud be the first licensed exchange in the world to offer Zcash trading and custody services and look forward to providing customers with a safe, secure, and regulated place to buy, sell, and store Zcash,\" Gemini Chief Executive Tyler Winklevoss said in a statement provided by Vullo's office. The Winklevosses, who are 36-year-old twins, in 2008 reached a $65 million settlement with Facebook Inc and founder Mark Zuckerberg over who had the idea for the social media website. They also competed in the men's rowing competition at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

A team was even sent to Chandigarh following a tip-off though it turned out to be false, said a source.\n\"We had gone to the sessions court to file a report against Kotadiya and plead for an arrest warrant against him under CrPC Section 70. We could not get it as the court was closed. We should have the warrant with us on Tuesday morning,\" said AA Shaiyad, deputy superintendent of police, CID (crime).\nMeanwhile, the police have transferred the 119 bitcoins recovered from Paladiya's Binance e-wallet to a wallet opened by the special investigation team. Officers said they plan to convert the cryptocurrency into Indian rupees and seize it.\nThe CID first served summons on Kotadiya on May 4. Officers issued more summons after they didn't receive any response from the former MLA. On May 7, Kotadiya released a press statement claiming that he was being \"framed by the conspirators\". He also claimed that Shailesh Bhatt was the main conspirator and that he had also kidnapped two investors and extorted 2,300 bitcoins from them.\nOn May 9, Kotadiya also faxed a letter to the CID Crime and in which he pleaded the officials to not to carry out the third summons since he was allegedly out of Station and will only be able to return on May 11 or 12. He cited his reasons as he was not able to get transportation to get back to the city during the summer holiday rush in public transportation. Because of this, they waited but the officials claimed that he did not show up at the designated time and not even on Sunday.

The Bitcoin asset management platform has designed this new product to cater to long-term hodlers. The LedgerX Bitcoin ‘Call Overwrite’\nLaunched on May 15th, the LedgerX Bitcoin savings account enables investors to earn a fiat-based yield on their Bitcoin holdings. Instead of hodling in the hope of a significant price increase, savers can now earn revenue from a call overwrite. Usually, overwrite contracts are for assets that are deemed to be undervalued or overvalued. The trader overwrites calls if the latter is the case and overwrites puts if the former is the case. ALSO READ Love Turns Ugly as Woman Arrested for Bitcoin Murder-For-Hire Plot\nWith this investment technique, traders deposit Bitcoin in their LedgerX accounts. The trader then sets a call option sold at a longer date with an accompanying slightly higher strike call option. LedgerX already offers similar trading techniques, but this new product makes the process a lot less complicated.\nThe new Bitcoin savings account will enable less finance-savvy investors to earn USD premiums on their Bitcoin holdings. Traders have the freedom to select both the number of bitcoins and the premium rate. Options contracts on the new account will be offered in both three months and six months duration. LedgerX will also charge a transaction fee for the product. ALSO READ Roger Ver Says Ethereum May Overtake Bitcoin in Market Cap CFTC Regulations\nLedgerX’s new Bitcoin savings account is provided under license from the CFTC. The company has both the CFTC derivatives clearing organization (DCO) and the swap execution facility (SEF) licenses . In an interview with Forbes , Juthica Chou spoke about the importance of being a licensed Bitcoin company. The LedgerX co-founder and CTO said that the company’s products are all in compliance with statutory regulations. She also said LedgerX takes a deliberate approach to ensuring that it stays within the confines of the law.\nCommenting on the new product, Chou expressed optimism that it would become a favorite of the company’s customers. The LedgerX CTO based her confidence on the current trading pattern already established in the company. According to Chou, more than 70 percent of LedgerX’s trading volume comes from similar Bitcoin options contracts. ALSO READ Bitcoin ‘Is a Screaming Buy Right Now,’ Says Pantera Capital CEO\nLast quarter, the company also recorded a notional transaction average of $30 million per month. Another reason for Chou’s optimism is the Bitcoin volatility which makes call overwrites an attractive investment strategy.\nWill the LedgerX Bitcoin savings account encourage more long-term holding of the cryptocurrency?

A communication was sent to BitOasis users yesterday that beginning Tuesday; no more dirham can be withdrawn from the exchange, leaving users with today only to transfer their balance elsewhere or top it up with more dirham if wanted.\nUsers wanted to make credit card deposits can do so at the reduced fee of four percent until June 16. According to BitOasis, the issuing bank of the exchange is the only problem, and the average trading of cryptocurrencies such as BTC, BCH, ETH, XRP, LTC, XMR, and ZEC will remain as general, as will cryptocurrency withdrawals from the exchange into private wallets. Arabian Business extracts the statement as informing BitOasis users the following:\n“If you choose to leave your fiat balances the only method for you to withdraw your funds at any time following May 15th would be to change it to cryptocurrency and transfer it to an external wallet.”\n“If you want to hold your AED fiat advantages back May 15th, currently we do not have a date on if we will continue reactivating AED fiat withdrawals, but we are hard at an effort to provide our consumers with this service.”\nThere is none time as of though for the reactivation regarding dirham withdrawals and deposits by wire transfer, although BitOasis have assumed it should be immediately.\nThe exchange, which works in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait, has suspended withdrawals in the past as completely, halting transfers to and from Emirates NBD, Noor Bank and Mashreq bank accounts in 2017 for a short time Gulf News announced that customers experienced limited withdrawals while further verifications were also rejected and that the problem was due to regulatory pressure from inside the UAE at the time. 360 Total Security saves its users from crypto-mining malware\nEntrepreneur Ola Dudin of Jordan established BitOasis in 2014 as a hybrid wallet/exchange, and the exchange has been working since then, listing Zcash as lately as April 23, 2018.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. After listing Bitcoin futures in December of last year, CME launched two indexes tracking Ethereum on Monday. Though the company has denied plans of adding another new product, speculation is rife that Ethereum futures may be added in the future. Ethereum futures will offer the institutional players an opportunity to diversify their trading into the top two cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Software developer Kx Systems has also launched cryptocurrency trading on its while label forex trading platform . The software supplier serves a few investment banks and hedge funds. Nasdaq is also not to be left behind. It is providing the technology to the new centralized crypto exchange, DX, which will offer trading in the market’s top six cryptocurrencies. The stage is being set for the institutional players to take the plunge. So, should the retail investors buy and hodl? We believe that the large players might first push prices down, accumulate at lower levels and then boost prices. Hence, retail investors should stagger their purchases instead of buying all at once. Let’s see if we find any buy setups on the charts. BTC/USD For the past three days, Bitcoin has been taking support at the 50-day SMA. The bulls will strongly defend the support zone between $7,900 to $8,400 because if this cracks, a fall to $7,000 will be on the cards. If the support zone holds, the cryptocurrency will stay range bound between $7,900-$10,000. The 50-day SMA has been flat for the past few days while the 20-day EMA has become flat in the past week. This shows that the BTC/USD pair will soon enter a period of consolidation. The resistance of the range is well established at $10,000, but the supports are still unclear. It will either be $7,900 or $6,700. Hence, we suggest waiting for a couple of days before clarity emerges. ETH/USD The dip in Ethereum below the 20-day EMA was aggressively purchased on May 14, resulting in a move back to the overhead resistance of $745. Currently, the ETH/USD pair is looking strong as it is holding above the $700 levels. This increases the possibility of a break out of $745 levels once again. Aggressive traders can take a very short-term long position above $750 with a close stop loss. The target is $838, but this is a very risky trade, hence, should be attempted with only about 30 percent of the usual position size. On the downside, the critical support levels are $637, $600 and the 50-day SMA at $570. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash bounced back sharply from the lows on May 12, but it is struggling to sustain above the 20-day EMA and break out of the small downtrend line. The BCH/USD pair may form a very short-term head and shoulders pattern, which will complete on a breakdown and close below $1,270 levels. This bearish pattern has a target of $650, but it is unlikely to be a straight fall because the digital currency has strong support at $1,221, then at the 50-day SMA at $1,100 and finally at $800. If the neckline of the H&S pattern doesn’t break down and prices break above $1,520 levels, Bitcoin Cash can rally back to $1,800 levels. Traders should wait for prices to break and close (UTC) above the downtrend line before buying. XRP/USD Ripple broke below the 50-day SMA on May 11 but found strong buying support at $0.632 levels on May 12. Currently, it has climbed back above the 50-day SMA. On the upside, it will face a strong resistance at $0.76, which was previously the support of the range. The 20-day EMA is just above this level, which will also act as a resistance. If both these levels are crossed, the XRP/USD pair will become positive, and the probability of a rally to $0.9377 levels increase. If the bulls fail to scale above the overhead resistance, the cryptocurrency can slide to $0.56-$0.58 levels. XLM/USD Stellar bounced off the 50-day SMA on May 12, but the pullback is facing resistance at the 20-day EMA. If the bulls break above the 20-day EMA, a rally to $0.45 levels is possible. If the XLM/USD pair turns down from the moving average but takes support at the $0.334 levels, it will be a positive sign and we can expect a break out of the 20-day EMA within a couple of days. However, a break below the 50-day SMA will increase the possibility of a head and shoulders pattern, which can sink the digital currency to the $0.20 levels. Therefore, traders should wait for buying to emerge before establishing long positions. LTC/USD Litecoin broke below the 50-day SMA and the horizontal support on May 11 but quickly rebounded from the lows on May 12. Currently, the bulls are trying to sustain above the $141 levels, which is a positive sign. Any up move in the LTC/USD pair will face resistance between $167 and $173 levels. The 50-day SMA has still not turned up and the 20-day EMA is also turning down. Hence, we don’t anticipate a break out above the downtrend line. On the downside, a break below the $132.163 level opens up a downside target of $115. As we don’t find any buy setups, we are not recommending any trade on it. ADA/BTC Cardano plunged below our second stop loss on May 12 but took support at the 50-day SMA and the trendline. The ensuing up move is facing resistance close to the 20-day EMA. Currently, prices are again sliding towards the trendline support. If the ADA/BTC pair breaks the trendline support, it can decline to 0.000025 levels, which is a strong support. On the other hand, if the trendline holds, Cardano will again try to scale above the 0.00003445 levels. There are no reliable buy setups, hence, we are not proposing any trade on it. IOTA/USD IOTA is currently sandwiched between the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. The bulls are defending the horizontal support at $1.63 while the bears are defending the 20-day EMA. If the IOTA/USD pair climbs above the 20-day EMA and the overhead resistance at $2.2117, it will become positive. Though there is a minor resistance at $2.6977, we believe that it will be crossed if the digital currency closes (UTC) above $2.2117. We should wait for the breakout before suggesting any long position. EOS/USD On May 12, EOS bounced off the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement and the bottom trendline of the descending channel. For the past three days, it has been facing resistance at the $15.1390 levels. On the upside, the EOS/USD pair will face resistance at the 20-day EMA and the top trendline of the descending channel. A breakout and close (UTC) of the channel will be a bullish sign and can be purchased by keeping a stop loss below the May 12 lows. If the price fails to rally above the overhead resistance it can again decline to the 50-day SMA. A sustained move below $12.4810 will weaken the digital currency.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. The charts for the analysis are provided by TradingView .
