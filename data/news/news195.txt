Experts are unsure", "text": "How much energy does Bitcoin mining require? Experts are unsure 2018-05-21T13:10:25Z By Eric Brackett\nContent Provided by\nHow much energy does crypto mining really use? One recently released study conducted by Alex de Vries says that Bitcoin mining consumes 24 THw of energy or as much as Ireland. To make matters worse, the study estimates that Bitcoin’s energy use is doubling every six months. By the end of 2018, Bitcoin could use as much as 67 THw or the annual energy consumption of the Czech Republic.\nWhile those numbers might seem high, things may not be as bad as they sound . For starters, one of the main issues with Bitcoin mining is that it was originally powered in large part by coal plants in China. In recent years, however, China has worked to rein in its pollution problem, and many Bitcoin mining operations have moved to countries which make use of cleaner energy.\nAnother issue is the matter of distribution. Comparing Bitcoin’s energy usage to countries such as Ireland or the Czech Republic is useful to help visualize the scope of their operations, but that doesn’t tell the full story. Bitcoin mining can happen from anywhere in the world so no one country’s infrastructure is bearing the brunt of the cost.\nBeyond that, there are numerous experts who dispute this study’s findings.Jonathan Koomey, a professor at Stanford who, in the 1990s, disproved similar fears about the internet, says there simply isn’t enough data available to draw conclusions.\n“For two decades, people have been eager to overestimate electricity use by computing,” Koomey told NBC News . “My concern is that we simply don’t have adequate data to come to the strong conclusions that he’s coming to.”\nOne of the issues Koomey points out is that it is difficult to determine how the value of the energy used in Bitcoin mining and the price paid for that energy.

Experts are unsure", "text": "How much energy does Bitcoin mining require? Experts are unsure 2018-05-21T13:10:25Z By Eric Brackett\nContent Provided by\nHow much energy does crypto mining really use? One recently released study conducted by Alex de Vries says that Bitcoin mining consumes 24 THw of energy or as much as Ireland. To make matters worse, the study estimates that Bitcoin’s energy use is doubling every six months. By the end of 2018, Bitcoin could use as much as 67 THw or the annual energy consumption of the Czech Republic.\nWhile those numbers might seem high, things may not be as bad as they sound . For starters, one of the main issues with Bitcoin mining is that it was originally powered in large part by coal plants in China. In recent years, however, China has worked to rein in its pollution problem, and many Bitcoin mining operations have moved to countries which make use of cleaner energy.\nAnother issue is the matter of distribution. Comparing Bitcoin’s energy usage to countries such as Ireland or the Czech Republic is useful to help visualize the scope of their operations, but that doesn’t tell the full story. Bitcoin mining can happen from anywhere in the world so no one country’s infrastructure is bearing the brunt of the cost.\nBeyond that, there are numerous experts who dispute this study’s findings.Jonathan Koomey, a professor at Stanford who, in the 1990s, disproved similar fears about the internet, says there simply isn’t enough data available to draw conclusions.\n“For two decades, people have been eager to overestimate electricity use by computing,” Koomey told NBC News . “My concern is that we simply don’t have adequate data to come to the strong conclusions that he’s coming to.”\nOne of the issues Koomey points out is that it is difficult to determine how the value of the energy used in Bitcoin mining and the price paid for that energy. He is unsure of where de Vries is getting the two numbers he uses for those values.\n“The worry is that those are two numbers that are picked out of the air,” said Koomey. “There may be some basis for them, but it’s a very unreliable way to do these kinds of calculations, and nobody who does this for a living would do it like that. It’s odd that someone would.”\nThe other issue is the accessibility of Bitcoin data.

Background\nBitcoin mining , as we have written about before , is when computers solve mathematical problems to validate transactions on the Bitcoin network. They do this because of the possibility of receiving a Bitcoin reward. There are many computers (nodes) working on every transaction, thousands even, but only one will win the prize each time.\nHelp us to make Finance Magnates better!\nThe calculations are programmed to become more difficult as more bitcoins are released, so that now only companies that can afford to set up massive rooms with hundreds of devices working on the problems can expect to make a profit.\nThe calculations are driven by electricity. As Bitcoin becomes more valuable, more people begin mining, more Bitcoin is mined, and the calculations become harder. Thus, the amount of electricity used keeps on growing. Estimates\nde Vries bases his estimate on a number of factors.\nFirstly, as of March 2018 the proportion of computer operations to accepted validations was 8.7 quintillion to one (26 quintillion/3 approved transactions per second).\nThese figures are not sufficient to estimate electricity usage because the machines used to mine can vary wildly – they can be specialist machines, home computers and even playstation game consoles. Moreoever, not even the number of machines can be calculated because a node could consist of mean several machines.\nWhat can be seen is that the most energy-efficient device on the market at the moment is the Antminer S9. de Vries uses this to calculate a minimum figure of 2.55 gigwatts – for perspective, the entire nation of Ireland uses 3.1 gigawatts.\nThis is a lower estimate not only because it is based on the most productive mining device, but also because it does not take into account the additional equipment required to cool the machines – which can become as hot as room heaters. This is factor is particularly significant because the majority of mining takes place in centres where thousands of machines are held in a single room, which compounds the heat problem.\nOn this subject, information is either conflicting non-existent, and de Vries cannot draw any meaningful conclusion. He told Motherboard : “Right now we’re just looking at extremely limited data. There is some information available, but its often conflicting. One of the first things we should do is try to get more information about these facilities and then we can better understand them. But for now it’s a black box and its really hard to get a good number out of it.”\nUndeterred, he used profit calculations to arrive at an estimated figure for an upper limit of Bitcoin mining profitability.\nFactoring in maintenance costs of the major Bitcoin mining operations (electricity cost, equipent purchase and upkeep, retail worth of one bitcoin), he comes to a figure of 7.57 gigawatts.\nThis is his estimate of how much a company would have to burn in order exceed profitability; he assumes that they currently are profitable by virtue of their continued operation.\nHe estimates that this figure could be reached by the end of 2018. He bases this on production figures; Bitmain, a major miner and manufacturer of mining machines, he says “could” produce 6.5 million Antminer S9 devices in 2018, which together would have the ability to burn 8.92 gigawatts.\nThis figure exceeds the yearly demand of the nation of Austria (8.2 gigawatts), a first-world country of 8.7 million, or more sensationally, 0.5 percent of the entire world.\nde Vries told Motherboard : “There are some diehards in the Bitcoin community that don’t want to talk about this because they hold Bitcoin and think it’s damaging. But overall I’m getting a lot of really positive reactions from people who are happy that I’m trying to understand this problem which is growing quite rapidly.”\nFinancemagnates.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRisHN0415X-E5Ru16ORunEn_qNxIuhGgZIlFqtW8ul0HEpg/viewform?usp=sf_link", "https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/growing-bitcoin-mining-industrys-energy-demand-causing-blackouts/", "https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/infographic-much-cost-mine-one-bitcoin-country/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T18:15:36.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "232d12a6d243a1830174cd9b8b97bca7207476d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbpnls0Kp17XOK61FZ_qCZA-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "What coin in the future can take the place of bitcoin?", "title_full": "What coin in the future can take the place of bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-21T16:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "232d12a6d243a1830174cd9b8b97bca7207476d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbpnls0Kp17XOK61FZ_qCZA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "deklitt", "published": "2018-05-21T16:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "What coin in the future can take the place of bitcoin?", "text": "Quote: from: eashikde on May 16, 2018, 07:50:34 AM Now appear a lot of different coins, and there are existing ones from the top 10 ... who of them can take the place of bitcoin?\nIt is true that the growth of new altcoin is currently very fast but i think to replace the role of bitcoin as a source of crypto trade is highly unlikely, and with top 10 altcoin at this time may not necessarily replace the role of bitcoin in the future", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T18:04:57.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e7b61d3dd89828d05adacb968f0295e45dd623a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSj9kks7Ck.pAFIiV8cKD19F34I4TzybGlYOG0DHmcTEhYaxrIl.MeCttH9o0b0uBaJ6kKI8K6vuL73XVyFb3x8uX.xCR54I4Cu7MwPgpJYFnUGxWZwI01RXYoZC6s1v12kSPkDzCNAXX6eyfpm9g0E", "site_full": "medium.com", "site": "medium.com", "site_section": "https://amrank.info/feed", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "Amrank Real Estate", "title": "Why Gold Is The King Financial Asset, Not Bitcoin – Cash Metals Trade – Medium", "title_full": "Why Gold Is The King Financial Asset, Not Bitcoin – Cash Metals Trade – Medium", "published": "2018-05-21T16:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://amrank.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Why-Gold-Is-The-King-Monetary-Asset-Not-Bitcoin-–-Money-Metals-Exchange-–-Medium.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 380, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e7b61d3dd89828d05adacb968f0295e45dd623a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSj9kks7Ck.pAFIiV8cKD19F34I4TzybGlYOG0DHmcTEhYaxrIl.MeCttH9o0b0uBaJ6kKI8K6vuL73XVyFb3x8uX.xCR54I4Cu7MwPgpJYFnUGxWZwI01RXYoZC6s1v12kSPkDzCNAXX6eyfpm9g0E", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bad Fox", "published": "2018-05-21T16:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Gold Is The King Financial Asset, Not Bitcoin – Cash Metals Trade – Medium", "text": "Bad Fox 1 hour ago 0 0 1 minute read Google+ VKontakte Odnoklassniki Telegram Viber There appears to be a whole lot of misinformation being peddled on the web about gold and bitcoin . One main false impression is the notion that bitcoin will change gold as a financial instrument. Some analysts, as soon as stanch treasured metals advocates now turned crypto aficionados, imagine in such theories that there’s an excessive amount of gold on this planet for use as cash or that it’s now only a barbarous relic. Only a yr or so in the past, these identical supposed analysts have been criticizing the Mainstream media monetary community speaking heads for calling gold as a barbarous relic, however now have jumped on the bandwagon. Effectively, in a single small manner, who can blame them. It has been irritating holding onto gold and silver patiently ready for his or her inevitable rise. So, when Bitcoin and the crypto costs moved up exponentially final yr, promising traders huge riches sooner or later, it was simple for a lot of to drop the valuable metals and transfer into the crypto market. The mindset in the present day is to make a number of cash doing nothing. Thus, it’s not shocking to see many fall into this delusion and mind-set. A couple of of the crypto aficionados inform their followers that gold can’t be a financial asset as a result of there are hundreds of thousands of tons of gold hidden in secret vaults or that there are billions of ounces locked away within the Grand Canyon. Whereas this may occasionally sound like fairly an attention-grabbing conspiracy, there isn’t any sound proof to again it up. To imagine in these fanciful conspiracies defies all logic. Nevertheless, with logic being in brief provide at the moment, I’m not stunned that many imagine in these fairy tales. Considered one of these ex-precious metals, now a extremely certified cryptoanalyst, steered in a latest video that the “Gold is owned by the Bankers” so why would you wish to personal gold? Sadly, this can be a false assertion. Whereas the Central banks personal a whole lot of gold, it’s rather a lot lower than what the non-public traders and jewellery homeowners maintain. In keeping with the World Gold Council, jewellery accounted for the biggest shares of above floor gold at 90,700 metric tons (mt), adopted by 40,000 mt of personal funding, 32,600 mt of Central financial institution holdings and 26,700 mt of Industrial utilization and different: Of the entire 190,000 mt of the world above floor gold shares, jewellery consists of 48%, non-public funding 21%, Central financial institution 17%, and Industrial and different at 14% (Supply: World Gold Council — Complete above-ground shares 2017) So, if we understand that just about half of all above-ground gold shares are within the type of jewellery, after which one other 21% is owned by non-public traders, Central banks DO NOT personal many of the gold.

And while some critics take issue with these figures, few disagree that the digital currency's energy use is a problem that's only getting bigger.\nEconomist Alex de Vries studies bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which were invented in 2008 by an anonymous computer programmer . Bitcoin allows people to buy and sell things directly from each other without the use of intermediaries, like banks or currencies controlled and manipulated by governments.\nAnalysis How blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin, could change your life Is bitcoin an environmental hazard? Bitcoins are exchanged along a public digital ledger, known as a blockchain, where every move is tracked and verified by computers doing complex mathematical calculations, called hashes. Those willing to lend a hand in verifying the transactions and building the blockchain are rewarded with bitcoins.\nIf it sounds complicated, that's because it is. It's also hard work.\nDe Vries estimates that globally, computers on the bitcoin network are currently crunching 26 quintillion hashes — that's millions of trillions, or 26 followed by 18 zeros — every second of every day.\nBitmain, by far the biggest player in the bitcoin world, has locations where tens of thousands of computers are mining at the same time. (Qilai Shen/Bloomberg) It takes quite a bit of computational power to pull that off, and de Vries is among those taking a stab at figuring out just how much energy is used in conducting all that work, publishing his latest survey — the first peer-reviewed research on the topic — in the scientific energy journal Joule .\nBy his math, computers hashing for bitcoins — known as \"miners\" — are currently using at least 2.5 gigawatts of power, and are on track to collectively suck up more than three times that by the end of this year. That's more than Ireland, Austria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and most Canadian provinces currently each use.\n'It is growing fast' De Vries also estimates the industry's voracious appetite for juice has doubled in the past six months, possibly due to new interest in bitcoin — their price spiked to just under $20,000 each at the end of last year — but also because energy-consumption growth is baked in: the supply of undiscovered bitcoins is dwindling so it takes more work to find those left.\nIn the early days, it was comparatively easy to find a bitcoin, as there were fewer miners competing for the work. Mining could be done by hobbyists using personal computers. But as the digital currency's popularity — and value — has skyrocketed, the increased complexity of the blockchain requires more energy and computing power to solve equations, and now there are specialized computing farms mining for bitcoin.\nChinese bitcoin miners eye sites in Quebec, Manitoba By de Vries' math, a single bitcoin transaction uses as much electricity as a typical Canadian home would consume in a month — and there are 200,000 transactions being processed each day.\n\"Bitcoin has a big problem,\" de Vries wrote. \"And it is growing fast.\"\nBut de Vries' numbers and methodology are not without their critics. The economist comes up with his estimates by assuming most large-scale miners are using the most energy-efficient devices possible, then factors in how many machines are known to be in use and the cost of electricity where these machines are known to be clustered.\nHe admits he's taking educated guesses, partly because many bitcoin miners operate in relative secrecy.\nResearcher and economist Alex de Vries has been charting his best guess at bitcoin's electricity usage on Twitter at @DigiEconomist for more than a year now. (Alex de Vries) Stanford University lecturer Jonathan Koomey says de Vries' work makes far too many leaps of logic, which results in assumptions that are likely wildly out of step with reality.\n\"We know there's a lot of electricity used and we know there's rapid growth,\" Koomey said in an interview. \"But nobody has been in these facilities and we don't have information on the servers themselves.\"\nThe 800-pound gorilla of the bitcoin world is a Chinese company called Bitmain , which has huge operations in Mongolia and remote parts of China. Bitmain is a fascinating player as the company both mines for bitcoin itself, but also sells mining equipment to others.\nCanadian couple invests $100K to build backyard bitcoin mine\nTheir most efficient model, known as an Antminer S9, has the computational power of about a half-million PlayStation 3 gaming consoles, but uses as much wattage as a dishwasher in the process, according to de Vries.\nIt's not hard to imagine how 20,000 of those devices — as one of Bitmain's locations in Mongolia is believed to have — would net an eye-watering electricity bill.\nIndividual bitcoin-mining machines, such as these, have large demands for energy, partly because of the heat that they emit. (Glen Kugelstadt/CBC) It's also not hard to understand why many of the largest mining facilities are set up in cold-weather places with a steady supply of cheap power, such as Manitoba, Quebec and Iceland . \"Rational agents would undertake mining while the marginal costs are lower,\" de Vries said.\nWe still don't know exactly how much power they're using or how much they pay for it.\nDe Vries admits his work is only meant to be a starting off point for future research. \"I think everyone agrees on the minimum energy consumption. But the future estimate? That's actually quite debatable,\" he said.\n\"We don't really have a common approach to getting to a future estimate of electricity consumption right now, which is why I am hoping to get this conversation started.\"\nBitcoin price seesaws up to $11,000 US and down to under $9,000 then back up again But Koomey argues it's classic scaremongering to worry about the electricity use of new technologies. Twenty years ago, he recalls that the media was full of stories about how internet usage was growing too rapidly , and reportedly destined to consume as much as half of all electricity in the world.\n\"I've seen this happen over and over,\" said Koomey. \"That was bunk, [so] people shouldn't jump to conclusions.\"\n\"To be clear, [bitcoin mining] is a big user of electricity and growing rapidly,\" he said. \"But we need to be careful to not to overhype the problem.\"\nKoomey said he puts more stead in the work of Marc Bevand, another researcher who suggests de Vries is overestimating bitcoin's power consumption, possibly by twice as much. ( Bevand has published a detailed criticism of de Vries' work online. )\n'Digital versions of Beanie Babies' Regardless of the electrical toll, some argue any amount of time and effort that is going into the mining of bitcoin is a fruitless folly.\nAndreas Park, a finance professor at the University of Toronto, likens the digital currency to a major fad of the 1990s.\n\"Bitcoin, such as it is, has little-to-no use. So we are effectively using our planet's resources to secure people's digital versions of Beanie Babies,\" he told CBC News in an email.\n\"I am a fan of decentralization and blockchains, but I sincerely hope that we find mathematically and economically sound alternative approaches soon that replace this waste of resources.\"\nWhat's fuelling the potential bitcoin mining boom in Canada\nAbout the Author Pete Evans\nSenior Writer, CBCNews.ca\nPete Evans is the senior business writer for CBCNews.ca.

We want to remove that uncertainty and by working with the most knowledgeable experts, Bitcoin.live will be a one-stop-subscription service to end all the cryptocurrency confusion. ” Designed to be affordable and accessible, the platform will launch with at least six dedicated analysts, available to provide their expertise, with more to contribute as the platform begins to expand.

While most of the cryptocurrencies are much below their earlier highs but there are newer and newer predictions coming up for cryptocurrencies. One such prediction is that Bitcoin can rise to as high as $ 50,000 in the calendar year 2018.\nA cryptocurrency portfolio manager by the name of Jeet Singh, stated at World Economic Forum in Davos, that the current volatility is completely normal when it comes to the cryptocurrencies space. He also stated that it is normal for cryptocurrencies to fluctuate by 70% to 80%. This is one of the main reasons why the current volatility does not worry him at all. [sm_bitcoin_price]\nHe compared cryptocurrencies to the current bellwether companies like Microsoft as well as Apple. Initially, their stocks were also pretty volatile. However, as the companies develop their business model, the stocks not only rose but they become much more stable as well.\nHowever, many of the investors are actually currently worried due to the high volatility in cryptocurrencies. According to him, however, long-term investors need not fear the volatility at all. Since they are here to stay for a longer period of time, they would have no problem at all in holding the cryptocurrencies for a longer period of time as well.\nHe further added that Bitcoin would reach as high as $ 50,000 this year. If indeed that happens, the current price of Bitcoin being around just $ 10,000, that would be a fivefold increase once again.\nWhether the portfolio manager is right or wrong, only time would be able to tell. The truth is that currently, many of the investors are worried about putting new money into Bitcoins. Only once they are sure that the volatility would end and the Bitcoin resumes its uptrend you can be sure that most of the investors would actually get ready to invest in this cryptocurrency.\nFor now, however, most of the investors are keeping away from the cryptocurrency boom. Many of the investors are just holding their holdings patiently in order to find out whether the cryptocurrencies resume their uptrend or not. It is still too uncertain for most of the investors to take a call. On the other hand, institutions are increasing their presence in the cryptocurrencies pace as well which is sure to benefit the cryptocurrencies space and would add value and credibility to the cryptocurrencies in the future as well. This is one of the main reasons why it is not seeing further fall after creating a bottom few weeks back. Also, once the regulatory hurdles are sorted, you can be sure that the value of cryptocurrencies would again more.\nBitcoin prices in 2018 have been marked by volatility which has made bitcoin price prediction in short-term a bit of a challenge, even for the experienced analysts. As at the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin took a dip from 10k to under 8k following news that search engine giants, Google will ban crypto-related ads. So far, 2018 has presented its own surprises though not a dramatic as the rollercoaster we say in 2017.\nHistory generally has a way of repeating itself but bitcoin has a lot of history which makes it an equal challenge predicting which history will be repeated. It takes more than a study of past trends to get predictions spot-on this time and so we ended this article by highlighting certain area expert analysts were looking at.\nAnalysts, enthusiast, and industry figures have very diverging opinions and bitcoin price predictions for both long and short-term. Optimism is still high in many quarters—reports of a new survey among British financials suggest a wide majority will buy more coins in hope of price resurgence later this year.

The partnership between MoneyToken and Bitcoin.com may bring new benefits to the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) community, as BCH will be available as accepted collateral on the MoneyToken lending platform, says the joint press release.\nAccording to Bitcoin.com , Roger Ver is also an advocate of Bitcoin Cash and one of the key influencers in the crypto community because of his early investments – since 2011 – in crypto-related startups including Ripple, Blockchain.info, Bitpay and Kraken. Ver’s company, MemoryDealers, became the first company in the world to accept Bitcoin as a payment option for its services.\nAs reported in the MoneyToken announcement , Mate Tokay has been involved in the cryptocurrency business as a miner since 2013. He co-founded Bitcoinist.net a cryptocurrency news magazine and he is now the COO at Bitcoin.com – one of the most popular source for bitcoin related news and information.\nMoneyToken is a cryptocurrency-backed lending platform that provides loans to cryptocurrency holders. The main idea is that a borrower who owns cryptos may simultaneously deposit cryptos as a long-term asset and spend it at the same time by investing in new initial coin offerings (ICOs), or by trading at exchanges. Joining forces\n“MoneyToken is a bright example of the real use of blockchain technology, as well as offering a massive boost for crypto market liquidity for all market players, and especially for businesses,” Roger Ver said at the press release on the partnership with MoneyToken.\nWith leading Bitcoin.com executives on the board of advisors, MoneyToken faces new opportunities. “Now Bitcoin Cash holders can enjoy the benefits that MoneyToken offers – leveraging their assets and spending cash, while continuing to hold their crypto positions”, says the announcement.\n“The Bitcoin Cash community is a unique and powerful force in cryptocurrency. Adding our support to Bitcoin Cash and allowing our potential token buyers and future lenders and borrowers to operate in BCH, only adds to our portfolio and strengthens the value of MoneyToken as a product for all our users.” Commented Jerome MacGillivray, Co-Founder of MoneyToken. Conquering fintech user’s hearts\nThe MoneyToken platform, aimed at miners, projects that made their token sales, traders, investors and exchanges, will allow holders of crypto assets to gain access to loan-based financial services, using cryptocurrency as collateral.\nThe MoneyToken business model works as following. Any user may deposit his Bitcoins , Ethers or other coins at MoneyToken and in return receive the a loan that may be spent on investments in US dollars or cryptocurrencies.\nMoneyToken has launched its public token presale on May 2, 2018 with a 20 percent bonus. The crowdsale campaign will last until June 6, 2018. So far, the MoneyToken team has overpassed its softcap goal, having raised almost $10 mln. The hardcap is $41.5 mln.\nDisclaimer.

So the question is, when I make a transaction on a website how can I make sure that the website is broadcasting my transaction? Maybe the site is holding it because it has high fee so that he can include it in his own block? I noticed that nodes are becoming fewer every day , does this mean when they become less the security of bitcoin or its value will decrease ? In order to become a miner, do you have to be a node too? Btc.com has a crazy fast hash rate. Is it even worth to get into mining? Say I want to become a miner with a chance of solving at least one block in a month, approximately how much should I invest?

During the past 50 bars, there have been 0 white candles and 0 black candles.\nA falling window occurred (where the bottom of the previous shadow is above the top of the current shadow). This usually implies a continuation of a bearish trend. There have been 24 falling windows in the last 50 candles–this makes the current falling window even more bearish.\nA gravestone doji occurred. This often signifies a top (the longer the upper shadow, the more bearish the signal).\nMomentum Indicators\nMomentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators.\nStochastic Oscillator\nOne method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 0.1631. This is an oversold reading. However, a signal is not generated until the Oscillator crosses above 20 The last signal was a sell 8 period(s) ago.\nRelative Strength Index (RSI)\nThe RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 41.53. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 34 period(s) ago.\nCommodity Channel Index (CCI)\nThe CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -132.This is an oversold reading. However, a signal isn’t generated until the indicator crosses above -100. The last signal was a buy 4 period(s) ago.\nMACD\nThe Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a sell 5 period(s) ago.\nRex Takasugi – TD Profile\nNYSE BitcoinIndx closed down -201.300 at 8,105.956.

But Bitcoin is an entirely different animal in terms of its volatility. The digital coins, which have garnered a lot of acclaim for the convenience with which they facilitate financial transactions and a lot of criticism for their decentralized nature, has become the poster child for volatility. For every rapid rise that they enjoy that sends investors into fits of joy, there seems to be an accompanying plummet in value that will have those same investors tearing out their hair. Imagine a rollercoaster ride that goes through a big pile of money and then through a big pile of grease that makes the money slip out of your hands and you’ve got some idea of what Bitcoin investing is all about.\nOf course, that doesn’t mean that you should avoid it all together. By contrast, the Bitcoin boom still seems like it has a lot of legs left in it, which is why you should have some exposure via your own investment ideas or the assistance of a digital trader like Bitcoin Code . But you should have some kind of plan for the volatility that Bitcoin is bound to encounter. If not, you might find that no amount of medicine taken beforehand can prepare you for the queasiness of the rollercoaster ride that you are bound to endure. Constant Monitoring\nIn the case of Bitcoin, the rises can come out of nowhere, and the drops can come just as suddenly. As a result, the person who lets their Bitcoin account be without vigilantly watching it could be in for a major investment disaster. Make sure you include some stops in your account and that you are notified when those stops are reached so that you can take immediate action. That will prevent you from debilitating losses from which you can’t recover. Repositioning\nMany people want to rest on their laurels when they get involved in Bitcoin and it takes one of its patented jumps in value. But that’s when you need to start thinking about protecting those profits. One way to do that is to make sure that your exposure to Bitcoin never rises above a certain amount. After a rise and it goes over that predetermined percentage, you can sell some off to once again strike the proper balance. Keep Your Eye on The Prize\nIf you get caught up in the constant yet ultimately temporary shifts in the value of Bitcoin, you can easily get too carried away with the rises or the falls. But it might be a better idea for you to look at the long-term prospects of the coins . If you believe that Bitcoin, after all the swoons and spikes, will reach a level higher than it is right now at some point in the future, stick with it. If not, maybe it’s time for you to sell it off or don’t get involved in it at all.\nVolatility will be riding side-saddle with Bitcoin for a while. Take these steps to ready yourself for it and try to enjoy the ride.

If those answers do not fully address your question, please ask a new question . Several incorrect assumptions here: by \"longest chain\" we refer to the chain with most work (not just most blocks), and checkpoints were a historical way to optimize synchronization speed which is being abolisbed (one of the reasons for abolishing it is actually due to it being prone to cause misunderstandings in Bitcoin's security model, like your question). If a checkpoint ever prevents an actual chain reorganization, PoW is completely broken. – Pieter Wuille 5 hours ago @PieterWuille The bitcoin whitepaper says longest chain and doesn't say most work. Can you please provide references (or code) that confirm that longest chain = most work? – The Quantum Physicist 4 hours ago The whitepaper only describes the rough idea behind Bitcoin's design, and the practical implementation differs and extends it in many ways (for example, the whitepaper doesn't say the coin supply is finite!). As for proof: github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.16.0/src/… is where the code decides which branch to attempt to validate, and calls a function that finds the most work chain. But really, this is a very fundamental design property, and you'll see it described in many places (including in dozens of answers on this site). – Pieter Wuille 4 hours ago @PieterWuille Thanks.

Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy. News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system .

Rather, the opposite has been happening, giving environmentalists (and anyone but the most adamant cryptobros) cause for concern.\nBetween cooling fans, manufacturing hardware, and the outrageous, ever-rising energy costs needed to operate a bitcoin mining rig, the world’s bitcoin network is expected to use as much as 7.67 gigawatts of power by the end of 2018, according to new research and models .

Multiple sources report that it just can’t be done. You could get an Antminer S9, the best ASIC hardware on the market, and you’ll be lucky to break even . There’s a lot of confusing information about this subject so let me be crystal clear: you as a person with a max budget of say, $10,000, can make money mining cryptocurrency, but not Bitcoin (See end of article for more discussion).\nThe best Bitcoin mining rig is a mining farm in China. Since most of us are not able to participate in this tantalizing yet capital-intensive business activity, we are left to mine all of the other cryptos. Fortunately, building a cryptocurrency mining rig is fairly straightforward. And once you acquire a bunch of whatever coin you choose to mine, you can use that coin to trade for Bitcoin (or Ethereum or Litecoin, and then into USD).\nThere are a few ways to make money with mining equipment. The stronger and more interesting one, in my opinion, is by mining new alternative cryptocurrencies. While most of these will be worth nothing, some of them will eventually be worth 10 or 100 times their current price. This means that with even only your CPU, you can stand to make an incredible percentage. The second option is to simply pick one or two cryptocurrencies you feel very strongly about and go with them. Because of my limited mining capacity (One GTX 1070, One GTX 1060), I have opted to solely mine Garlicoin. This is a trite memecoin, but since Dogecoin did very well, there is a fair chance the same could happen for Garlicoin. The third option is to use something like Nicehash ( check out their profitability calculator ). This service will automatically use your mining power and then pay you in Bitcoin. You won’t earn much, but then you’ll own the biggest crypto of them all; plus this is far more efficient than mining Bitcoin directly.\nDisclaimer: If you are looking to invest or for financial security, I recommend you DO NOT spend money on cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency mining equipment. The best practice for getting into crypto is visualizing all of the money you are spending as being burnt in a fire. This is gambling, pure and simple.\nBut it is fun.\nHere’s the five best ways to get Bitcoin by mining altcoins. 1. Build a Dedicated GPU-Rig Radeon\nIf you’ve paid attention to crypto news, you may have heard that there are no graphics cards on the shelves. It’s true, there are very few, but if you can get between three and six of them, you can build a rig. Check Amazon for GTX cards, and you may be lucky enough to see something for sale. Note that you should pay around $400 for a GTX 1060, $550 for a GTX 1070, and $700 for a GTX 1080. That said, you may find cards that are more expensive. If you’re a gamer, you can squeeze some additional potential use out of the card (see item 5), but don’t think you’re evading some kind of risk because a graphics card is technically a capital asset: if you look to sell it later, chances are so will a lot of other people. Hence, buying during a shortage will likely mean selling during a surplus, and that’s bad business! Still, in theory, you can write this stuff off on your taxes since it is business equipment so you can lop 30% or so off the price right there.\nBuilding a rig is fairly straightforward. You’ll need a mining motherboard , a processor (a cheap one is fine; the mining work is done by the graphics cards), a small quantity of RAM , PCIe risers (to reach the cards) , flash drive , mining rig frame , cable ties , and a heavy-duty power supply (wouldn’t go lower than gold). There are many full guides to building a rig ( Cryptosrus , Vice , YouTube ), and it’s not exactly rocket science as most of the components are plug and play. However, there is trouble-shooting, diligence, and a fair amount of technical knowledge to get a hold of. If you’re not intimidated by computers, you can get through it. That said, don’t think you can set it up and forget about it. Coins fork. Graphics card stop working. Computers glitch. That said, most of the time, it is pretty close to printing money (between $2 and $3 per day per card).\nThat said, the biggest con to mining is that if you don’t find it fun, it’s not considered a betterm financial prospect than simply investing ( some debate can be read here ). For the investor-minded, we recommend Coinbase for buying Bitcoin and a handful of other cryptos. 2. Add a Crypto Mining Card To Your Current Windows Desktop EVGA\nIf you have a Windows desktop, there’s a good change your PC has one or two slots where you can stuff a graphics card. Unfortunately, this is not as simple of a solution as it may seem since graphics cards are overpriced and hard to find. Still, while opening up your PC may seem scary, hardware installation can be cheap ($40 or so at Geek Squad) and doing it yourself is simple. Check out this guide on how to add a graphics card to your current system.\nDepending on your motherboard, you can install either Nvidia or AMD cards; be sure to figure out your system configuration (use the Run app (windows key + R) and type in dxdiag.exe to see your system components as a starting point).\nCheck Amazon for GTX 1060s , 1070s , and 1080s .\nOnce you put in the graphics card, it’s pretty easy to get up and running. I was able to mine Garlicoin (which I don’t necessarily recommend you mine, but it’s a normal crypto in terms of difficulty for set up) in about 10 minutes. Back in 2014, I mined around $200 worth of Dogecoin using my CPU. It was worth $200 then. I don’t want to think about what it would be worth had I held, but probably around $2000. 3. Purchase an External GPU Aorus\nNote: I do not recommend this, but the numbers bear out my personal suggestion. My EGPU, the Aorus GTX 1070, broke after two weeks of mining. That said, I recognize this is anecdotal evidence so I will explain this option nonetheless.\nIf your PC has a Thunderbolt 3 port, you can hook it up to a new technology, the external graphics card. To be clear, you MUST have a Thunderbolt 3 port. This is not merely a USB C port nor a USB 3.0 Superspeed port- it has to have a little Thunderbolt icon by it, then you’ll know, that’s Thunderbolt 3 (see this guide if you’re still confused).\nThere are two types of EGPU. All of them have the same basic principles, however. The first type is simple an external box that holds a normal graphics card, such as the Akitio Node . The second type contains a GPU already, like my late Aorus GTX 1070 , that is a box that comes including a graphics card. For the former type, you will have to also purchase a graphics card separately.\nOnce you do, setup couldn’t be simpler. You simply plug in the power, plug in the EGPU, the PC detects it, and you run your miner. Again, I did this with Garlicoin and setting it up to mine on two graphics card (the PC’s internal card and the EGPU) was as simple as passing a flag at the command line, something like, “-d 1” to tell the miner to use graphics card. If you get this far and can’t figure out how to mine, feel free to email me danny dot vega at heavy dot com. 4. Mine With Your PC’s CPU Intel\nMining with your CPU is doable, but with electricity costs and how considerably slower CPUs are for mining, it’s not necessarily a surefire way to money. That said, mining with your CPU can be worth it if you mine small, new cryptocurrencies. While you won’t necessarily mine a huge amount, there are definitely stories of people buying small amounts of crypto and then finding it has gone up significantly in value. After all, there was a time where one could mine Bitcoin itself with their CPU, though this was a long time ago.\nThis thread on BitcoinTalk.org gives some suggestions. Again, based on Dogecoin’s success, I recommend Garlicoin. It is a memecoin and not very special in any regard, but it does have a popular subreddit. You can learn how to mine Garlicoin with your CPU here. 5. Purchase a New PC With Graphics Card In It Heavy\nThis is either the best way or the worst way to do this, depending on your situation. If you’re looking to upgrade your PC, then this is the best way. While the price of graphics card is skyrocketing, it is not doing so when that graphics card is inside a PC. Therefore, the only way to get a graphics card at the normal human price is precisely by purchasing a PC. Check out some PCs with GTX 1070s or The Top 5 Best Desktops For Mining Cryptocurrency .\nIf you don’t need a new PC or need to upgrade, however, this is the equivalent of wanting to get a new tires, but getting a new car instead. Truly, it’s not that bad, but I don’t recommend it. The profitability is only that much farther.\nI hope I was able to guide you toward some products or enlightenment in your crypto journey. If you have any questions or comments, I’m known to answer thoroughly. Addendum: Are ASIC miners and mining Bitcoin really unprofitable?\nSome people seem to have taken umbrage at this claim. Yet, no one has provided any evidence that this is not the case. Feel free to run the numbers yourself. TechRadar (identical to this article) reports that the most powerful Bitcoin miner on the market is the Antminer S9. There are also some less reliable companies selling similar miners at a slightly better price/performance. Even using the best case numbers, the break even point for these miners is almost a year long ( calculations can be done on Coinwarz.com ). Here Nicehash shows that profitability for an Antminer S9 is 10 months away. For a GTX 1070 that costs $600, it’s less than 8 months.\nGPUs (even in today’s market) take 30% less time to pay their themselves , retain some value, and most importantly can be repurposed to mine a huge variety of coins. Once your Antminer S9 stops being profitable (if it ever gets there) mining Bitcoin, it’s a paper weight. That is not true about GPUs. They have resale value and can mine many different coins.\nIt is not my fringe opinion that mining Bitcoins is a bad idea. This Antminer S9 review on 99Bitcoins states ,”Also there’s always the question of the increasing difficulty and how much time will pass until the Antminer s9 becomes obsolete (usually this happens within 8-12 months).” Buying an ASIC-miner means you’ll need luck just to make money, even if the price of Bitcoin increases. If you believe in Bitcoin, buy Bitcoin.

This story, astrology-based financial investment, and many more feature in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief.\nAlso Read: Marvel, The Simpsons Go Crypto Parity Shuts Down ICO Passport Service\nThe team behind Parity Technologies, the developers of the Parity multi-signature wallet, have announced they are shutting down PICOPS, a service used by ICO campaigns to comply with KYC/AML regulations by validating that the owner of an Ethereum wallet has already passed an ID background check. The reason for the closure is a new EU dictate called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is meant to bring a new set of “digital rights” for EU citizens and guard their personal data. The regulation that will come into force this Friday has already killed other services in the crypto space such as the P2P exchange Cointouch and has forced others to change the way they do business such as Localbitcoins .\nThe Parity team explained that: “GDPR creates new and untested challenges when storing personal information on the blockchain. These challenges make running a service like PICOPS more difficult. We are looking at ways of resolving the uncertainty and making PICOPS compliant with GDPR while keeping it useful. However, as things stand, the solutions we have identified restrict the service to a very limited set of features. Because of this, the significant resources required to make PICOPS GDPR-compliant, and the fact that PICOPS is not part of our core technology stack, we have decided to discontinue the service, despite overwhelming market needs and demand.” Indian Ban Case Shifts to Supreme Court\nThe Supreme Court of India has taken over the cases of Coin Recoil and others challenging the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) ban on local banks from dealing with bitcoin companies. The n ext hearing of this now combined case is planned for July 20, 2018.\nRashmi Deshpande, Associate Partner at Khaitan & Co., commented: “The Supreme Court has recently transferred the entire batch of petitions pending at High Court level with respect to the contentious issue of RBI effectively banning transactions in cryptocurrencies. This decision highlights the importance of this issue at a national level from not just a legal, but also an economic standpoint. We strongly believe that the RBI’s circular to effectively discourage the business of cryptocurrency exchanges is an arbitrary decision against the freedom of the right to trade guaranteed by the Constitution. We are hopeful that justice will be meted out at the Supreme Court level.” Written in the Stars\nAstrology-based financial investment is apparently a thing, and many practitioners are using it to navigate the tumultuous seas of the cryptocurrency markets. This is according to a Marketwatch report that cited a number of astro-investors and even a professional astro-analyst talking about the practice as well as their predictions.\nThis matter came into the forefront recently after ex-NFL star Ricky Williams shared his use of the of study of celestial objects with CNBC . “When I look at things, I tend to look at astrology to get insight. The insight that got me interested in Bitcoin was the planet Uranus is about to enter into Taurus,” he explained. Roboforex to Compete with Wallets\nRoboforex, an IFSC (International Financial Services Commission of Belize) licensed financial firm offering crypto CFDs , has introduced a new service for its clients to buy BTC with fiat directly from the broker. The company believes that its regulated status will convince users to use their accounts over existing wallets.\nDenis Golomedov, Chief Marketing Officer at Roboforex, said: “Providing the ability for clients to deposit into their accounts in Bitcoin is not only an additional service, which expands clients’ opportunities, but also a standalone product, which significantly dominates over its market counterparts. Security has become very significant issue recently, as more and more information appears about hacking cryptocurrency exchanges and stealing users’ assets. Using the cryptocurrency is much more convenient and safer for clients within the framework of their trading and investment activities, using products and services provided by a regulated broker”.\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates?

We find that specific teams may be quite enthusiastically committed, but widespread internal acceptance of crypto/blockchain faces hurdles of indifference/inertia, legacy bias/protectionism and career risk.”\nHe also cited the “chicken and egg issue.” Most entities, he said, prefer to be “fast followers” rather than leaders.\nStill, Mr. Lee remains profoundly bullish, forecasting that bitcoin will hit $25,000 by year’s end, saying he draws encouragement from the fact that a “large share of incremental attendance” at Consensus were financial institutions.\nBitcoin ticked higher over the weekend and recently traded at around $8,500, according to Coindesk.\nShare this: Bitcoin cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrency Previous WSJ Wealth Adviser Briefing: Argentina, Crypto, Summer Beer Next Iran Challenges the EU to Take On U.S. Over Nuclear Pact—Energy Journal", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin o", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "funstrat global advisors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "argentina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T14:04:41.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8574c5fa205a1c039a1ebb86f72875ebc0713d0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWlAO5eXvV0jd2Unsnu9Oc5R2u9pMpDcog5jmrIXZT_w3SbGUcGTY3.Awx5PVTrjU_ISCTCcyk5eJibcFhNpksH6mnPVW40RcpB.e968JmaAnXdeZsUgYuFThLUWdIM8Lg-", "site_full": "news.bitcoin-babe.com", "site": "bitcoin-babe.com", "site_section": "http://news.bitcoin-babe.com/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Is Back Above $8,500 But Does the Rally Have Legs?", "title_full": "Bitcoin Is Back Above $8,500 But Does the Rally Have Legs?", "published": "2018-05-21T14:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8574c5fa205a1c039a1ebb86f72875ebc0713d0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWlAO5eXvV0jd2Unsnu9Oc5R2u9pMpDcog5jmrIXZT_w3SbGUcGTY3.Awx5PVTrjU_ISCTCcyk5eJibcFhNpksH6mnPVW40RcpB.e968JmaAnXdeZsUgYuFThLUWdIM8Lg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoinbabeau", "published": "2018-05-21T14:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Is Back Above $8,500 But Does the Rally Have Legs?", "text": "\nBitcoin (BTC) has bounced back over $8,500, but the rally is not backed by decent trading volumes, the specialized charts indicate. The cryptocurrency closed below key technical levels on Thursday, signaling a bearish breakdown, but the sell-off suddenly ran out of steam at $7,925 a day afterwards. Subsequently, bitcoin accumulated greater than $500 over the weekend, climbing back above resistance in the 50-day moving average. At time of writing, BTC is changing hands at around $8,530, having clocked a six-day high of $8,644 before today. While a week past’s bearish tendency appears to have run out of steam (as seen from the charts below), the weekend’s low-volume rally risks trapping the bulls on the wrong side of the marketplace. 4-hour chart\nThe inverse head-and-shoulders breakout signifies short-term trend reversal – i.e. the pullback from the high of $9,990 has finished and the breakout has opened the doors to $9,000 (target as per the measured height method. Daily chart\nThe daily chart shows yesterday’s candle closed (as per UTC) over Saturday’s doji candle high of $8,468, signaling a bullish reversal. Further, the 5-day and 10-day moving averages have shed bearish bias (are not any longer sloping downwards). Consequently, the likelihood that bitcoin will rally to $9,000 this week is high. Nevertheless, the bullish case significantly simplifies if we take into consideration the amounts for trading quantity. Volume is an essential indicator, as it shows the level of interest in bitcoin. A rally endorsed by high volumes means increased reliance can be put on the bullish move. On the other hand, a low volume rally trends to turn out to be a bull trap. In BTC’s case, now, trading volume on Bitfinex carries on to decrease and much more significant remained low alongside positive price action, as seen from the chart above. Further, trading volume across all exchanges fell below $5 billion on the weekend – the lowest amount since Apr 11, according to CoinMarketCap. Therefore, the sustainability of the rally seen over the weekend is under question. View\nBTC rally lacks material (low volumes), thus the outlook is probably neutral, regardless of the inverse head-and-shoulders breakout (4-hour chart) along with the bullish doji reversal (daily chart). A failure to hold over $8,475 (inverse head-and-shoulders neckline) would revive the bearish perspective and allow a fall to Friday’s low of $7,925. On the higher side, only a high volume move over the 100-day moving average, now seen at $8,857, could open the doors to $10,000.\nRunning up measures picture via Shutterstock\n news, CoinDesk is a media outlet greatest abides by a ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rally have legs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T14:35:57.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0cc77077cdfb7155959bd5e247196cdd4f821cf5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmX7Tk8nMNjXYKsUJ0MsOJfs-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Is volatility is a bless or curse for Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Is volatility is a bless or curse for Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-21T14:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0cc77077cdfb7155959bd5e247196cdd4f821cf5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmX7Tk8nMNjXYKsUJ0MsOJfs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "nilavoro", "published": "2018-05-21T14:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is volatility is a bless or curse for Bitcoin?", "text": "The volatility nature offers the grounds to invest and receive huge returns only if you know how to play with it.
