Although it remains unsuccessful in crossing the key resistance level, there is optimism that that cryptocurrency market will bounce back shortly.\nBrian Kelly is one such optimist. He has discarded Warren Buffett’s and Bill Gates criticisms of late, stating that he believes the cryptocurrency market to be immune to billionaires bashing. Source Image: coinmarketcap.com\nBitcoin price trades around the $9,400 level today, while altcoins are also paring losses from earlier in the week. Is the upside movement attributed to Brian Kelly’s rebuke of the legendary investor’s thoughts? It could very well be. Brian Kelly Responds to Buffett’s and Gate’s Criticism\nBrian Kelly – who predicts bitcoin price to hit $250K in the next couple of years, rejects Buffett and Gates criticism. He said Warren Buffett was proved wrong so many times in the past — pointing out in particular his criticism towards commodities and tech companies.\nWarren Buffett was among the most prominent critics of high growth tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). However, he changed his stance later on, and now Apple is one of the biggest holdings according to the latest 13F filing.\nReplying to Bill Gates negative attitude towards bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets, Brian Kelly compared bitcoin with Microsoft. He said , “ unlike Microsoft which provides software and which is centralized, Bitcoin is a decentralized software. Bitcoin gives the users incentive to run this open source. making the internet itself a unique economic model .” Hopes are High for the Bull Run\nCryptocurrency markets have been experiencing positive developments since regulators around the globe started accepting the emerging market. Following Goldman Sachs and NASDAQ, the reports suggest that Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) – the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is planning to introduce cryptocurrency trading in the days to come. Bulls are also optimistic that the Consensus Summit will bring positive change to cryptocurrency markets, and that is just around the corner.\nFeatured Image: Depositphotos/© mdkhalil1", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cryptocurrencynews.com/daily-news/crypto-news/brian-kelly-shares-three-bullish-reasons/", "https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-btc-price-drop-immune-billionaire-bashing-brian-kelly/", "https://cryptocurrencynews.com/daily-news/crypto-news/another-bull-run-near-wallstreet-involvement/", "https://screenshots.firefox.com/fzCvNDz3ILmbWxJk/coinmarketcap.com"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siraj sarwar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill gates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T02:07:33.039+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3e497371eee28dd0250bf78352224cd7c600d6e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR2hKI_aYwoyEw5EObaH.J5TFWMtUJya2cVldNDKtbbHEj4wTAr5X1ymp2ZBVXxxebpXAwLm02677EqfKtrTWLo6fWjisnIC68-", "site_full": "themeforest.net", "site": "themeforest.net", "site_section": "http://themeforest.net/feeds/new-themeforest-items.atom", "site_categories": ["web_design_html", "tech"], "section_title": "ThemeForest new  items", "title": "RedBux - Bitcoin Doubler HTML Templates (Business)", "title_full": "RedBux - Bitcoin Doubler HTML Templates (Business)", "published": "2018-05-11T00:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s3.envato.com/files/246059750/01_Preview.__large_preview.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 340, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3e497371eee28dd0250bf78352224cd7c600d6e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR2hKI_aYwoyEw5EObaH.J5TFWMtUJya2cVldNDKtbbHEj4wTAr5X1ymp2ZBVXxxebpXAwLm02677EqfKtrTWLo6fWjisnIC68-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "IdealBrothers", "published": "2018-05-11T00:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "RedBux - Bitcoin Doubler HTML Templates (Business)", "text": "Add to Collection\nRedBux HTML templates suitable for any type Bitcoin Doubbler, lending, hyip, bitcoin trade, Altcoin & CryptoCurrency website. its the great Bitcoin Doubbler HTML Template that enables you to create a professional Lending website.

Galaxy Digital LP has struck a strategic partnership deal with Bloomberg to create a cryptocurrency index called the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (BGCI).\nIn the May 9 announcement , the firms have stated that the all-new Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index would \"track the performance\" of ten established and most liquid cryptos on the market, including bitcoin , ethereum , EOS , monero , and ripple . Bitcoin and Ethereum are equally weighted at 30 percent, with the index's methodology not allowing for a weighting higher than 30 percent. Displayed below are the weightings for other cryptocurrencies:\nSource: Bloomberg\nFurther explaining how the platform works, the statement hinted that all the digital assets that make up the index are diversified across a vast array of categories such as mediums of exchange, smart contract protocols, stores of value and fungible assets.\nThe companies also reiterated that the digital currency index makes use of a rules-based system as well as data from reliable sources that have passed through the BGCI \"due diligence processes.\"\nDigital Currencies Steadily Going Mainstream While Bloomberg runs other indices in the traditional finance industry including indices for strategy, commodities, and many others, the BGCI is a first-of-its-kind index for the digital currency ecosystem.\nButtressing the above fact, the firms said that:\n\"The creation of the index marks an important step in the evolution of the digital assets space, facilitating diversified exposure as well as independent benchmarking for investors.\"\nOf a truth, services like the BGCI is what the virtual currency space needs in order to make valuable information about the nascent industry more readily available to investors who may need such data to make informed investment decisions.\n\"The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index brings unprecedented transparency to the cryptomarkets. We are excited to help drive the decentralized revolution forward through the creation of BGCI,\" said Michael Novogratz , CEO and founder of Galaxy Digital Capital Management.\nSteve Kurz, Head of Asset Management at Galaxy Digital Capital Management also noted that, \"We are thrilled to partner with Bloomberg on the BGCI. The index's independent, rules-based methodology provides a strong foundation on which the cryptocurrency ecosystem will continue to grow and mature.\"\nBetter Days Ahead Novogratz initially had plans of launching his cryptocurrency hedge fund on December 15, 2017. However, the smart billionaire shelved the move amidst fears of a market slump.\n\"We didn't like market conditions, and we wanted to re-evaluate what we're doing. I look pretty smart pressing the pause button right now,\" he told Bloomberg back in December 2017, adding \"I didn't want to have to deal with the schizophrenic emotional side of it. There are just so many conflicts in that business. It was going to be more complicated than I wanted.\"\nWhen Novogratz announced he was no longer interested in launching a bitcoin hedge fund last year, many thought the former Goldman Sachs man had lost faith in digital currencies. However, the expert asset manager quickly re-strategized and steered his ship to a less stormy sea.\nIn February 2018, reports emerged that Novogratz had raised $250 million for his cryptocurrency merchant bank in a private funding round. With a war chest of over $250 million and several formidable partnerships, it remains to be seen whether he will succeed this time around.\nThe post Bitcoin Evangelist Michael Novogratz Joins Forces with Bloomberg to Launch Cryptocurrency Index appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike novogratz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "galaxy digital lp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg galaxy crypto index", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg further", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T00:14:13.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b12317a7ad2ca2fb671190cb048b4f8c4be3f7eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.dcS_swA9gvXTjy7t5UdZMW3az4ZC.dnduMJ9mdrhMqTb8PAJ77wxMrcfdwzUgxeKk_ExTnt.4jUq5YcPvbEFe9nAwWPtCWWwk9yRsG9nXkw--", "site_full": "www.mctdirect.com", "site": "mctdirect.com", "site_section": "http://qctimes.com/search/?f=rss&t=article&c=business&l=25&s=start_time&sd=desc", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "qctimes.com - RSS Results in business of type article", "title": "The trouble with bitcoin: Keeping it from getting hacked, lost or stolen", "title_full": "The trouble with bitcoin: Keeping it from getting hacked, lost or stolen", "published": "2018-05-11T00:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/qctimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/ac/bacbcf1b-35db-53b6-84b4-28df27d7c24b/5af4c06d02951.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C992%2C0%2C91&amp;resize=1120%2C630&amp;order=crop%2Cresize", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b12317a7ad2ca2fb671190cb048b4f8c4be3f7eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.dcS_swA9gvXTjy7t5UdZMW3az4ZC.dnduMJ9mdrhMqTb8PAJ77wxMrcfdwzUgxeKk_ExTnt.4jUq5YcPvbEFe9nAwWPtCWWwk9yRsG9nXkw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tim Johnson, McClatchy Washington Bureau", "published": "2018-05-11T00:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "The trouble with bitcoin: Keeping it from getting hacked, lost or stolen", "text": "WASHINGTON - Here are the drawbacks with digital currencies: Hackers and scammers can make them vanish. If an owner has a poor memory, the bitcoins can get locked for eternity in an electronic wallet, like a fly in amber.\nSome high-profile people have admitted this year to losing cryptocurrency, among them Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak.\nIn another case last month, a cryptocurrency promoter doing a livestream on his YouTube channel was notified by a viewer that digital currency was flowing out of the host's virtual account. The host later acknowledged he suffered losses of \"over $2 million.\"\nIn the Wild West world of bitcoin and other digital currencies, many new investors may not fully grasp the challenges of keeping their crypto investments safe, whether on their own devices or lodged in accounts at exchanges around the globe.\n\"I suspect many small investors may assume that their money is as safe as it would be in an online bank. But that's not necessarily the case,\" said Graham Cluley, a British security blogger and researcher.\nBitcoins first emerged in 2009, spawning the creation of dozens of other digital currencies that exist only in electronic form. They operate independently of central banks and have fluctuated wildly in value. A single bitcoin traded for around $9,130 Thursday afternoon.\nCryptocurrency exchanges, where buyers and sellers gather to trade digital currencies, are like honeypots for hackers. In the largest known heist to date, hackers in late January made off with around $530 million in cryptocurrency from a Tokyo-based exchange, Coincheck.\n\"South Korea said they thought it could be North Korea (behind the heist) but I haven't seen any other evidence of that, and it has the hallmarks of the typical cyber hack by thieves,\" said Yaya J. Fanusie, a former economic and counterterrorism analyst at the CIA who is now at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a national security think tank in Washington.\nAn Italian-based platform, BitGrail, reported that hackers made off with more than $170 million of a cryptocurrency known as Nano in February.\nThe loss experienced by Wozniak stung, even though he is a multimillionaire.\n\"I had seven bitcoins stolen from me through fraud,\" Wozniak told the Global Business Summit in New Delhi Feb. 26, according to the Economic Times newspaper. \"Somebody bought them from me online through a credit card and they cancelled the credit card payment. It was that easy! And it was from a stolen credit card number so you can never get it back.\"\nBitcoins and many other digital currencies have public keys and private keys. The private key is a secret number that allows someone to access his or her cryptocurrency.\nWhoever has the private key controls what's in an electronic wallet.\nCluley said there were \"lots of reports of folks losing a small fortune (and sometimes a large one) €¦ following the loss of their private keys.\"\nSometimes the method by which bitcoins are lost remains a mystery years later.\nTom Curry, who is a home builder in Massachusetts, still remembers his chagrin the day in 2013 when he lost 996 bitcoin, which at today's prices would be about $9.2 million.\n\"I woke up at 5:30 or 6 in the morning and I got a text message: 'All the bitcoins have been removed from your wallet,' \" Curry said. Someone had gained access to his account and his private key.\nCurry bought the bitcoins for a few bucks each, he said, and still rues what they would be worth today if he hadn't been ripped off.\n\"I would no longer be doing construction. I would be in the Caribbean, that's a definite,\" he said in a telephone interview.\nIf a digital currency owner loses a private key - say, storing it on a laptop that melts down, or simply forgetting it - the bitcoins are essentially frozen in an electronic limbo.\n\"Let's say a guy dies and he never gave his wife the private keys, and she doesn't know how to move that crypto,\" Fanusie said. \"She's a millionaire in crypto but with no way to get it.\"\nFanusie said problems around securing and managing private keys for electronic wallets is a major drawback to digital currencies, harder than dealing with ordinary passwords.\n\"For cryptocurrencies to grow in adoption, someone's going to have to figure out a better way for private key management, a way that's more user friendly. Right now, that just doesn't exist,\" Fanusie said.\nOne solution is to store digital currency in a hardware wallet, a physical device a bit larger than a USB flash drive, which is not connected to the internet, kept in what industry experts call cold storage. Only when the hardware wallet is plugged into a computer can the currency be accessed.\nThe crypto promoter who suffered the loss of digital currency on an April 16 livestream is Ian Balina, a former IBM analyst who has drawn tens of thousands of followers on his YouTube and Telegram channels.

It is precisely this splintering into myriad tokens, objectives, and outcomes that the developers maintain is a terminal trend for cryptocurrencies and one they aim to curtail at this early stage.\nUltimately built to eliminate fracturing inputs from investment or mining cabals, governments, and any other supposed self-serving interests, the platform seeks a return to that which was briefly glimpsed at the dawn of cryptocurrency. Talking of an international marketplace, buyer and seller ratings and freelance exchange, the aims of the company are global and technically enabled in their blockchain construct.\nWhat Issues will the Tkeycoin Solve? In the global economy , inefficiencies and gross inequalities exist. Every individual and nation-state is impacted by a myriad of taxing realities in the conduct of commerce and life itself. Often, any concept of a new economic dispensation remains mired in the known paradigm of current business as usual, unable to truly sweep clean due to vested interests and the daily grind of commerce.\nAccording to research conducted by the company, four fundamental obstacles inhibit the majority of cryptocurrencies from having a significant impact. These are scalability, narrow application, hard usage and the absence of a corporate market.\nThese four major points, in the eyes of Tkeycoin, form the basis of the reason why cryptocurrencies are not a significant threat to the existing fiat currency system. The company aims to bridge this gap by bringing the market to the masses, a new twist on the traditional approach of bringing the masses to the market.\nThrough greater accessibility, cryptocurrency's ease of use is amplified, and its economic reach is extended. Consequently, users spanning the globe will enjoy the benefits of a decentralized, quick and low-cost payment system that is simple to use and available to everyone.\nThe Tkeycoin Solution The innately egalitarian power of blockchain is encapsulated within the Tkeycoin utility token. A process of debugging of the ecosystem is anticipated that will involve eliminating behavior or employment of the technology outside of what is deemed appropriate to enable the democratic and fluid nature of the blockchain.\nThe company seeks to address social inequalities by issuing what it hopes will become a universal token enabling working, sharing and living communally.\nTkeycoin employs its own blockchain protocol to bring cryptocurrency to millions of previously underserved users, using an advanced bandwidth capable of supporting 500,000 transactions per second.\nAs well as enabling worldwide cryptocurrency exchanges, Tkeycoin promotes a fair shopping policy in which a verification protocol accurately records vendor rating data. All operations and transactions which take place on the Tkeycoin DAO are verified by smart contracts, which in turn dispel fraudulent transactions from the network.\nTkeycoin assists both freelancers and businesses, providing an internal job network for the former and seamless low-cost payment services for the latter.\nStartup companies can utilize the TBP protocol to conduct token sales as a means of crowdfunding to raise capital for new ventures. Further to that, the Tkeycoin wallet provides secure and easily accessible funds storage, for convenient exchange or spending.\nThe developers will mint and release 105 million TCD (the token symbol). The ICO is live , and any user with 3,000 TCD or more in their wallet can also mine the network. Frequently refuting its status as a token, the developers insist that TCD is a coin on its own blockchain, a subtlety not made perfectly clear in the available information. TCD can be purchased with ETH, BTC, LTC, DASH, RUR, EUR and USD. 1 TCD = 1 USD and each year 30 million new coins will be issued.\nFunds Distribution, Source: Tkeycoin\nThe Tkeycoin Team There are various tweaks and nuances to the security protocols at play in the Tkeycoin blockchain, and the white paper is highly technical. Overall, the developers have articulated a massively detailed and elegant offering.\nThe team consists of Russian Physicists, Mathematicians, Engineers, and Dreamers.\nConclusion The Tkeycoin ICO is ambitious in its reach, well thought out and very technically detailed.\nAlthough leading to improved UX and a host of other benefits, it is not clear exactly how huge the idea could be, especially as individual cryptocurrencies are already entrenched and industry players are bending blockchain to their own unique needs.\nBTCManager does not endorse any content or product on this page.

Last week, CFTC chairman J. Christoper Giancarlo stated he does not believe Bitcoin to be an “ideal” payment system . The chair has this mentality despite also saying Bitcoin has similarities to gold.\nThis week, the Bank of America CTO joined the conversation. Bitcoin as a Payment System\nOn Thursday, Catherine Bessant, Bank of America CTO, stated that Bitcoin as a payment system is very “troubling.” Not just Bitcoin, however, Bessant referred to the use of other cryptocurrencies as payment systems as well. Many recognize that the crypto sector comes with risk, with cryptocurrencies acting in illegal activity, such as money-laundering. The payment systems industry also has its trouble, with criminals using it for illegal purposes. Now, Catherine Bessant has said that virtual currencies are getting in the way of law enforcement closing in on the criminals using payment systems this way. UK Central Bank to Tackle Issues Like Crypto Money Laundering\nIn an interview with CNBC, Bessant said that Bitcoin as a payment system is “troubling” for one reason, in particular. According to Bessant, cryptocurrency is designed to not be transparent – and this is a problem. Why? Because this makes it more difficult to monitor business transactions in the cyber world. The chief technical officer went on to say that the way you catch financial criminals is by “being transparent in the financial moment of money.” Things get a little tricky, though, when virtual currencies are “the antithesis of that,” said Bessant. What are the Crypto Markets Saying?\nSo, that’s two people in a span of two weeks that have said Bitcoin as a payment system is not ideal. But what do the masses have to say about that? Let’s see what we can find out.\nOne crypto analyst seemed to be against Bessant’s statements, tweeting to his followers that blockchain is “more transparent than the current banking system.” Bank of America CTO just said on @CNBC that Bitcoin wasn’t “transparent in the financial moment of money.”\nSomeone send her the definition of a blockchain so they realize it is much more transparent than the current banking system!\nThe crypto community on Twitter seemed to agree with the above-mentioned analyst, with one user tweeting that Bessant only said this because Bank of America “can’t figure out where their business model fits in this new world of money.” The Takeaway\nWhat do you think about both Bessant and Giancarlo’s comments about Bitcoin as a payment system?

People like this usually have never invested before, or did once but lost their money. As somebody who cares about the field of cryptocurrency and has invested several times in the past, it can be mind-numbing and frustrating to hear the opinions of people who have only ever read headlines and soundbites regarding the topic.\nMake note, it is reasonable to be skeptical of cryptocurrency and present some well-researched arguments against them, but the people being referred to here are those that know very little about the industry and have no noticeable desire to get acquainted with it.\nHere are some of the most common arguments you will hear against cryptocurrency (either from people you know or from news outlets) and some simple responses to them.\nCryptocurrency is a pyramid scheme.\nOccasionally, I will run into a person who claims that cryptocurrency (or more specifically bitcoin) is a pyramid scheme and that only those who were first to the market will be able to make a reasonable profit from it.\nWhile it is true that the earliest adopters of coins like bitcoin and ether have seen the most significant increases in their profits  this does not make it a pyramid scheme. Pyramid schemes are structured so that subordinate investors must pay or hand over a percentage of earnings to a higher level investor. This is not the case with cryptocurrency if you head to an exchange to buy a coin, it is possible you will be buying from somebody who is at the same level as you (i.e., they invested around the same time you did). This is not possible with pyramid schemes since the only way to make money is to recruit new members. With cryptocurrency, you can trade and exchange with new or old investors. Also note, the main aim of cryptocurrency is not necessarily to get new investors since the price of a coin does not exactly rise due to adoption. Positive news regarding programming updates, partnerships, and new features can also just as quickly raise the price of a coin.\nCryptocurrency is only used to buy drugs and launder money.\nThis statement is commonly used by media outlets as a way to discredit the entire industry and the technology behind it. The best way to refute this statement is to briefly explain the nature of the blockchain and the sheer level of transparency that cryptocurrency offers. Most people who do not know anything about the industry get the impression that using this currency automatically masks your identity and your movements.\nExplain to them that most coins have a global database of transactions which can freely be viewed by anybody. This, alone, is enough to discourage people from laundering money and purchasing illicit substances since law enforcement, the IRS, and other government bodies can track purchases with more ease than fiat.\nThere is no underlying. value\nThis is a half-truth. While cryptocurrency does not rest its value on assets like gold or land, it instead derives value from its developers and its code. Arguably, this is similar to how legal tender derives its value from its government and laws. Similar to how a decision or press conference from the President can affect the price of USD, an announcement from a lead developer can affect the price of Litecoin.\nIt is too late to make money.\nI have personally found this argument to be said by people who only know of one cryptocurrency: bitcoin. Generally, the easiest way to open their mind is to show them that CoinMarketCap actually lists over 1500 coins and tokens. Of course, only a fraction of them are worth investment, but it proves that the industry is expansive.\nNew coins and tokens are constantly entering the market, many of which shoot up in price significantly after a while. One coin that has not had a long history, but is valued highly, is Nano. The coin only came into existence in early 2017, but in the space of a little over a year it has risen to the 28th spot. The main reason for this is the team it has and the technology it runs on. Finding a new coin with a great set of programmers and impressive code can be one way of making money in the industry. Of course, it is not the only way. The much larger coins like bitcoin, ether, and monero are still considered good investments now this is because people still think the technology is undervalued. If that is the case, then it certainly is not too late to make money.\nOriginally published at cryptodisrupt.com\nI think they will just waste our time so I advice that we should ignore the ignorant people.

Gambling already takes a part in most people lives and the Market Review illustrates this. We do not respect traditional betting services due their unfair conditions and other problems described in “Problems” section. Our mission is to change that.\nIn Betrium bets happen off-chain and only added when the event happens and the outcome is undeniable. However the bets are broadcasted all over the network instantly for the odds to be recalculated.\nThat means, in contrast to competitors, we are able to provide high-speed betting service built on decentralized IT architecture. Any solution powered just by Ethereum blockchain simply can’t provide the speed required for professional betting/trading on sports.\nADVANTAGES ORGANIZERS EARN PLATFORM Betrium provides unique betting creation platform for event organizers such as e-sport streamers or small sport leagues.\nWORLDWIDE SUPPORT Betrium works globally and supports crypto-currencies withdrawals all around the world. 24/7 support on 18 languages.\nLOWEST COMMISSIONS Betrium does not take comission from money deposits and withdrawals, winnings. We also do not take taxes on personal income.\nBETRIUM FEATURES Platform for Organizers Betrium provides special partner solution for event organizers that want to earn money. Each owner of the Betrium Network account is able to create custom event and earn on betting just in few clicks. For example, e-game organizer (or player) can create the match on the Betrium, add potential outcomes and publish it. Betrium will automatically adjust the odds to make it profitable.\nPowerful API Betrium is the first to offer advanced Open API for developers, bots, third-party apps and betting service providers. Our Team develops Betrium Framework for the most popular software platforms.\nProfit Sharing Profit share: 50% of annual profit. Each BTRM token holder regularly receives a half of Betrium’s profit and that is the key element of our token growth mechanism. Therefore, the Betrium token is directly backed by Betrium financial success and has a real increasing worth.\nNo Volatility / Hedging We offer crypto-currencies volatility stabilization for users. In Betrium, balances will be fixed in the virtual USD/EUR, so users are protected from losing in regular dumps. We’re going to achieve that by integrating some exchange functionality (USD/BTC/ETH) and future partnerships with different local and worldwide exchanges.\nLegal Activity Despite the fact, that Betrium’s nature can’t be regulated, our goal is to make our platform as legal as possible. We will act fully within the law under Curaçao license for online gambling. Curaçao is the most popular offshore and e-zone for such purposes and it is used by many current biggest betting providers, online casinos and poker. Moreover, in future we plan to get licenses in: Malta, UK, Germany, Australia, USA.\nDASHBOARD https://investors.betrium.co/ We have launched the special dashboard for investors! The solution will allow investors to manage and control profit share, to view Betrium’s statistics and achievements, to get and request different documents, track token price etc.\nTOKEN DETAILS To achieve Betrium’s goals, we are launching an Initial Coin Offering to issue Betriums tokens on the public blockchain. BTRM is an ERC-20 token build on Ethereum. A total of 140m BTRM will be issued only. The tokens will be issued during the pre-ICO and ICO.\nROADMAP MEET THE TEAM FOR MORE INFORMATIONS : Website | White Paper\nTwitter | Facebook | Telegram | Medium", "highlightText": "",

contributor to CNBC’s Fast Money, and founder of BKCM, stated on the May 9 Fast Money show that the adoption of bitcoin by Wall Street’s biggest financial institutions such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Goldman Sachs will lead the cryptocurrency market to surge in the short- to mid-term. Kelly is Shocked Earlier this week, as CCN reported, NYSE’s parent company ICE Exchange has been developing and testing a bitcoin exchange to serve investors from the traditional finance sector. Various reports revealed that ICE Exchange is not launching a futures market like CME and CBOE, rather a proper bitcoin exchange on which investors can buy, sell, and store bitcoin directly. “The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been working on an online trading platform that would allow large investors to buy and hold Bitcoin, according to emails and documents viewed by The New York Times and four people briefed on the effort who asked to remain anonymous because the plans were still confidential,” the New York Times reported. Kelly emphasized that while he is “shocked” the cryptocurrency market did not surge in value based on the entrance of NYSE into the market, he stated that investors have missed out on an important element, which is that like Xapo and Coinbase, NYSE and its parent company ICE Exchange will start to operate a custody solution for institutional holders. The operator of the NYSE is planning to support bitcoin trading. “I’m actually a bit shocked that the market did not pick up on this. Dominic Chu of CNBC said that investors will get physical delivery of bitcoin. That doesn’t sound that interesting except for the fact that it means ICE Exchange has a custody solution. That has been the big hurdle. How do you hold onto these assets. These are generally bearer instruments, just like gold bearer bonds. That’s the big deal. They have come up with a custody solution for institutional holders,” said Kelly. He further noted that the development of a bitcoin custody solution by ICE Exchange signifies cryptocurrencies have become an emerging asset class. More importantly, Kelly added that the growth of cryptocurrencies as an emerging asset class will allow multi-billion dollar pensions, endowment, and institutional investors to invest in the cryptocurrency market. “Finally, it opens the door for pensions and endowments. Up to this point, it has been very difficult for them to get comfortable compliance wise in holding cryptocurrency. If ICE has a custodian solution that is SEC compliant, that’s going to open the floodgates,” Kelly added. What Will Floodgates Look Like? The cryptocurrency market has become a $0.5 trillion market with barely any capital from institutional investors, endowments, and pensions. If institutional investors begin to enter the cryptocurrency market with tens of billions of dollars in new capital, it will allow the cryptocurrency market to grow at a pace that is incomparable to its growth rate in the past. It could enable the cryptocurrency market to evolve into a multi-trillion dollar market, as many investors have expected since 2016. Images from Shutterstock.

Many of these developments had a negative impact on the growth prospects of cryptocurrencies, like restrictions by banks on the use of credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies, and calls by financial regulators across the world for caution while investing in digital currencies (with some countries even banning their use). This sent cryptocurrencies sliding in value from the all-time highs seen in mid-December 2017, as demonstrated by the slump in Bitcoin&a;rsquo;s price from almost $20,000 then to below $6,000 in early February.\nNotably, a &l;a href=&q;https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2018/may/how-futures-trading-changed-bitcoin-prices/&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;recent report by the Federal Reserve&l;/a&g; indicated that another important factor behind this sharp decline was the launch of Bitcoin futures by the &l;a href=&q;http://finapps.forbes.com/finapps/jsp/finance/compinfo/CIAtAGlance.jsp?tkr=cme&a;amp;tab=searchtabquotesdark&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;CME&l;/a&g;. The Bitcoin futures allowed investors with a negative outlook on Bitcoin to enter the market &a;ndash; something they hadn&a;rsquo;t been able to do when the cryptocurrency witnessed an unusually strong rally. The fact that Bitcoin prices began falling after having peaked on the same day that futures trading began lends support to this argument.\nHowever, Bitcoin prices have recovered over the last couple of months thanks to some positive developments. Most notable among them was &l;a href=&q;http://finapps.forbes.com/finapps/jsp/finance/compinfo/CIAtAGlance.jsp?tkr=gs&a;amp;tab=searchtabquotesdark&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;Goldman Sachs&a;rsquo;&l;/a&g;&a;nbsp;reported efforts towards&l;a href=&q;https://www.trefis.com/articles/426999/what-to-make-of-goldmans-cryptocurrency-trading-plans/2017-12-22&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g; setting up a cryptocurrency trading desk&l;/a&g;. This marked a departure from the overwhelmingly negative stance taken by investment banks against cryptocurrencies, and the investment bank&a;rsquo;s impending entry into the market was seen as a first step towards the integration of cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial industry.\nAdditionally, the fact that many cryptocurrency exchanges are now required to be registered with financial regulators (like the SEC in the U.S.) is also likely to make the nascent industry more stable and sustainable in the long run &a;ndash; something that boosted investor confidence in cryptocurrencies over recent weeks.\n&l;strong&g;What We Expect Going Forward&l;/strong&g;\n&l;!–nextpage–&g; Goldman is reportedly close to getting its cryptocurrency trading desk up and running, with the bank expected to start by offering its clients derivatives that are linked to cryptocurrencies. The investment bank is likely to begin buying and selling bitcoins on behalf of clients once it receives the requisite approval from regulators. Goldman&a;rsquo;s presence is likely to get other investment banks (including boutique investment banks which operate on a smaller scale) interested in cryptocurrency over coming months.\nMoreover, &l;a href=&q;http://finapps.forbes.com/finapps/jsp/finance/compinfo/CIAtAGlance.jsp?tkr=ice&a;amp;tab=searchtabquotesdark&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;IntercontinentalExchange&l;/a&g; (which owns the NYSE) has been working on a new trading platform that will allow institutional investors to buy and hold cryptocurrencies &a;ndash; marking another important step for the industry. As other mainstream exchanges begin allowing clients to trade in cryptocurrencies on their platform, there should be a steady increase in trading activity levels.\n&l;strong&g;What Does This Mean For Bitcoin&a;rsquo;s Price?&l;/strong&g;\nLike the price for anything, Bitcoin&a;rsquo;s price depends on two things: demand and supply, i.e. how many people want it vs. what is available. Demand for Bitcoin is primarily driven by two factors: the number of active users, and how much they transact. On the supply side, the number of available Bitcoins is capped, and about 80% of the capped number is already mined. As such, it is sensible to focus on the demand, both in terms of users and transaction volumes. In our interactive Bitcoin Price Estimator, we forecast changes in the number of unique users as well as transaction volumes for each month over the rest of 2018 to arrive at our estimate for Bitcoin&a;rsquo;s fundamental value. As we expect both these metrics to grow steadily over coming months from increased acceptance by mainstream financial institutions, Bitcoin could be headed to $15,000 by the end of the year.\n&l;a href=&q;https://vimeo.com/257961400&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;&l;strong&g;This video&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g; shows how to leverage our bitcoin pricing dashboard.

trading above $9,000 and below $10,000 for some time now. It is now trading at the lower end of that range and has come close to the $9,000 mark. Bitcoin's recent performance On Monday the price of bitcoin dropped below $9,200 and technical charts on Tuesday indicated that it could fall below the $9,000 mark. The cryptocurrency closed on Monday below the 10-day moving average (MA). This is a sign of at least a short-term bullish invalidation. Over the weekend the price failed to break through the $10,000 level after coming close as reported in a recent Digital Journal article . On Wednesday the price of bitcoin dropped below the $9,000 level marginally. It opened at $9,184 not very far off the $9,000 mark. The price fell as low as $8,980 on Bitfinex hitting seven-day lows. The bear-flag breakdown witnessed on Tuesday signaled a possible fall to $8,865. Coindesk's analysis for Thursday Although there was a brief rally in the price of bitcoin yesterday, Coindesk claims that the price is still in corrective mode and risked falling back once again below $9,000 according to chart analysis. The cryptocurrency broke out of the bearish falling channel setup yesterday by way of a bullish relative strength index (RSI) that indicated that the recent pullback from its recent high of $9,990 had ended with the recent low of $8,980. The breakout also brought up the possibility of a stronger move back towards $9,767 and even perhaps a test of the $10,000 mark. The hourly chart shows that the price is attempting to break about the $9,380 level, with a major resistance being at $9,442 the 200-hour moving average (MA). The high so far today at about 19:35 UTC time has been around $9,383. Momentum studies are bearish. Both the 100-hour MA and the 50-hour MA are descending and have not bottomed out. The short-term moving averages also favor the bears. Any move above $9,442 could be difficult. Coindesk outlook Coindesk's view :\"A break below $9,228 (support on the hourly chart) would add credence to the bearish 5-day MA and 10-day MA crossover and open the doors for a drop to $8,980 and $8,868 (100-day moving average). A daily close (as per UTC) below $8,652 (April 26 low) would confirm a bearish reversal.On the higher side, a daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA (currently located at $9,452) would signal the end of the pullback from the recent high of $9,990. \" Present situation As of 20:03 the price of bitcoin was $9,066.88 barely above the $9,000 level and the trend was downward. At the opening, the price was $9,306 and the high was just $9,383 so far today. The present price is almost at the low so far which was $9,063.96. There are still almost four hours before the close today. If the trend continues then the close could be below the $8,000 mark but a lot can happen in four hours and perhaps there will bitcoin can recover to close further from the $9,000 level. The present price can be found here. UPDATE: At about half an hour into May 11th the price of bitcoin has dropped from $9,014.61 to about $8, 889 a drop of over a hundred dollars in half an hour. Perhaps, we will see a breakout to the downside. The price managed to stay just above the $9,000 mark at closing yesterday but now has once again dropped below that mark.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.coindesk.com/topping-out-bitcoin-bulls-need-to-defend-9k/", "http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "https://www.coindesk.com/drop-to-9k-still-in-play-despite-brief-bitcoin-rally/", "https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-risks-drop-below-9k-after-4-day-low/", "https://www.coindesk.com/price/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ken hanly", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "coindesk", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "digital journal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T00:10:38.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ab4edf9821316ce7be26a22acf14594bed2bdcf4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWL4.fplZp2gU8cGJk4cAKmbxOSXASigLGWFyqWKphfwn0Wv.71NOVbW8uDWhsVYr22UkKFTpc..yt3Hv48E7D.uNzAV6p1VCAgZblGOt4ezMN4TwRzPDEAMUmYfZULuY7Rb_fE86auQ--", "site_full": "www.whatsonthorold.com", "site": "whatsonthorold.com", "site_section": "https://www.whatsonthorold.com/feed/rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "WhatsOnThorold", "title": "Analysts covering Bitcoin Gold (BTG) look at the 3.28% rise on May 9-10", "title_full": "Analysts covering Bitcoin Gold (BTG) look at the 3.28% rise on May 9-10", "published": "2018-05-10T23:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.whatsonthorold.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/3.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ab4edf9821316ce7be26a22acf14594bed2bdcf4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWL4.fplZp2gU8cGJk4cAKmbxOSXASigLGWFyqWKphfwn0Wv.71NOVbW8uDWhsVYr22UkKFTpc..yt3Hv48E7D.uNzAV6p1VCAgZblGOt4ezMN4TwRzPDEAMUmYfZULuY7Rb_fE86auQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Peter Erickson", "published": "2018-05-10T23:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Analysts covering Bitcoin Gold (BTG) look at the 3.28% rise on May 9-10", "text": "Analysts covering Bitcoin Gold (BTG) look at the 3.28% rise on May 9-10\nMay 10, 2018 - By Peter Erickson\nBitcoin Gold (BTG) had a good 24 hours as the cryptocurrency jumped $2.21 or 3.28% trading at $69.55.

Source: Tkeycoin\nFrequently referring to the Tkeycoin Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), the developers are hoping to source funding from willing investors who share the same vision.\nDeveloped as an egalitarian platform, it’s token will act as a mechanism for hiring services and buying goods, trading knowledge or anything else for that matter, while also giving rise to, the society first imagined by many when Bitcoin was launched in 2009.\nThe company points to research that indicates both an unwillingness by the general public to adopt digital currencies as well as the fragmentation of the cryptosphere. It is precisely this splintering into myriad tokens, objectives, and outcomes that the developers maintain is a terminal trend for cryptocurrencies and one they aim to curtail at this early stage.\nUltimately built to eliminate fracturing inputs from investment or mining cabals, governments, and any other supposed self-serving interests, the platform seeks a return to that which was briefly glimpsed at the dawn of cryptocurrency.

Often, any concept of a new economic dispensation remains mired in the known paradigm of current business as usual, unable to truly sweep clean due to vested interests and the daily grind of commerce.\nAccording to research conducted by the company, four fundamental obstacles inhibit the majority of cryptocurrencies from having a significant impact. These are scalability, narrow application, hard usage and the absence of a corporate market.\nThese four major points, in the eyes of Tkeycoin, form the basis of the reason why cryptocurrencies are not a significant threat to the existing fiat currency system. The company aims to bridge this gap by bringing the market to the masses, a new twist on the traditional approach of bringing the masses to the market.\nThrough greater accessibility, cryptocurrency’s ease of use is amplified, and its economic reach is extended. Consequently, users spanning the globe will enjoy the benefits of a decentralized, quick and low-cost payment system that is simple to use and available to everyone. The Tkeycoin Solution\nThe innately egalitarian power of blockchain is encapsulated within the Tkeycoin utility token. A process of debugging of the ecosystem is anticipated that will involve eliminating behavior or employment of the technology outside of what is deemed appropriate to enable the democratic and fluid nature of the blockchain.\nThe company seeks to address social inequalities by issuing what it hopes will become a universal token enabling working, sharing and living communally.\nTkeycoin employs its own blockchain protocol to bring cryptocurrency to millions of previously underserved users, using an advanced bandwidth capable of supporting 500,000 transactions per second.\nAs well as enabling worldwide cryptocurrency exchanges, Tkeycoin promotes a fair shopping policy in which a verification protocol accurately records vendor rating data. All operations and transactions which take place on the Tkeycoin DAO are verified by smart contracts, which in turn dispel fraudulent transactions from the network.\nTkeycoin assists both freelancers and businesses, providing an internal job network for the former and seamless low-cost payment services for the latter.\nStartup companies can utilize the TBP protocol to conduct token sales as a means of crowdfunding to raise capital for new ventures. Further to that, the Tkeycoin wallet provides secure and easily accessible funds storage, for convenient exchange or spending.\nThe developers will mint and release 105 million TCD (the token symbol). The ICO is live , and any user with 3,000 TCD or more in their wallet can also mine the network. Frequently refuting its status as a token, the developers insist that TCD is a coin on its own blockchain, a subtlety not made perfectly clear in the available information. TCD can be purchased with ETH, BTC, LTC, DASH, RUR, EUR and USD. 1 TCD = 1 USD and each year 30 million new coins will be issued. Funds Distribution, Source: Tkeycoin The Tkeycoin Team\nThere are various tweaks and nuances to the security protocols at play in the Tkeycoin blockchain, and the white paper is highly technical. Overall, the developers have articulated a massively detailed and elegant offering.\nThe team consists of Russian Physicists, Mathematicians, Engineers, and Dreamers. Conclusion\nThe Tkeycoin ICO is ambitious in its reach, well thought out and very technically detailed.\nAlthough leading to improved UX and a host of other benefits, it is not clear exactly how huge the idea could be, especially as individual cryptocurrencies are already entrenched and industry players are bending blockchain to their own unique needs.\nBTCManager does not endorse any content or product on this page.

The positive candle of course suggests that we could rally again, reaching towards the $10,000 level. We have been consolidating between the $9000 level on the bottom and the $10,000 level above, and the action on Wednesday only reinforced this situation. The market breaking above the $10,000 level could release Bitcoin to go looking towards the $12,000 level, which has been resistance previously. Ultimately, if we were to break down below the $9000 level, it could release this market down to the $8000 level. I anticipate that there are a lot of back-and-forth moves left in this market, so I think that short-term range bound trading is probably going to be what we continue to see. However, we have a couple of obvious levels that could throw more money into the market, such as a break above the previously mentioned resistance barrier, or of course a breakdown below the $9000 level that allows this market to drop to $8000 next. \\n\\n\n\\n\\n BTC\\/JPY \\n\\n\nBitcoin also rallied against the Japanese yen during the day on Wednesday, using the ¥1 million level as support, and of course an attraction level. I think that the market is probably going to try to break towards the ¥1.1 million level, which clearing that level opens the door to the top of the major consolidation level at the ¥1.25 million level. If we were to break down below the ¥900,000 level, then I think the market drops down to the ¥700,000 level. This is essentially the middle of the overall consolidation area, but that means that we could go in either direction. \\n\\n\n\\n\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T15:27:26.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "24e4205471f404514fc90addb4006e5a60f36d4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFQEnQZZ12txl0yuR5uJG13qZePq730Gel56AeSLmyWBmIqXSLrbrYlPK0EKWHY17kpZfHhpIYbIoplYROY.ebuGRelsA9lQNHQRazBpfvF8G9ZhHtNyHFMFbuCXF06o0U0HTrI3lgaXKYwPZQjg3w6V", "site_full": "forextv.com", "site": "forextv.com", "site_section": "http://forextv.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "retirement_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "ForexTV", "title": "‘Icons’ like Mark Zuckerberg shouldn’t be ‘picked on’ by the government, says VC and bitcoin enthusiast Tim Draper", "title_full": "‘Icons’ like Mark Zuckerberg shouldn’t be ‘picked on’ by the government, says VC and bitcoin enthusiast Tim Draper", "published": "2018-05-10T23:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "24e4205471f404514fc90addb4006e5a60f36d4a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFQEnQZZ12txl0yuR5uJG13qZePq730Gel56AeSLmyWBmIqXSLrbrYlPK0EKWHY17kpZfHhpIYbIoplYROY.ebuGRelsA9lQNHQRazBpfvF8G9ZhHtNyHFMFbuCXF06o0U0HTrI3lgaXKYwPZQjg3w6V", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin News Editor", "published": "2018-05-10T23:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "‘Icons’ like Mark Zuckerberg shouldn’t be ‘picked on’ by the government, says VC and bitcoin enthusiast Tim Draper", "text": "Webmaster Tools Risk Disclaimer - By using this web site you agree to its terms and conditions.

Since April 17, bitcoin has picked up approximately $1,500 per coin.\nStill, Pantera was outshined by at least two passive index funds. Bitwise HOLD 10 Private Index Fund was up 52.9% in April, after fees, according to person familiar with the matter. And Hehmeyer Trading's Cryptocurrency Index Fund ended April up 51.7%, according to the company.\nTo be sure, many hedge funds have outperformed passive funds year-to-date, according to Joe DiPasquale, the founder of BitBull Capital, a cryptocurrency fund of funds.\n\"BitBull's diligence on crypto funds shows that the many well-run funds were about 15% higher than HOLD 10 through April 2018,\" DiPasquale said in a statement. \"While most did not outperform in bull months like April, they did in bear months like January and March, as well as in bull years like 2017 vs backtest of indexes.\"\nAs for Pantera's Digital Asset Fund, it is down 34% since the beginning of the year, which is slightly worse than bitcoin's performance. The cryptocurrency is down 30% year-to-date, according to Market Insider data.\nElsewhere at Pantera, its ICO fund was up a whopping 60% in April. And its Long-Term ICO fund gained 5% in April.\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.panteracapital.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pantera capital", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "digital asset fund", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T18:36:45.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8d70bff72dde2c190526b0fde0b4fbf2a571eaea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_pozj1Z8NU88Qzypaqq3fGO3u9Uy6T5oDI0tGi9RUCFUWPhza7JPUxYDaDQkJxlqwQckHOEem0b5QVZ5Muu_RnXEm", "site_full": "investorshub.advfn.com", "site": "advfn.com", "site_section": "http://investorshub.advfn.com/Bitcoin-Invt-GBTC-29559/", "site_categories": ["investing", "stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Invt.

More than 1,500 other cryptocurrencies have come into existence since bitcoin’s inception in 2009, each one trying to overcome one or more of bitcoin’s flaws.\nIncreasing interest in bitcoin over the last year has been reflected across the cryptocurrency markets, with ethereum and bitcoin cash making significant gains on bitcoin.\nIn the past 12 months, the price of one bitcoin has risen from around $1,700 to $9,360 - an increase of 450 per cent. In the same timeframe, ethereum has seen gains of almost 1,000 per cent to reach its current value of $764, while bitcoin cash has surged from around $500 in August last year to today’s price of $1,655.\nThe price of ethereum may still be a long way off bitcoin, however there are five-times more in circulation - meaning ethereum’s market cap is just under half that of bitcoin’s.\nOther cryptocurrency experts contend that bitcoin is too well established to lose its position as the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency.\nMichael Jackson, the former COO of Skype who now works for the investment firm Mangrove Capital Partners, believed the issues that blight bitcoin can be overcome, therefore negating the benefits of alternative cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash.\n“There is so much talent in the crypto space, and people are working on solving these scalability problems,” Mr Jackson said.\n“I don’t see why bitcoin shouldn’t remain in the number one spot. It is still by far the best known and it is ultimately the reserve currency in the space.”\nBitcoin could remain the world’s dominant cryptocurrency, Mr Ver conceded, but he does not believe such a scenario is likely. While its perceived limitations may see its price stagnate, the utility of bitcoin cash could see its price reach “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in the future.\n“It’s not guaranteed but it is much more likely to happen than not,” Mr Ver said. “Bitcoin cash has more than doubled in value in the last month and big investors coming in soon could see it double again by next week. People love to chase a rising star.”\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/Flippening?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://twitter.com/MKjrstad/status/994388739500670976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/143316473001208/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger ver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marius kjærstad", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T18:53:59.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4c68e68df9fcd4932ceafd5dcb38d1c7b76af960", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_pozj1Z8NU88Qzypaqq3fGO3u9Uy6T5oDI0tGi9RUCFUWPhza7JPUxYDaDQkJxlqwQckHOEem0b5QVUi6RUWRqiD1", "site_full": "investorshub.advfn.com", "site": "advfn.com", "site_section": "http://investorshub.advfn.com/Bitcoin-Invt-GBTC-29559/", "site_categories": ["investing", "stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Invt.

Top Crypto Analysts believe that Bitcoin Cash / BCC (BCH) is looking for the $1817.81 goal. According to 8 analysts could reach $3647.80. The highest price was $1678.47 and lowest of $1488.45 for May 9-10. The open was $1504.06. It last traded at Exmo exchange. Aproximately 82,021 BCH worth $131.24 million was traded.\nFor a month, Bitcoin Cash / BCC (BCH) tokens went up 153.23% from $652.58 for coin. For 100 days BCH is up 12.96% from $1462.99. It traded at $325.88 200 days ago. Bitcoin Cash / BCC (BCH) has 17.12 million coins mined with the market cap $28.29 billion. It has 21.00M coins in circulation. It was founded on 01/08/2017. The Crypto BCH has PoW proof type and operates under SHA256 algorithm.\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is a hard forked version of the original Bitcoin. It is similar to bitcoin with regards to its protocol; Proof of Work SHA-256 hashing, 21,000,000 supply, same block times and reward system. However two main differences are the the blocksize limits, as of August 2017 Bitcoin has a 1MB blocksize limit whereas BCH proposes 8MB blocks.

If the IPO is successful it would make Canaan\\u00a0the first company from the blockchain industry to be listed on the Hong Kong bourse. \\n\nThe rumors that Canaan Creative have been considering launching an IPO outside of China started in April, with most considering the US and Hong Kong as top candidates. Now the unnamed sources say the company has settled on Hong Kong and will be looking to reach the billion-dollar mark. \\n\nThe Hanzou based company was founded in 2013 to design and sell the high-performance circuits specific to mining Bitcoin. In 2017 Canaan released unaudited figures that showed a net income of 410 Million Yuan ($64 million) which was a 600 percent increase over 2016 profits. \\n\nCanaan has previously made two attempts at raising funds through IPO’s in China. First in 2016 when the company tried to gain a listing in China’s A-share market by partnering with electric equipment maker Luyitong but the plan ended when regulators\\u00a0judged the deal to be overvalued. They failed again in 2017 when they applied for a listing in China’s “New Third Board”\\u00a0 market which requires less stringent requirements for undisclosed reasons. \\n\nAmid China’s crackdown on crypto trading and ICOs the majority of Canaan’s clients are still in the country which remains one of the top three Bitcoin mining nations. The company’s decision to launch an IPO out of the country may be linked to its future plans of creating home appliances that also passively mine cryptocurrency and its desired expansion to create chips for mining alt currencies. \\n Mining Conglomerates Could Choke Ethereum \\n\nCanaan seeking to raise a billion dollars in order to expand its already massive mining interest leads to concerns over the decentralization of cryptocurrency mining\\u00a0as Bitcoin mining giant Bitmain begins a shift towards mining Ether to increase profits. \\n\nEthereum’s increase in popularity and price has attracted mining conglomerates to either change over from mining Bitcoin or add new hardware in order to mine its native token the Ether. Bitmain which builds and operates mining rigs that are much more powerful than the average GPU miner may endanger the decentralized nature of the network. \\n\nThe dominance of mining conglomerates can push GPU miners out of the space leaving the network to be reliant on a few giant companies.

The dubious doppelganger called Electrum Pro appeared online in March and has been flagged as malware since. \\n Fake Bitcoin Wallet Swipes Seed Keys \\n\nAccording to reports the team behind the original wallet posted a document on Github explaining how to get rid of the impostor. It was obvious for a while that the duplicate wallet was malicious as it used the branding of the company without permission. In a further attempt to deceive users into downloading the malware cybercriminals registered the electrum.com domain to copy the original electrum.org. \\n\nDevelopers have exposed a line of code from the fake wallet that appears to take the user\\u2019s seed key and upload it to the spurious domain.

The FacexWorm hijacks CPU computing power to pilfer Monero in addition to spreading affiliate links for various crypto exchanges. \\n\nOther reports indicate that as many as 400 US government and business websites running the Drupal content management system could be infected with mining malware. Those infected were running an outdated version of the platform and included websites of the US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), Chinese tech giant Lenovo, Taiwanese network hardware manufacturer D-Link, and the University of California (UCLA). \\n\nAccording to the report government administered websites in the Mexico, Turkey, Peru, South Africa, and Italy have also been affected with the mining malware. As with the majority of these types of infections, Coinhive is once again the culprit. As crypto becomes a part of more people’s lives malware designed to steal it by mining or otherwise will be on the rise. \\n\n \\n Image from Shutterstock \\n\nThe post Electrum Copycat Crypto Wallet Steals Seed Keys appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T15:15:09.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "63ca3a8fb64b146d5bc452c219a2622710e87348", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNJdrTvalju.n2qmnMc4JxZSzcfwtzWvTQv_LKqAIhdaH8ByMLsHZ8t5liw16flIN1TPQgW4JgK_wlulYjAuiy2R9oeZhweNmyvewNyIeO57v", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/news-btc", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "NewsBTC - Barchart.com", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price found support", "title_full": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price found support", "published": "2018-05-10T23:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.123, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "63ca3a8fb64b146d5bc452c219a2622710e87348", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNJdrTvalju.n2qmnMc4JxZSzcfwtzWvTQv_LKqAIhdaH8ByMLsHZ8t5liw16flIN1TPQgW4JgK_wlulYjAuiy2R9oeZhweNmyvewNyIeO57v", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aayush Jindal", "published": "2018-05-10T23:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price found support", "text": "Key Points \\n \\n Bitcoin cash price found support near the $1,460 level and recovered nicely against the US Dollar. \\n This week\\u2019s major bearish trend line with resistance at $1,580 was broken on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). \\n The pair also moved above the $1,600 resistance level, which is a positive sign in the near term. \\n \\n\nBitcoin cash price is back in a positive zone above $1,600 against the US Dollar.

The Reddit community for Bitcoin is /r/bitcoin and the currency’s Github account can be viewed here .\nAccording to CryptoCompare, “Balances – block chain The block chain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions – private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing – mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends. “\nBitcoin Coin Trading\nBitcoin can be bought or sold on the following cryptocurrency exchanges: Coinsuper, Exrates, BitMEX, Livecoin, itBit, Huobi, Trade By Trade, Cobinhood, YoBit, Binance , Cryptopia, BtcTrade.im, Coinhub, QuadrigaCX, CoinEx Market, Negocie Coins, Lbank, CoinsBank, Foxbit, Bitstamp, Bittrex, BitBay, BX Thailand, B2BX, Bitbank, Quoine, Allcoin, bitFlyer, OTCBTC, Bitinka, Hotbit, fex, CoinEgg, Upbit, Coinfloor, BTCC, OKEx, CEX.IO, Poloniex, Kucoin, WEX, OOOBTC, Paribu, RightBTC, Neraex, ZB.COM, Fatbtc, Coinroom, TOPBTC, Indodax, Iquant, OEX, BCEX, Coinrail, Tidex, Octaex, Kraken, Sistemkoin, GDAX, CoinBene, Gate.io, HitBTC, Bibox, Liqui, Exmo, BTCTurk, Luno, CoinTiger, Bithumb, EXX, Bitfinex, Bit-Z, Omicrex, Gemini, Zebpay, Coinone, Zaif, BTCBOX, Fisco, xBTCe, LakeBTC, Korbit, DragonEX and Simex.

Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The value of currencies may fluctuate and investors may lose all or more than their original investments. Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices.

Dutch banking giant Rabobank is in hot water over allegations that its US arm acted as a funnel for drug-cartel cash.\nAccording to a report by Bloomberg , the Department of Justice is considering whether to accuse John Ryan, Rabobank NA’s ex-CEO; Dan Weiss, the bank’s former general counsel; and Laura Akahoshi, the ex-compliance chief, following a four-year investigation of Rabobank.\nSources with knowledge of the probe confirmed that “Akahoshi is a former OCC official herself who Rabobank hired a decade ago because of her expertise with money-laundering rules. The criminal investigation stems from accusations that in 2013 she and the other senior executives deliberately withheld from regulators an internal report that documented Rabobank’s shortcomings, the two people said.”\nAccording to the Justice Department , drug cartels used California bank branches of Rabobank near the Mexican border for a money laundering operation that began in 2009. In February, Rabobank pleaded guilty and agreed to pay over $360 million in fines for allowing illicit funds to be processed through the bank despite suspicious activity that should have raised red flags and triggered an extensive review.\n“Rabobank pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States and to corruptly obstruct an examination of a financial institution. In pleading guilty, Rabobank admitted to conspiring with several former executives to defraud the United States by unlawfully impeding the OCC’s ability to regulate the bank, and to obstruct an examination by the OCC of its operations throughout California, including its Calexico and Tecate bank branches. Rabobank admitted that its deficient AML program allowed hundreds of millions of dollars in untraceable cash, sourced from Mexico and elsewhere, to be deposited into its rural bank branches in Imperial County, and transferred via wire transfers, checks, and cash transactions, without proper notification to federal regulators as required by law.”\nRabobank has $723 billion in assets with specialized units across the globe. It is considered a global leader in agricultural financing despite its role in the Libor scandal of 2013 when US, UK and Dutch regulators found Rabobank guilty of manipulating Libor currency rates worldwide. The bank was fined $1 billion .\nBitcoin is a blockchain-based payment system that allows peer-to-peer, cross-border transactions. It is frequently cited as a preferred method for criminals, although a recent study found that less than 1% of all Bitcoin transactions involve money laundering and illegal activities.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://dailyhodl.com/2018/04/30/monero-zcash-and-dash-facing-pressure-from-cryptocurrency-regulators-in-japan/", "https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/rabobank-na-pleads-guilty-agrees-pay-over-360-million", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-10/ceo-whose-bank-hid-drug-cash-is-said-to-face-u-s-criminal-probe", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-rabobank-libor/dutch-rabobank-fined-1-billion-over-libor-scandal-idUSBRE99S0L520131029"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laura akahoshi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan weiss", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rabobank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rabobank na", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "occ", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T05:51:25.039+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5300711d4272210f3f445a52f60b3bda56f0057c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTRGVAuhAtgS9jAW0GVt4qJUrd7l6EcpOQ3JFhrBS4tgsGJlml6cOwNR1jOCCW0usWsZKTXiqdZBfrUOOsg6ia3wUBXPiZjDaVGHH2v6LnC1g--", "site_full": "dvolatility-pro.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://dvolatility-pro.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Dvolatility Pro", "title": "Cryptos Suddenly Crack As FundStrat Sees Bitcoin $36k By YE2019", "title_full": "Cryptos Suddenly Crack As FundStrat Sees Bitcoin $36k By YE2019", "published": "2018-05-10T22:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5300711d4272210f3f445a52f60b3bda56f0057c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTRGVAuhAtgS9jAW0GVt4qJUrd7l6EcpOQ3JFhrBS4tgsGJlml6cOwNR1jOCCW0usWsZKTXiqdZBfrUOOsg6ia3wUBXPiZjDaVGHH2v6LnC1g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dvolatility Network (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-10T22:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cryptos Suddenly Crack As FundStrat Sees Bitcoin $36k By YE2019", "text": "...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T21:13:24.264+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7b2808a5c46e396b7cb692973bd61170235e1ce2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbp_QMzL_IvIwuRjD1V9RNw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Futures destroyed Bitcoin", "title_full": "Futures destroyed Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-10T22:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7b2808a5c46e396b7cb692973bd61170235e1ce2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbp_QMzL_IvIwuRjD1V9RNw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "GDragon", "published": "2018-05-10T22:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Futures destroyed Bitcoin", "text": "Give me some explanation nonsense poser.

Where Does Bitcoin Fit In Portfolios? May 10, 2018 Cinthia Murphy\nThere’s still no bitcoin ETF on the market, but that doesn’t mean ETF investors aren’t contending with the notion of whether bitcoin—and cryptocurrencies in general—belong in an asset allocation.\nIn an ETF wrapper, access to bitcoin today can only be achieved indirectly through some ETFs such as a pair of ARK Invest funds—the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) and the ARK Web x.0 ETF (ARKW) —that currently allocate less than 1% each to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a closed-end fund.\nStill, Matt Hougan, global head of research for Bitwise Asset Management in San Francisco, and a well-respected expert in the ETF realm, recently penned a report arguing cryptos belong in a diversified portfolio. His work looked at the impact that a 1%, 5% and 10% allocation to cryptos would have on a 60/40 portfolio.\nWe spoke with Hougan, and two other advisors, about whether they thought cryptocurrencies belong in portfolios, and whether they’d add them to their asset allocation models.\nMatt Hougan, Global Head of Research, Bitwise Asset Management; San Francisco:\nThe data suggest that adding a small amount of cryptoassets to your portfolio and rebalancing regularly can improve your risk-adjusted returns. Whatever you think about it philosophically, that's what the data show. Crypto has combined high returns with low correlations to other asset classes, which is a pretty good combo for portfolio construction.\nThere is every reason to believe correlations will remain low when measured over any meaningful time period, as the fundamental drivers of crypto returns are different than the fundamental drivers of stocks, bonds, etc. The right allocation for most investors is pretty small: You're talking about 1%, 2% or 5% at the outside. These are very volatile assets. But used correctly, they can be quite helpful in a portfolio setting.\nJohn Davi, Founder & CIO, Astoria Portfolio Advisors; New York:\nWe strongly believe in the need for alternatives, commodities and hedge fund replication strategies within a multi-asset portfolio to help diversify traditional stock and bond risk factors. In our never-ending quest to find liquid, listed, transparent and tax efficient alternatives to hedge traditional stock and bond portfolios, we’ve examined the potential use of digital assets as a liquid alternative.\nThe pricing of digital assets resembles stock trading in the early 1900s or emerging market equities 20-30 years ago where spreads were wide, volatility was sky high and information flow was low. More knowledge, education, technology and more access to solutions should temper price volatility, but this will take time.\nSome compare digital assets to gold, which has relatively higher intrinsic value compared to digital assets. Gold’s supply is elastic, whereas bitcoin is highly inelastic. These are important differences along with the fact that gold has a multiple-century head start compared to digital assets.\nThe “evidence” would suggest that they serve as a valuable portfolio diversifier if one were to incorporate a small allocation with strict rebalancing and risk management practices. However, one needs to temper this “evidence-based analysis,” given it can be challenging to account for bid/offer and transition costs, both of which are extremely high.\nWe get it: digital assets are uncorrelated. But what’s the point if it’s not accessible, execution costs are sky high and the liquidity profile is poor?\nWe hope the liquidity profile for digital assets improves. Equally important, as their liquidity improves, we hope their uncorrelated nature remains intact. However, one should realize liquidity and correlation tend to go hand in hand (more liquidity tends to result in higher correlation). Let’s see.\nBen Lavine, CIO, 3D Asset Management; Hartford, Connecticut:\nThe intrinsic value of a cryptocurrency is inherently based on, first, its ability to solve digital asset transactions that don’t involve a third party, and, second, on demand for such transactions. From an investor’s viewpoint, cryptocurrencies exhibit similar characteristics to that of precious metals—the desire to hold an asset as a store of value independent of government-issued currencies.\nWe believe cryptocurrencies have more commercial applications for handling complex transactions and as a means of raising capital for venture projects than as investments held in broad asset allocation portfolios.\nThe private, anonymous aspect of cryptocurrencies is appealing, but also makes it a target for regulatory scrutiny. For cryptocurrency investments to become more widely adopted, the investment costs—custody, investment vehicles, management fees—must come down and there needs to be commensurate improvement in security, transparency and auditing.\nContact Cinthia Murphy at [email protected] Related ETFs", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://static.bitwiseinvestments.com/CryptoInstitutionalPortfolio.pdf", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hougan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt hougan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitwise asset management", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T11:27:53.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "12fb5e832fdae012e0c24a4e3a660397c1711c41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkdynKqnkSXb34_YbwZjDPi781Cz7XncCskhADj2Ld5783gTfdaC0NSpf3ztN3rWuA759n3x_PUh_XZZEKVSr.gNfbchImc1H48-", "site_full": "www.americanbankingnews.com", "site": "americanbankingnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.americanbankingnews.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "American Banking News", "title": "Bitcoin Atom (BCA) Trading 41% Higher Over Last Week", "title_full": "Bitcoin Atom (BCA) Trading 41% Higher Over Last Week", "published": "2018-05-10T22:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/2387.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "12fb5e832fdae012e0c24a4e3a660397c1711c41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkdynKqnkSXb34_YbwZjDPi781Cz7XncCskhADj2Ld5783gTfdaC0NSpf3ztN3rWuA759n3x_PUh_XZZEKVSr.gNfbchImc1H48-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ABMN Staff", "published": "2018-05-10T22:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Atom (BCA) Trading 41% Higher Over Last Week", "text": "Posted by ABMN Staff on May 10th, 2018 // No Comments\nBitcoin Atom (CURRENCY:BCA) traded down 8.5% against the US dollar during the 24-hour period ending at 10:00 AM E.T. on May 10th.

The head of data research believes that Bitcoin miners will hold Bitcoin as its price falls to break-even levels for operating costs. As the price rises, the miners will sell their hoard for greater profits. Bitcoin has mostly remained in the $9,000 range with a 52-week high of just over $19,000.

The company operates mining facilities in Washington state and northern Sweden and owns 7,000 mining devices.\nThe North American Marijuana Index, comprised of the leading cannabis stocks in the U.S. and Canada, was up slightly.\nResidents of Carpinteria, an oceanside town in Southern California, have begun to complain that the smell of marijuana crops nearby have become distracting, according to a report by the Independent. The county has 800 marijuana cultivation licenses, the largest number of any county in California.\nMYM Nutraceuticals shares jumped after the cannabis company announced that the cultivation license for its Sublime Culture facility is under final review with Health Canada. The Vancouver-based company worked with Cannabis Compliance Inc, a company that helps commercial cannabis producers meet regulatory compliance. Shares were up more than 10% to US$1.19.

Novogratz's Galaxy Digital Capital Management LP and Bloomberg will establish the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (BGCI). The index service will provide trusted asset tracking for 10 of the most liquid cryptocurrencies in the market.\nThe Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index The BGCI is part of the Bloomberg Index Services Limited catalog and is administered by the company. The platform offers institutional-grade benchmarking standards for cryptocurrencies.\nSpeaking on the launch, Alan Campbell, the Bloomberg Indices Global Product Manager, said:\nToday's launch of the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index reflects our clients' growing interest in cryptocurrencies. The index brings our rigorous approach to index construction to cryptos and will provide investors with a transparent benchmark to gauge the performance of the broader market.\nHow the Index Works The BGCI will monitor and track the performance of the ten largest cryptocurrencies based on their market cap. The index operates via a rules-based methodology. To ensure accuracy, all data used by the index must pass the due-diligence framework set by both Bloomberg and Galaxy Digital.\nNot all cryptocurrencies are the same. As a result, the BGCI's cryptocurrency tracking pool covers the different classes of digital coins. These classes are privacy assets, mediums of exchange, stores of value, and smart contract tokens. The ten cryptos contained in the BGCI paradigm at its launch are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple , Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Dash, Monero, Ethereum Classic, and Zcash.\nThe maximum and minimum cap for any coin on the index is 30 percent and 1 percent respectively. At inception, both Bitcoin and Ethereum make up 30 percent of the BGCI while Zcash is at one percent. Commenting on the way the BCGI is structured, Steve Kurz, Asset Management Chief at Galaxy Digital, said:\nWe are thrilled to partner with Bloomberg on the BGCI. The index's independent, rules-based methodology provides a strong foundation on which the cryptocurrency ecosystem will continue to grow and mature.\nThe BGCI will Become the S&P 500 for Cryptos Mike Novogratz, the founder of Galaxy Digital, expressed optimism at the new BGCI. He described the index as another milestone in the march towards the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. He also said the platform adopts the rigorous approach utilized by mainstream benchmarking services to the crypto market.\nCommenting on the potential importance of the BGCI, Novogratz said:\nWe wanted an institutional player for the whole ecosystem, and I think it's important for the crypto ecosystem. You're starting to see more institutional participation, and what they're looking for is this architecture — here's an index that will feel like the S&P 500 in a few months, that people can benchmark themselves against.\nBloomberg and Galaxy Digital aren't the first to launch a crypto benchmarking platform. Upbit, the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange, recently created a cryptocurrency index service.\nDo you think the BGCI will become the de facto crypto benchmarking service for mainstream investors?

The world’s largest cryptocurrency had spent the majority of the day trading near $9,325 on Bitfinex, though it peaked as high as $9,390 during the early morning hours. At approximately 16:45, the bitcoin price entered a severe downward spiral — severe, at least, in comparison to its recent price movements. By 17:00, bitcoin had fallen to $9,205, and it ultimately fell as far as $9,112 before experiencing a $65 bounce. At present, bitcoin is valued at $9,177 on Bitfinex, though it remains to be seen whether BTC will continue to defend the $9,000 barrier. BTC Price Chart Today’s movement marks a stark reversal from last Saturday when bitcoin appeared poised to triumphantly cross the $10,000 threshold for the first time since early March. However, the rally stalled at $9,990, and bitcoin has failed to challenge that mark in the five days since.
