But now that we have seen major financial institutions accept its use, it seems almost certain that Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies have found themselves a position in the future of the financial markets. To gain a sense of how quickly Bitcoin has become a legitimate asset, consider the chart below:\nHere, we can see that annual car sales in the United States required 60 years to reach the $100 billion mark. It took the world’s largest company, Apple, Inc., 32 years to reach that same mark. For Bitcoin, this took a mere six years – and this does not even take the values of the other common cryptocurrencies into consideration.\nThat is quite a lot of value creation in a very short period of time. It also shows the ways Bitcoin acceptance into the mainstream has actually shown very few limitations when viewing things from the historical perspective. Global Currency Alternatives\nOne of the reasons behind the meteoric rise Bitcoin lies in the fact that blockchain-based transactions do not need to be filtered through the fiat currency systems enabled by governments. This ultimately puts more freedom in the hands of the consumer, and this has helped cryptocurrencies find a major audience. In the chart below, we can see that this acceptance of Bitcoin has been both widespread and diverse:\nLast year, most of the growth in cryptocurrency investment was seen in emerging Asia, Nigeria, and South America. China accounted for a large majority of this growth, and this is not entirely surprising given the tight restrictions that are placed on foreign exchange in the Chinese Yuan. If nothing else, this highlights an inherent need for cryptocurrencies around the world. Investments and Risks\nOf course, any time we are dealing with a market that is as new as Bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies there will be a certain amount of risk that is tied to its investment avenues. In the chart below, we can see some of the Bitcoin “crashes” that have already taken place during its short history.\nMake no mistake about it, these are some of the biggest declines in the history of the financial markets (when viewed in absolute terms). These declines represent significant drawdown for those heavily invested, and each of the “crashes” seen during Bitcoin’s history have erased colossal amount of investment capital for those bullish on the space.\nThis is why it is important to use conservative positioning tactics whenever there are new investments in the cryptocurrency space. In the chart above, we can see that drawdown can be significant in these assets. The biggest collapse was seen in 2011, where prior rallies were followed by losses of 93%. Any investor that was overleveraged or simply not positioned for this type of decline would have been forced to handle substantial losses. But this can be avoided with conservative positions in smaller trading sizes. Conclusion: The World of Cryptocurrency Is Just Beginning\nWhether a person is invested or not, it is difficult to argue with the idea that cryptocurrencies will likely have a long future ahead in the world of finance. Cryptocurrency has a wide range of applications and the ability to make global transactions without the need for exchanging fiat currencies. Rapid growth rates suggest that this is an exciting time for digital assets, and this should be the case for years to come. Submit a Comment Your email address will not be published.

The main purpose was for it to be used as a mode of making payments online, but after some years now it has turned out to be used for something much bigger than that. It can be used as an investment or savings. So if you ask me, I will tell you that bitcoin is very important to us cause it serves a lot of purpose.\nTo me i think that the main purpose of bitcoin is to use a single currency throughout the world, bitcoin is created as currency but currently it is not too much popular when it will become more popular then people will like to start using it as currency throughout the world.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T05:56:59.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a05094388323724ac361a8f36fb06595322c9709", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUgcfw28le1J1oCjNa.ALUs-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Bitcoin and retirement - how do you see your future?", "title_full": "Bitcoin and retirement - how do you see your future?", "published": "2018-06-07T17:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a05094388323724ac361a8f36fb06595322c9709", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUgcfw28le1J1oCjNa.ALUs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kiweikoo", "published": "2018-06-07T17:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin and retirement - how do you see your future?", "text": "Quote: from: Skieleton on May 25, 2018, 09:05:35 PM I came across a very nice experiment of one of my compatriots. He started to put up around $ 50 a month for pension. I will add that pensions in my country are low.\nDescription of the experiment:\n\"What is going on?\nOne of my many areas of interest are cryptocurrencies. There is a good chance that you have heard about bitcoin. A smaller chance that you know litecoin or dogecoin. If you want to know the technical side or economic cryptocurrency - use google. For the needs of my retirement, it is enough to know that cryptocurrencies act as cash in a modern version. They have their value (they are listed on the stock exchanges, they have their course), they can be safely stored, they can be sent immediately to any distance, practically free of charge and - with a little effort - they are anonymous. And they are today at the initial stage of development. Everyone who touches them is still an early employer, and this means that - with a high probability - a long-term investment in cryptocurrencies will be very profitable. I chose 4 cryptocurrencies for my retirement basket and gave them percentages indicating their presence in the basket. When making my choice, I based my own - already several years - experience in the cryptocurrency industry, the capitalization value of a given cryptocurrency (market cap) and the features that distinguish it from other coins on the market. And so I chose:\nHow much do I put aside? I did not want to set any fixed amount. Because you know - inflation, fluctuations in financial markets, etc. ... So I decided that the value of a monthly investment will depend on the minimum wage in Poland. In 2017, it is an amount of $ 540. And every month I invest 10% of this amount, that is 50 $. \"\nHe has currently invested $ 1,600, and the rate of return since early 2017 is 1,600% = $ 27k.\nIt's a great idea, right?\nI wont really try putting my life savings into Bitcoin, no way! Its a very big risk for anyone that does such a thing and I cant risk it. I know a friend of mine that did that and ended losing more than 50% of his money. Best thing is to divide the money and make use of about 20 or 30% for Bitcoin investment, save the next 30% while you make use of the remaining percentage to start up an offline business.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T10:11:00.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6152e2793cf0c3a0ba869665b26924ab4e53fa7f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOq.ziOvKaAK.RU2EevlfbpPDaBJsUrj_.w_whZFs5FMdgOimVWKgU8k_Pb1WEGErF0-", "site_full": "siteownersforums.com", "site": "siteownersforums.com", "site_section": "http://siteownersforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=18", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Making money on the web - Site Owners Forums - Webmaster Forums", "title": "Breaking ReCaptcha2 helps to earn BITCOINS", "title_full": "Breaking ReCaptcha2 helps to earn BITCOINS - Site Owners Forums - Webmaster Forums", "published": "2018-06-07T17:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 26408, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6152e2793cf0c3a0ba869665b26924ab4e53fa7f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOq.ziOvKaAK.RU2EevlfbpPDaBJsUrj_.w_whZFs5FMdgOimVWKgU8k_Pb1WEGErF0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "HelenShuth", "published": "2018-06-07T17:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Breaking ReCaptcha2 helps to earn BITCOINS", "text": "XEvil 4.0 : NEW innovative soft for SEO/SMM\nhttp://xrumersale.site/img/botmasterlabs_xevil3_en.png\n1.

Kagin said, “I love pushing the envelope by offering better ways to acquire numismatic properties and educate potential collectors to our fascinating field.”\nHe has a record of firsts in his life, including earning the first Ph.D. degree to be awarded in the United States in numismatics.\nThis followed his Bachelor of Arts degree in the same field.\nMore recently Kagin has held design competitions to make the covers of his auction catalogs works of art.\nKagin’s Auctions next sale will be held in Santa Clara Sept. 21.\nHe has started a numismatic loyalty program and offers material on Amazon.\nIt will be interesting to see what percentage of the auction lots will be paid for in Bitcoin in September.\nWill it be a significant number?\nWe cannot know the answer today, but with his background in Pioneer and Territorial gold pieces, Kagin is well placed to recognize that a medium of exchange isn’t always necessarily a governent issue.\nBitcoin’s future will be determined by how many individuals and firms undertake to use it.\nIt has no physical form. Bitcoin is simply a digital entry on a computer blockchain ledger that records transactions.\nWikipedia notes that in 2017 there were an estimated 2.9 million to 5.8 million users of Bitcoin.\nWhere that number goes from here is a topic of great interest.\nReported fluctuations of Bitcoin’s value has generated many headlines in recent months.\nOn. Nov. 20 I wrote a blog about Bitcoin reaching a value of $ 8,000.\nSince then it rose to roughly $ 20,000 in December and has dropped to this morning’s $ 7,710, as reported on the Kitco website.\nWhether Bitcoin can be turned into a reliable method of payment from its current status as a speculator’s darling remains to be seen.\nKagin is in a good position to evaluate the future.\nHe knows that Pioneer and Territorial gold issues were soon supplanted by government money.\nThis process can happen again with Bitcoin.\nBut in the meantime, just like those gold issues of old, Bitcoin can be used as payment.\nBuzz blogger Dave Harper won the Numismatic Literary Guild Award for Best Blog for the third time in 2017 .

Sponsored Links Market visualization from Coin360\nBitcoin (BTC) is comfortably holding above the $7,600 threshold and inching to a new price point of $7,700, trading at around $7,690 at press time. The leading cryptocurrency, up almost 2.3 percent over a 24-hour period, saw an intra-weekly low just above $7,400, but has since stemmed its losses.\nYesterday’s official clarification from the chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that Bitcoin is categorically not considered to be a security under U.S. law may have gone some way to bolster market confidence.\nBitcoin’s regulatory status is evidently more clear-cut than major altcoins Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), both of whose representatives have emphatically rejected security classifications, although their regulatory status in the eyes of the SEC remains unclear. Bitcoin price chart from Cointelegraph’s Bitcoin Price Index Leading altcoin Ethereum (ETH) has seen a slightly lower gains of just over 1.3 percent on the day, trading around $606 to press time. Having recovered from its low of $571 earlier this week, the coin has for now reclaimed its ground above the psychological price point of $600. Ethereum price chart from Cointelegraph’s Ethereum Price Index Most of the top ten coins by market capitalization are showing minor fluctuations of within a 2-3 percent range over a 24-hour, as data from CoinMarketCap shows. Of the top ten coins, only Cardano (ADA) is in the red, down less than 1 percent, trading at about $0.21 to press time. Altcoin EOS is seeing the most growth of the top ten coins over the past 24 hours, up over 4.5 percent on the day, trading at $14.20 a coin at press time. EOS is currently ranked in fifth place on CoinMarketCap, with a market capitalization of over $12.7 bln. Yesterday, stock analytics firm Trefis announced they have lowered their Bitcoin year-end price forecast from $15,000 to $12,500, according to their analysis of fundamentals of supply and demand in BTC markets. Trefis pointed to significant recent losses in total BTC transaction volumes across crypto exchanges, and attributed a surplus in supply and subsequent drop in price to Mt. Gox dumping BTC onto exchanges earlier this spring. As of press time, CoinMarketCap data indicates BTC trade volumes of 4.69 bln, down from 7.41 bln one month ago. While markets remain sluggish, institutional actors are making significant headway with their foray into the crypto sphere. Yesterday, one of the largest financial firms in the world, Susquehanna International Group, revealed it would be opening cryptocurrency trading to its clients, initially in the form of Bitcoin futures. The week has also seen news of significant advances among major crypto industry players to bring their operations under the purview of financial regulators. Yesterday, peer-to-peer payments platform Circle Internet Financial Ltd., revealed it is pursuing both a federal banking license and registration as a brokerage and trading venue with the SEC. The news followed hot on the heels of leading U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase initiating its own process to become a fully SEC-regulated broker dealer, through its acquisition of three financial firms.\nOverall market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is $346 bln to press time, up about $10 bln on the week.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/", "https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/", "https://coinmarketcap.com/", "https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/eos/", "https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cointelegraph", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T23:07:38.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee2d797e0ba75953a84f369cb892144c5814f630", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYAL0cN0EkN2Y.3ZOZVLqFYkdbJlCs6jOLNfHygu5pYNRaoEbOrzRs.qrMYEhx6kCNGA7APjpCsiEGdEOgMRMPzQHiVTvFUdc-", "site_full": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://en-maktoob.news.yahoo.com/world/?format=rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo News UK & Ireland - Latest World News & UK News Headlines", "title": "Bitcoin price forecast to double as experts revise cryptocurrency predictions", "title_full": "Bitcoin price forecast to double as experts revise cryptocurrency predictions", "published": "2018-06-07T17:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Sgop68mQAjVGkGxoR96dhw--~B/aD01MTI7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/the_independent_577/2c4dd54ff4adda581973aebd1a99ef52", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ee2d797e0ba75953a84f369cb892144c5814f630", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRYAL0cN0EkN2Y.3ZOZVLqFYkdbJlCs6jOLNfHygu5pYNRaoEbOrzRs.qrMYEhx6kCNGA7APjpCsiEGdEOgMRMPzQHiVTvFUdc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-07T17:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin price forecast to double as experts revise cryptocurrency predictions", "text": "Bitcoin price forecast to double as experts revise cryptocurrency predictions Anthony Cuthbertson Reblog Bitcoin will double in value by the end of the year despite its recent price stagnation, according to several cryptocurrency experts. The last six months has seen bitcoin's price fall from more than $19,000 in December, to today's value of below $7,700. The falling price has been attributed to uncertain regulation, as well as the seizure of bitcoins in different legal cases, such as MtGox , which were then sold on exchanges. While the cryptocurrency markets continue to settle, the short-term forecast is expected to remain relatively stagnant. \"I believe bitcoin's price will continue to fluctuate between $6,500 and $8,500 in the coming weeks,\" David Hanson, a blockchain expert and CEO of the gaming platform Ultra, told The Independent . \"In the medium-to-long term, bitcoin's value should go up, as big institutions enter the crypto space in a bid to gain first-mover advantage, further legitimising the market.\" This view that major institutions will provide a boost to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is shared by other figures in the space, who believe bitcoin will finally break back above $10,000 in the coming months. \"As the regulatory landscape clears up we can expect far more investors, including big ticket institutions, to make their first cryptocurrency investments,\" Iqbal Gandham, the UK managing director of the investment platform eToro, told The Independent . \"For the first few months of this year, the crypto industry has been jogging along at a relatively slow pace, waiting for the opportunity to stretch into a sprint. This may just be that moment.\" Price support for Bitcoin is getting really strong🌟 — Marius \"not giving away ETH\"🏄‍♂️ (@LandM_Marius) 7 June 2018 Bitcoin price predictions were very positive at the beginning of the year, buoyed by the price explosion at the end of 2017. Celebrated investor Tim Draper said bitcoin could hit $250,000 by 2022, while self-described \"bitcoin evangelist\" Alistair Milne said he believed bitcoin would reach between $35,000 and $60,000 by the end of next year. In January, a panel of cryptocurrency experts compiled by price comparison site Finder forecast that bitcoin would hit $33,000 by the end of this year. A new prediction released this week revised that figure to less than half that initial outlook at just $14,638. Despite being more modest, if it is realised it would still represent almost a 100 per cent gain on bitcoin's current price. Of all the other major cryptocurrencies, The Cryptocurrency Predictions Survey placed EOS as the digital currency with the most potential, with price gains of more than 200 per cent forecast by the end of the year. This positive outlook is one shared by blockchain expert David Hanson, who said EOS could attract the most interest from investors in the second half of 2018. Mr Hanson said: \"Looking at cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin, EOS is gaining a lot of attention lately as it's unique and the scale at which it handles its ecosystem has never been seen before, so it would be worth keeping an eye on.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/LandM_Marius/status/1004590633414094848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-price-crash-predicted-mt-gox-exchange-latest-a8324026.html", "https://www.finder.com/uk/cryptocurrency-predictions", "https://www.finder.com/uk/cryptocurrency-predictions&quot;", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-price-live-updates-latest-cryptocurrency-value-ethereum-ripple-usd-exchange-trading-invest-a8301651.html&quot;", "https://www.independent.co.uk/cryptocurrency&quot;", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-price-live-updates-latest-cryptocurrency-value-ethereum-ripple-usd-exchange-trading-invest-a8301651.html", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-trend-forecast-cryptocurrency-expert-value-ethereum-ripple-btc-cash-a8319541.html&quot;", "https://www.independent.co.uk/cryptocurrency", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-price-crash-predicted-mt-gox-exchange-latest-a8324026.html&quot;", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-trend-forecast-cryptocurrency-expert-value-ethereum-ripple-btc-cash-a8319541.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anthony cuthbertson th", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ultra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david hanson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T17:46:44.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1831f8d3ae6dcd54296f3bf92b681896f273cb76", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSfiF_XycCS.x3OvoWGLNPuEqcLTv7N5SDIHyvxF4fjDF2N1O9zrcFs0xmjwUztWpc8j2VHjaLtqythWFRav8FhDCxEjdcX6iljDKnSQZF76.eQd05fKBkooyOhz8av4AYyKHe7kZupr.rhROaqdc.RD27wjUvWkcTLdmOREMPuzg--", "site_full": "www.independent.co.uk", "site": "independent.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.independent.co.uk/rss", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "The Independent", "title": "Bitcoin price forecast to double as experts revise cryptocurrency predictions", "title_full": "Bitcoin price forecast to double as experts revise cryptocurrency predictions", "published": "2018-06-07T17:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/07/12/gettyimages-914861056.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 568, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1831f8d3ae6dcd54296f3bf92b681896f273cb76", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSfiF_XycCS.x3OvoWGLNPuEqcLTv7N5SDIHyvxF4fjDF2N1O9zrcFs0xmjwUztWpc8j2VHjaLtqythWFRav8FhDCxEjdcX6iljDKnSQZF76.eQd05fKBkooyOhz8av4AYyKHe7kZupr.rhROaqdc.RD27wjUvWkcTLdmOREMPuzg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anthony Cuthbertson", "published": "2018-06-07T17:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin price forecast to double as experts revise cryptocurrency predictions", "text": "Bitcoin price forecast to double as experts revise cryptocurrency predictions Bitcoin price forecast to double as experts revise cryptocurrency predictions\n'This might just be that moment' Popular Videos Click to followThe Independent Tech\nBitcoin will double in value by the end of the year despite its recent price stagnation, according to several cryptocurrency experts.\nThe last six months has seen bitcoin's price fall from more than $19,000 in December, to today's value of below $7,700.\nThe falling price has been attributed to uncertain regulation, as well as the seizure of bitcoins in different legal cases, such as MtGox , which were then sold on exchanges.\nWhile the cryptocurrency markets continue to settle, the short-term forecast is expected to remain relatively stagnant.\n\"I believe bitcoin's price will continue to fluctuate between $6,500 and $8,500 in the coming weeks,\" David Hanson, a blockchain expert and CEO of the gaming platform Ultra, told The Independent .\n\"In the medium-to-long term, bitcoin's value should go up, as big institutions enter the crypto space in a bid to gain first-mover advantage, further legitimising the market.\" Bitcoin's volatile history in pictures + show all Bitcoin's volatile history in pictures 1/8 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009 On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

A new prediction released this week revised that figure to less than half that initial outlook at just $14,638.\nDespite being more modest, if it is realised it would still represent almost a 100 per cent gain on bitcoin's current price.\nOf all the other major cryptocurrencies, The Cryptocurrency Predictions Survey placed EOS as the digital currency with the most potential, with price gains of more than 200 per cent forecast by the end of the year.\nThis positive outlook is one shared by blockchain expert David Hanson, who said EOS could attract the most interest from investors in the second half of 2018.\nMr Hanson said: \"Looking at cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin, EOS is gaining a lot of attention lately as it's unique and the scale at which it handles its ecosystem has never been seen before, so it would be worth keeping an eye on.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=6522&id=201309&p=https://www.finder.com/uk/cryptocurrency-predictions"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ultra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david hanson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T17:49:04.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "084730e2e528f4c72d227e54a85eaafa98b96326", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYZG7J_puPbWUCb5Dl8nDtc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "This guy has lost 103 Bitcoins", "title_full": "This guy has lost 103 Bitcoins", "published": "2018-06-07T17:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.09, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "084730e2e528f4c72d227e54a85eaafa98b96326", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYZG7J_puPbWUCb5Dl8nDtc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "aces777", "published": "2018-06-07T17:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "This guy has lost 103 Bitcoins", "text": "Even if he had access to that wallet file he would have sold a long time ago as not many people have that much patience to hodl those coins for so long.

Kagin said, “I love pushing the envelope by offering better ways to acquire numismatic properties and educate potential collectors to our fascinating field.”\nHe has a record of firsts in his life, including earning the first Ph.D. degree to be awarded in the United States in numismatics.\nThis followed his Bachelor of Arts degree in the same field.\nMore recently, Kagin has held design competitions to make the covers of his auction catalogs works of art.\nKagin’s Auctions next sale will be held in Santa Clara Sept. 21.\nHe has started a numismatic loyalty program and offers material on Amazon.\nIt will be interesting to see what percentage of the auction lots will be paid for in Bitcoin in September.\nWill it be a significant number?\nWe cannot know the answer today, but with his background in Pioneer and Territorial gold pieces, Kagin is well placed to recognize that a medium of exchange isn’t always necessarily a government issue.\nBitcoin’s future will be determined by how many individuals and firms undertake to use it.\nIt has no physical form. Bitcoin is simply a digital entry on a computer blockchain ledger that records transactions.\nWikipedia notes that in 2017 there were an estimated 2.9 million to 5.8 million users of Bitcoin.\nWhere that number goes from here is a topic of great interest.\nReported fluctuations of Bitcoin’s value has generated many headlines in recent months.\nOn. Nov. 20, I wrote a blog about Bitcoin reaching a value of $8,000.\nSince then, it rose to roughly $20,000 in December and has dropped to this morning’s $7,710, as reported on the Kitco website.\nWhether Bitcoin can be turned into a reliable method of payment from its current status as a speculator’s darling remains to be seen.\nKagin is in a good position to evaluate the future.\nHe knows that Pioneer and Territorial gold issues were soon supplanted by government money.\nThis process can happen again with Bitcoin.\nBut in the meantime, just like those gold issues of old, Bitcoin can be used as payment.\nBuzz blogger Dave Harper won the Numismatic Literary Guild Award for Best Blog for the third time in 2017 .

Many in the Bitcoin community mistakenly assumed or were led to believe that the Lightning Network (LN) would be a distributed peer-to-peer network. However, this is infeasible. In fact, even using a generous set of assumptions, we will prove it is mathematically impossible. 57 Bitcoin “Core” developers have signed their support to an official Capacity Increase Roadmap that advocates the Lightning Network as a “non-bandwidth scaling mechanism” that may provide “very high decentralization”. We disagree and will prove it does not. After reading and understanding the information here, we recommend you draw your own conclusions. What is the Lightning Network and How Does it Work?\nLightning Network (LN) is a protocol allowing for a series of off-chain bidirectional payment channels .\n“Bidirectional” simply means two directions, so Alice and Bob could open up a private channel and send bitcoins back and forth (outside of the blockchain)\nIn order to open the channel, one or both parties have to deposit bitcoins into a Special Bitcoin Address . After that, they can do as many transactions as they want inside the channel, until either of them decide to close it, which settles (pays out the appropriate final balances) on the main Bitcoin blockchain.\nGoing one step farther, if Alice had a channel with Bob, and Bob also had a channel with Carol, then Alice could indirectly send money to Carol: Bob would first pay Carol, and then Alice would reimburse Bob. The Mirage Network LN evangelists promote the idea that if Alice can pay Carol through Bob, we should be able to keep extending this idea to build an entire network of payment channels, thus allowing a large percentage of transactions to occur off-chain. However, this cannot be realistically accomplished as a peer-to-peer network, at least not one of any significant size. “Decentralized” Vs “Distributed Centralization” In everyday talk about Bitcoin, most people say “decentralized” to mean what is technically a “distributed topology”. Conversely, a network with centralized hubs can technically be called “decentralized” if it doesn’t have a singular center. But let’s not get caught up in word games. The diagram below should clear things up: Lighting Network Cannot Scale\nIt starts off like a basic math problem. We’re going to assume the goal is to scale to one million users.\nLet’s think about this: If you have a tree with 10 branches, and each of those branches has 10 leaves, you can reach 100 leaves.\nAnd if you have a tree with 10 branches, and each has 10 sub-branches, and each of those in turn has 10 sub-branches , etc… you can go 6 levels “deep” and get: 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10, or simply: 10⁶, which equals one million. Since you have to hop from branch to branch 6 times to reach the leaf, we can say we have “6 hops”. So that’s 10 branches with 6 hops, or in our case: 10 channels with 6 hops. So, what’s the challenge? Your Money Can’t Be In Two Places At the Same Time\nKnown Lighting Network Issues Peer failures: If one of the peers is unresponsive, users might have to wait for hours to close a payment channel and resend the funds via an alternative route No Offline Payments: Users can’t pay someone who is not online Not ideal for large payments: Even though a route via various payment channels might exist, the funds in the peers multi-sig wallets might not be sufficient to transfer large funds Centralization: The Lightning Network might encourages centralization in payment hubs (similar to miner centralization) Easy too lose your Bitcoins into a central hub. As the network reaches a million users, it seems there will be no realistic way to avoid these problems. Dividing funds into many channels and continually loaning out money both make the network unusable. The only conceivable visions are either A) everyone deposits MUCH much more than they need to transact with, or B) the system depends on large centralized hubs. Neither is a decentralized scaling solution, or even a major part of one.\nRemember, Bitcoin must be decentralized. Be wary of the rationalization of “Centralization is ok as long as the base layer is kept decentralized.” That is an insidious trap which allows forcing users off the base layer and into the centralized systems. We must never allow that.\nSo, is Bitcoin in trouble because second layer solutions may not work? No, not at all. Bitcoin was designed to scale on-chain with simple blocksize increases.

Since coins like ZenCash and Verge had become targets of these attacks, it is evident that just any digital asset can be exposed to the factors of vulnerability and become the victim of an attack. That is how the team behind Bitcoin Gold decided that the best way to prevent this from happening to BTG is to have a new hard fork.\nBitcoin Gold: Creating a Hard Fork to Prevent 51% Attack\n51% attacks have been the subject of many speculations for the past several weeks as cryptos like Verge and ZenCash got exposed to the attack while having both users and the network jeopardized that way.\n51% attack is a strategic hacker attack initiated by a group of people or an individual that owns certain knowledge in cryptocurrencies, blockchain and encrypting. If it is presumed that the 50% of the network makes a spinning wheel of this mechanism out of miners and their performance, then we can also deduct that these miners are responsible for having the transactions within the given platforms validated and processed.\nWhen a hacker is able to fool the system into validating faulty transactions without the need for the miners, then we can say that the hacker or a group of hackers have taken over the mentioned 51% of the network’s power.\nThat is how the hackers become in charge of the network, being able to manipulate with nodes, transactions and the system.\nIn order to prevent the worst case scenario from happening to Bitcoin Gold, the BTG team has decided to have another fork, which is set to solve this problem, as the team claims.\nBitcoin Gold Waiting for a New Fork\nAlthough it has been officially confirmed several days ago that Bitcoin Gold is going to get another fork, considering the fact that Bitcoin Gold makes up for a fork as well, it is yet not certain when the fork will take place.\nThe team has only added that the fork should take place in the following weeks, which means that we might expect the planned fork to happen somewhere at the end of June and the beginning of July.\nThe team has also stated that the further information that will contain all details about the fork will be shared with the public in accordance with the date of realizing the new fork.\nWhat is confirmed for now is that this fork won’t produce another coin, which means that Bitcoin Gold will get to stay BTG. This is great for BTG because there won’t be any holders leaving the project in order to embrace the next one, which would also consequently affect its price in the market.\nThe hard fork has the purpose of updating the security protocols in order to prevent the mentioned attacks that have become a thing of a realistic scenario as of the most recent events. However, Bitcoin Gold will be getting a new fork also in a portion due to ASIC miners, which has become a problem in the world of mining as it poses a question about the fairness among miners as well as increased competitiveness.\nThe team has stated that they were focused on improving the current Proof-of-Work protocol, which is the algorithm they have been using by far.\nThe goal is to move the existing algorithm for mining to a new version of Equihash, which is currently named Equihash-BTG.

Tax Bitcoin, home offices, work deductions and property investors in the ATO’s ‘tax gap’ firing line Frank Chung, news.com.au June 8, 2018 9:05am\nHOME offices, work uniforms, Airbnb hosts and bitcoin investors are set to go under the microscope this year as the Australian Taxation Office attempts to close the “tax gap” and crack down on dodgy claims.\nWith the end of the financial year fast approaching, taxpayers are being warned there’s nowhere to hide from the sophisticated data matching capabilities of the ATO, which is apparently a little bit upset with us.\n“The ATO have been doing some work around what they call the ‘tax gap’ for individuals, which is basically the difference between what taxes people are paying and what the ATO believes they should be paying,” said H&R Block director of tax communications Mark Chapman.\n“What they’ve done is do a series of random audits on taxpayers. Rather than targeting taxpayers they think have issues, it’s like a lottery, taking random taxpayers and auditing them. From that they’ve been able to work out what the gap is, and then extrapolate that over the whole taxpayer population.”\nMr Chapman said the ATO, which hasn’t released the exact numbers yet, placed a “fair bit of blame” for the size of the tax gap on the work-related expenses area. Last month’s Federal Budget handed the ATO extra cash specifically to deal with the issue.\n“The ATO have flagged work-related expense claims, specifically they’ve highlighted some of the flat-rate deductions that people can claim under the work-related expenses rules,” he said.\n“So for instance the 66-cents-per-km vehicle use which you can claim up to 5000km, the ATO are concerned people are claiming that as a standard amount irrespective of whether or not they travelled the 5000km.\n“[Similarly] the $150 people can claim on laundry expenses, and the $300 people can claim without any substantiation if that’s all they’re claiming. The ATO are concerned people are claiming that almost as a standard deduction, which it’s not.”\nAustralians claim about $22 billion in work-related expenses annually, and ATO commissioner Chris Jordan last year said a “startlingly” large number of people were effectively gaming the system.\nAbout 6.3 million people made claims against clothing expenses in 2014-15 totalling almost $1.8 billion, which would mean “almost half of the individual taxpayer population was required to wear a uniform or protective clothing or had some special requirements for things like sunglasses and hat”.\nmedia_camera Don’t try any holiday home funny business.\nThe ATO has previously warned that there was no such thing as a “standard” deduction. In the same year, more than three million people made work-related car expense claims totalling $8.5 billion, a “significant proportion” of which were “right at the limit that does not require detailed records”.\nMr Chapman said the “other deductions” category — covering things like home office usage, union fees and mobile phone costs — was also a big concern for the ATO. Taxpayers should expect greater scrutiny on what proportion they claim for work versus private use.\nAlso in the firing line this year will be property investors incorrectly claiming deductions, such as people with holiday homes claiming for times they actually use the home themselves, or letting the home out to family or friends at a reduced rate but claiming the full amount.\n“There are also some instances where the ATO believes the properties are not genuinely available for rent in the first place but they’re still claiming deductions,” he said. “They might have all sorts of restrictions or terms and conditions on renting the property which would make the renter say no.”\nAnother popular rort is when spouses who jointly own a property split the rental income in a way that’s not 50-50, funnelling the higher deductions to the spouse who earns more to maximise the benefit.\n“You can’t do that,” Mr Chapman said. “If it’s two spouses it’s 50-50, unless you’ve got some really compelling evidence to the contrary, and that’s rare.”\nUber drivers, Airbnb hosts, Airtasker taskers and other people who earn money in the sharing economy should also watch out. The banks and even the platforms themselves now hand over your information directly to the ATO, meaning the discrepancy will automatically be picked up.\n“The computers see it as a mismatch, that there was some income which wasn’t declared,” Mr Chapman said. “They don’t typically do a full audit, but they’ll send you a letter asking if you want to amend your return.”\nFinally, investors who first got into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies towards the end of last year could be in for a rude shock. “The ATO is really looking at that as a big risk area, because it’s new and people don’t understand the tax implications,” he said.\n“Probably the most common scenario is people will have capital gains tax implications through buying cryptocurrency and then selling. That could produce a very large profit or very large loss depending on when they did.”\nmedia_camera Bitcoin investors may be in for a shock. Picture: Nhac Nguyen/AFP\nLiz Russell, senior tax agent with Etax.com.au, said while cryptocurrencies were often touted as an anonymous payment system that can’t be tracked by banks or governments, the ATO’s data matching kicked in as soon as they were converted to fiat currency.\n“It’s important to know how the ATO classifies cryptocurrency, as this determines how it’s treated for taxation purposes,” she said.\n“There is a long-running debate over what cryptocurrency actually is — whether it’s an asset, currency or collectable — but the ATO has made it clear that it treats cryptocurrency as an asset. That means it’s subject to the same capital gains tax provisions that apply to real estate and shares.”\nCapital gains tax provisions are triggered when you sell cryptocurrency, in whole or in part. “Let’s say you originally bought $5000 worth of XEM, which is one of the lesser-known coins consistently in the top 10 of cryptocurrency market caps,” Ms Russell said.\n“If you later traded it for fiat currency of $8500, then the $3500 in profit is considered a capital gain, and you’ll need to add it to your assessable income for the financial year — much like you would any gains you make the sale of shares or an investment property.”\nOn the other hand, if you sold your cryptocurrency at a loss — which is more likely given the market crash since its December peak — then you can deduct that amount from capital gains you made from another asset.\n“For example if you made a $3000 loss on the sale of cryptocurrency but a $4000 gain on the sale of shares, your net capital gain would be the $4000 gain minus the $3000 loss, equalling a $1000 capital gain,” she said.\nOne exception is when you use cryptocurrency to purchase items for personal use — such as in the ‘digital currency-friendly’ Queensland tourist town of Agnes Water, where visitors can use cryptocurrency at restaurants, cafes and other stores.\n“For these sorts of transactions, no CGT is payable when disposing of cryptocurrency,” Ms Russell said.\nFor businesses who receive cryptocurrency for goods and services, you must include the value of the cryptocurrency in Australian dollars as part of your ordinary income, the same as receiving any other non-cash payment under a barter transaction.\n“One way of determining the value in Australian dollars is the fair market value which can be obtained from a reputable cryptocurrency exchange,”\n“Where you purchase business items using cryptocurrency, including trading stock, you are entitled to a deduction based on the arm’s length value of the item acquired.”\nfrank.chung@news.com.au\nShould we get rid of tax deductions? 1:12 The ATO have seen it all, and Aussie’s are claiming $21 billion in work related expenses per year.

SolidX will act as the sponsor of the ETF and VanEck will provide marketing services.\nThe two firms will work jointly with regulators. VanEck was the first to file for a bitcoin ETF registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 in August 2017, while SolidX in March 2016 was among the first to file under the Securities Act of 1933 for a physically-backed bitcoin ETF that would reflect the performance of the price of bitcoin. “I believe that bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of ‘digital gold’ that may make sense for investors’ portfolios,” says Jan van Eck, Chief Executive Officer of VanEck. “The SolidX team has in-depth experience with bitcoin, cryptography, and capital markets. We’re pleased to join with them in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market. “We believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process. A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin. “It is important to communicate with investors about the risks as well as the opportunities, especially for new investment areas, and we have been committed to this effort.” VanEck has a history of supporting innovative investment products, from the first gold-focused mutual fund and gold miners ETF, to more recent strategies, including emerging markets debt as well as a series of guided allocation approaches. VanEck has also, through its MVIS subsidiary, created several comprehensive digital asset indices designed to provide a measurement of both individual digital assets and various baskets of digital asset exposures. The SolidX team has been involved with the bitcoin ecosystem since 2011 and was one of the first sponsors to file a registration statement for a bitcoin-based ETF. SolidX has been working on bringing a bitcoin ETF to market since 2015. “In determining a marketing partner, we looked for a firm with a clear understanding of the potential of bitcoin and the role it can play in an investment portfolio,” says Daniel H Gallancy, Chief Executive Officer of SolidX. “VanEck is deeply involved in this space, understands its potential, and has a long track record of successfully opening new avenues for investors to access unique and compelling investment opportunities.

Here’s why…\nRon Paul interviewed by Dan Dicks on Press For Truth\nThe crash of the dollar is not a matter of if…but when! The modus operandi for the inner cabal of the global elite is and always has been to provide order out of chaos…sometimes the chaos happen organically and sometimes it has to be created. Money has always been used as their greatest mechanism for control ever since the introduction of usury in the ancient world.\nBut here in the 21st century what’s Donald Trump’s roll in all of this? Is he being set up top take the fall or is he working with the deep state to ensure that that the crash of the dollar happens? In this video Dan Dicks of Press For Truth speaks with Dr. Ron Paul of The Liberty Report to get his views on the coming dollar crash, the idea of a cashless society, cryptocurrencies as a potential hedge and whether or not Donald Trump is a tool of the deep state.

The more bitcoin is mined and energy is consumed, the environment takes a hit. June 7, 2018 Jessica Messier Leave a Comment\nAccording to The Outline , bitcoin is hanging a black cloud over the environment – almost literally. As a result, decision makers whose company is currently investing in or planning on investing in bitcoin, but want strive for a cleaner environment, might want to reconsider.\nThe bitcoin network consumes roughly 2.55 gigawatts of power annually, which is “nearly the same amount of energy consumed by the entirety of Ireland,” The Outline says. Alex de Vries, a financial economist and blockchain specialist, predicts that by December of this year, “the bitcoin network could be using almost triple that.”\nOne of the reasons why bitcoin is harmful to the environment is because it requires energy to “mine;” mining consists of a computer running calculations, The Outline says. “The longer Bitcoin is around, the more energy it takes to mine each subsequent unit (it takes four times as much energy to mine a single bitcoin now as it did when the currency launched in 2009).” On top of that, any transaction involving bitcoin needs electricity – the amount of electricity that could power a home for a week – which pumps carbon into the atmosphere. The Outline also notes that the interest in bitcoin doesn’t appear to be taking a breather any time soon, either, as well as interest in other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Ripple.\nHowever, there might a silver lining to bitcoin’s adverse effect on the environment. The Outline says that it’s likely that bitcoin will stop growing so rapidly and may even decline in the future. The longer bitcoin lives, the greater the possibility is of developing new mining algorithms – ones that don’t use as much energy. In the meantime, experts like de Vries are trying to increase awareness about bitcoin, and how more information about it is needed before next steps can be taken to preserving the environment: “‘We’ve seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed,’ said de Vries in a press release. ‘Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall…’”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://theoutline.com/post/4561/bitcoin-is-consuming-as-much-energy-as-the-country-of-ireland?zd=2&zi=r7vjiiog"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jessica messier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T04:27:59.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bd8f1f3cb8938df9446df99936e7f733e0819656", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQmLHTSs4pxUTm95.yHM3Ww-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Good times with bitcoin", "title_full": "Good times with bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-07T16:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bd8f1f3cb8938df9446df99936e7f733e0819656", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQmLHTSs4pxUTm95.yHM3Ww-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Saiful Islam777", "published": "2018-06-07T16:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Good times with bitcoin", "text": "I think that Bitcoin is going well now.

Digital Trading Push\nAs per a report on Business Insider , the company’s graphical user interface has been well-received by clients, allowing them to trade with others in a wholly electronic system that also leaves convenient audit trails.\nThe report observed that while cryptocurrencies are a groundbreaking financial innovation and extremely forward-thinking in their concept, the way the asset trades is akin to historic trading methods.\nFor example, institutional traders place million dollar digital currency trades via phone calls or video conferences, instead of using more advanced techniques. Reportedly, companies such as Cumberland , DRW’s cryptocurrency arm, even conduct bitcoin trading via Skype. Large Trades not a Novelty\nIn stark contrast, Jump Trading’s electronic platform allows users to execute and place large cryptocurrency trades directly with counterparties. Additionally, the desktop interface ensures that external trading exchanges have no intervention in the trade.\nThe investment house is famous for its High Frequency Trading ( HFT ), which utilizes advanced quant algorithms to perform thousands of trades per second in the traditional markets. In addition, the company claims to be developing a “lower frequency trading strategy,” but has not released any public information on the latter. Industry observers believe that Jump is serious about its cryptocurrency ventures, besides propagating the fact that voice-based platforms are not the best bet for place trades. Such techniques can easily be tapped and lead to the compromise of sensitive information. Advertisement ( Source : Glassdoor ) Cryptocurrency Market Much like FX\nJohn Spallanzani, a former FX trader at Sumitomo Mitsui , believes that the cryptocurrency market is maturing similarly to the multi-trillion dollar foreign-exchange market. In the latter’s salad days, the market conducted trades exclusively over the phone, adding that his company “used to call 20 banks at once for spot FX prices in the 1990s.” The cryptocurrency industry has experienced the rise of many OTC desks in recent times. Popular cryptocurrency exchange Kraken set up an OTC desk in 2017 in New York, while Coinbase launched block trading in May 2018.\nMore to this point, several cryptocurrency-focused investment funds are also opening up at breakneck speed. As per research , over 61 such funds have launched in 2018 alone, with the global total at 366. However, the crypto-specific hedge funds only handle $5 billion: a drop in the financial ocean for traditional hedge funds with trillions of dollars under management.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.jumptrading.com/", "http://www.smbc.co.jp/global/", "http://www.businessinsider.com/a-secretive-chicago-trading-firm-has-built-a-bitcoin-platform-that-shows-crypto-is-shaking-off-its-scrappy-roots-2018-6?IR=T&_ga=2.79780119.1097347866.1528265431-2061292902.1505137301", "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/high-frequency-trading.asp", "https://cumberlandmining.com/", "https://www.glassdoor.com/Photos/Jump-Trading-Office-Photos-IMG952814.htm", "https://www.kraken.com/", "https://drw.com/", "https://bitcoin.org/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "digital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skype", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drw", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cumberland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T20:51:38.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a7ff697cd0f6d9c17444665e33846d79e708744c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdYq3foCj9LN2ZE4yyCi6VM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Is Bitcoin ethical?", "title_full": "Is Bitcoin ethical?", "published": "2018-06-07T16:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a7ff697cd0f6d9c17444665e33846d79e708744c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdYq3foCj9LN2ZE4yyCi6VM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Thefrolly", "published": "2018-06-07T16:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is Bitcoin ethical?", "text": "When you withdraw cash from banks or ATMs it could have been deposited by terrorists or criminals, now do you go looking for its source?

While Bitmain has few direct comparables, applying a multiple similar to that of publicly traded chipmakers such as Nvidia Corp. and MediaTek Inc. would give the company a valuation of about $8.8 billion. That would make the co-founders’ holdings worth a combined $5.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nWu has previously stated Bitmain is worth $12 billion.\nAn IPO would not only open Bitmain’s books to the world, it would also allow the stock market to assign the company a value in real time. While Wu said he has no specific plans at the moment, he’s open to a listing in Hong Kong -- or in an overseas market with U.S. dollar-denominated shares -- because it would give early investors including Sequoia Capital and IDG Capital a chance to cash out.\nA public share sale would be a landmark event for both Bitmain and the broader crypto industry, which is slowly emerging from the shadows. Miners, developers and venture capitalists are opting for more transparency as they try to placate wary regulators and prove that last year’s boom in digital assets was more than just a flash in the pan.\n- Aaron Goldstein, Gambling911.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-07/crypto-s-32-year-old-billionaire-mining-king-is-mulling-an-ipo"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "micree zhan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jihan wu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nvidia corp.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg billionaires index", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ipo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "technologies ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mediatek inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T21:52:45.035+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "262fe990f8a49a48d0e18c00ee3e84a7d8ef7d0f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisVvFENVBPCHWD9Bim2xK50vlEd5y.zDWYTS3F8R9tpKQ2czHG.Rnww7ZixLfEdt_og3NBYwJouKc_6F8SkRFbrfjihteb3Iy5M9o578Iki47fMiX3Qypvtnf6YMwy0euJQ3y3rc.0tKfZFW_w8bUvVrr7zMwm2IvaC3RFoyl1z2IcOV6m9Iq1r5grVgTXwN19w--", "site_full": "www.forexcrunch.com", "site": "forexcrunch.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/ForexCrunch", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Forex Crunch", "title": "Bitcoin Technical Analysis: BTC/USD bulls are not far away from re-testing $8000, given the gradual breakdown of touted sell zone", "title_full": "Bitcoin Technical Analysis: BTC/USD bulls are not far away from re-testing $8000, given the gradual breakdown of touted sell zone", "published": "2018-06-07T16:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forexcrunch-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/BTCUSD252072520JUNE2520602520MINUTE-636639754148090036.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 70067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "262fe990f8a49a48d0e18c00ee3e84a7d8ef7d0f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisVvFENVBPCHWD9Bim2xK50vlEd5y.zDWYTS3F8R9tpKQ2czHG.Rnww7ZixLfEdt_og3NBYwJouKc_6F8SkRFbrfjihteb3Iy5M9o578Iki47fMiX3Qypvtnf6YMwy0euJQ3y3rc.0tKfZFW_w8bUvVrr7zMwm2IvaC3RFoyl1z2IcOV6m9Iq1r5grVgTXwN19w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FX Street", "published": "2018-06-07T16:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Technical Analysis: BTC/USD bulls are not far away from re-testing $8000, given the gradual breakdown of touted sell zone", "text": "EU’s Barnier: Backstop must be workable to avoid hard border Disclaimer Foreign exchange (Forex) trading carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors.

It is a proposal that has been implemented in Bitcoin network and now it is in Beta Stage.\nIs the reason why Bitcoin network didn't had a 2MB or 4MB upgrade in order to scale and instead this proposal by 2 private companies Blockstream Inc. and Lighting Labs Inc. has been pushed hard into Bitcoin's code.\nThey said it was a solution for scalability without \"centralization\".\nUsing a network of these micropayment channels, Bitcoin can scale to billions of transactions per day\nBut it was all a lie, when in their own proposal centralization has it is own role.\nWhat it doesn't tell you is that this can only be accomplished by using large, centralized \"banking\" hubs. Many in the Bitcoin community mistakenly assumed or were led to believe that the Lightning Network (LN) would be a distributed peer-to-peer network.\nHowever, this is infeasible. In fact, even using a generous set of assumptions, we will prove it is mathematically impossible.\n57 Bitcoin \"Core\" developers have signed their support to an official Capacity Increase Roadmap that advocates the Lightning Network as a \"non-bandwidth scaling mechanism\" that may provide \"very high decentralization\".\nWe disagree and will prove it does not. After reading and understanding the information here, we recommend you draw your own conclusions.\nWhat is the Lightning Network and How Does it Work? Lightning Network (LN) is a protocol allowing for a series of off-chain bidirectional payment channels .\n\"Bidirectional\" simply means two directions, so Alice and Bob could open up a private channel and send bitcoins back and forth (outside of the blockchain)\nIn order to open the channel, one or both parties have to deposit bitcoins into a Special Bitcoin Address . After that, they can do as many transactions as they want inside the channel, until either of them decide to close it, which settles (pays out the appropriate final balances) on the main Bitcoin blockchain.\nGoing one step farther, if Alice had a channel with Bob, and Bob also had a channel with Carol, then Alice could indirectly send money to Carol: Bob would first pay Carol, and then Alice would reimburse Bob.\nThe Mirage Network LN evangelists promote the idea that if Alice can pay Carol through Bob, we should be able to keep extending this idea to build an entire network of payment channels, thus allowing a large percentage of transactions to occur off-chain.\nHowever, this cannot be realistically accomplished as a peer-to-peer network, at least not one of any significant size.\n\"Decentralized\" Vs \"Distributed Centralization\" In everyday talk about Bitcoin, most people say \"decentralized\" to mean what is technically a \"distributed topology\".\nConversely, a network with centralized hubs can technically be called \"decentralized\" if it doesn't have a singular center.\nBut let's not get caught up in word games. The diagram below should clear things up:\nLighting Network Cannot Scale It starts off like a basic math problem. We're going to assume the goal is to scale to one million users.\nLet's think about this: If you have a tree with 10 branches, and each of those branches has 10 leaves, you can reach 100 leaves.\nAnd if you have a tree with 10 branches, and each has 10 sub-branches, and each of those in turn has 10 sub-branches , etc… you can go 6 levels \"deep\" and get: 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10, or simply: 10⁶, which equals one million.\nSince you have to hop from branch to branch 6 times to reach the leaf, we can say we have \"6 hops\". So that's 10 branches with 6 hops, or in our case: 10 channels with 6 hops.\nSo, what's the challenge? Your Money Can't Be In Two Places At the Same Time\nKnown Lighting Network Issues\nPeer failures: If one of the peers is unresponsive, users might have to wait for hours to close a payment channel and resend the funds via an alternative route No Offline Payments: Users can't pay someone who is not online Not ideal for large payments: Even though a route via various payment channels might exist, the funds in the peers multi-sig wallets might not be sufficient to transfer large funds Centralization: The Lightning Network might encourages centralization in payment hubs (similar to miner centralization) Easy too lose your Bitcoins into a central hub. As the network reaches a million users, it seems there will be no realistic way to avoid these problems. Dividing funds into many channels and continually loaning out money both make the network unusable.\nThe only conceivable visions are either A) everyone deposits MUCH much more than they need to transact with, or B) the system depends on large centralized hubs.\nNeither is a decentralized scaling solution, or even a major part of one.\nRemember, Bitcoin must be decentralized. Be wary of the rationalization of \"Centralization is ok as long as the base layer is kept decentralized.\" That is an insidious trap which allows forcing users off the base layer and into the centralized systems. We must never allow that.\nSo, is Bitcoin in trouble because second layer solutions may not work? No, not at all. Bitcoin was designed to scale on-chain with simple blocksize increases. It can and will do so, if we allow it.\nThe post Bitcoin Lightning Network – A total failure by Lighting Labs & Blockstream appeared first on Crypto News 24/7 - Bitcoin News .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lighting labs & blockstream have", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin lightning network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lightning network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockstream inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lighting labs inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin lightning network", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T16:38:42.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e9203c2bb4b092418ef1d653397ea2eb8a855d94", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQwQWYGJcAGDuIXgyyoIQ30-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=212.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Micro Earnings", "title": "Moon Bitcoin Cash down?", "title_full": "Moon Bitcoin Cash down?", "published": "2018-06-07T16:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.053, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e9203c2bb4b092418ef1d653397ea2eb8a855d94", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQwQWYGJcAGDuIXgyyoIQ30-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin_collector", "published": "2018-06-07T16:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Moon Bitcoin Cash down?", "text": "same 503 error, anyway might as well let go bcash faucet...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T14:19:54.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2d8c0752231e036ae303f277b7d51660d0739ad1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.som0MHg.jsqSztq2SIkpOMY8fjq1m6LLiKOgW3emNP23niILbXzfvHZi8loj3Zc5uhDyg2_FTk3c", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "In the process of making a CBD site that only accepts Bitcoin, can I get some help/feedback?", "title_full": "In the process of making a CBD site that only accepts Bitcoin, can I get some help/feedback?", "published": "2018-06-07T16:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2d8c0752231e036ae303f277b7d51660d0739ad1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.som0MHg.jsqSztq2SIkpOMY8fjq1m6LLiKOgW3emNP23niILbXzfvHZi8loj3Zc5uhDyg2_FTk3c", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-07T16:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "In the process of making a CBD site that only accepts Bitcoin, can I get some help/feedback?", "text": "In the process of making a CBD site that only accepts Bitcoin, can I get some help/feedback?\n/u/CannaWurks\nI'm in the process of making an online cbd shop and I only want to accept Bitcoin as payment for now, mainly because I don't want to deal with payment processors.
