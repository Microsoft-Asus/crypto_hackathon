Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images for T.J. Maxx Barbara Corcoran recently made the point that bitcoin is perfectly suited to the real estate market. According to Corcoran, the attraction of bitcoin is the privacy it permits the buyer and seller, cutting out the middleman. However, she admits she will personally be refraining from investing in cryptocurrency due to its associated risks.\nThink buying and selling homes for bitcoins sounds like a fad? To Shark Tank's Barbara Corcoran, it sounds like the future.\n\"It makes great common sense,\" Corcoran said in a recent interview with MONEY. \"I'm being very optimistic because, as a long-term play, it's perfectly suited for real estate transactions.\"\nBitcoin's involvement in real estate is uncommon, but not unheard of. Properties have reportedly been sold for cryptocurrency from Texas to Manhattan, and there are currently 140 units for sale or rent on Zillow that mention Bitcoin in their listings. Corcoran, who sold the New York City real estate agency she founded for $66 million in 2001, says bitcoin home sales will only become more common in the future.\nWhy? \"It's peer-to-peer, with no central anything, and that's why it's so powerful,\" Corcoran says. Such transactions, she explains, allow buyers greater privacy. \"The main idea is to eliminate the middle guy.\" Advertisement\nIn fact, Corcoran predicts bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will eliminate the need for banks.\n\"I really don't expect banks to be around 10 years from now unless they change their model,\" Corcoran says. \"I don't see why it's going to be needed if bitcoin does what I believe it's going to do.\"\nNot everyone believes cryptocurrency will catch on in the long run. Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett called bitcoin \"probably rat poison squared,\" while Vanguard's Jack Bogle has warned investors to \"avoid bitcoin like the plague.\" And, while Corcoran is optimistic about cryptocurrency in real estate, she says the concept does face some challenges.\nFor one thing, in a peer-to-peer crypto-sale there's no insurance or appraisal, she says, which makes people uncomfortable. And then there's the cryptocurrency's notorious volatility. \"I could agree, this week, that that unit is worth $3 million,\" Corcoran says. \"If, by next Thursday, the bottom falls out and [the bitcoin] is worth $2 million, that $3 million agreement is useless.\"\nAnd there's one reason Corcoran says she's personally staying away from cryptocurrency. Advertisement\n\"I lose my credit cards at least once a week, I lose my cell phone once a month,\" Corcoran says, \"and I can't even imagine being like that guy in England , what did he lose, $127 million because he lost his private key code?\"\nStill, Corcoran believes cryptocurrency will survive these bumps in the road — and anyone who says otherwise is \"guarding the old guard.\"\n\"That, to me, is the death knell of an old business,\" Corcoran says. \"The big guys that control the marketplaces are always the last guys to see the train coming.\"\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>> ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barbara co", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "barbara corcoran", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "shaina mishkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corcoran", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "shark tank", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "zillow", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T13:18:15.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b63d0b9b3287f6bb239fb965c6a58339a53d5a4d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtVmEV_.HvFCrFcUbLzm63Ey3FH8MQyI.X4CeOLmQRmSAn8DwbPxjH6m0aKtq572R6A--", "site_full": "reviewcoin.me", "site": "reviewcoin.me", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Lorien Gamaroff: If Bitcoin experience i... - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "title_full": "Lorien Gamaroff: If Bitcoin experience i... - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "ME", "spam_score": 0.102, "main_image": "https://reviewcoin.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1526625689_hqdefault.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b63d0b9b3287f6bb239fb965c6a58339a53d5a4d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtVmEV_.HvFCrFcUbLzm63Ey3FH8MQyI.X4CeOLmQRmSAn8DwbPxjH6m0aKtq572R6A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Lorien Gamaroff: If Bitcoin experience i... - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "text": "/ Lorien Gamaroff: If Bitcoin experience i… Lorien Gamaroff: If Bitcoin experience i… top new video crypto By root / May 18, 2018\nIn South Africa, cryptocurrency’s push for mainstream adoption is getting a boost from a Bitcoin wallet called Centbee, which is helping South African expats send money to their family back home.

As a result, it can be hard to objectively compare the different technologies and advantages of each cryptocurrency. To cut through the noise for privacy-focused cryptos, a Google spreadsheet has surfaced on the internet, allowing for users to see differences between different cryptocurrencies.\nThe sheet, titled “Privacy Coin Matrix,” the focus is on coins with solutions for improving fungibility and security of the coin. Sponsored Links\nIt includes coins and blockchain networks you would expect; bitcoin, ether, monero, and dash. But it also includes some smaller projects like phore, sumokoin, and zoin.\nThe privacy coin matrix is incredibly detailed, as users can compare various attributes, such as coin supply, algorithms, and other variables. Being able to see information across so many coins at a glance reveals interesting findings. Contents 4 Inflation Anonymity\nIn the ‘Privacy’ section, for example, you quickly see that most of the coins have no cryptographic privacy. The rest are equally divided between implementations of Zerocash, Zerocoin, and Cryptonote. Particl is the only one of the 20 using RingCT and Confidential Transactions.\nLooking at dash will be an eyeopener for many. The largest privacy-focused coin by market capitalization scores poorly in the privacy section.\nIn comparison, particl received top marks with a green score in all but three sections, and a yellow score in one.\nYet dash is ranked 12 on CoinMarketCap and Particl is at 133. Perhaps the most technologically superior coin is not always the most successful. Perhaps it’s the one with the right amount of privacy – enough to keep transactions obscured from onlookers but transparent enough to satisfy potential authorities. Distribution of Coins\nAnother interesting trend is the distribution in many of the coins; 25 percent of the coins have 70-80 percent of their supply owned by the top 100 addresses. Bitcoin and dash are the only ones with less than 20 percent of the supply owned by top 100 addresses. For Cryptonote-based coins like monero and sumokoin, it is impossible to give any indication of equity in the blockchain network, as all addresses, and the amounts held, are private. Scalability of Privacy-focused Coins\nScaling is also discussed, in terms of max theoretical transactions per second (tx/s) and max theoretical private transactions per second. Bitcoin is already seeing the limits of what the network can handle, an issue that only gets bigger as time passes by.\nBitcoin and Zcash tie for last, with 7.73 tx/s. NavCoin leads the pack by a longshot, with a theoretical max of 309 tx/s and a private max of 101 tx/s, which beats PayPal average tx/s of 193 but is still far from VISA’s 1,667 tx/s. Inflation\nInflation is another factor to consider when investing, as this attribute is not captured by many metrics such as market capitalization. Bitcoin, bitcoin private, groestlcoin, particl and navcoin have the lowest daily inflation, whereas DeepOnion and Zcash have the highest daily inflation.\nWhen looking at annualized inflation we see a similar picture emerge; the cryptos based on zcash have the highest inflation (zcash, zencash, and zcoin), while bitcoin, groestlcoin, particl, navcoin have the lowest figures for this measure.\nRegardless of whose team you’re rooting for, it is beneficial to see comparisons like this surface. It shows what crypto is doing right as a whole, but also what could use some work universally.

From government crackdowns to new crypto launches, the arena can seem like a swirling vortex of entropy. Bitcoin, the number one digital currency remains the focal point of the industry. Here are four reasons why Nakamoto’s creation is destined for even greater heights in the future. The Simplicity of the Bitcoin Blockchain\nBitcoin was the first successful implementation of the distributed ledger framework via a blockchain. Since its creation, there have been many other iterations of the technology to varying degrees of success. While not taking anything away from robust functioning environments like Ethereum and co, the bitcoin blockchain triumphs in its simplicity. Now, with upgrades like SegWit and the Lightning Network, the efficiency of its blockchain can be improved significantly.\nWhile other blockchains delve into more sophisticated and sometimes confusing applications, the Bitcoin blockchain remains quite simple and basic. This simplicity tends to create a mass appeal, especially with the not-so-tech-savvy. Fintech Revolution\nThe number one crypto is at the heart of the emerging fintech revolution. The tech market has established itself as a change-driver in the broader financial market. Bitcoin is beginning to dominate fintech with recent reports showing that Square Cash app is outstripping Paypal’s Venmo regarding growth. Such has been the impact of bitcoin that Square sold $ 34 million worth of bitcoin in Q1 of 2018.\nIn Africa, bitcoin is at the heart of fintech growth with many remittance and payment platforms offering bitcoin products. As a result, payments have become significantly easier thus lifting a considerable burden from millions of unbanked and underbanked people. Price Resilience\nBitcoin, much like the larger crypto market is volatile. However, in recent times, bitcoin has shown itself resilient to otherwise profound market events. While other cryptos decline in the high double-digit percentages, bitcoin usually only suffers single-digit declines. A recent example is the Upbit investigation which saw bitcoin show some resilience despite the general crypto price decline. With the market maturing, bitcoin will begin to show even fewer reactions to negative market signals. Bitcoin Price for the Last Three Months Adoption by Mainstream Finance\nBitcoin is not without its naysayers like Warren Buffet and Bill Gates . However, there is a noticeable increase in the level of adoption coming from the mainstream finance arena. Nasdaq recently partnered with Gemini to ensure the fidelity of the exchange platform’s bitcoin trading infrastructure. In 2017 both the CME and CBOE launched bitcoin futures trading.\n2018 has seen an influx of bitcoin products geared at increasing the presence of institutional investors in the market. Coinbase and Goldman Sachs recently unveiled products targeted at institutional investors. There are also reports of OTC bitcoin trading decks that will allow significant bitcoin buy and sell orders without negatively impacting the market.\nDo you agree that bitcoin will become even more valuable in the future? Will it remain the number crypto despite growing competition in the market? Let us know in the comment section below.\nImage courtesy of Coinmarketcap, Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mark lyford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "digital money times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lightning network", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T13:23:30.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c18cbaa9c3ee31f7ac6c09ddedc76a6c21184c31", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTZSpbO5xfQ53CUhfnF1S8yp4rNWQifqBkcvC.6jbtbJU7BymVvFYhm3rE4AWRT00vPKkAAmfLnEbXGz_iH9Os99FrZPJ9cSlsboVoVBtZPkhKy15puUIfZ3nId3lgeIWA-", "site_full": "greenground.it", "site": "greenground.it", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "CoinShares Chairman Predicts BTC Surge, New Bitcoin High in 2018 | GREENGROUND IT", "title_full": "CoinShares Chairman Predicts BTC Surge, New Bitcoin High in 2018 | GREENGROUND IT", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IT", "spam_score": 0.901, "main_image": "https://greenground.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cropped-img_0778.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c18cbaa9c3ee31f7ac6c09ddedc76a6c21184c31", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTZSpbO5xfQ53CUhfnF1S8yp4rNWQifqBkcvC.6jbtbJU7BymVvFYhm3rE4AWRT00vPKkAAmfLnEbXGz_iH9Os99FrZPJ9cSlsboVoVBtZPkhKy15puUIfZ3nId3lgeIWA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "CoinShares Chairman Predicts BTC Surge, New Bitcoin High in 2018 | GREENGROUND IT", "text": "by lacer2k CoinShares Chairman Predicts BTC Surge, New Bitcoin High in 2018\nIn an interview with CNBC, Masters stated that Bitcoin is set to experience another rally on the proviso that the cryptocurrency market matures, … social experiment by Livio Acerbo #greengroundit Share this: Google+ Subscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.

Encryption is widely used on the internet to protect user information being sent between a browser and a server, including passwords, payment information and other personal information that should be considered private. However, with recent developments in quantum computers, more powerful and capable than “traditional computers”, the “traditional” data security comes to a threat. Are we prepared for post-quantum era cyber security? IDM service provides today a complete post-quantum protection for tomorrow. With new SIZE algorithm IDM team has developed a security solution to tackle the quantum computer supremacy.\nQuantum computer development Quantum computing takes advantage of a strange ability of subatomic particles to exist in more than one state at any time. In common digital computing, a bit is a single piece of information that can exist in two states – 1 or 0. Quantum computing uses quantum bits, or ‘qubits’ instead. These are quantum systems with two states. This difference allows a future quantum computer to solve some difficult mathematical problems easier, faster and with less energy.\nQuantum computers operating on completely different principles to classic computers can solve particular mathematical problems, like finding very large prime numbers. This problem is classically very difficult to solve. In fact, it is so difficult that it forms the basis of RSA encryption, probably the most popular method of encryption used today. Since prime numbers are so important in cryptography, it is likely that quantum computers would be able to crack practically any of the existing data security systems.\nTo estimate the scope of a potential security problem we have to answer few questions: What kind of attacks can quantum computer perform? What are the most vulnerable scenarios? How far away is the quantum computing? How can we prepare for the future?\nToday Google, IBM, Honeywell, Microsoft, Rigetti and some other companies and laboratories are developing a quantum computer. Currently, with the number of qubits less than 100, a quantum computer is far from being practically viable. However, continuous research and development are bringing fast the day when a quantum computer could surpass the abilities of conventional computers. In anticipation to this day IDM has developed a solution for protection of data security from quantum supremacy. This solution is very different from commonly employed encryption methods.\nQuantum threat to encryption Quantum computer is a threat to data security. There are some particular scenarios, use cases, algorithms necessary to consider when referring to the quantum supremacy.\nHash algorithms Cryptographic hash algorithms are the basis of blockchain technology. It is the hash function that protects any blockchain record from being modified. In addition, the proof-of-work system uses a hash to control the difficulty level of mining process. There are many other use cases of these algorithms, which are very popular in any industry: it is a part of the digital signatures and helps to store password securely.\nA hash function maps input data of arbitrary size to a fix size (a hash) and is designed to be a one-way, that is, a function which infeasible to invert. Any change in input data leads to a different hash. The hash function is irreversible: it is impossible to retrieve input data from output hash string.\nIs it possible to mine all Bitcoins at once with quantum computer? Alex Beath, a Toronto-based physicist, formulated a popular idea: the first quantum computer will mine all of the remaining Bitcoins instantly. There are different opinions in the scientific and crypto community, which are based on theoretical research and practice. Briefly, to make quantum computer be practically useful for Bitcoin mining, we need thousands of qubits. It will eventually happen in 10-20 years from now when 99% or more bitcoins will be in circulation.\nAre my passwords safe? When we read news about brute force attack on passwords, such as attack on WordPress in 2017, we worry about our password strength. How is it being done? It is not possible simply to continue retyping passwords directly into a user interface of a site or service: the protection such as captcha prevents such attack. Most modern services store passwords as hashes. Attackers somehow obtain user database with these password hashes and match these hashes with dictionaries of common password hashes. The brute-force searching with a quantum computer will probably be much faster. IDM allows to store complicated, very long passwords and all your sensitive data in a quantum resistant manner.\nSymmetric Encryption Symmetric algorithms apply the same key for encryption and decryption. We use such algorithms as AES for storage and transition of sensitive data, including access to banking accounts. Probably, a quantum computer will be able to break easily the popular 128-bit AES algorithm by the Grover algorithm in several years. To prevent losses, information security community already discusses AES-256 as a medium-term protection against the quantum attack.\nIncreasing the algorithm complexity with a key length is just a temporary measure. The ultimate solution offered by IDM allows to protect data completely and on a permanent basis.\nAsymmetric Encryption Public or asymmetric encryption, including RSA and elliptic curve techniques, is very popular on the Internet and in cryptocurrency word. Cryptocurrency transaction uses a signature and a public key to verify that it was the owner of the private key that signed it. It is an example of public algorithm usage. Other examples include access to websites, messaging, sending e-mails.\nBecause asymmetric encryption uses two connected keys – private and public – it is more vulnerable than symmetric. Dr. Michele Mosca, deputy director of the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, estimates the chance that some fundamental public key crypto will be broken by quantum computing by the year 2026 as one in seven, and a one-in-two chance of the same by 2031. MIT is constantly exploring this too. In 1994, Peter Shor, a math professor at MIT, invented an algorithm able to crack asymmetric encryption by the quantum computer. In 2015, MIT demonstrated practical ability to break RSA by the quantum computer.\nThe threat to public encryption is tangible and cannot be eliminated by a simple key length extension. Information security specialists are discussing different types of algorithms, such as lattice-based cryptography and error-correcting codes.\nIDM is based on the SIZE technology utilizing new type of error-correction codes. The out of the box solution\nThe purpose of the data encryption is to transform information in order to prevent unauthorized access to it. IDM guarantees a prevention from unauthorized access by applying the SIZE algorithm. The SIZE algorithm relates to a class of correction codes that correct errors, producing multi-level file transformation, same way as encryption algorithms do. And just like encryption algorithms, our code makes unauthorized access to the data impossible.\nFor data protection, the SIZE algorithm applies well-known digital electronics operations. However, these operations have never been applied to special algorithms with a special sequence of mathematical operations and have never been used to protect information. The algorithm is used to transform any digital content into a new form — a set of digital packages. Each of these individual packages has no functional value and may not contain a single bit of the original information. To restore the original information, it is necessary to reassemble the original file from a set of packages in a specific way, performing a series of mathematical operations.\nThere is an infinite number of ways to transform data, the algorithm specifies only the general direction of the process. The data transformation is user specific, so no-one else can access this data, except for the user.\nTo summarize, the SIZE technology guarantees privacy and security for a data storage and transmission. The algorithm characteristics fully meet requirements for the post-quantum protection system.\nIn addition to ultimate protection, IDM’s technology provides the highest level of data recovery and has minimum requirements for computing resources. We provide an excellent opportunity for everyone to share the success of the company. On May 28th we start a crowdfunding campaign on our site.

But what we didn’t see this year was the bitcoin price rally peddled in the media last week by the fund manager Fundstrat .\nDuring the previous three Consensus conferences, bitcoin rallied between 10 and 70 percent but Fundstrat managing partner Thomas Lee was even more bullish about prospects this year: “Already one of the largest crypto conferences in the world, attendance this year is up dramatically and coming at a time when bitcoin/crypto is down YTD. Hence, we expect the Consensus rally to be even larger than previous years.” Going by the precedent of the 70 percent rally last year, Lee’s prediction implied a breakout in bitcoin to back above $15,000. Lee, an experienced Wall St analyst of 25 years, has clocked up more airtime than most fund managers on mainstream financial media making definitive claims about the future price of cryptos with specific price and time targets. Lee and his Fundstrat managers make regular appearances on CNBC making prophetic predictions with definitive explanations on what is happening in the market, especially with bitcoin. Lee has made the call that BTC will increase to “ at least $25,000 ” by the end of this year, implying a tripling in value from where we are today. Fundstrat this year also created a Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI) which is a contrarian index that signals a buy when the indicator, and confidence, is at its lowest. But as a proprietary tool there is little known about what goes into the composition of the index . Amber Baldet reveals DApp store\nMeanwhile, former head of JP Morgan’s blockchain project Quorum, Amber Baldet, revealed the details of her new project Clovyr at Consensus. Co-founded with another former lead blockchain developer at JP Morgan, Patrick Nielsen, Clovyr will be a sort of decentralized app store offering businesses and individuals tools to create their own Dapps and other blockchain solutions. It will also integrate with the Quorum project. Baldet described the hesitance among businesses to adopt public blockchains as akin to the nascent stages of public cloud technology and the reluctance towards Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure. Like then, companies are now spending big money and time trying to build their own private blockchains instead of using tried and tested networks, like Bitcoin’s or Ethereum's. Talking to Fortune Magazine, Baldet says companies will ultimately unwind their expensive private blockchain experiments, like they did with their private cloud efforts, and migrate to the public infrastructure already in place. “The conversation on the enterprise side right now feels a bit like that,” she says. In a discussion with Ethereum developer Joe Lubin and bitcoin maximalist Jimmy Song after debuting Clovyr, Baldet asked Lubin what he thought of the project. Characteristically outspoken, Lubin wasn't long bursting Baldet's bubble. “I didn’t see anything other than buzzwords” he replied; even going as far as to dismiss decentralized applications (Dapps) in general as “magical blockchain dust”. Startup-based blockchain ETF announced Portfolio manager Brian Kelly, whose investment firm BKCM LLC focuses on digital currencies, announced at Consensus that it will create a blockchain-based startup exchange-traded fund (ETF). Working in partnership with REX Shares founder Gregg King, Kelly will actively manage a portfolio of about 30 startup companies that are using blockchain technology. The ETF will use the following criteria to screen the blockchain companies: ideas that streamline business processes; Wall Street “disruptors”; mining focused entities; exchange firms and startups creating a decentralized internet. German exchange Deutsche Borse gets into crypto While most of the crypto world had its gaze firmly fixed on New York this week, one of Europe’s largest stock exchanges, Borse Stuttgart, announced that it will offer crypto trading through a subsidiary, Bison , which it claims will be the world’s first crypto trading app when released in September. It will offer trading on BTC, LTC, ETH and XRP. Europe’s regulatory environment is arguably more conducive to blockchain innovation than the US and has attracted many startups to Malta, Switzerland and eastern Europe.

There is a major bearish trend line formed with resistance at $1,250 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is currently correcting higher, but it may face many barriers on the upside near $1,240-50.\nBitcoin cash price is under pressure below $1,300 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD is likely to extend declines further if it fails to move above $1,250. Bitcoin Cash Price Decline\nRecently, there was a minor upside correction above $1,300 in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price traded towards $1,340 where sellers appeared and protected more upsides. As a result, the price started a fresh downside move and declined back below $1,300. Sellers gained momentum, which pushed the price even below the $1,240 and $1,220 support levels.\nThe decline was such that the price almost tested the $1,150 level. A low was formed at $1,156 from where an upside correction is currently underway. It is currently testing the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,339 high to $1,156 low. However, there are many hurdles on the upside for buyers near $1,220-50. There is also a major bearish trend line formed with resistance at $1,250 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,339 high to $1,156 low is near $1,248 to act as a resistance.\nLooking at the chart , the price is clearly under bearish pressure below $1,250. A break above $1,240-50 is needed for a bounce back, else there is a risk of more declines towards $1,100 in the near term.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is mostly moving in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is currently recovering from the 30 level.\nMajor Support Level – $1,150\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,250 Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Extends Its Decline was last modified: May 18th, 2018 by Aayush Jindal ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitc", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T08:21:00.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eadcb3bd9fc84e4f4d74d5a9e6717f427378cc34", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKXRU2OpTFfNRdiT3VYP7ieBnNJp5AiXpFTCE1RQIXGrJM4G.FHHCErqAondFiGzT2CTgpa5dLAMe2nk_eDXegDaGacY_mF16vnzH1cLKGKYG4JuZYxkgikg--", "site_full": "www.newsbtc.com", "site": "newsbtc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin and Blockchain is the 'Next Major IT Revolution' | NewsBTC", "title_full": "Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin and Blockchain is the 'Next Major IT Revolution' | NewsBTC", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/05/18180836/Wozniak-Blockchain.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40893, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eadcb3bd9fc84e4f4d74d5a9e6717f427378cc34", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKXRU2OpTFfNRdiT3VYP7ieBnNJp5AiXpFTCE1RQIXGrJM4G.FHHCErqAondFiGzT2CTgpa5dLAMe2nk_eDXegDaGacY_mF16vnzH1cLKGKYG4JuZYxkgikg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jp Buntinx", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin and Blockchain is the 'Next Major IT Revolution' | NewsBTC", "text": "Home » Bitcoin » Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin and Blockchain is the ‘Next Major IT Revolution’ Steve Wozniak: Bitcoin and Blockchain is the ‘Next Major IT Revolution’ Posted on May 18, 2018 in Bitcoin | 0 comments\nThe co-founder of the multinational technology company Apple has once again praised Bitcoin and its underlying technology blockchain. Steve Wozniak spoke about the financial innovation at a tech conference that was held this week. Wozniak Believes in Bitcoin and Blockchain\nWozniak was speaking in Vienna at an event called WeAreDevelopers World Congress. There he stated that he felt that the blockchain would be a world-changing technology. He went on to claim that it was the ‘next major IT revolution that is about to happen.’\nThe Apple co-founder spoke just after the opening of the conference. His 45 minute ‘fireside chat’ took place at the main stage and was live streamed to all of the other rooms at the event. Naturally, being given the task of introducing the general technology conference, Wozniak didn’t exclusively talk about Bitcoin and blockchain. He also addressed topics such as Tesla, and the Cambridge Analytica data leak scandal. Digital security was also addressed:\n“We lost our security a long time ago. We’ve lost our privacy and it’s been abused. If I think I have a level of privacy that I don’t, that’s deceit. And that bothers me. I hit a limit. I can’t take that. It’s one step in a long series of steps that are all in the same direction.”\nAlong with Wozniak’s opening, there were multiple presentations and workshops at the WeAreDevelopers World Conference devoted to blockchain. Amongst those sections of the program covering the technology was a talk titled ‘How to Execute Business Processes on the Blockchain’ delivered by Dr. Jan Mendling, one called ‘From Coded Cultures to Future Cryptoeconomics’ by Matthias Tarasiewicz, Daniel Pichler, and Jürgen Hoebarth, as well as ‘Don’t Be the Weakest Link In the (Block)chain’ by Luka Milinković & Marko Atanasievski.\nDespite only briefly mentioning Bitcoin and blockchain in his opening speech, Wozniak is already known as a fan of cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. According to U.K. newspaper the Independent , he spoke on the topic in October of last year at the Money 20/20 event in Las Vegas. There, he slated fiat currency as being ‘kind of phony’ since governments can just create more of it at their own whim. He contrasted gold and traditional forms of money with Bitcoin:\n“There is a certain finite amount of bitcoin that can ever exist… Gold gets mined and mined and mined.

The idea is to roll out its coin initially to a relative handful of customers, hoping they’ll participate in finding inevitable bugs as they make typical retail purchases. For Japan, it’s yet another indication the country’s business culture is betting on a crypto future.\nAlso read: Alec Baldwin’s Lambo Movie Backed by Crypto Tech Japan Banking Behemoth to Test Proprietary Coin\nMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (MUFG; 株式会社三菱UFJフィナンシャル・グループ), after a few years of plotting (since 2015), appears ready to roll out its own crypto token, MUFG Coin by 2019. In doing so, it would become the first major bank on the planet to issue a variation on cryptocurrency. The plan involves testing MUFG Coin in 2019 with 100,000 users, hoping they will shop the token through retail outlets, everything from clothing to food.\nIn early 2016, Asahi Shimbun , Japanese daily, broke the story of how MUFG bundled a trial-trial with an iteration then of MUFG Coin and a smartphone app. “MUFG coin takes advantage of the new technology that is on a network of multiple smaller computers,” a company report at the time revealed. “It is possible to cheaply build a tamper-resistant transaction record of the ledger, otherwise referred to as the ‘blockchain.’”\nMUFG Coin’s users in 2019 would indeed have to download an app, converting fiat deposits. The token is supposedly designed for parity with Japanese yen. When the project was hatched three years ago, one rationale was to bring down transactional frictions with regard to remittances and transfers, using a variation on peer-to-peer platforms to lower costs.\nJapan’s largest bank’s crypto appetite was probably wet by participation years ago in private consortium, R3. Dozens of international banks collaborated at the time to study crypto-related solutions. Indeed, close to a dozen of those banks tested distributed ledger tech using Ethereum by way of Azure. That four continent experiment proved to bankers such as Mitsubishi crypto tech was for real. Better than Bitcoin?\nFall of last year, MUFG president Nobuyuki Hirano insisted the bank was trying to “overcome issues of virtual currencies and create a highly useful currency.” The quote revealed two things: an acknowledgment the bank was monitoring cryptos, and how ubiquitous currencies such as bitcoin core (BTC) were becoming in Japan, which ruled BTC legal tender. MUFG president Nobuyuki Hirano\nVarious reports also claim MUFG is trying to get cooperation from other banks in its digital endeavor. If such is to come about, MUFG Coin will have to compete with J-Coin, a Mizuho bank crypto shooting for roll out during the upcoming Tokyo Olympic games (2020). And while not a bank, Yahoo! Japan has entered the space as well, and e-commerce group DMM (close to 30 million users) has already launched a cryptocurrency exchange.\nMitsubishi United Financial of Japan Group (MUFG) boasts $2.5 trillion in assets. It also ranks second in the world as a holding company, and is the largest financial group in Japan.

Along with the myriad of dApps being built, Ethereum’s success is mainly attributed to its implementation of smart contracts.\nInterestingly enough, the invention of smart contracts dates back to 1996. Computer scientist Nick Szabo drew up the term “smart contracts,” and explains them as follows:\n“I call these new contracts “smart”, because they are far more functional than their inanimate paper-based ancestors. No use of artificial intelligence is implied. A smart contract is a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises” — Nick Szabo, 1996\nHis work later went on to inspire many other researchers and scientists, including Vitalik, who created Ethereum. Basic info\nBefore we delve further into the guide, it is important to understand two important concepts.\nThe first thing that we need to understand is what the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is. Its sole purpose is to act as a runtime environment for smart contracts based on Ethereum. Think of it as a global super computer that runs all the smart contracts. As the name suggests, the EVM is virtual and not a physical machine. You can read more about the EVM here.\nThe second concept we need to understand is what is gas. In the EVM, gas is a unit of measurement used to assign a fee to each transaction with a smart contract. Each computation that happens in the EVM requires gas. The more complex and tedious it is, the more gas is needed to execute the smart contract.\nEvery transaction specifies the gas price it is willing to pay in ether for each unit of gas, allowing the market to decide the relationship between the price of ether and the cost of computing operations (as measured in gas). It’s the combination of the two, total gas used multiplied by gas price paid, that results in the total fee paid by a transaction. Fee for transaction = Total gas used * gas price;\nRead more about gas here.\nNow that you have basic knowledge about what a smart contract is and how the smart contract runs, we can go straight into how we are going to make our very own smart contract! Setting up\nWe’re going to use a tool for this: Pragma. It’s an easy-to-use platform for creating and deploying smart contracts. Sign up here and go the editor:\nLog in to Metamask. If you haven’t installed MetaMask yet, you can start here.\nSwitch to the Kovan test network both in Pragma and MetaMask. Just to give you a brief overview about testnets, check out this article. An Introduction to Ethereum Testnets\nUnderstanding how to use testnets is essential for developing smart contracts on Ethereum. Here is a basic introduction to what testnets are and how to use them. What is a testnet? Testnets simulate the Ethereum network and EVM. They allow developers... 1_X-yIFMaU0inr5_32wo6d9w.jpeg 637x1053 57.1 KB\nThe Ethereum mainnet is the official Ethereum network. It is more secure, and uses Ether, which has real monetary value.\nTestnets are playground Ethereum networks in which the Ether is agreed to have no monetary value. Developers use these playgrounds to test applications before deploying them to the mainnet for their users.\nTo switch between these networks, click on the network name next to the MetaMask icon and select the network. For this tutorial, please choose Kovan. Writing the smart contract\nThe following contract will implement the simplest form of a cryptocurrency. It is possible to generate coins out of thin air, but only the person that created the contract is able to do that (it is trivial to implement a different issuance scheme). Furthermore, anyone can send coins to each other without needing to register with a username and password. All you need is an Ethereum keypair. pragma solidity ^0.4.21; //tells that the source code is written for Solidity version 0.4.21 or anything newer that does not break functionality contract yourToken { // The keyword \"public\" makes those variables readable from outside. address public minter; // Events allow light clients to react on changes efficiently. mapping (address => uint) public balances; // This is the constructor whose code is run only when the contract is created event Sent(address from, address to, uint amount); function yourToken() public { minter = msg.sender; } function mint(address receiver, uint amount) public { if(msg.sender != minter) return; balances[receiver]+=amount; } function send(address receiver, uint amount) public { if(balances[msg.sender] < amount) return; balances[msg.sender]-=amount; balances[receiver]+=amount; emit Sent(msg.sender, receiver, amount); } }\nThis code basically lets you mint and send tokens to other accounts.\nLet’s go through it line by line: pragma solidity ^0.4.21;\nThis indicates that the source code is written for Solidity version 0.4.21 or anything newer that does not break functionality. This is to ensure that the code doesn’t behave differently with the new compiler versions. contract yourToken\nEverything related to yourToken goes inside this contract. Essentially, a contract in solidity is the collection of functions and state (code and data) sitting at an address on the Ethereum blockchain. address public minter;\nThis is the address of the minter. The keyword “public” makes those variables readable from outside. event Sent(address from, address to, uint amount);\nEvents allow light clients (UI) to react to the changes efficiently. function yourToken() public { minter = msg.sender; }\nLet’s set your Ethereum address as minter of the contract. You’ll need to access the contract through your MetaMask to be able to mint. We’ll go through this again after deploying the contract. function mint(address receiver, uint amount) public { if(msg.sender != minter) return; balances[receiver]+=amount; }\nThis function lets you mint the amount of coins you want to. You can mint as many tokens as you want to. The if condition tells the system to stop executing if you’re not the minter, which is set in yourToken function.\nIf you are in fact the minter, it lets you mint the tokens. function send(address receiver, uint amount) public { if(balances[msg.sender] < amount) return; balances[msg.sender]-=amount; balances[receiver]+=amount; emit Sent(msg.sender, receiver, amount); }\nThis is a function that lets one address send the tokens to another address. It takes two parameters: receiver and amount. It reduces the amount from the sender’s address and adds the same amount to receiver’s address. Event Sent, which we declared earlier, is now used to do the transfer. Currently, we have kept the sender as msg.sender, which is the minter, as we do not want to complicate the contract.\nThat’s it. Your contract is now ready, so let’s compile it.

In the past, he has said he does not understand bitcoin but had not previously gone as far as calling it a bubble.\nLike many other bitcoin bashers, Ma remains positive regarding blockchain technology. In his recent remarks, he said that blockchain is not a bubble, although he worries about all the people buying and selling blockchains. High On Blockchain\nBlockchain is not a big gold mine, he said, but a solution for solving data and privacy and security issues. The true value of blockchain is its ability to provide guarantees, not to make money. He said people should be asking what value blockchain can bring to consumers, businesses and government.\nMa, whose company does trillions of transactions, said he recognized blockchain’s importance when he learned it could solve security and privacy issues. Alibaba began researching the technology and has become the largest holder of blockchain patents, Ma said, while China is the country with the most patents.\nWhen asked in November about bitcoin, Ma said he did not have much interest in it. Alibaba and Ant Financial were promoting a cashless society at the time.\nIn December of 2017, with bitcoin’s price at $15,000, many were saying bitcoin was a bubble. Interviewed by CNBC, Ma said he did not know if it was a bubble , but he against said he was not paying attention to it. He said he was still focusing on Alipay, the renminbi, the euro and the U.S. dollar. The High Profile Bitcoin Bashers\nWarren Buffett, for his part, recently referred to bitcoin as a “rat drug” on CNBC. Charlie Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, has called transactional bitcoin immoral and bitcoin an artificial speculative medium.\nBill Gates has said investing in bitcoin produces nothing, so it cannot be expected to appreciate.\nOther high profile bitcoin bashers include Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase CEO; UBS chairman and former Bundesbank president Axel Weber; former PayPal chief executive Bill Harris, Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard Group; and CNBC “Mad Money” host Jim Cramer.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack ma", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "alibaba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "backs blockchain alibaba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack ma joins the bitcoin bashing brigade", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "blockchain blockchain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tianjin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T16:13:48.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5a90ec83c330df64038901d1f9213cfc61422fb3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKXRU2OpTFfNTLQ7fT1SzV5UiGO064.XT9azkn7ffDwr7MC4h3Un3rImwCzo3tJKVVgjfrS_tmrD8-", "site_full": "www.newsbtc.com", "site": "newsbtc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD at Risk of Further Declines | NewsBTC", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD at Risk of Further Declines | NewsBTC", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.101, "main_image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/04/17062405/techanalysis-btc2.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40893, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5a90ec83c330df64038901d1f9213cfc61422fb3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKXRU2OpTFfNTLQ7fT1SzV5UiGO064.XT9azkn7ffDwr7MC4h3Un3rImwCzo3tJKVVgjfrS_tmrD8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aayush Jindal", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD at Risk of Further Declines | NewsBTC", "text": "Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD at Risk of Further Declines Aayush Jindal | May 18, 2018 | 8:48 am Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD at Risk of Further Declines Aayush Jindal | May 18, 2018 | 8:48 am Key Points Bitcoin price declined and broke a key support level at $8,200 against the US Dollar. There was a break below a triangle pattern with support at $8,250 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may correct a few points in the short term, but it could face resistance near $8,150 and $8,250.\nBitcoin price tumbled below key supports against the US Dollar. BTC/USD is currently consolidating near $8,000 and it is at risk of more losses. Bitcoin Price Analysis\nThere was no upside break above $8,500 in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair failed on many occasions to trade above the $8,500 resistance area. There was a sharp bearish reaction and the price declined below the $8,200 and $8,080 support levels. It seems like the price was completely rejected from the 50% Fib retracement level of the leg from the $8,850 high to $8,080 low.\nMore importantly, there was a break below a triangle pattern with support at $8,250 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair is now trading well below $8,500 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The decline was such that the price even spiked below $8,000 and a low was formed at $7,931. At the moment, the price is consolidating losses and moved above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the drop from the $8,486 high to $7,931 low. However, the price is struggling to move above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $8,150.\nLooking at the chart , the price may perhaps move above $8,150 in the near term, but it could face a strong barrier near $8,250. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the drop from the $8,486 high to $7,931 low is a key resistance at $8,209.

By 0 24\nBitcoin will consume as much electricity as a country like Australia by the end of 2018, warns a new study. In a few months, blockchain, the famous technology behind cryptocurrency, will represent up to 0.5% of global electricity consumption and it is not ready to stop there!\nIt is known, Bitcoin mining consumes a huge amount of electricity. To undermine cryptomony, such as Bitcoin, Ether or Litecoin, miners use expensive and powerful computer components that run at full speed constantly. It is thus very difficult for a person who mines Bitcoin at home to be profitable. Bitcoin: the cryptocurrency will represent 0,5% of the world consumption in electricity at the end of 2018\nAccording to a new study carried out under the leadership Alex De Vries, a Dutch researcher specializing in Blockchain, the excessive power consumption of Bitcoin will continue to grow. Currently, the Bitcoin network already represents 2.55 gigawatts per year . It is almost as much as Ireland, which consumes up to 3.1 gigawatts a year.\nA single transaction equals as much electricity as a Dutch home in a month. If Bitcoin was a country, it would become today the 65th largest consumer in the world! A few months ago, the cryptocurrency was satisfied with the 85th place.\nBy the end of this year 2018, Bitcoin will represent up to 7.7 gigawatts of world consumption considers the study. For comparison, it is a power consumption equivalent to that of a country like Chile, Austria, or Australia, which consumes 8.2 gigawatts per year. “This growing demand for electricity will certainly not help us achieve our climate goals” warned Alex de Vries\nFor some, this alarming consumption will precipitate the death knell of Bitcoin. According to a study by the French company Selectra, a Bitcoin transaction consumes 500 times more than a payment in blue card . Knowing that the electricity consumption of cryptocurrency can not be revised downwards without calling into question the entire Blockchain system, a question arises: Is Bitcoin really viable in the long term ?\nThis article appeared first on http://www.phonandroid.com/bitcoin-consommera-autan-electricity-bitcoin-fin-2018.html\nHits: 27 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockchain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T09:04:35.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f08077800a44a613a77aada6c81f391910a4a8f8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9GpoK49ucKkZtSlTt2RYrI3k4TPImXo0Siga7j2PicGF3z6dy9b5Rxxd1tJfqMfkK4NrTHDgmThC8qTZINxFvAxXK9mdLF2Lj7.DcXZFmEJpJKA5xhETfXiPEeft5U8n0Sv185TKW7Wg--", "site_full": "www.bitcoininsider.org", "site": "bitcoininsider.org", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "New Slightly Faster z-enemy-1.10 Nvidia GPU Miner for RavenCoin (RVN) | Bitcoin Insider", "title_full": "New Slightly Faster z-enemy-1.10 Nvidia GPU Miner for RavenCoin (RVN) | Bitcoin Insider", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f08077800a44a613a77aada6c81f391910a4a8f8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9GpoK49ucKkZtSlTt2RYrI3k4TPImXo0Siga7j2PicGF3z6dy9b5Rxxd1tJfqMfkK4NrTHDgmThC8qTZINxFvAxXK9mdLF2Lj7.DcXZFmEJpJKA5xhETfXiPEeft5U8n0Sv185TKW7Wg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "New Slightly Faster z-enemy-1.10 Nvidia GPU Miner for RavenCoin (RVN) | Bitcoin Insider", "text": "New Slightly Faster z-enemy-1.10 Nvidia GPU Miner for RavenCoin (RVN) New Slightly Faster z-enemy-1.10 Nvidia GPU Miner for RavenCoin (RVN)\nThere is a new version of the popular closed source miner z-enemy-1.10 for Nvidia GPU mining rigs that is widely used for RavenCoin (RVN) and the X16R algorithm it uses that brings 1-2% performance improvement as well as some fixes and improvements.

Yamaguchi’s cold stare had shown the crowd the MMA veteran was very serious about this re-match with Lee.\nAs 138 countries watched during the first four rounds of the bout, it seemed Lee dominated Yamaguchi.

During the fifth and final round Yamaguchi came out swinging hard with many double leg takedowns, submissions, and threw lots of strikes from the bottom.\nAfter the fifth round of the Unstoppable Dreams bout the judges came to the decision that the Atomweight World Champion Angela Lee had won the fight. Lee then thanked her team for their support but also stated that Yamaguchi put up a tough fight as the Japanese veteran is very experienced.\nAt Bitcoin.com we’re proud of Mei Yamaguchi’s efforts during the One Championship in Singapore, and we think she put up one hell of a fight.\nDid you watch the Unstoppable Dreams One Championship fight?

The bearish pressure is not relenting by any means, as market makers are intent on keeping the prices down for some time to come. With the Bitcoin price now dropping below $8,200, it seems to be a matter of time until the value dips below $8,000 once again. That would certainly trigger an even bigger sell-off in the altcoin department. Bitcoin Price Trend Becomes Worrisome\nIt has been documented over the past few months how the Bitcoin price is seemingly incapable of catching a break. No solid positive momentum has been achieved at this stage, and it seems things will not necessarily improve in the near future either. The past three months have seen some attempts at recovering losses, but ultimately seem to result in lower lows for the Bitcoin price.\nMore specifically, three months ago, the Bitcoin price was hovering near the $12,0000 mark. Ever since that time, it has dipped below $11,000, then $10,000, and even hit $7,200 a few weeks later. While that is still the proverbial bottom as of right now, it remains to be determined if any positive momentum can be generated before the year 2018 comes to a close. The current trend doesn’t look all that promising so far, but things are always subject to change in the world of cryptocurrency.\nOver the past 24 hours, the Bitcoin price has lost another 1.95% of its value. This decline pushes the price per BTC below $8,200, and will seemingly result in a price dip below $8,000 by the time the weekend has come to a close. It remains unclear what is causing all of this negative Bitcoin price pressure this year, but it seems evident things will not improve anytime soon.\nEven the Bitcoin trading volume is on the decline as of late, which is anything but promising. More specifically, the trading volume has dropped to $8.894bn, which is $2bn below what one would expect to see these days. This seems to indicate the overall demand for the world’s leading cryptocurrency is on the decline, which doesn’t bode well for Bitcoin and any other cryptocurrency on the market these days.\nOKEx is still leading the charge in terms of Bitcoin trading volume, which is a bit surprising. Its USDT pair remains extremely popular and is well ahead of Bitfinex’s USD pair and the USDT market on Binance. All three platforms generate over $215m in 24-hour volume, which is rather interesting to keep an eye on. With Huobi and OKEx’s TRUE pair in the five as well, there is only one fiat currency market to speak of. That can prove to be problematic for the Bitcoin price moving forward.\nWhether or not the Bitcoin price can recover from this latest setback, remains to be determined. Anything is possible in the world of cryptocurrency these days, even though the current trend looks anything but promising. Then again, the weekend is usually very different from the rest of the week when it comes to cryptocurrency trading, and this weekend may prove to be somewhat interesting in this regard.

It’s being used as regular money with people buying goods, clothes and paying for holidays using Bitcoin. More and more companies have started embracing Bitcoin as a form of payment, and South Africa is not standing by idly while this phenomenon is taking place! Bitcoin as a form of payment for products and services has grown, and merchants have an incentive to accept it because fees are lower than those typically imposed by credit card processors…\nAnd unlike credit cards, any fees are paid by the purchaser, not the vendor. Also transactions cannot be reversed, so retailers no longer need to worry about credit card chargebacks. We have a look at what company accept payment in Bitcoin. Here’s a list of merchants in SA:\nTakealot.com\nThis online shopping is the biggest e-commerce retailer in SA. Takealot boasts of a large product variety that’s split into 23 departments. When paying with bitcoin on Takealot select instant EFT when you checkout to pay for your purchase with bitcoin.\nBidorbuy\nProbably the most popular auction site in South Africa will gladly accept your payment in Bitcoin. A popular fav shopping destination for myself, BOB as they are know to users not only sells second hand goods, but also a lot of new stuff at bargain prices! From gardening equipment, to electronics to your ultimate single malt whisky, buy it on BOB and drop some Bitcoin in their purse to secure your goods.\nDaddy’s Deals\nThis popular promotional and specials for the South African consumer site can hook you up with that quick break or well deserved holiday at a fraction of the normal price. Now you can also kick back for the weekend and pay your way with Bitcoin, awesome…\nNearly Every Vape Store Online\nSince vaping has become the new craze as a hip new product, so have the stores adapted the latest technology like paying with Bitcoin. From what we can see, nearly every Vape store out there is now also accepting this crypto currency as payment. These stores include, VapesSA, Vape King, Vape Store, Vape Cartel, Vape Club and Twisp to just call on a couple.\nCape Coffee Beans\nCape Coffee Beans is an online store for the coffee lovers. This online shop is the answer to all your coffee needs.\nRunwaySale\nIs the largest fashion online shopping club in South Africa. They offer up to 70% affordable designer’s brands that you’ve exclusive access to. The sales last for online a few days and the stock is limited, so you’ve to be early to get the best choices.\nEarthchild Clothing\nIs a proudly South African national retailer and design house that offers clothing that’s natural and made of organic cotton of the best quality and comfort.\niFix/weFix\nThis company is the biggest smart device repairers in SA. WeFix, formerly known as iFix, repairs and services all Apple products, some Samsung devices. And the devices range from iPods, iPhones, to Macs as well as Samsung smartphones and tablets.\nCustom Candies\nIs an online custom apparel and gifting shop offering easy, unlimited customisation of various products for the individual.\nThe Tea Merchant\nHas been sourcing loose leaf tea, teapots, cups and accessories for over five years and supplying South Africans with the complete tea solution. Now you can shop online with your bitcoin and have it delivered direct to your door, nationwide. Where do we think Bitcoin payment in SA is going?\nI think it’s evident that Bitcoin is starting to get mass adoption from retailers online. Although this does not at this point in time include large retailers like Woolies or Pick n Pay, we think it’s well on its way to SA. We are waiting to hear what is going to come from the experiment with Luno Wallet and Pick n Pay that will make Bitcoin payment possible for the first time to such a large store… Let’s hold our thumbs and see what the future holds!

This text will cowl a number of the most attention-grabbing initiatives, occasions, and conditions that occurred in the course of the occasion. Consensus is without doubt one of the largest and most necessary conferences that occurs yearly, and it recurrently attracts a big crowd of traders, entrepreneurs, and crypto fanatics.\nAs with most issues in life, the perfect isn’t low cost, and that is actually the case with tickets for CoinDesk’s Consensus 2018 conference which might have set you again $2,000 per ticket. With an roughly complete of 8,500 individuals in attendance this 12 months, the occasion may have generated round $17M in ticket gross sales. Should you have been unlucky sufficient to go away it to the final minute to purchase a ticket, you’ll have needed to put up as a lot as $3,000 per ticket (or greater than 0.35 BTC).\nConsensus is a three-day lengthy occasion compromised of talks, exhibitions, and demonstrations that relate to all issues round cryptocurrencies and blockchains. This 12 months was one among, if not the largest conferences but, probably owing itself to the meteoric worth explosion Bitcoin noticed within the prior 12 months, which additionally noticed different cryptocurrencies for the same trajectory. The value of Bitcoin has already seen a considerable spike because the heavyweights of the cryptosphere made their technique to the Huge Apple, enhancing by greater than 4% in comparison with the earlier low of the previous three weeks. Who’s at Consensus this time round?\nThe actual query is, who isn’t there? As the largest crypto occasion round, all the largest names from startups, to traders, angel teams and the monetary sector are in attendance this week, making it completely buzzing with potential. 254 audio system from all all over the world participated within the convention offering ample number of content material for guests. Nevertheless, with its recognition, there come some unlucky trade-offs, one among which was unexpectedly lengthy wait occasions, with one CNBC reporter reportedly being pressured to attend greater than an hour to achieve entry.\nCoinDesk’s director of promoting Jacob Donnelly had the next to say in regards to the wait occasions: “While we apologize for any delays, Consensus 2018 has acquired overwhelming curiosity and is the biggest blockchain-focused occasion ever held in the USA. We’re working to scale back the wait time.” Though they issued an apology for the lengthy waits, we think about it fell on deaf ears at $2,000+ per ticket.\nConsensus is just not the one occasion bringing within the crowds, discovering itself in the midst of the first-ever Blockchain Week New York. As the primary occasion of the week, it is just supplemented by the presence of different occasions earlier than and after Consensus. As is now apparently custom, the Lambos have been out in full show to welcome attendees to the celebrated occasion held in Midtown New York on the Hilton. What higher technique to sign prosperity than to flash the money of the Bitcoin rich to an keen viewers. Who didn’t make it?\nOf the largest names but once more lacking from the annual Convention, Vitalik Buterin stands on the prime. Nevertheless, for the fourth 12 months in a row the enigmatic persona has shunned the occasion owing as a result of exorbitant ticket costs, Buterin quoted “I refuse to personally contribute to that stage of rent-seeking.”\nApart from eschewing the occasion, Buterin additionally remarked upon CoinDesk’s reporting insurance policies and use of off-record quotes via Twitter that “[CoinDesk’s] reporting insurance policies are designed to lure you with gotchas. Do you know that should you ship them a reply, and also you explicitly say that some half is off the file, that’s explicitly on the file except you undergo a request/approve dance first?” FedEx and Bullard\nFred Smith, the Chairman and chief govt of the FedEx lately said, “ blockchain has the potential to fully revolutionize what’s throughout the border.” Referencing the potential for blockchain to disrupt the logistics trade. With the vastly improved effectivity and transparency in warehousing, supply, and fee doable with the blossoming expertise. Earlier within the 12 months, Smith had demonstrated an curiosity in the potential for FedEx becoming a member of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA). Smith notes that the variance in requirements, laws, and terminologies utilized by totally different nations is accountable for a “huge quantity of friction” when contemplating logistics throughout borders, declaring that the “chain of custody” provided by blockchain is perhaps a possible decision to the problem.\nBecause the president of the St. Louis Federal, we might suppose that the opinion of James Bullard ought to carry some heft. In a latest message, Bullard warned that the largest impediment dealing with the worldwide adoption of cryptocurrency is its change charge instability. This volatility has been fairly clearly demonstrated lately as the worth of Bitcoin reached an all-time excessive of virtually $20,000 final December, earlier than falling sharply by greater than half within the following months. Apart from this, Bullard additionally tried to attenuate the chance the U.S. Fed will introduce its personal digital foreign money.\nBullard made the next assertion at Consensus: “ We now have an uncommon sort of downside the place we merely don’t know who’s issuing the foreign money, and what the longer term issuance for these currencies will likely be. Is it even doable to keep up the credibility of those guarantees given the lack of awareness surrounding crypto? Should you can’t, then the foreign money will probably go the way in which of the Venezuelan Bolivar… on a path to zero.” Joe Lubin & Jimmy Tune’s wager on the way forward for Blockchain expertise\nJoe Lubin, founding father of the Ethereum startup ConsenSys, & Jimmy Tune, a associate at Blockchain Capital, have been engaged in an intense debate which led to them agreeing on a wager over the way forward for blockchain tech. Tune , a skeptic in regards to the potential advantages of many blockchain purposes at Consensus said that to him, all of them sound like “magical blockchain mud” , earlier than persevering with “I don’t actually see a lot of these things gaining a lot traction. Bitcoin is the actual innovation right here.” Lubin , on the alternative facet of the dialogue, challenged Tune to a wager, stating “I’ll wager you any quantity of bitcoin that you simply’re flawed.” The 2 shook on the wager, however the phrases nonetheless stay to be labored out, although in accordance with in accordance with Forbes Lubin is price as a lot as $5 billion, which is one thing Tune would possibly need to take into account when ironing out the phrases of their association. Former JPMorgan bankers begin once more\nAmber Baldet and Patrick Mylund Nielsen, each former bankers at JPMorgan Chase, have formally introduced their three way partnership: Clovr, which is described as a “pragmatic connection between enterprise and public chains.” The wager between Lubin and Tune was the direct results of the Clovr demo, which should have triggered a clumsy ambiance for everybody concerned. In accordance with Baldet, former head of blockchain initiatives on the US financial institution, Clovr is an app retailer for decentralized apps and providers.\nFeatured Picture by way of BigStock .

The American investing tycoon, Wilson said, has not done his research. Why Bitcoin Has Value\nSpeaking at the Consensus 2018 conference in New York City, Wilson said that the true value of the bitcoin ecosystem would accrue to the protocol itself and not the businesses that build on top if it. He stated that Buffett hasn’t “taken the time to really understand what’s going on here” before saying that his firm, Union Square Ventures , is making highly speculative bets but that it would “all work out”.\nWilson, whose funds hold investments in web 2.0 businesses like Twitter, Tumblr, and Kickstarter, did caution that some of the current valuations of existing tokens are inflated. He went on to say that they will not represent a good deal even years from now.\nWilson went on to say that he thought governments would attempt to control cryptocurrency and would enjoy some success, but said that they wouldn’t be able to undo the work that has already been done, likening it to trying to “put the genie back in the bottle”. Fred Wilson’s Open Letter to Warren Buffett Union Square Ventures founder Fred Wilson | Source: YouTube\nWilson was responding to billionaire Buffett’s recent comments, made during the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting at the beginning of the month, when he described bitcoin as being “rat poison squared” and said that bitcoin “is creating nothing”.\nHis comments drew a lot of criticism, not only from blockchain entrepreneurs but from respected businessmen and venture capitalists like Wilson himself. However, those opinions are shared , at least to some extent, by the likes of Bill Gates and most major banks.\nFollowing the meeting, Wilson posted an open letter on his AVC blog, and he repeated his comments when speaking during the annual Consensus conference this week. He stated that Buffett dislikes bitcoin because of the lack of cash flow for the underlying networks. He hinted that Buffett’s investment style is that of investing in businesses, and because bitcoin is decentralized there is no underlying business in which Buffett can invest. That, Wilson posits, is why Buffett has been put off by the idea.\nWilson did temper his comments with some words of caution, saying that he expected governments to have some success in rationalizing and, ultimately, regulating the industry but said that the ICO market is half-way to a new capital market.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fred wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kickstarter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "usv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "union square ventures", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T11:28:41.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b509647870e2ccfa6a9df6fe3eed470eba0bbb12", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU46YIFQJVzsYE38dJlvNgKmiSfZrB9pdJJ0799YsRXhWIoWaUhqsm8KDrbrBjdW1oPC9RI6khpWSO8aPfsLXd_A56JY.SFVf5ko-", "site_full": "lukasgrumlik.co.uk", "site": "lukasgrumlik.co.uk", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Blockstack Launches Decentralized Applications Store – Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency World Blog", "title_full": "Blockstack Launches Decentralized Applications Store – Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency World Blog", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/llloodg6655.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b509647870e2ccfa6a9df6fe3eed470eba0bbb12", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU46YIFQJVzsYE38dJlvNgKmiSfZrB9pdJJ0799YsRXhWIoWaUhqsm8KDrbrBjdW1oPC9RI6khpWSO8aPfsLXd_A56JY.SFVf5ko-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Blockstack Launches Decentralized Applications Store – Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency World Blog", "text": "Posted by LukasG79\nWallets\nThe project that’s building a network for decentralized applications layer for the internet, Blockstack, has announced the launch of a new universal Dapp (decentralized application) store called App.co. The aggregated list of roughly 138 ecosystem-wide applications that offer utility by harnessing the benefits of decentralized technologies like blockchain, cryptocurrencies, IPFS, Zeronet, and more.\nAlso read: EU Adopts Rules to Reduce Anonymity for Crypto Users App.co: An Aggregated List of Decentralized Applications\nOne thing is for sure the internet is heading more and more towards a decentralized path every day. The team over at Blockstack project aims to make this technological trend and advancement flourish with their own systems and collaborating with other Dapps. This week Blockstack released its Dapp store called App.co which features a bunch of platforms tethered to the decentralized ecosystem.\n“Whether you are downloading Metamask to use an Ethereum dapp, or logging in with a Blockstack ID and granting a dapp access to your encrypted data storage hub, inherent to all these dapps is the true ownership of your data,” explains Blockstack.\nDapps link developers and users directly, without middlemen hosting software or managing user data — We believe it is critical to drive everyday users to dapps that are ready for widespread adoption — That’s why we’re announcing the first ecosystem-wide, universal Dapp store. Currently, Blockstack’s List Has 138 Dapps\nThe Blockstack Dapp store shows a wide variety of applications that do things like decentralized instant messaging, social media, developer tools, games, marketplaces, exchanges, and more. Dapps included in the store are Kyber , Yours , Ethlend , Cryptokitties , Peepeth , Stealthy , Steemit , Openbazaar and many more platforms.\nThere are 138 Dapps on the store at the time of publication and creators can submit their platforms for review to get on the webpage. Decentralized networks used by some of the applications include Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash , Steem, Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) , Matrix, Bittorent, and others. Additionally, in the future, Blockstack hopes the App.co Dapp store will be as decentralized as the apps it hosts. The New York-based company states:\nBlockstack Public Benefit Corporation is curating and maintaining this Dapp store initially, but eventually we plan to include user ratings to rank dapps across the ecosystem — We want to democratize dapp development, and reward developers for great user experiences.\n“Decentralized apps represent the many doors people can walk through to enter the decentralized Internet. Each user may be enticed by different doors, depending on what they’re interested in or what they need fulfilled,” explain the Blockstack founders Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea.\nWhat do you think about the Blockstack Dapp store?

It’s also tough to admit you’re wrong. One researcher may deserve some credit for owning up after his latest Bitcoin forecast failed to pan out. Thomas Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, predicted on May 7 that Bitcoin would rally during Consensus, the cryptocurrency conference this week that drew thousands of enthusiasts (and some Lamborghinis ) to a packed hotel in Midtown Manhattan. More from Bloomberg.com: China Casts Doubt on Report of $200 Billion Trade Deficit Offer Bitcoin didn’t rally. In fact, cryptocurrencies slumped about 10 percent during the past week, Lee admitted in a report to clients Friday. “Given conferences like Consensus are chances for the community to gather in a centralized place and meet constituents new to the community (growth in attendance), it seems natural that the combination of ‘sanity check’ (all is OK and progress is happening) plus ‘new interest’ (incremental attendance) should strengthen the crypto-community’s conviction,” he wrote. “And coupled with growth in incremental constituents, should have aided crypto-currency prices.” Read more: Crypto wealth sinks $45 billion while Bitcoin bros party in NYC So what went wrong? Lee said the crypto industry still needs more clarity from regulators like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as increased adoption by traditional companies. “Crypto still faces significant internal resistance and hurdles within traditional financial institutions,” Lee said. “But it is encouraging, nonetheless, that a large share of incremental attendance are financial institutions.” Fundstrat still expects Bitcoin to be worth $25,000 by the end of this year.

Bulls continue to defend this level but a short-term downtrend channel remains intact. A bounce off this area could lead to a test of the channel top, and an upside break could spur a move to the triangle top.\nBitcoin price continues to hover at the major support zone, and bulls would need more momentum to sustain a bounce.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA remains below the longer-term 200 SMA on the 4-hour time frame to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This signals that the selloff is more likely to continue than to reverse.\nThis could also mean that a break of the triangle support around $7,350 is imminent. The 100 SMA lines up with the top of the short-term descending channel to add to its strength as resistance while the 200 SMA adds another dynamic resistance before the top of the triangle at $9,000.\nRSI is pointing up to signal that bulls could still push higher, though. Stochastic is also turning higher to reflect a return in bullish momentum, which might be enough for a test of the near-term resistance at $8,000. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin and its peers have been on the back foot recently as the lack of positive updates and the liquidation of more bitcoin on Mt. Gox have spurred declines. This time, there is some degree of focus on regulation but developments in the industry could lead to positive sentiment.\nFor one, there’s the mainnet launch for both Tron and EOS that would make them independent of the Ethereum network. Although this probably won’t have a direct influence on bitcoin price, any improvement in investor outlook could still lift altcoins overall.\nBesides, the dollar has the NFP report to contend with and weak results could further dampen tightening expectations. Apart from that, overall risk sentiment in the financial markets, particularly relating to trade talks and political uncertainties, could lead to some volatility.

UnionBank recently demonstrated its cryptocurrency miners at a business conference. That is an interesting development, considering how the world’s leading cryptocurrency is a legal tender in the country. When the biggest bank in The Philippines gets into Bitcoin, an interesting tone is set. Unionbank and Cryptocurrency\nThe Philippines have always been a key region for Bitcoin. It is home to a few remittance services which rely on cryptocurrency. Moreover, the government made it clear Bitcoin can be used for remittance purposes. It is a validation of the world’s leading cryptocurrency being used for real-world use cases. So far, the Philippines is one of the only countries to take this specific step in recent years.\nUnionbank, the biggest bank in the country, recently showcased cryptocurrency miners during a business conference.While that may not seem important, it is another nod of approval toward cryptocurrency. While not a Bitcoin mining unit, it does show the institution is interested in cryptocurrencies. When the CEO of a top bank in the Philippines runs #Bitcoin miners at a business conference, you know we're headed in the right direction 😉 pic.twitter.com/b7dzGMDXVa\n— Miguel Cuneta (@MiguelCuneta) May 18, 2018\nHow this venture will pan out exactly, remains a bit unclear. To this date, the bank has not confirmed it is involved in any cryptocurrency mining operation just yet. Even so, they are quite confident cryptocurrencies here to stay. More and more banks are getting on the cryptocurrency bandwagon these days. Ranging from trading desks to mining operations, things are certainly heading in an interesting direction. Bitcoin and The Philippines\nIt is not the first time Unionbank shows an interest in cryptocurrency or its underpinning technology. Earlier this year, the institution announced a blockchain payment system. This venture is launched together with Visa. Although that feature does not involve cryptocurrencies, it shows its underpinning technology can effectively transform business models in the Philippines.\nAdditionally, the Philippines government introduced an “economic zone” for cryptocurrencies. In this zone, cryptocurrency companies are allowed to operate in a licensed environment. Surprisingly, this venture attracted a lot of attention from international firms. Especially companies from Japan, Malaysia, and Hong Kong are interested in this option. The economic zone accommodates all business models, including exchanges, mining, and initial coin offerings.\nAll of this is in stark contrast with a slight crackdown on Bitcoin users. The Philippine National Police has arrested Bitcoiners before. This was mainly due to allegations regarding running a Ponzi Scheme. Additionally, cloud mining is still somewhat frowned upon in this country. The Bitcoin situation in the Philippines is heading in an interesting direction right now. Unionbank’s recent “endorsement” is another surprising development in this regard.

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

Motherboard’s Daniel Oberhaus used mining equipment (albeit graphics cards, not ASICs) to stay warm during a storm once, and a Redditor posting under the handle “gta3uzi” just took it to another level. In a Tuesday post by gta3uzi on the /r/Bitcoin subreddit, they revealed a system for heating hot water using ASICs so you can make money while you chill in a steamy bath.\n“Imagine a crypto heated swimming pool, or anything else you could heat with the output from a small, medium, or large-scale mining operation,” gta3uzi wrote on Reddit. Some of their suggestions for using the hot water include creating a sauna, heating a home, drying one’s hair, and even cooking a steak sous vide.\nWhen I reached gta3uzi over Reddit, and then over Twitter, he told me that his name is “Lee” and he works in IT in Alabama. Lee used to mine cryptocurrency with graphics cards, he told me in a message, and when he recently rediscovered an old digital wallet containing the proceeds from that endeavour he decided to reinvest in some ASICs. “After realizing how much waste heat is generated by this equipment I decided to try and recycle it in a productive way,” he told me. Screen Shot 2018-05-18 at 10.42.36 AM.jpg 1260x1650 621 KB\nLee’s system—which he set up briefly in January—is “extremely simple,” he told me, and makes use of a water-to-air intercooler like you’d find in a supercharged car. Ambient air is pulled into the system to cool the ASICs, and the heated air is pushed through an intercooler that has water constantly being pumped through it from a source, like a bathtub. The heat is transferred to the water, and voila—computer-heated water suitable for anything you’d normally use hot water for. In fact, Lee told me, it worked a little too well.\n“It was a little too effective if I left it running all day as it produced baths of up to 122F/50C,” he wrote. “Dangerously hot, especially as I have a few pets who could fall in if they somehow gained access to the bathroom. I took the experiment down to preserve the safety of my living space. Safety is an absolute priority to me.”\nLee said that his mining operation made a 10 percent profit after electricity costs before he turned it into a water heater. But after the ASICs eliminated his $80 heating bill in addition to generating new cryptocurrency, Lee estimated that his mine’s profit went from 10 percent to 47 percent. So would he try it again?\n“Absolutely,” Lee wrote. “It is huge fun and I am constantly exploring new applications for this method of heat recycling and ASIC thermal management. My only limitation is that I do not have the space or resources to scale it beyond the small prototypes you see in the photos I provided.” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "daniel oberhaus", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin pub", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "it worked too well - mining & hardware", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T10:44:56.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cd7b5ffe8000620fdf8d224f623ff6cc288a5e86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS4HhWnwxZBU3Q63HVbZhAE0-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cd7b5ffe8000620fdf8d224f623ff6cc288a5e86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS4HhWnwxZBU3Q63HVbZhAE0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nTo get started visit ------> https://btctarget.blogspot.com/2018/04/guide-to-earn-btc-in-2018.html\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can trust us with 100%, we always pay!

In the last 24 hours for example, it is down nine percent adding on to their weekly 13 percent loss. It might have been because of the mixed reaction following the upgrade from 8MB to 32MB happening at a time when the average daily transaction is around 20K at 80kb per block. When Bitcoin Cash shall utilize full capacity and fill 32MB per block we don’t know. Considering competition especially from Bitcoin and Ethereum-the latter plans on sharding, it might take a while before that happens.\nFrom the News\nIs Bitcoin Cash a wonderful product? Absolutely! Will it replace Bitcoin and dominate the crypto world? Well, maybe, who knows! For investors, speculators and traders, waiting on the sidelines and timing good entry positions can be prudent than trading with every slight swing. Yes, they had an upgrade this week but is it convincing enough for merchants and retail users to say switch from say Litecoin and use Bitcoin Cash to transact? Time is everything and right now, sellers are pressing the gas pedal with eyes set at $600.\nWhat we do know for sure is that Bitcoin Cash has new capacity now that we have a 32MB block in place. There will be space for new user cases and yes, just to clarify, majority of the Bitcoin Cash network would be run by small data centers with better connections and which have the ability to carry out network back hauls. In my view, I don’t really think there would be problems of centralization as many people have been made to believe.\nNot everyone can become a full node and forget about your smart phone ever becoming one. The issue of centralization might crop up not because of storage issue or bandwidth limitation but from centralization of hardware via economies of scale. It’s a design weakness and that’s why we have these huge mining pools who are set to get richer with every block size increment. So, will Bitcoin Cash becomes another centralized business in the future? I leave that to you.\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) Technical Analysis Weekly Chart Bitcoin Cash Weekly Chart by Trading View\nIn the weekly chart, Bitcoin Cash prices are basically topping and after week ending May 13 double bar bear reversal pattern, it is likely that prices might dip lower. Notice that last week ended lower despite abnormal volumes suggesting that there were some form of liquidation and rejection of higher highs at resistance. So, unless otherwise, this week will likely end as a bear and in that case we shall continue holding our bear stance as we aim for week ending April 8 lows at around $700.\nDaily Chart Bitcoin Cash Daily Chart by Trading View\nLike the weekly chart, BCH sellers are in charge and for sure, this might continue. As it looks, bears have already broken through the first level of distribution at $1200. From the look of things and basing this on the general trend, swing traders can initiate shorts at current prices and aim for $800, $700 and $600 round numbers.

During the previous three Consensus conferences, bitcoin rallied between 10 and 70 percent but Fundstrat managing partner Thomas Lee was even more bullish about prospects this year: “Already one of the largest crypto conferences in the world, attendance this year is up dramatically and coming at a time when bitcoin/crypto is down YTD. Going by the precedent of the 70 percent rally last year, Lee’s prediction implied a breakout in bitcoin to back above $15,000.Lee, an experienced Wall St analyst of 25 years, has clocked up more airtime than most fund managers on mainstream financial media making definitive claims about the future price of cryptos with specific price and time targets. Meanwhile, former head of JP Morgan’s blockchain project Quorum, Amber Baldet, revealed the details of her new project Clovyr at Consensus. Co-founded with another former lead blockchain developer at JP Morgan, Patrick Nielsen, Clovyr will be a sort of decentralized app store offering businesses and individuals tools to create their own Dapps and other blockchain solutions.Like then, companies are now spending big money and time trying to build their own private blockchains instead of using tried and tested networks, like Bitcoin’s or Ethereum's. Talking to Fortune Magazine, Baldet says companies will ultimately unwind their expensive private blockchain experiments, like they did with their private cloud efforts, and migrate to the public infrastructure already in place. The ETF will use the following criteria to screen the blockchain companies: ideas that streamline business processes; Wall Street “disruptors”; mining focused entities; exchange firms and startups creating a decentralized internet.

Some sources claim it is just fine, whereas others deem is not viable for much longer. Alex De Vries conducted an interesting piece of research, which claims the energy usage by Bitcoin miners will double by late 2018. An interesting study, although one that also misses out on key elements . The Alex De Vries Study\nLooking at how Bitcoin mining evolved, it is normal the energy usage has been on the rise. More people are excited about mining cryptocurrencies. At the same time, the efficiency of mining units has improved vastly. As such, one would expect the energy usage to remain somewhat stable. Alex De Vries claims that will be anything but the case. In his findings, BTC mining will use as much energy as the entire country of The Netherlands.\nHis research also claims how this energy consumption will continue to rise. It may even reach 5% of the world’s energy. On paper, this sounds very problematic, although there are always two sides to a story. There are some key factors which contribute to making Bitcoin mining profitable. The first of all is having access to electricity that is affordable and cheap. For Bitcoin mining purposes, the number of locations is fairly limited in this regard.\nCanada, Iceland, and some regions of the US are places that come to mind in this regard. China also has some “cheaper” electricity rates, but the country is trying to move mining firms out of the region. This factor is seemingly not taken into account by Alex De Vries. Bitcoin mining has become something for corporations rather than individual miners. These companies are also looking to keep their electricity usage in check first and foremost. The Rise of Renewable Energy\nAnother factor Alex De Vries overlooked is the use of renewable energy . All regions mentioned above have a high degree of renewable energy sources. Bitcoin mining operations are tapping into those solutions rather than the traditional power grid. One could even argue the focus on renewable energy makes the entire study by Alex De Vries a trivial issue.\nNo one denies the Bitcoin mining industry will continue to require more electricity. With the mining difficulty rising, more hardware is needed or new units will need to be developed which are even better at this process while keeping the energy consumption low. It is unclear if more robust units can be expected in this regard. Even so, existing hardware combined with renewable energy sources will not affect the world’s energy consumption all that much.\nThere are bigger threats to our environment than Bitcoin mining. It is a slight concern, but most of these studies tend to overlook all of the necessary information. Alex De Vries highlights some interesting aspects, but they are based on partial information and a few assumptions. This research will have no real impact on the popularity of Bitcoin or mining whatsoever.

The recovery from the low of $7,925 could be associated with the oversold conditions shown by the relative strength index (RSI) in the hourly chart.\nHowever, the gains will likely be short-lived as the odds are stacked against the bulls, according to technical charts. Daily chart\nBTC closed well below the 50-day moving average (MA) yesterday, signaling a continuation of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990. Further, BTC has also found acceptance below $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement), a level which acted as a strong support since May 12.\nThe 5-day moving average (MA) and the 10-day MA continues to slope downwards in favor of the bears. The relative strength index (RSI) is also biased bearish (below 50.00 and falling).\nAnd last but not the least, BTC's turn lower from $8,884 (May 14 high) and drop below $8,100 yesterday have established a lower highs and lows pattern (bearish setup).\nSo, it is quite clear that the drop to one-month lows in the last 24 hours has the put bears in the driver's seat. View\nBTC looks set to test the immediate support lined up at $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement). A daily close (as per UTC) below that level would be the final confirmation of bearish trend reversal and will likely be followed by a sell-off $7,000.\nOnly a daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA (currently seen at $8,555) would abort the bearish view and could yield sideways to positive action.\nBitcoin image via Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T16:44:54.053+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9448de061aaa5bb10430359656289db7619a0b66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS5Fzp_og634gmBKNlouzaqU-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9448de061aaa5bb10430359656289db7619a0b66", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS5Fzp_og634gmBKNlouzaqU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInvest your time and effort inviting new users and you will guarantee a high passive income for yourself for a long time.

The aggregated list of roughly 138 ecosystem-wide applications that offer utility by harnessing the benefits of decentralized technologies like blockchain, cryptocurrencies, IPFS, Zeronet, and more.\nAlso read: EU Adopts Rules to Reduce Anonymity for Crypto Users App.co: An Aggregated List of Decentralized Applications\nOne thing is for sure the internet is heading more and more towards a decentralized path every day. The team over at Blockstack project aims to make this technological trend and advancement flourish with their own systems and collaborating with other Dapps. This week Blockstack released its Dapp store called App.co which features a bunch of platforms tethered to the decentralized ecosystem.\n“Whether you are downloading Metamask to use an Ethereum dapp, or logging in with a Blockstack ID and granting a dapp access to your encrypted data storage hub, inherent to all these dapps is the true ownership of your data,” explains Blockstack.\nDapps link developers and users directly, without middlemen hosting software or managing user data — We believe it is critical to drive everyday users to dapps that are ready for widespread adoption — That’s why we’re announcing the first ecosystem-wide, universal Dapp store. Currently, Blockstack’s List Has 138 Dapps\nThe Blockstack Dapp store shows a wide variety of applications that do things like decentralized instant messaging, social media, developer tools, games, marketplaces, exchanges, and more. Dapps included in the store are Kyber , Yours , Ethlend , Cryptokitties , Peepeth , Stealthy , Steemit , Openbazaar and many more platforms.\nThere are 138 Dapps on the store at the time of publication and creators can submit their platforms for review to get on the webpage. Decentralized networks used by some of the applications include Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash , Steem, Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) , Matrix, Bittorent, and others. Additionally, in the future, Blockstack hopes the App.co Dapp store will be as decentralized as the apps it hosts. The New York-based company states:\nBlockstack Public Benefit Corporation is curating and maintaining this Dapp store initially, but eventually we plan to include user ratings to rank dapps across the ecosystem — We want to democratize dapp development, and reward developers for great user experiences.\n“Decentralized apps represent the many doors people can walk through to enter the decentralized Internet. Each user may be enticed by different doors, depending on what they’re interested in or what they need fulfilled,” explain the Blockstack founders Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea.\nWhat do you think about the Blockstack Dapp store?

In many regions of the world, governments appear to be taking a more serious approach to monitoring the activities of the crypto ecosystem. KYC and AML Procedures\nThe EU has been at the forefront of creating a robust regulatory framework for the burgeoning crypto market with a lot of emphasis on Know your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. On May 14, 2018, the EU agreed to a renewed drive at enforcing KYC and AML compliance in the crypto market.\nAccording to the working group, robust KYC and AML regulations makes it difficult for criminal elements to use cryptos as a vehicle for perpetrating crimes or hiding the proceeds from the illicit activities. As a result, different segments of the market including exchange platforms and wallet providers must carry out the same identity verification processes as banks.\nVetting the identity of customers is also essential in the fight against terrorist organizations who might take advantage of anonymous cryptocurrency transactions to fund their nefarious activities. In fact, together with money laundering, terrorist funding is the primary worry of many governments in the crypto sphere. Advertisement advertisement\nThe EU aren’t the only ones calling for stricter KYC and AML regulations. In South Korea, anonymous trading is banned, and financial watchdogs regularly inspect the accounts of traders in search of inconsistencies and irregularities. Japan, via its Financial Services Agency ( FSA ), has also come down hard on exchange platforms concerning KYC. In the United States, exchange platforms are mandated to observe strict KYC guidelines which must be satisfied before a user is allowed to trade. Will Transparency Drive Crypto Adoption?\nThe mostly unregulated and anonymous nature of crypto transactions has made them a likely haven for criminals. Many experts believe that part of the meteoric rise in the prices of cryptocurrencies can be attributed to this aura of anonymity.\nPresently, the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market stands at over $400 billion . Cryptos have been identified as providing a conduit for illegal cash flows and the purchase of prohibited items, especially on the dark web platforms . Thus, commentators like Larry Fink, the chairman of BlackRock has described digital tokens as an “index of money laundering.”\nWith these new EU regulations, much of this anonymity should be eroded, paving the way for a more legitimate feel to transactions. Further to that, law enforcement and regulatory officials will be able to track and monitor crypto payments.\nOn the flip side, illegal cryptocurrency transactions can be moved from online exchange platforms into dark web domains where they become virtually impossible to track. If that happens, at least, legitimate crypto traders can rest assured in the knowledge that their transactions will not be deemed suspicious. Thus, bitcoin and other cryptos can begin to enjoy some semblance of legitimacy which in turn will enhance their adoption in mainstream finance.\nAlready, there has been some response to the EU directive as exchange platforms are upgrading their KYC and AML procedures. BTCManager recently reported that Localbitcoins had introduced strict identity verification guidelines in compliance with the EU directive.

On May 16, economistAlex de Vries published a paper in the peer-reviewed journal Joule outlining how much electricity the process of mining bitcoin currently requires, and how much it may require in the future, given existing trends.\nAccording to Vries' estimates , the bitcoin network currently consumes 2.55 gigawatts (Gw) of energy, and that number could potentially reach 7.67 Gw by the end of 2018. Such an increase would make the energy consumption used by the bitcoin network on par with that of a small country; Ireland, for example, uses 3.1 Gw and Austria uses 8.2 Gw.\nThese massive demands for electricity come from the power required to solve the complex mathematical equations required to mine bitcoin. According to Vries, the bitcoin network processes 200,000 transactions a day. He writes, \"This means that the average electricity consumed per transaction equals at least 300 kWh [kilowatt hours], and could exceed 900 kWh per transaction by the end of 2018.\"\nVries admits that \"trying to measure the electricity consumed by the bitcoin mining machines producing all those hash calculations remains a challenge to date.\" By using the efficiency data on different mining hardware, and the total computational power of the network, Vries was able to determine the lower bound for bitcoin's electricity consumption to be 2.55 Gw.\nAlthough the power requirements to mine bitcoin seem to only be growing, Vries does point out that projects such as the Lighting Network , which is intended to increase the throughput of the bitcoin network in an attempt to quell its thirst for electricity, do seem promising. But for now, \"Bitcoin has a big problem, and it is growing fast.\"\nThis article originally appeared on ETH News, Click here to visit.

Halong Mining have recently also announced their DragonMint T2 ASIC miner (still not on sale) that delivers 17 THS at similar power usage and is also based on 10nm (this is also the company that was apparently first with 10nm ASIC miner). We are yet to see a new generation of Bitcoin miners using 10nm production process from other larger ASIC manufacturers such as Bitmain and Canaan, but we can surely expect them to join the fun soon too… Other Similar Publications: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asic", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T13:00:23.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d33ed26ddec2d98229aa7538b3415d29bc035aa7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jlsEnM39XT9OnG38yRcNTb_mU2qzDeD7gG_7URBAdJAQ6JCsrqxCqKfBVKNrL_Itu", "site_full": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "The Resurrection of ZCash (ZEC): Analysis - The Bitcoin News", "title_full": "The Resurrection of ZCash (ZEC): Analysis - The Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.019, "main_image": "https://thebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Crypto.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d33ed26ddec2d98229aa7538b3415d29bc035aa7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jlsEnM39XT9OnG38yRcNTb_mU2qzDeD7gG_7URBAdJAQ6JCsrqxCqKfBVKNrL_Itu", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Global Coin Report", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Resurrection of ZCash (ZEC): Analysis - The Bitcoin News", "text": "The Resurrection of ZCash (ZEC): Analysis May 18, 2018 133\nThe world of cryptocurrencies can be confusing at times, with several tokens making price movements frequently over the course of one working day. Hence, it is not at all surprising that some projects tend to get resurrected and grow in volume after an extended period of stagnation. The reasons behind this phenomenon can be attributed mostly to positive sentiment regarding the particular token, which is mostly caused by the positive industry news. One such instance was recorded recently, as Zcash (ZEC) started to perform well due to a variety of factors.\nA little About Zcash\nIntroduced in 28 th October 2016, Zcash was the product of the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company and aimed at the extensive use of cryptography to provide enhanced privacy to its users. The Zerocoin protocol was thus introduced to provide a superior degree of privacy to the token, compared to the likes of other privacy-based coins like Monero. As of 15/05/2018, Zcash has amassed a market cap of $1,411,758,583 USD with a total circulating supply of 3,919,831 ZEC tokens.\nThe Reasons for Zcash’s Dramatic Rise\nZcash along with several other cryptocurrencies did not have an encouraging performance over the last few months, with Zcash’s value dropping significantly after the January 08 th , where it recorded a high of $780.84 USD. ZCash continued to perform poorly, dropping to a disastrous high of just $180.77 USD on April 11 th . Currently, though, the situation has improved dramatically, with the recent gains propelling its value to $357.43 USD at the moment. Some major news events are behind this massive price surge, discussed in brief below. Integration By Circle: Zcash’s fortunes started to take a turn for the good on April 30 th , when it was announced that Circle has added ZCash. The investment app launched back in March has already attracted a strong user-base, and would allow Zcash to attract even more users for widespread adoption. Alliance with StawkWare: On 11 th May, the news regarding the alliance with Starkware industries definitely generated a high degree of positive sentiment around the coin. StawkWare Industries is a reputed developer behind the creation of Starks, a cryptographic proof system. Thus, the news of this partnership has a positive effect on Zcash’s reputation, as the team plans for a better and more secure platform for their users. Listing on Gemini Exchange: The Winklevoss Twins owned Gemini exchange, which has been in the spotlight for quite some time now, decided to add Zcash, becoming the project’s first licensed Cryptocurrency exchange. The addition to the Gemini exchange is expected to bring even more success to the Zcash project, as more users start to embrace its high degree of anonymity. Indeed the effects were noticeable shortly after the news broke out, with Zcash’s value rising from $263.03 (High) on May 13 th to $349.56(high) the next day. The daily trading volume also increased dramatically, increasing from $28,585,200 to $293,688,000 overnight.\nFinal Thoughts:\nThe path to success seems clear for Zcash , as evidenced by the 55% growth it experienced on May 14 th . This comes as a relief for many investors after experiencing an initial 20% decline earlier. Zcash has since reached the 0.041 BTC mark, with demand for the project expected to rise in the coming days. It is to be noted that in spite of the price surge; Zcash’s relative strength index still appears neutral at 66. With big exchanges like Bitfinex and Binance already working with Zcash, the bearish sentiment in the market seems not powerful enough to negatively affect its value.

Read full article here .\nIt is perhaps easy to get lost in the constant flurry of activities within the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. From government crackdowns to new crypto launches, the arena can seem like a swirling vortex of entropy. Bitcoin, the number one digital currency remains the focal point of the industry. Here are four reasons why Nakamoto’s creation is destined for even greater heights in the future. The Simplicity of the Bitcoin Blockchain\nBitcoin was the first successful implementation of the distributed ledger framework via a blockchain. Since its creation, there have been many other iterations of the technology to varying degrees of success. While not taking anything away from robust functioning environments like Ethereum and co, the bitcoin blockchain triumphs in its simplicity. Now, with upgrades like SegWit and the Lightning Network, the efficiency of its blockchain can be improved significantly.\nWhile other blockchains delve into more sophisticated and sometimes confusing applications, the Bitcoin blockchain remains quite simple and basic. This simplicity tends to create a mass appeal, especially with the not-so-tech-savvy. Fintech Revolution\nThe number one crypto is at the heart of the emerging fintech revolution. The tech market has established itself as a change-driver in the broader financial market. Bitcoin is beginning to dominate fintech with recent reports showing that Square Cash app is outstripping Paypal’s Venmo regarding growth. Such has been the impact of bitcoin that Square sold $34 million worth of bitcoin in Q1 of 2018.\nIn Africa, bitcoin is at the heart of fintech growth with many remittance and payment platforms offering bitcoin products. As a result, payments have become significantly easier thus lifting a considerable burden from millions of unbanked and underbanked people. Price Resilience\nBitcoin, much like the larger crypto market is volatile. However, in recent times, bitcoin has shown itself resilient to otherwise profound market events. While other cryptos decline in the high double-digit percentages, bitcoin usually only suffers single-digit declines. A recent example is the Upbit investigation which saw bitcoin show some resilience despite the general crypto price decline. With the market maturing, bitcoin will begin to show even fewer reactions to negative market signals. Bitcoin Price for the Last Three Months Adoption by Mainstream Finance\nBitcoin is not without its naysayers like Warren Buffet and Bill Gates . However, there is a noticeable increase in the level of adoption coming from the mainstream finance arena. Nasdaq recently partnered with Gemini to ensure the fidelity of the exchange platform’s bitcoin trading infrastructure. In 2017 both the CME and CBOE launched bitcoin futures trading.\n2018 has seen an influx of bitcoin products geared at increasing the presence of institutional investors in the market. Coinbase and Goldman Sachs recently unveiled products targeted at institutional investors. There are also reports of OTC bitcoin trading decks that will allow significant bitcoin buy and sell orders without negatively impacting the market.\nDo you agree that bitcoin will become even more valuable in the future? Will it remain the number crypto despite growing competition in the market?

Posted by David Ogden on May 17, 2018 - 11:14pm Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis: Heading For $7,000?\nBitcoin continues to slide and may be setting its sights on new last month's lows.\nBitcoin has formed higher lows and lower highs on its 4-hour time frame to create a symmetrical triangle. Price is on its way to the bottom around the $7,000 level.\nThe 100 SMA has crossed below the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the downside. In other words, the selloff could continue from here and support might even break. Note that the chart pattern spans $6,000 to $12,000 so the resulting downtrend could be of the same height.\nRSI is on the move down so bitcoin could follow suit while sellers have the upper hand. Stochastic is also moving down to signal that bearish pressure is in play. If support holds, though, bitcoin could make another move to the top at $9,000 or even attempt to break higher.\nInvestor sentiment appears to have turned sour as bitcoin has been unable to break out of its slump, drawing even more selling pressure. Traders could keep holding out for positive industry updates before reviving their long positions.\nMeanwhile, the dollar has been on a tear for the most part of the week, drawing strength from both fundamentals and risk sentiment. Geopolitical risk has supported the flight to safety while a few upside data points have supported tightening expectations and US bond yields, making the dollar the preferred safe-haven currency.\nFor now, it looks like bitcoin is still reeling from the selling of Mt. Gox units and the ongoing investigation into South Korea’s UPbit. This has revived regulatory concerns and once again put the trust of bitcoin exchanges to question.\nLooking ahead, this slump could go on until there’s another set of developments in the industry. For now, the focus seems to be on institutional investors looking to trade products based on digital assets as firms and exchanges prepare to include these in their offerings.\nBy Rachel Lee On May 18, 2018\nposted by David Ogden Entrepreneur Write a comment...

As noted in our last discussion, a break back into the TR would be considered a period of evaluation and an inability to maintain support within the TR would likely lead to a continuation of the downtrend:\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, Downtrend Continuation\nAfter establishing the Major Sign of Weakness (SOW), the market made a feeble rally and ultimately formed a Last Point of Supply (LPSY) at the bottom of the TR. The LPSY is the point where supply begins to overwhelm the market and long positions begin to close as the demand dries up. Shortly after the rejection of the TR, the market established a new low. However, this low was pushed on fairly low volume. The price action and volume are shaping out a reversal pattern called a Falling Wedge (FW):\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, Falling Wedge\nIf the price manages to break out of this FW it will have a modest $1,000 move upward. The measured move would have us retesting the lower $9,000s once again. However, if we fail to gain enough momentum upward, we would likely test the macro 61% Fibonacci retracement values:\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 3-Day Candles, Macro Fib Retracements\nFigure 4: BTC-USD, 4-Hour Candles, Macro 61% Closer View\nIf we manage to test the 61%, this will again be a zone of evaluation as we wait to see how the market reacts to such strong, macro support. Summary: After a short-lived rally, bitcoin established a LPSY in the $8,800s before continuing to make new lows. Currently, the market is pushing new lows but on diminishing volume. The current price action is forming a Falling Wedge which, if it breaks upwards, would have a price target in the low $9,000s.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Koomey told NBC News :\nFor two decades, people have been eager to overestimate electricity use by computing. My concern is that we simply don’t have adequate data to come to the strong conclusions that he’s coming to.\nDe Vries’ conclusions in question estimate that the Bitcoin network consumes “at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future.” Furthermore, the researcher claims:\nEconomic models tell us that Bitcoin’s electricity consumption will gravitate toward the latter number. A look at Bitcoin miner production estimates suggests that this number could already be reached in 2018.\nHowever, according to experts such as Koomey, de Vries’ and others’ underlying assumptions are problematic — particularly in regards to the manner in which they calculate the value of energy and the price paid for said energy. Explained Koomey:\nThe worry is that those are two numbers that are picked out of the air. There may be some basis for them, but it’s a very unreliable way to do these kinds of calculations, and nobody who does this for a living would do it like that. It’s odd that someone would.\nBitcoin mining is a notoriously private enterprise , with a lot of current and future mining operations taking place in remote areas. As such, it’s not exactly cut and dry how much miners pay for energy, especially considering many operations are set up specifically to reduce said costs — such as mining in caves, energy-rich areas, or low-cost countries.\nDe Vries research also neglects to consider how miners often use special mining equipment crafted specifically to maximize efficiency. Christian Catalini, an assistant professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management who researches cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology , told NBC News:\nThe only people with good data on this are the miners, so you do need that data to understand the electricity consumption. The main challenge is that this gear is scattered across the globe and faces different prices.\nKoomey added:\nThe equipment they’re using is customized to their use. This is not the standard servers that are being sold. These are machines that are assembled using other components. That makes it more difficult. It’s a custom design and those kind of servers are not tracked as well.\nWe should try to get the numbers right […]\nSo, what are the correct numbers? According to Jan Čapek, CEO and co-founder of Braiins Systems and operator of massive Bitcoin mining pool Slush Pool, his company uses a lot less energy than critics imply — and turns a pretty penny in the process.\nNotes Čapek, the total cost, at current difficulty, to mine one bitcoin comes to less than $1937 using recent HW @ 5c/kWh, which is far less energy consumed than most naysayers would like you to believe. Let's have some numbers for todays panel in NYC. I have updated the \"1 BTC mining cost estimates and total network power gists\" with current difficulty. It comes to less than USD 1937 for 1 BTC using some recent HW @ 5c/kWh https://t.co/ykBj4wNPgq\n— Jan Čapek (@janbraiins) May 18, 2018\nIt’s worth noting that even de Vries himself admits the flaws in his research’s design. The researcher stated:\nWe’ve seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I’m hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research.\nDo you think the energy costs associated with global Bitcoin mining are overblown?

Coinbase did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAcquiring a banking license would expand the line of services that Coinbase could offer its customers and would remove the need for it to find a banking partner willing to work with a firm that offers cryptocurrency trading.\nIt would also help Coinbase’s sales pitch to the large institutions it hopes to attract to its platforms. The firm has begun to roll out a wide variety of products for institutional investors — including cryptoasset custody — but many institutions feel more comfortable working with custody partners that have conventional banking licenses.\nThe report also states that cryptocurrency financial services startup ivyKoin met with officials at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in recent weeks, a meeting that ivyKoin President Gary Fan has publicly confirmed.\nHowever, applying for a banking license would also subject these firms to a litany of new regulations, perhaps offsetting the benefits.\n“Most fintechs come to us because they have heard of this thing called a national banking charter that gives them pre-emption across state lines,” the publication cites Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting as saying at an industry meeting last month. “When they come and they speak to us, and they understand what it really takes to be a bank, they kind of glaze over and often leave skid marks leaving the building.”\nAs CCN reported , Coinbase is said to have approached the SEC about becoming a registered broker-dealer. The company is also one of only five firms that have received New York’s BitLicense, which is required to facilitate cryptocurrency trading in the highly-regulated state.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coinbase", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "coinbase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us office of the comptroller of the currency", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T21:57:08.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ab64958fbdbc7946331258f51ae44bfdb052869e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54DQ5EUbvf6jdYFI0uMukEzHzIUtRkz11gz3VgY6N_qxDGJYndv48djUa13GQmElHGLBcr9YofWuFclo0Vdo.TQE-", "site_full": "bitcoinist.com", "site": "bitcoinist.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "4 Reasons Why Bitcoin Will Become More Valuable - Bitcoinist.com", "title_full": "4 Reasons Why Bitcoin Will Become More Valuable - Bitcoinist.com", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.096, "main_image": "http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_1030058917.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ab64958fbdbc7946331258f51ae44bfdb052869e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54DQ5EUbvf6jdYFI0uMukEzHzIUtRkz11gz3VgY6N_qxDGJYndv48djUa13GQmElHGLBcr9YofWuFclo0Vdo.TQE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Osato Avan-Nomayo", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "4 Reasons Why Bitcoin Will Become More Valuable - Bitcoinist.com", "text": "4 Reasons Why Bitcoin Will Become More Valuable Osato Avan-Nomayo · May 18, 2018 · 4:00 am · Views: 8,284 News teaser\nIt is perhaps easy to get lost in the constant flurry of activities within the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. From government crackdowns to new crypto launches, the arena can seem like a swirling vortex of entropy. Bitcoin, the number one digital currency remains the focal point of the industry. Here are four reasons why Nakamoto’s creation is destined for even greater heights in the future. The Simplicity of the Bitcoin Blockchain\nBitcoin was the first successful implementation of the distributed ledger framework via a blockchain. Since its creation, there have been many other iterations of the technology to varying degrees of success. While not taking anything away from robust functioning environments like Ethereum and co, the bitcoin blockchain triumphs in its simplicity. Now, with upgrades like SegWit and the Lightning Network, the efficiency of its blockchain can be improved significantly.\nWhile other blockchains delve into more sophisticated and sometimes confusing applications, the Bitcoin blockchain remains quite simple and basic. This simplicity tends to create a mass appeal, especially with the not-so-tech-savvy. Fintech Revolution\nThe number one crypto is at the heart of the emerging fintech revolution. The tech market has established itself as a change-driver in the broader financial market. Bitcoin is beginning to dominate fintech with recent reports showing that Square Cash app is outstripping Paypal’s Venmo regarding growth. Such has been the impact of bitcoin that Square sold $34 million worth of bitcoin in Q1 of 2018.\nIn Africa, bitcoin is at the heart of fintech growth with many remittance and payment platforms offering bitcoin products. As a result, payments have become significantly easier thus lifting a considerable burden from millions of unbanked and underbanked people. Price Resilience\nBitcoin, much like the larger crypto market is volatile. However, in recent times, bitcoin has shown itself resilient to otherwise profound market events. While other cryptos decline in the high double-digit percentages, bitcoin usually only suffers single-digit declines. A recent example is the Upbit investigation which saw bitcoin show some resilience despite the general crypto price decline. With the market maturing, bitcoin will begin to show even fewer reactions to negative market signals. Bitcoin Price for the Last Three Months Adoption by Mainstream Finance\nBitcoin is not without its naysayers like Warren Buffet and Bill Gates . However, there is a noticeable increase in the level of adoption coming from the mainstream finance arena. Nasdaq recently partnered with Gemini to ensure the fidelity of the exchange platform’s bitcoin trading infrastructure. In 2017 both the CME and CBOE launched bitcoin futures trading.\n2018 has seen an influx of bitcoin products geared at increasing the presence of institutional investors in the market. Coinbase and Goldman Sachs recently unveiled products targeted at institutional investors. There are also reports of OTC bitcoin trading decks that will allow significant bitcoin buy and sell orders without negatively impacting the market.\nDo you agree that bitcoin will become even more valuable in the future? Will it remain the number crypto despite growing competition in the market?

This is requiring deposit addresses for users to change and transactions to old addresses will no longer be credited.\nIf a user accidentally sends funds to an old address, 1Broker will manually credit their deposit upon request. SegWit, among other things, increases the available space for transactions per block and makes second-layer solutions, like the Lightning network, possible.\nBy adding 1Broker to this new wallet infrastructure, transactions between 1Fox and 1Broker will be instant and with virtually no fees. Withdrawals to regular addresses will be charged with a floating transaction fee that is updated every hour depending on the required Bitcoin network fees. This floating fee will be much lower than the previous fixed fee the company used.\nAfter this upgrade, it will also be possible to send Bitcoin transactions to the new alternative address format called Bech32.\nAPI Changes\nWith this update, 1Broker will update its API to version 2.2 that includes the following changes: The user/bitcoin_deposit_address.php method will be removed and replaced by a new user/deposit.php method. A new position/get.php method will return position details for a single position – works for open and closed positions.

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.
