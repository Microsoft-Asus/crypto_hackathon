Illustrative photo\nThe figure was disclosed by Hubery Yuan, the director of Huobi Academy of Blockchain Application at the Blockchain Festival 2018 in HCM City on May 24.\nVietnam is seeing robust development in the finance sector and electronic currencies like Bitcoin is enjoying great opportunities here, Hubery Yuan said. \"Electronic money will gradually replace traditional financial market in many sectors,” he claimed.\nA report from Huobi Pro showed that there are currently over 74,000 registered users in Vietnam and the number of transactions was among top three in Southeast Asian countries. \"Although there are about 12 transaction floors in Vietnam, legal transactions are not stable due to the country's tight policies,\" the report said, adding that the framework for monitoring electronic money is now only being built. Blockchain Festival 2018 is being held by Huobi.Pro, the world’s third largest digital asset exchange, in Ho Chi Minh City from May 24-25. The two-day Blockchain Festival, the first of its kind in Vietnam, featured more than 30 speakers, including keynotes from Le Ngoc Giang from the Vietnamese Ministry of Justice with The Road Ahead for Vietnam’s Blockchain Industry, and David Nguyen, President of Vietnam Chamber of Commerce Singapore and Chairman of Regulus Investment & Capital Holdings. “Vietnam is becoming more and more important on the global blockchain map,” said David Nguyen. “As such, Vietnam needs more help from global leaders in the blockchain industry, like Huobi. We hope that this festival will help increase the awareness level of the public, especially for ICT businesses, students, and universities.” Fuelled by a young population with a high rate of smartphone usage and large batches of IT graduates each year, Vietnam has become one of the fastest growing economies. In Southeast Asia, Vietnam has been dubbed the blockchain country to watch because of the country’s high-tech literacy and engineering resources. According to the World Economic Forum, Vietnam is ranked among the top 10 countries for producing engineering talent.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Revolut currently charges a 1.5% fee for cryptocurrency transactions, and there are currently 100,000 cryptocurrency transactions per day.\nHowever, compared to a traditional cryptocurrency exchange, users can’t send or receive cryptocurrencies from their Revolut account, as they don’t get a Bitcoin address for instance. All they can do is buy tokens in the app. If they want to transfer those tokens somewhere else, they will have to sell them for USD, GBP, etc. and then buy cryptocurrencies on a traditional exchange using their fiat money.\nRecently, the startup also announced a new feature called Vaults.

Co-founder and CEO Michael Cammarata claims Bitcoin has accounted for 5 to 10 percent of online sales since they started accepting the cryptocurrency on May 14. “It’s starting to be a percent of sales more than we expected,” he said in an interview with Cheddar . The all-natural deodorant comes in scents like lavender, tea tree, bergamot, and cedar and will set you back about $9, or 0.0011 BTC, a stick. Schmidt’s is the first company owned by hygiene giant Unilever to accept cryptocurrency as a payment method. Cammarata said: It kind of was actually a last minute surprise. We got a lot of consumers that are like, ‘Can we pay with Bitcoin’? We were playing around with the idea a little bit and our tech team was like, ‘Should we do this should not do it?’ But he admitted they “weren’t that shocked” when the company’s social media savvy consumers asked to pay with Bitcoin. “We have a lot of millennials and highly socially active consumers,” he said. Shopping with Bitcoin You can make purchases on Schmidt’s Natural’s site using Bitpay, a widely available Bitcoin payments provider found on Shopify and in popular mobile games by Zynga. When it comes to e-commerce and online shopping, Bitpay is the most ubiquitous. But the service has had its fair share of controversy. Newegg is a Canada-based online computer and electronics seller that uses Bitpay. The payment provider came under fire last month when a Newegg shopper accused Bitpay of taking more than their share when it comes to network costs. Regardless, Bitcoin is becoming more widespread as a way to shop online. And as Schmidt’s Naturals co-founder said, it will take consumers demanding more payment options to see it more commonly accepted. “Whether it be a scent or a payment method, we are very highly engaged with our consumer,” Cammarata said.

BTG forums seem to have been tracking the hack, going as far back as last week, monitoring the controversial coin’s hashrate, ultimately determining a 51% attack was under way. Also read: Roger Ver and Ryan X. Charles Reveal the Future of Cash Bitcoin Gold Gets $18 Million Haircut “An unknown party with access to very large amounts of hashpower is trying to use ‘51% attacks,’” Bitcoin Gold forum poster Mental Nomad announced a week ago, “to perform ‘double spend’ attacks to steal money from Exchanges. We have been advising all exchanges to increase confirmations and carefully review large deposits.” A founding economic principle of bitcoin was its alleviation of the double spend problem. It was a main stumbling block in the historical race to create a viable cryptographic monetary form – foiling a great many coders along the way. Satoshi Nakamoto solved it through a decentralized, distributed ledger confirmation process (blockchain). Going as far back as its genesis block from early 2009, users can be confident transactions aren’t rebroadcast. Like clockwork, 6 times an hour, blocks are added – copied to nodes within the universal network. The offending wallet, according to the BTG team. One way to achieve double spending is known as a 51% attack. It’s accomplished by bogarting the network’s computing power. With a majority, bad actors can get between the Nakamoto solution and transaction confirmations. By stymieing block completion in the usual manner, all sorts of mischief can arise: blockchain mining rewards redirected, users’ transactions reversed, etc. Not too long after, a double spending attack can commence, acting as the fiat equivalent to counterfeiting. Needless to type, any crypto suffering from such a problem is certain to immediately lose user confidence. Such attacks are interesting for another reason, as Mental Nomad is careful to point out. “There is no risk to typical users or to existing funds being held. The only parties at risk are those currently accepting large payments directly from the attacker. Exchanges are the primary targets,” he assured last week. “It appears that actions on the part of the exchanges have deterred the attacker, for now.” And hitting exchanges tends to elicit little sympathy, at least initially, due to users being insulated. Exchanges are particularly vulnerable because they generally covet large deposits, which only compounds the problem in cases like these. GTNjvCGssb2rbLnDV1xxsHmunQdvXnY2Ft Over period of days, batches of BTG were deposited into exchanges supporting the forked coin, only to be sent back to the depositor’s wallet. The lag between such a transaction and some exchanges’ discovery is sufficient enough to nab tokens, doubling the filthy lucre. Exchanges trading bitcoin gold have responded by upping transaction confirmation filters, but evidently to no avail as the attacker gains ever-more BTG network control. Bitcoin Gold team members seem to have communicated with some exchanges. “Requiring more confirmations greatly increases safety,” the forum details. “Until now, some Exchanges were operating with less than five confirmations required. We have been urging higher limits to prevent such an attack, and urging manual review of large deposits of BTG before clearing the funds for trading.” Indeed, according to BTG, “One of the targeted Exchanges reported that they strongly believe this attacker attempted to hit them with a double-spend of BTC in the past. In their words, ‘we are 100% sure that it is the same person, we found many associations between the accounts.’” The traditional way BTC has been able to thwart double spend attacks. Evidence put forward by the BTG team points to address GTNjvCGssb2rbLnDV1xxsHmunQdvXnY2Ft as the attacker’s wallet; mined coins, according to the forum post reside at GXXjRkdquAkyHeJ6ReW3v4FY3QbgPfugTx. More than 388,201.92404001 BTG were funneled through the wallet, totalling more than $18 million according to Bitcoin Gold Explorer . That a top thirty crypto by market cap can be so easily troubled is a giant of enough problem, but it could also take exchanges down in the process – something the ecosystem is very sensitive to since Mt. Gox. And though, for now, BTG is confident enough to suggest users are not at risk, history shows that can quickly be the case as an exchange freezes withdrawals in an effort to stop hemorrhaging. Bitcoin Gold has been beset by controversies since its birth fork late last year, including a recent dust-up between BCH advocate Craig Wright and BTG founder Jack Liao . To be fair, however, it is not the only blockchain to suffer a 51% attack. Mere days ago, recently Chinese government highly rated coin verge (XVG) was made to heel, again. These pages reported XVG, “On the morning of May 22, Suprvona, one of the largest altcoin mining pools, informed its 19,000 Twitter followers that verge was suffering yet another 51% attack, causing all blocks to be rejected.” Do you think the BTG hack spells doom for the coin?

The major cryptocurrency fell through key supports on Monday amid a report from Bloomberg that suggested the DoJ (Department of Justice) and CFTC were launching a criminal probe into market manipulation tactics in Digital currency with the big boys (Bitcoin, Ethereum), particularly in focus. The focus appears to surround the subject of “spoofing” or faking large orders to deceive the marketplace. This is a particularly concerning thing given that volumes have more than halved over the last few weeks, and if the spoofers have abandoned ship, is that a possible explanation for why it has gone all quiet on the Western Front? For now, it isn’t clear, but as we have discussed in recent reports, the Tether issue returned this week, which means we have had an awful lot of “market manipulation” bad news over the last few days. This is so damaging to the marketplace because it calls into question the integrity of the price, increase the chance of it all going to zero and big investors will get out fast which is possibly what we have seen. BTC/USD currency rate 'in danger' as key support gives way Technical analysis grows more bearish for Bitcoin\nIt is impossible to deny how bad the chart is starting to look again for Bitcoin, and even the most bullish of analysts are having to come to terms with the fact another leg lower is being signalled. Omkar Godbole writing for Coindesk released his daily technical forecast for Bitcoin, and fully anticipates that a test of $7000 is very likely over the coming day,\n“BTC will likely find acceptance below the immediate support seen at $7,188 (78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement seen in the daily chart) and drop to the $7,000 mark in the next 24 hours. By then, the RSI in the hourly and 4-hour chart will likely have dropped below 30.00, indicating oversold conditions, meaning BTC may defend the psychological support level of $7,000.”\nWhile Mr. Godbole cannot entirely rule out a move higher, it would appear that his convictions are much stronger to the downside. With some distance now opening up between the recent low and what is needed to restore bullish momentum, this is hardly surprising as he notes,\n“On the higher side, only a daily close above the 10-day MA, currently seen at $8,111, would abort the bearish view. Only a daily close above $8,644 (May 21 high) would signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change.”\nWorrying times for Bitcoin ahead, and it would appear that until volumes return there may be little to get it out of the bearish funk it is currently in.

Its Otaku Coins are likely to be launched as early as this summer, and unlike many cryptocurrencies, Kodaka does not plan to make the new coins an investment tool with wildly fluctuating values.\nThe coins are expected to be accepted at stores geared toward otaku, such as anime shops.\n“When you think about how cryptocurrencies can spread, I think it won’t be on a countrywide scale. … it will be on more of a communitywide scale,” he said.\nAs opposed to traditional currencies, virtual coins can easily be traded across international borders, helping them become a de facto currency for members of multinational communities.\n“I think it is worthwhile to have an Otaku Coin that anime, manga and game fans can use. There can also be, for instance, a Sake Coin for sake lovers,” Kodaka said.\nThe first batch of about 5 billion Otaku Coins, or 5 percent of the planned 100 billion coins to be issued, is scheduled to be released sometime this summer or fall. Users will be able to get their first coins for free but how many they’ll receive is not yet known.\nEventually, Otaku Coins will be listed on virtual-currency exchanges, which will be the main channel for people to purchase the coins.\nTo avoid roller-coaster highs and lows seen with other cryptocurrencies, the Otaku Coin Preparation Committee, which designed the coin’s blueprint, is working on a system that would keep their volatility low. But details are not ready to be disclosed at this point, said Kodaka, a former banker at Merrill Lynch and chief financial officer at social media firm Gaiax Co.\nExperts in various fields, including accounting, digital money and cybersecurity, are advising the committee to come up with a valid system.\nThe committee will keep 39 percent of the total coins to cover operating costs.\nAfter the committee unveiled their plan earlier this month, it triggered mixed opinions online, with some expressing interest in the new virtual currency and others greeting the news with tepid enthusiasm.\nA major reason why Tokyo Otaku Mode is betting on their coins is the rising expectation of a move toward blockchain, Kodaka said. Blockchain is an underlying technology for cryptocurrencies and an online ledger of virtual-coin transactions.\n“We believe that blockchain will be more commonly used in society. It’s like how the internet has come into our lives,” Kodaka said.\nBlockchain works on a peer-to-peer network that links people’s computers directly without the use of a central server and records each transaction from the beginning. The data can be mutually and simultaneously monitored by individuals called “miners,” which makes falsification effectively impossible.\nThe technology is seen as an important innovation due to its traceability and immunity from data forgery, so many believe it can be applied to various record-keeping tasks in addition to currency transactions, such as voting.\nTaking advantage of blockchain’s technological prowess, Kodaka also wants to launch a voting platform that will allow creators to pitch their project ideas on anime, manga and games.\nThere, Otaku Coins are expected to serve as voting rights, with the number of ballots being equivalent to how many coins a given user has.\nTo prevent large coin holders from becoming too powerful, the number of coins that can be used as votes will likely be capped, said Kodaka.\nThe project that gets the most votes will receive a reward in the form of Otaku Coins from the committee so that the creator can launch their initiative.\n“I really like the concept of running a voting system via blockchain,” Kodaka said, noting that it would realize more secure voting.\n“It would also facilitate content production (in anime, manga and game industries) while making fans feel they are more involved with the process,” he said.\nKodaka said Tokyo Otaku Mode is unlikely to benefit financially from the Otaku Coin experiment with the firm believing that it will help improve its brand.\n“Tokyo Otaku Mode is proposing this whole concept, so I think it’ll help spread our name more widely. Some people may think that our company is ahead of the trend,” said Kodaka. The coin project may eventually lead more people to come to the company’s e-commerce site, he added.\nOne key incentive that could drive people toward Otaku Coins is to make sure the currency can be used at real stores as a payment method. Otherwise, users won’t see tangible value in them, Kodaka noted.\n“A key is to increase the number of stores that accept Otaku Coins,” he said.\nIn the meantime, regulations on cryptocurrencies differ by country. Some nations, including China, are strict about people dealing with cryptocurrencies, so this might hamper Otaku Coins’ prevalence worldwide.\nKodaka agrees that’s a possibility, “But in the mid- to long-term, people will have more understanding (of cryptocurrencies and blockchain).” LATEST BUSINESS STORIES", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=300&pubid=jtimes"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kodaka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naomitsu kodaka", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tokyo otaku mode inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tokyo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T11:37:33.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "564a4535c52b5740e19f977b875b64c7ec9220c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSVWtUDPEV9UBb0S4EWOiKEpoWjVmlxPpkqvahrQq1TNDY51aKmgBTnAybu4anrchiLPJOlAfxQzA", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "15 Bitcoins Demanded by South African Kidnappers", "title_full": "15 Bitcoins Demanded by South African Kidnappers", "published": "2018-05-25T10:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "564a4535c52b5740e19f977b875b64c7ec9220c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSVWtUDPEV9UBb0S4EWOiKEpoWjVmlxPpkqvahrQq1TNDY51aKmgBTnAybu4anrchiLPJOlAfxQzA", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-25T10:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "15 Bitcoins Demanded by South African Kidnappers", "text": "15 Bitcoins Demanded by South African Kidnappers\n15 Bitcoins Demanded by South African Kidnappers EconoTimes Full coverage Google ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T10:53:24.158+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a2f9ba9bef93887cd1cb3d44ddbd6d01429adccd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApu.hVYzrlqKXGv1Rrn4ivnkUuyIQKgyY27mObAXu2.icyvs7SLyYiTHRj_MICGUoq_Y4LOQwTJe0e63sa7b4Y56ldrY00pdElU-", "site_full": "mypr.co.za", "site": "mypr.co.za", "site_section": "http://mypr.co.za/feed/", "site_categories": ["media", "travel", "africa"], "section_title": "MyPR", "title": "Beginners Guide To Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Trading-Part 6", "title_full": "Beginners Guide To Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Trading-Part 6", "published": "2018-05-25T10:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img.youtube.com/vi/YgqF0JIAc1U/0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a2f9ba9bef93887cd1cb3d44ddbd6d01429adccd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApu.hVYzrlqKXGv1Rrn4ivnkUuyIQKgyY27mObAXu2.icyvs7SLyYiTHRj_MICGUoq_Y4LOQwTJe0e63sa7b4Y56ldrY00pdElU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "clydethorburn", "published": "2018-05-25T10:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Beginners Guide To Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Trading-Part 6", "text": "You are here: Home / Banking and Financial Services / Beginners Guide To Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Trading-Part 6 Beginners Guide To Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Trading-Part 6 (MyPR.co.za) By clydethorburn Filed Under: Banking and Financial Services\nIf you want to purchase Bitcoin as an investment and you want to join the BitClub Network Company, so that BitClub can mine Bitcoin and other Crypto Currency on your behalf to grow a stable and increasing investment for you, please join BitClub for free at http://bitclub.network/clydethorburn .

It could give it the boost you have been looking for. Software Upgrades. Over the past few years, there has been a lot of discussion in the Bitcoin community about upgrading the core software functions of Bitcoin. The primary discussion has been around the transaction speed of Bitcoin. If you have ever funded your trading account with Bitcoin or tried to buy anything with Bitcoin, you will understand what I mean. For a digital currency, the transaction time is a little slow. It can take about 30 minutes or more, to do a single transaction. Upgrading this speed has been hotly debated and finally led to the creation of Bitcoin Cash at https://www.bitcoincash.org/. After the split of Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin has taken off to new highs. There will be countless other software changes across all cryptocurrencies, so make sure that you understand the implications of those changes. Public Hype. Just like fake tweets at https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/06/21/fake-tweets-sink-stocks-what-happens-when-scammers.aspx can affect the price of a stock, any type of hype can affect the value of a cryptocurrency. Good or bad. So before you dismiss something as just hype, remember that hype moves markets too. But if you do trade hype, be sure to close your trade out long before the hype has a chance to cool off. Otherwise, it could be a very expensive lesson.\nWallet Improvements. Since you are reading this post, you probably want to start actively trading cryptocurrencies. But there are many other people who are investors and want to buy and hold for the next few years. This is where storage becomes an important part of the cryptocurrency valuation equation. Unlike traditional fiat currency that can be stored in a bank, your trading account, or your mattress at home, cryptocurrencies need to have a compatible wallet (or cold storage solution) to be stored safely. Remember that cryptocurrency is simply software. So the wallet software needs to be able to work with the cryptocurrency software. It’s like trying to use the Windows version of Microsoft Office on a Mac. That simply won’t work. Therefore, if a cryptocurrency doesn’t have a good wallet yet, that will prevent less technical investors from buying the currency. But as soon as one is available, then it makes the currency much more accessible to the masses. …and thus, more valuable. If you find that a cryptocurrency does not have a good wallet solution yet, that could be one signal that it is undervalued. Looking for opportunities to buy, immediately after the launch of the first high-quality wallet, could give you a nice short-term profit. Platform Applications. Some cryptocurrency platforms, like Ethereum, host other applications. These applications, in turn, can have their own currencies or tokens. If one of these DApps at https://www.coindesk.com/7-cool-decentralized-apps-built-ethereum/ or Decentralized Apps does very well, this can have a positive effect on the underlying platform currency.\nThe value of the tokens should theoretically be independent of the value of the platform. However, not everyone understands this and the success of one DApp can drive the price of Ether…at least in the short term. So if you are trading a platform cryptocurrency, watch promising apps on the platform closely. Government Regulation. Finally, government regulation can have a huge effect on the value of a cryptocurrency. One example is in Venezuela, where the police have been arresting Bitcoin miners at https://cointelegraph.com/news/venezuelan-bitcoin-miners-turning-to-ethereum-after-government-crackdown on made-up charges. This has forced miners to go underground or start mining Ether instead. But this could happen in any country. Any decision by the NFA at https://www.tradingheroes.com/nfa-bans-hedging-in-us-forex-accounts/ or SEC could affect the value of certain cryptocurrencies. The SEC has already banned at https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/ia_icorelatedclaims certain Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), due to the potential pump and dump situation that could happen with those coins. Be aware of current trends in government regulation and steer clear of currencies that could get red flagged by government agencies. Conclusion. So that is the Trading Heroes Beginner’s Guide to Trading Cryptocurrencies. I hope that it answered any questions that you may have had about trading currencies like Bitcoin or Ether. There will be more detailed posts on specific currencies and how to do some of the things mentioned above. If you have any more questions or comments, leave them below.

Germany’s Largest Stock Exchange “Deep at Work” With Bitcoin News | May 25, 2018 By: Maricel Custodio\nDeutsche Börse , the operator of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, is considering adding cryptocurrency products to its offerings.\nDeutsche Börse is a marketplace organizer for the trading of shares and other securities. It is also a transaction services provider. It gives companies and investors access to global capital markets. The group’s Frankfurt Stock Exchange is one of the world’s largest trading centers for securities. With a share in turnover of around 90 percent, it is the largest of the German stock exchanges.\nDuring an event hosted by the Association for Financial Markets in Europe on Wednesday, Jeffrey Tessler, CEO of the post-trade services provider owned by Deutsche Börse Clearstream, said the group is examining its options for launching cryptocurrency procducts.\n“Before we move forward with anything like bitcoin, we want to make sure we understand the underlying transaction, which isn’t the easiest thing to do,” Tessler said. “We are deep at work with it.”\nTessler, however, acknowledged that Deutsche Börse is “not at the same stage” as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE), which both launched bitcoin futures trading last year. He said his team will study cryptocurrency volatility and make sure regulators are “in line” before any major moves are made.\nIn March of this year, the Frankfurt-based exchange group partnered with liquidity management company HQLAx to develop a securities lending solution using R3’s Corda blockchain platform.

Bitcoin Cash And XRP Added By UK Mobile Banking App Revolut Announcements , News | May 25, 2018 By: Maricel Custodio\nUK FinTech firm Revolut has added Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ripple’s XRP to its cryptocurrency trading app.\nRevolut is a digital banking alternative that includes a pre-paid debit card (MasterCard), currency exchange, and peer-to-peer payments. The company currently supports spending and ATM withdrawals in 120 currencies and sending in 25 currencies directly from its mobile app. It allows customers to change fiat currency into crypto and trade their existing cryptocurrencies for others.\nRevolut said the decision to include Bitcoin Cash and XRP, in addition to bitcoin, Litecoin and ethereum, was made because they were the “two most popular cryptocurrencies our community wanted” and other major crypto exchanges have yet to support them.\n“We’ve been asking the Revolut community which cryptocurrencies they would like to see next, and the demand for both XRP and Bitcoin Cash has been absolutely overwhelming,” said Vlad Yatsenko, Revolut chief technology officer.\nUsers can now buy, hold, and exchange these cryptocurrencies in any of the 25 fiat currencies supported by the app. The company charges a 1.5 percent markup on “the average exchange price,” which is obtained using live prices from its partner exchanges.\nLast month, Revolut announced that it raised $250 million in its Series C investment round, which gives the company a $1.7 billion post-money valuation. The funding will be used to hire engineers and designers, to launch new features, and to scale the company in the United States, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand this year.

The executive board member of the German company which provides services for derivative markets and equity trading, in an event on Wednesday, talked about adopting cryptocurrency. Currently, there are a lot of financial institutions taking a dip into cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, with benefits like cheaper trade fees and peer to peer network. This is due to the total and obsolete emergence of Bitcoin in people’s lives and economic trades companies are adopting the technology. According to the market report the company has been battling with other derivative companies such as Cboe Global Markets Inc. and CME Group Inc. He believes that there have not been much of regulatory effects from the regional authorities as the market is nascent. The event was held in London which was organized by the Association for Financial Markets in Europe. Jeffrey Tessler during the event says: “Before we move towards the Bitcoin market, we want to make sure we understand the underlying transaction which isn’t the easiest thing to do.” He also said that the company is working with the cryptocurrency. Later in the event, he added that: “We want to understand the volatility and make sure clients are in line and make sure regulators are in line.” Garisson a Redittor says: “Crank up and cramped up banks are the way to be behind the crypto-game. The involvement of institutions is a bad sign as more regulatory standards will be I posed…making it further non-decentralized.” Sara a Redittor says: “I believe that derivative and equities are dropping into the cryptocurrency and blockchain game because of the emergence of this new industry. Goldman has to lead the way for the stock market to follow now everyone is gonna adopt the new technology of crypto. I believe that the ones who reject to evolve will have a major market collapse.” Wesley Willam Cryptocurrency enthusiast tweeted: “Bitcoin is gonna pop like a big bubble as it is observed that the market is not volatile and is falling at the steep rate.

The Search Engine Optimization Company is also partnered with Google and is ranked 1st in Google as “Seo Company”, “Seo Agency” and “Seo Services”. Proseo’s tweet. The company provides professional and presentable services with their experienced Irish Consultants who are aware of their Irish Market. It has a close team of specialists with extensive experience and talents. The company has gained the title of being the 1st SEO Company to accept cryptocurrency as their payment method. They accept the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin [BTC] and Neo [NEO] for now. However, they are currently investigating whether the company can make payments with other cryptocurrencies as well. Since ProSeo keeps a close watch of new technological developments in the world, it’s logical for them to apply to the world of digital payment of transactions. SeaOfDeadFaces, a Reddit user commented: “My first thought as well. I can imagine that only being able to charge people in increments of NEO means customers are either getting a great deal or shafted, depending on how the company rounds.” stuartwitherspoon said: “That’s great but wouldn’t GAS be the better option? I don’t see how this is practical with neo being non-divisible.” l4ur1ds said: “I’d love to accept GAS in my neo merch store. Does anybody know how I could accomplish that? The major payment gateways only accept BTC or ETH.” They reported that Bitcoin and Neo are extremely safe and reliable. They believe that Bitcoin is an investment opportunity in view of the fact of its rapidly increasing value. It is unfortunate that there is a finite number of companies in the Netherlands who accepts cryptocurrency as a form of payment. Proseo offers a simple method of transaction. The amount of payment by the customer is calculated on the basis of the rate of the largest exchange. Once they complete this, Proseo’s wallet address is sent to the customer to make the payment.

After three consecutive sell-offs within a 24-hour period, the price of bitcoin dropped from $7,900 to $7,250, eventually stabilizing at $7,400.\nBear Market\nThe cryptocurrency sector is in a short-term bear cycle. In a highly volatile period like this, positive developments and events that would otherwise lead to a significant surge in the valuation of the cryptocurrency market often do not affect the market in a major way.\nAs such, in spite of the entrance of financial institutions like the New York Stock Exchange, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan, the cryptocurrency market has continued to decline.\nBased on the price trend of BTC over the past two months, it is possible that the correction continues to the higher end of the $6,000 region, considering the overly strong downward trend of BTC and other major cryptocurrencies in the global market.\nThroughout its recent history, over the past 12 months, bitcoin recorded three major drops. As seen in the 1-day price chart of BTC below, all three correction bounced back on a similar support level at $6,600. When the bitcoin price dropped from $20,000 to the $6,000 region, the bitcoin price rebounded to $12,000 after securing the $6,600 support level.\nA similar trend occurred when the price of BTC dropped from $11,000 to $6,400 and so on.

It could give it the boost you have been looking for. Software Upgrades. Over the past few years, there has been a lot of discussion in the Bitcoin community about upgrading the core software functions of Bitcoin. The primary discussion has been around the transaction speed of Bitcoin. If you have ever funded your trading account with Bitcoin or tried to buy anything with Bitcoin, you will understand what I mean. For a digital currency, the transaction time is a little slow. It can take about 30 minutes or more, to do a single transaction. Upgrading this speed has been hotly debated and finally led to the creation of Bitcoin Cash at https://www.bitcoincash.org/ . After the split of Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin has taken off to new highs. There will be countless other software changes across all cryptocurrencies, so make sure that you understand the implications of those changes. Public Hype. Just like fake tweets at https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/06/21/fake-tweets-sink-stocks-what-happens-when-scammers.aspx can affect the price of a stock, any type of hype can affect the value of a cryptocurrency. Good or bad. So before you dismiss something as just hype, remember that hype moves markets too. But if you do trade hype, be sure to close your trade out long before the hype has a chance to cool off. Otherwise, it could be a very expensive lesson.\nWallet Improvements. Since you are reading this post, you probably want to start actively trading cryptocurrencies. But there are many other people who are investors and want to buy and hold for the next few years. This is where storage becomes an important part of the cryptocurrency valuation equation. Unlike traditional fiat currency that can be stored in a bank, your trading account, or your mattress at home, cryptocurrencies need to have a compatible wallet (or cold storage solution) to be stored safely. Remember that cryptocurrency is simply software. So the wallet software needs to be able to work with the cryptocurrency software. It’s like trying to use the Windows version of Microsoft Office on a Mac. That simply won’t work. Therefore, if a cryptocurrency doesn’t have a good wallet yet, that will prevent less technical investors from buying the currency. But as soon as one is available, then it makes the currency much more accessible to the masses. …and thus, more valuable. If you find that a cryptocurrency does not have a good wallet solution yet, that could be one signal that it is undervalued. Looking for opportunities to buy, immediately after the launch of the first high-quality wallet, could give you a nice short-term profit. Platform Applications. Some cryptocurrency platforms, like Ethereum, host other applications. These applications, in turn, can have their own currencies or tokens. If one of these DApps at https://www.coindesk.com/7-cool-decentralized-apps-built-ethereum/ or Decentralized Apps does very well, this can have a positive effect on the underlying platform currency.\nThe value of the tokens should theoretically be independent of the value of the platform. However, not everyone understands this and the success of one DApp can drive the price of Ether…at least in the short term. So if you are trading a platform cryptocurrency, watch promising apps on the platform closely. Government Regulation. Finally, government regulation can have a huge effect on the value of a cryptocurrency. One example is in Venezuela, where the police have been arresting Bitcoin miners at https://cointelegraph.com/news/venezuelan-bitcoin-miners-turning-to-ethereum-after-government-crackdown on made-up charges. This has forced miners to go underground or start mining Ether instead. But this could happen in any country. Any decision by the NFA at https://www.tradingheroes.com/nfa-bans-hedging-in-us-forex-accounts/ or SEC could affect the value of certain cryptocurrencies. The SEC has already banned at https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/ia_icorelatedclaims certain Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), due to the potential pump and dump situation that could happen with those coins. Be aware of current trends in government regulation and steer clear of currencies that could get red flagged by government agencies. Conclusion. So that is the Trading Heroes Beginner’s Guide to Trading Cryptocurrencies. I hope that it answered any questions that you may have had about trading currencies like Bitcoin or Ether. There will be more detailed posts on specific currencies and how to do some of the things mentioned above. If you have any more questions or comments, leave them below.

Transactions involving parties outside India would be liable for integrated GST (IGST), and would be considered an import or export of goods.\nMeanwhile, cryptocurrency transactions made for reasons such as “supply, transfer, storage and accounting” would be considered services, as would crypto mining, Bloomberg says. However, cryptocurrency exchanges would have to pay GST on commission under the proposal, while foreign exchanges would be liable for IGST.\nThe sources further said that, although no decision has been made so far, the government could levy the new tax regime as soon as July 1. It may, though, have to wait as the government decides if and how to regulate the technology.\nIndia’s tax department has in recent months been cracking down on tax avoidance by crypto traders. It issued notices to around 100,000 traders and investors in February after surveys of exchanges found that .5 billion in cryptocurrency transactions may have been performed by citizens over the previous 17 months.

The duo met at the economic forum in St Petersburg.\n“Russian businessmen are willing to invest large sums in our economy and create new businesses and jobs. To that end, however, entrepreneurs need to create an enabling environment,” Dodon wrote on his Facebook page.\nBut what has most interested both the Moldovan and Russian media about this meeting is Chaika’s interest in investing in “mining farms” to produce the cryptocurrency Bitcoin in the breakaway region of Transnistria.\nMining farms are hardware that help create cryptocurrency by using the computing power of PC systems. This requires a lot of electrical energy, while Transnistria provides cheap prices using natural gas from Russia’s Gazprom to produce electricity.\nChaika visited Moldova in September 2017 for talks with Dodon. The Moldovan President then wrote on Facebook about the prospects for business development with Russian investors.\nImmediately after the meeting, Chaika went to Tiraspol to meet the Transnistrian leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky.\nIn December 2017, Chaika then signed an agreement on behalf of the business association “Delovaya Rossiya” [Russian business] with the Transnistrian authorities to secure an easy pass for Transnistrian goods to the Russian markets.\nSince 2013, Moldova has been under a Russian embargo for exports of foods and wine, but many companies from the pro-Russian breakaway region of Transnistria and the autonomous region of Gagauzia in Moldova are exempted from the rule.\nAfter this meeting, in January 2018, Transnistria’s assembly quickly adopted a law exempting Russian investors from taxes. They also benefit from the region’s special electricity prices.\nChaika then told the Russian daily Kommersant that he wanted to move on with the bitcoin plans.\n“Now there are the prerequisites to move on,” he told the paper.\n“We agreed with the head of the Tiraspol executive that after the law came into force, the authorities would provide us with the infrastructure for the project. We will expect their proposals regarding the locations for the creation of mining farms – the ball is in their court,” he said.\nEver since the war between Moldova and Tiraspol 26 years ago created the breakaway region on the left bank of Dniester river, Gazprom has charged Moldova for the gas that the national energy company Moldovagaz flows into this territory.\nMoldovagaz is owned 51 per cent by Gazprom and 49 per cent by the Moldovan Minister of Economy.\nMeanwhile, Dodon also noted on Thursday that he had talked to Chaika about organising a Moldovan-Russian business forum in September in Chisinau, before the campaign for the parliamentary elections starts.\nOn May 14, Dodon Moldova’s accession to observer status in the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union, although both the pro-EU government and most experts doubt this will being Moldova much benefit as it now exports most of its goods to Europe. IAEA Says Iran Is In Compliance With Nuclear Deal → Balkan Insight The Balkan Insight (fornerkt the Balkin Investigative Reporting Network, BIRN) is a close group of editors and trainers that enables journalists in the region to produce in-depth analytical and investigative journalism on complex political, economic and social themes. BIRN emerged from the Balkan programme of the Institute for War & Peace Reporting, IWPR, in 2005. The original IWPR Balkans team was mandated to localise that programme and make it sustainable, in light of changing realities in the region and the maturity of the IWPR intervention. Since then, its work in publishing, media training and public debate activities has become synonymous with quality, reliability and impartiality. A fully-independent and local network, it is now developing as an efficient and self-sustainable regional institution to enhance the capacity for journalism that pushes for public debate on European-oriented political and economic reform.

Speaking in an interview with Bloomberg , Novogratz — the founder of $250 million cryptocurrency merchant bank Galaxy Digital — said that this increased oversight will help weed out bad actors from the nascent ecosystem. “Weeding out the bad actors is a good thing, not a bad thing for the health of the market,” Novogratz said. “Plenty of exchanges have these inflated volume numbers to create some sense of excitement around coins.” As CCN reported , the DOJ is scrutinizing whether cryptocurrency traders and other market actors have engaged in illegal activities to manipulate the bitcoin price, as well as the value of other prominent cryptocurrencies. Novogratz’s optimistic comments on the probe are not unique among Wall Street’s cryptocurrency bulls. Cameron Winklevoss, who co-founded cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, told the publication that the company welcomes “any inquiry that serves to foster rules-based marketplaces and deter bad actors.” Gemini, incidentally, recently struck a deal with Nasdaq to use the stock exchange operator’s surveillance technology to flag unusual trading patterns in real time.

Fundstrat Global co-founder Thomas Lee is standing firm on his outlook for the bitcoin price to reach USD 25,000 by year-end despite the fact that the leading cryptocurrency has just revisited April lows and slumped to the USD 7,500 threshold. The market drop is serving as an indication that “bitcoin is underappreciated”, Lee said on CNBC , adding that’s why Fundstrat likes it at USD 8,000. He reiterated his top-10 day theory, in which historically all of bitcoin’s annual gains are achieved on the best 10 trading days of the year. Lee reminds investors that “bitcoin doesn’t have to go up in a diagonal line.” Even though the broader cryptocurrency market didn’t rally during the Consensus summit last week, it was a clear demonstration of the strong interest in the blockchain, as evidenced by the thousands of people who showed up, which Lee notes is anecdotal evidence that the market is resonating. “The notion of blockchain as a way to solve trust in the digital world has gained a lot of traction, especially out of consensus. And what invsetors aren’t conectinng is that you can’t necessarily just say ‘I believe in the blockchain.’ Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are essential to how blockchains operate in the security,” said Lee on CNBC . Meanwhile, reports suggest there is a talent shortage of blockchain developers given the robust demand stemming not only from startups but also global corporations looking to integrate the public ledger. For example, Google, which recently extended a job offer to Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin. Institutional Capital to Power Bitcoin Rally Lee acknowledges that bitcoin could be a “scary trade” for investors, given that it has shed more than half its value from its December 2017 highs and that holding at USD 8,000 — which is at-cost for bitcoin mining — could feel “miserable.” What investors should remember, however, is that the market rally is contingent on a couple of milestones being reached in the market, including institutional capital coming off the sidelines and regulation taking shape. “Institutional investors have gained a lot of interest and they haven’t really come into crypto yet because there’s still some regulatory uncertainty.

The cryptocurrency has been shaking up the markets and experienced soaring highs towards the end of 2017. Since then, things have calmed down on the Bitcoin front, but the story is far from over. Proponents of the cryptocurrency see it as the dawn of a new age of finance and money. A decentralised currency that’s powered by the people. That could change everything. Others think it’s simply another stock market bubble and approach it with un-optimistic caution. There’s a lot of jargon and some complicated ideas to get your head around so Cartwright King have put together this short, no-nonsense guide to explain some of the key concepts and premises. What is a Bitcoin? Bitcoin, also known as BTC, is what’s known as a cryptocurrency. You won’t find any physical Bitcoins as they exist only in pieces of encrypted computer code. The concept of Bitcoin isn’t hard to understand, it has a monetary value with which you can purchase and sell things. The only difference is that the currency is maintained and created by its users, rather than a central bank. This is because Bitcoin uses ‘blockchain’ technology. Essentially, Bitcoin transactions form a ‘block’ and users need to verify these transactions to add the block to the currency’s digital ledger. In the very beginning, Bitcoins were distributed for free and then maintained through a process called Bitcoin ‘mining’, which we will talk about a bit further on. How Do I Buy Bitcoin? You can buy Bitcoins by heading to a Bitcoin exchange. You are able to acquire the cryptocurrency with your pre-existing money, whether that’s dollars, pounds, euros etc. Bitstamp and Coinbase are the two largest exchanges. Be warned, one bitcoin costs upwards of several thousand pounds. You don’t have to buy them whole. The smallest amount of Bitcoin you can buy is 0. 1 BTC, otherwise known as a Satoshi. You then store your Bitcoins in a virtual wallet which is unique to you. As always, keep your wallet details safe and secure. How Do I Spend Bitcoins? Spending Bitcoin is just as easy as using your bank card for an online transaction. In the murky, early days of Bitcoin, most of its use was on the dark web. The dark web is a shadowy underworld of the internet where people can buy nefarious goods and services easily through websites set up in much the same fashion as eBay and Amazon. Trying to track transactions that use Bitcoin was, in the beginning, nigh on impossible. Now, since exploding onto the stock market, many retailers accept Bitcoin including big names like Etsy, Wordpress and Amazon. What is Bitcoin Mining? So, how does one ‘mine’ Bitcoin? The term ‘mine’ was attached as it does sum up essentially what you’re doing. But in real terms, it’s a reward for devoting computing power to the currency as that’s what keeps it alive. Let’s break down the process of Bitcoin mining into steps: Someone initiates a Bitcoin transaction. This transaction, and others, get put into a ‘block’. This will eventually form part of the ‘blockchain’. The Bitcoin network is notified of the new block. The network can then approve the transactions if they look valid and legitimate. A large piece of code from the previous block is inserted in the new block. This is known as a ‘hash algorithm’. It’s essentially a puzzle. Miners are then given the opportunity to solve the algorithm. The first to do so is rewarded with brand new bitcoins. The block is added to the blockchain and the money gets processed. Obviously, it’s far more technically advanced than that, but that’s essentially how the mining process works. Anyone can be a miner, you just need to have a good amount of computing power to compete. That process may sound long but all of that is usually done in a matter of seconds. What’s Next for Bitcoin? Bitcoin started life in the shadowy world of the dark web because of its secretive nature. It took a while to generate traction and whilst it was so closely associated to crime, its growth was stunted. It has grown from strength to strength since then. Authorities have got better at tracking people who use it for illegal purposes and its blockchain technology is now being mulled over by major banks, companies and more. The price of Bitcoin has seen a slump in price in recent months but still poses many questions about the future of finance. Major retailers are accepting it and we could yet see another surge in the cryptocurrency.

If you got all of them, congratulations – I hope your obsession with cryptocurrency isn’t damaging your social life. Otherwise, you’re probably wondering why there are so many cryptocurrencies that call themselves “Bitcoin Something,” and there are several answers. They’re forks\n“Forking” software means creating a new software project using the code from an existing one. In cryptocurrency these forks are quite popular because: coding blockchains is hard If you hold the forked cryptocurrency, you often get an equivalent amount of the new cryptocurrency, since the ledger has been copied over as well as the base code.\nSome Bitcoin forks, like Litecoin and Dogecoin, decided to rebrand themselves, but many have elected to advertise their Bitcoin roots. They’re free-riding on Bitcoin’s reputation\nBitcoin is a household name, while knowledge of many other blockchain projects is limited to the crypto-curious. Using the name, then, provides an instant (if sometimes undeserved) credibility boost to the new coin. This isn’t an automatic red flag, though. Some Bitcoin clones really are legitimate efforts to improve on the original. Some of them are scams\nBecause of the free reputation points, the Bitcoin label is popular for scam-coins. These forks pretty much only exist so the creators can grab some money. Probably the best-known of these was Bitcoin Platinum — a coin designed by a South Korean teenager trying to profit off the Bitcoin market. Hopefully he at least got an A in computer science. The Top 10\nThere are dozens of forks out there, and not all of them explicitly include the Bitcoin name, so this list is not comprehensive. The coins listed here are in order of their current (May 2018) position on CoinMarketCap, which lists cryptocurrencies by the total value of all their coins. 1. Bitcoin (BTC)\nThe original, created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. 2. Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\nA legitimate, active fork of Bitcoin, created in an attempt to fix the slow speeds and high transaction fees that Bitcoin is prone to when its network is under strain. 3. Bitcoin Gold (BTG)\nThough many have eyed this cryptocurrency with suspicion, it’s managed to get itself into the ranks of the top-valued coins. It was designed to make Bitcoin more decentralized by making mining easier for individuals. 4. Bitcoin Diamond (BTD)\nThough the name sounds like a Pokemon game or something you’ll have to sell a lot of dubious health supplements to get, it is, in fact, a cryptocurrency. While it is marketed as a more private alternative to traditional Bitcoin, it was initially labeled a scam and hasn’t lost that vibe entirely. 5. Bitcoin Private (BTCP)\nThough it took the Bitcoin name, Bitcoin Private is also derived from another cryptocurrency called Zcash, which focuses on private transactions. It’s legitimate, but in the words of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, “Why not just use Zcash?” 6. BitcoinDark (BTCD)\nThough its name comes off as something you’d use to buy less-than-legal goods and services on a dark net market, BitcoinDark’s goal is actually “financial inclusion for everyone.” It still holds some value, but there’s very little activity around it, as it seems to have been somewhat absorbed by a larger project called “Komodo.” 7. Bitcoin Atom (BCA)\nAtom is one of the few Bitcoin forks to add value and get a generally positive reception. It offers “atomic swap” capabilities, meaning it allows you to exchange different assets (like other cryptocurrencies) without going through a centralized exchange. That translates to, among other things, cheaper transactions. 8. Bitcoin Green (BITG)\nBitcoin uses a lot of electricity, especially for mining. Bitcoin Green aims to change that by using a different algorithm that is much more energy-efficient, and they seem serious about it. 9. Bitcoin Plus (XBC)\nIt says it hides your IP address using Tor, but opinion is divided on this coin. Either way, there’s not much information out there on it, so use caution – don’t end up with Bitcoin minus . 10. BitcoinZ (BTCZ)\nNo, not a cryptocurrency for zombies – though there will probably be one eventually. BitcoinZ is another “Bitcoin + Zcash” meld, so it’s privacy-focused, with the added goal of being as decentralized as possible. The rest\nAs of May 2018, there are twenty-four coins on CoinMarketCap with “Bitcoin” in their name.

A bounce could take it back up to the resistance around $9,000 while a break lower could lead to a test of the next support at $6,500. Technical indicators are showing mixed signals, so the move could mostly depend on market catalysts.\nBitcoin price has sold off to the very bottom of its symmetrical triangle formation, still pending a bounce or a break.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is still to the downside. This suggests that a breakdown is more likely to happen than a bounce.\nThe gap between the moving averages is also widening to show accelerating bearish momentum. Also, price is below the 100 SMA dynamic inflection point to reflect continued selling pressure.\nRSI is heading south to show that sellers have the upper hand, but the oscillator is already dipping into oversold territory to signal exhaustion. Turning higher could draw buyers back in and lead to a bounce back to the resistance. Similarly, stochastic is indicating oversold conditions but has yet to turn higher to signal a return in bullish pressure.\nMarket Factors\nRegulatory fears are being blamed for the recent leg lower in bitcoin price, although this could prove positive for the industry in the longer run. The US Department of Justice is reportedly conducting a criminal probe into price manipulation practices involving cryptocurrencies.\nIt’s worth noting that the dollar has been on weaker footing following the FOMC minutes release and the recent announcements related to North Korea. Trump has cancelled his meeting with Kim Jong-Un for next month, reviving geopolitical tensions but weighing on the US currency. However, bitcoin price has been unable to take advantage of this as it also seems to have been dragged lower by risk sentiment.\nAuthor SARAH JENN | MAY 25, 2018 | 4:28 AM\n bitclub network bitcoin price Post navigation Hello, my name is Alan Zibluk.
