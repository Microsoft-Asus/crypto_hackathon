However, he admitted that at the moment, the company was not ready to launch such an offering\n“Before we move forward with anything like Bitcoin we want to make sure we understand the underlying transaction which isn’t the easiest thing to do,” Tessler said on Wednesday at an industry event in London, organised by Association for Financial Markets in Europe. “We want to understand the volatility and make sure clients are in line and make sure regulators are in line,” he added, as quoted by Bloomberg.\nIn December, US derivative marketplace operators Cboe Global Markets and CME Group launched Bitcoin futures contracts. These moves by Deutsche’s US rivals prompted a very positive reaction within the crypto community and contributed to Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally in December. So far, major European exchanges haven’t been able to follow suit, as they are mindful of regional authorities’ cautious approach to regulating the nascent market, Bloomberg notes. Tessler acknowledged on Wednesday that Deutsche Boerse was “not at the same stage” as CME.\nThis isn’t the first time the German company, which owns the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, has indicated that it has interest in tapping into the blockchain space. In late March Deutsche announced a plan to develop a blockchain-based solution for securities lending, in partnership with financial management firm HQLAX and blockchain start-up R3. The companes announced that the solution would be powered by R3’s Corda blockchain platform, while Deutsche’s Eurex Repo platform would provide the trading layer for the system. The German company will also assume a lead role in the custody agnostic, post-trade processing layer, “designed to interoperate with multiple collateral agents and custodians”.", "highlightText": "",

However, the payments suddenly stopped.”\nLocal technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than $50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global.\n“This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they’ve lost money,” police investigator Yolisa Matakata said.\nThe investigation follows a case this week where kidnappers demanded a ransom in bitcoin of nearly $120,000 to release a South African teenage boy.\nOn Thursday South Africa’s central bank said it was in the process of determining whether cryptocurrencies complied with its financial surveillance and exchange control regulations.

May 25, 2018, 11:06 am EDT May 25, 2018 Where Will Bitcoin Be in Another 20 to 30 Years? It's still stirring the pot, but sooner rather than later bitcoin's flaws will become clear http://bit.ly/2IQTYwI\nBitcoin. Just say the word to 10 different people, and you’ll get 10 different responses ranging from elation to derision. Though nobody denies it exists, the world is relatively well split on the merits of its existence. Half think it is the future, while the other thinks it has no future.\nTo its credit, so far, bitcoin and its peers like Ethereum, Lightcoin and a whole slew of other cryptocurrencies you haven’t heard of have survived. They’ve dished out painful degrees of volatility, but they’ve survived.\nThe long haul can and likely will be a different story, however. Within the next two to three decades, an ugly reality will come home to roost. What Is Money?\nThat’s the crux of the debate anyway. Will blockchain-based bitcoin or one of its peers supplant fiat (government-managed) currency once the masses decide a truly free-market system is superior? Or, will leaving the world’s monetary system up to a panic-susceptible crowd open the door to far too much volatility to make bitcoin a consistently useful means of storing and conveying value?\nThe experts, and amateurs, are of mixed opinions.\nAny meaningful discussion of the matter — and this is hardly the first time the debate’s been laid out — can and should begin with the definition of money.\nA currency must first have (at least) measurable degrees of durability, scarcity, divisibility, cognizability and usability.\nAt first glance bitcoin appears to bring all five core components of “money” to the table. Take a closer look though, and its fulfillment of a couple of those criteria become a little wobbly. Chief among those shortcomings is scarcity, though not for the reason one might think. Unlimited Supply of Bitcoin\nYes, there is a finite number of bitcoins that will ever be mined. Of the 21 million bitcoins that will ever be mined , about 80% of them have been found are now in circulation. The ones that have yet to be discovered will be, sooner or later, and that’s it. The limited number of them means only supply and demand will dictate its future value.\nThere’s a looming problem with the idea though. That is, there’s no cap on the number of other cryptocurrencies that can be created.\nNot so with fiat currencies. Though a government has the right to print more money, it generally practices restraint in doing so, since rampant money-printing devalues that currency and can spur inflation. And, anyone who wants to own another country’s currency must trade existing currency. Globally, for better or worse, the amount of money that can be held at any given time is finite, securing at least some semblance of value. Compare Brokers\nUnregulated cryptocurrencies have no creation ceiling, and their creators have every reason to make them as long as buyers are willing to exchange — and this is telling in itself — fiat currency for them. For bitcoin to “work” as a true global currency, there can be no other choices of cryptocurrency. Usability of Bitcoin\nYes, some businesses now accept bitcoin as a form of payment for products purchased or services rendered. Take a closer look though. Despite bitcoin’s nine-year existence, most organizations still want to be paid in fiat currency .\nThere’s a reason. That reason is (touching on elements of the other characteristics of money), cryptocurrencies are far too volatile to feasibly use as a primary means of doing business.\nContrary to popular belief, this won’t change if and when the supply/demand dynamic grows for bitcoin. If anything, volatility will worsen. How’s that? While most governments can and sometimes do it poorly, the value of fiat currency is “throttled” by a central bank with an agenda of stability in mind. The only thing determining the value of bitcoin are buyers and sellers.\nIn some regards that’s as it should be. But, as was noted, a crowd can turn into a mob in the right circumstances, and pull the rug out from underneath a digital currency’s value before they even realize it’s happened.\nSaid in simpler terms, a handful of organizations will accept bitcoin now. That’s apt to change the minute bitcoin suffers a nasty crash that nobody has a willingness to fend off. Bottom Line for Bitcoin\nSo why, pray tell, has bitcoin survived as long as it has if it’s flawed as described above?\nThe simple — even if insulting — answer is not enough people want to believe the premise is flawed. As long as fans and followers of the movement support it, there’s a “market” for it.\nJust bear in mind that bitcoin, or any digital currency for that matter, has never been truly tested. It’s not been tested in a courtroom that acknowledges it as an alternatives means of compensation of plaintiffs. It’s not been tested in the marketplace when a rival cryptocurrency decides it wants to take a shot at the top spot. It’s not been tested as a means of transacting business outside the purview of government regulators … in particular, the IRS. And it’s not even been tested in a court of meaningful public opinion after a crash.\nThe U.S. dollar, conversely, has repeatedly survived such tests.\nAt least one of those tests will materialize within the next 20 to 30 years, exposing the digital currency’s inherent flaws. The bigger it gets, the more likely those damning tests become. That’s when bitcoin starts to become a fading memory of things that didn’t work quite as initially hoped.\nOr, in terms even a 6-year-old can understand, if it seems too good be true, it probably isn’t.\nAs of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Now you need to find a wallet that’s secure enough to store your assets. Knowing what wallet to choose from is an important step in becoming a Core Bitcoin User.\nSince you’re investing your money into BTC, this is a serious matter that cannot be overlooked. There are a multitude of wallets out there whose features can help you get started on your investing journey. In this guide, we show you the safest bitcoin wallet available to help you get onboard. Keep Key\nKeep Key is an interesting company that has a hardware wallet with an interesting design. KeepKey has bits of Trezor’s framework and code, so the main difference between the two is their material.\nAlso, KeepKey has the appearance of a premium wallet and but its more susceptible to drops and might be heavier than other wallets. It has a simple client where users can work with its UI. Trezor – Hardware Wallet\nTrezor is the main mover within the crypto industry and has set the standard for crypto security. And they have a reputation for offering high-quality security, protecting the user from physical as well as virtual theft.\nIf your PC suffers a malware attack, rest assured, your private keys will stay secure with Trezor. Because of this, Trezor is more of a safety vault than a wallet. MyEtherWallet – Paper Wallet\nMost crypto users tend to use a paper wallet for the enhanced safety and because it’s cheaper than hardware wallets. You can save the money and invest it into other coins. Just create a wallet in myetherwallet.com and save your private keys.\nThe website doesn’t store your information, so we suggest that you write everything down on paper to ensure that you have it. If you don’t want to use the online version, then you can download it on GitHub and use it on your computer network.\nPaper wallets are free, but they require some knowledge to install correctly. Basically, these wallets take a lot of effort, so we don’t recommend them for novices. Jaxx\nCarrying your cryptocurrency conveniently and safely is no longer a dream. Meet Jaxx, the first mobile wallet solution. This wallet has applications for Android, iOS, and desktop web browsers.\nWhat makes Jaxx more secure is that it allows users to scan QR codes, receive all of your funds, and view crypto holdings with just one app. It offers advanced features such as multiple wallet integrations and shapeshift integration. This makes it a great crypto wallet for the technically savvy users.\nThe only problem is that Jaxx has a difficult learning curve, and its features may not fully work with new integrations. Still, Jaxx is one of the safest bitcoin wallets that’s available. Conclusion\nYour assets are very important. So why not get a bitcoin wallet that’s going to keep them safe from all sorts of danger (hacks, lost keys, etc). To make the safest bitcoin wallet, you have to keep all of your information safe. So make sure that you select one of these wallets and take the right safety precautions so that you can benefit from all of your crypto investments. *Opinions expressed in this article are those of its author and do not necessarily reflect those of Techaeris or its staff.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bonpay.com/wallet/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "keepkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trezor", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T22:59:06.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "47e15d7e7572725e83905759e81f1064d9b38db5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1pHZOv4QnLHXvO9i9JYU3YQ", "site_full": "nigeria.shafaqna.com", "site": "shafaqna.com", "site_section": "http://nigeria.shafaqna.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nigeria News (News Reader) |", "title": "South Africans lose $80m to bitcoin scam", "title_full": "South Africans lose $80m to bitcoin scam", "published": "2018-05-25T18:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5727, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "47e15d7e7572725e83905759e81f1064d9b38db5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1pHZOv4QnLHXvO9i9JYU3YQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-25T18:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "South Africans lose $80m to bitcoin scam", "text": "7 hours ago South Africans lose $80m to bitcoin scam South African authorities are investigating an alleged cryptocurrency scam that defrauded investors of 1 billion rand ($80m) with promises of huge returns that never materialised, police said on Friday.

She immediately posted her phone number to Facebook , as well as on pet finder site, Pawboost.\nSoon after, Howell received a threatening text message demanding $600 worth of bitcoin in exchange for the safe return of the lost dog — only one problem, Happy was already home.\nThe bitcoin scammer, who told Howell he was using a burner phone to avoid identification, claimed to have the lost basset hound. Howell would need to send the bitcoin ransom within five days, otherwise they would “sell it or kill it or whatever.”\n“I knew it was a scam because I had Happy, but it was heartless and cold and it was so mean-spirited,” Howell told CBS 17 .\nHowell filed a report with Granville County Sheriff’s Office for investigation. While this was the first reported case of this particular scam he’d personally encountered, the sheriff told CBS 17 news that he was familiar with similar bitcoin scams around the country.\nHowell and Happy weren’t the only ones in North Carolina to encounter the lost dog bitcoin scam. Fuquay-Varina county resident Raymond Brunet and his two lost dogs were also targeted by a similar scam.\nAfter posting his contact information on Triangle Pet Lost & Found, Brunet received an almost identical text from a burner phone, demanding $2,000 worth of bitcoin or else his two lost dogs would be killed within 10 days.\nLike Howell, Brunet had already found both of his dogs before the scammer sent the text.\n“They need to find a better way to make money,” Howell told CBS 17 news. “They need to leave people alone and realize that what they’re doing is hurtful and so cruel.”\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://gizmodo.com/scammer-threatens-to-kill-happy-the-dog-unless-owner-pa-1826292247", "http://www.cbs17.com/news/local-news/scammer-demands-bitcoin-in-exchange-for-safe-return-of-lost-granville-county-dog/1195087271", "http://abc11.com/finance/triangle-owners-of-lost-pets-targeted-in-bitcoin-scam-/3517761/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "carson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "patricia howell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "howell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kessler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cbs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "granville county sheriff’s office", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "granville county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T18:20:50.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b18274b0bf22c6e619d88a23eabeee821cbb1196", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKxNuNLl2qvyeptBawSGI4XQGKksGyghVCDKVPZ5bGoPBkBbGZ17hVRXBy4dvdItqVfdD.9dtwwCLFADvh9DMvP0DL4vXfNROSuE4HqEIwhgj8x8coK89eiKhjw7lSivFE88t8hPfTCS6G_T3BhTjukJJ7meMXpEy0CKtAF7WdV2hbGXC3Hi7Wiv.wMCfvAtGYOteRLwV2gRDSISUfOHoyXWRUxZ_lbQkas-", "site_full": "pretty-hot.com", "site": "pretty-hot.com", "site_section": "http://pretty-hot.com/feed", "site_categories": ["books_and_literature", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Pretty-Hot.com", "title": "Top 3 Cryptocurrency Box Set: Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple: How You Can Make Money with Investing, Trading and Mining Cryptocurrencies by Edward Harrod", "title_full": "Top 3 Cryptocurrency Box Set: Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple: How You Can Make Money with Investing, Trading and Mining Cryptocurrencies by Edward Harrod", "published": "2018-05-25T18:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prettyhot/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/16183407/Top3CryptocurrencyBoxSetBitcoinEthereumandRippleHowYouCanMakeMoneywithInvestingTradingandMiningCryptocurrencies.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b18274b0bf22c6e619d88a23eabeee821cbb1196", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKxNuNLl2qvyeptBawSGI4XQGKksGyghVCDKVPZ5bGoPBkBbGZ17hVRXBy4dvdItqVfdD.9dtwwCLFADvh9DMvP0DL4vXfNROSuE4HqEIwhgj8x8coK89eiKhjw7lSivFE88t8hPfTCS6G_T3BhTjukJJ7meMXpEy0CKtAF7WdV2hbGXC3Hi7Wiv.wMCfvAtGYOteRLwV2gRDSISUfOHoyXWRUxZ_lbQkas-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Christine Liston", "published": "2018-05-25T18:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Top 3 Cryptocurrency Box Set: Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple: How You Can Make Money with Investing, Trading and Mining Cryptocurrencies by Edward Harrod", "text": "Author Interview New Books / Top 3 Cryptocurrency Box Set: Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple: How You Can Make Money with Investing, Trading and Mining Cryptocurrencies by Edward Harrod Top 3 Cryptocurrency Box Set: Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple: How You Can Make Money with Investing, Trading and Mining Cryptocurrencies by Edward Harrod Leave a Comment\nAbout Top 3 Cryptocurrency Box Set: Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple: How You Can Make Money with Investing, Trading and Mining Cryptocurrencies by Edward Harrod:\nWant to make money with Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple but don’t know where to start?\nIf you are overwhelmed with all the information you see online, then keep reading…\nOn Facebook groups, Reddit, Forums and Online… you see so many information about Cryptocurrency.\nSome promises to make you a millionaire, while most are Ponzi schemes.\nHow would you prevent getting ripped off?\nIt only takes knowing the right information and reading it from a great source.\nLet me guide you.\nThis is a book packaged from the first books that I published Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple, all were best sellers.\nThe best resource to start your Crypto journey!\nTotal Coin Market Cap today is $436 billion, that means people are willing to invest their money.

CheapAir ‘Doing Testing’ With BTCPay\nAccording to comments on social media, BTCPay, which offers open-source merchant software, could officially become the new processor for Cheapair after it dropped Coinbase earlier this month.\nâWe had a nice run with Coinbase but they are sun-setting their merchant platform next week,â the company wrote confirming the planned switch May 24.\nâWe’re looking for an alternative and right now are doing some testing with (BTCPay).â Hey hey hey, welcome @CheapAir ! đ https://t.co/D2Ar1uU6Hi\n— BTCPay Server (@BtcpayServer) May 25, 2018\nCoinbase revealed it was retiring its merchant processing function in April, a move which the cryptocurrency industry condemned for its disruptive consequences.\nBitPay, a processor which along with Coinbase continues to be arguably the best-known option for Bitcoin payments, appeared to miss out on wooing CheapAir, meanwhile, which has offered Bitcoin since 2014 and wasÂ the first ever travel agency world-wide to accept bitcoin. BitPay Wallet Rules Cause Doubts\nThe company had originally sought to transfer to BitPay, but for undisclosed reasons instead opted for the open-source alternative. The crux, as CheapAir highlighted in a statement last month, could be wallet support.\nâWe have had a great experience with (BitPay) so far and our integration is largely complete. But our one giant concern is that Bitpay does not support ânon-payment protocol walletsâ (wallets that arenât BIP-70 compliant),â it reads.\nâSo if you do not have a compatible wallet, you would have to get one and use it as an intermediate stage for your Bitcoin payment.â\nA request for user input fielded sixty responses.\nDiscussing the move, an executive wrote on BTCPayâs Twitter account that âIt makes me even happier that they were considering Bitpay at first, but changed their mind.\nFeedback on BTCPayâs user experience has been positive from both users and industry figures, with Bitcoin Think editor Beautyon commenting CheapAir represented âwhat a properly run company looks like.â\nBTCPay has also garnered acclaim from Bitcoin core developer Nicolas Dorier, who told Bitcoinist it held specific advantages over BitPay in December.\nWhat do you think about CheapAir.com using BTCPay for its Bitcoin payments?

Ramaphosa fiercely defends SARB's independence\nPresident Cyril Ramphosa has given the strongest indication to date that he wants the independence of the country’s central bank protected, and he is ready to defend it.\n\"I was one of those who participated in the crafting of the clause that deals with the Reserve Bank in our Constitution, and can confirm and testify that to me that remains an unassailable provision in our Constitution,\" Ramaphosa said. READ: Ramaphosa fiercely defends SARB's independence SA Bitcoin platform claims 'super shy' founder has stolen all its money\nA company promising massive returns to investors via Bitcoin, and which is under investigation by the Hawks, has claimed its \"super shy\" founding trader has absconded with all the money and they don’t know where he is.\nBut investors who have been fleeced for what the Hawks estimate may amount to a total of R1bn have been claiming for months on social media support groups that the whole thing is an elaborate Ponzi scheme and the shy man never existed.

Advertisement Will Bitcoin Use as Much Electricity as All of Austria by the End of the Year? Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were designed to be efficient, low-friction alternatives to traditional financial systems. But it seems their creators maybe didn’t think too hard about their sustainability. An analysis published in the journal Joule this week predicts the Bitcoin network could be using 7.67 gigawatts of electricity by the end of the year. That’s half a percent of the world’s electricity and the same amount used by the whole of Austria. The problem comes from the way Bitcoin verifies transactions. To avoid duplicate spending of coins, members of the network compete in tricky computational challenges for the right to create the next block of transactions in the chain in return for a reward—currently 12.5 bitcoins (roughly $10,000). But solving these challenges—a process known as “mining”—requires you to run high-powered computers nearly continuously, which uses a lot of electricity. The paper’s author, economist Alex de Vries, estimates a single transaction uses the same amount of energy as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. To add to the problem, the mining challenges are getting harder, forcing miners to invest ever more power-hungry hardware. That’s because the network self-regulates to keep the rate of new blocks constant at around 1 every 10 minutes by increasing the difficulty of the calculations depending on the total computational power of the network. This combines to create a situation where the energy use of the system can only really go one way—at least until the cost of mining bitcoins reaches equilibrium with the cost of the electricity and hardware required to do so. The 7.67 GW figure is actually de Vries’ estimate for when this equilibrium will be reached, something he says could happen this year. But it’s worth noting that his estimates are based on some pretty big assumptions. De Vries based his estimates on the energy usage of the Antiminer S9, the top-of-the-range specialized mining chip produced by market leader Bitmain. He then assumed a 1–2 year lifetime for these chips, an average electricity cost of 5 US cents per kWh, and a production cost of $500, based on estimates from a bitcoin developer. He used these figures to work out what percentage of the lifetime cost of the chips went to electricity, coming to a ballpark figure of 60 percent after hedging for the uncertainty around the chips’ lifetimes. By combining this figure, his assumed electricity cost, and the value of Bitcoin mined on March 16 of this year, he reached his figure for equilibrium. The reason he thinks we could reach this equilibrium point in 2018 is based on the fact that the number of Antiminers due to be produced this year would have a combined electricity consumption of 8.92 GW, so there should be enough devices to make it possible. That’s a lot of assumptions, and the model relies on both the price of electricity and bitcoin staying the same until the end of the year, which the last 12 months suggests is unlikely. Marc Bevand, a bitcoin investor and entrepreneur who has also made efforts to forecast Bitcoin’s energy usage, pointed out to Gizmodo that de Vries’ estimate also assumes Bitmain is selling its chips at cost, which gives miners much more money to spend on electricity. Stanford University energy economist Jonathan Koomey criticized previous estimates made by de Vries on his Digiconomist blog using a similar approach, because he said basing the analysis on estimates about manufacturers’ costs and revenues introduced lots of opportunity for error and uncertainty. But with no publicly-available data on energy consumption from the miners themselves, making unambiguous claims about the electricity use of these networks is hard. Indeed, de Vries admits that there’s plenty of scope for disagreement, but he says it’s important to start doing these calculations now so we can start to think about the policy implications of Bitcoin’s energy use. “We don’t really have a common approach to getting to a future estimate of electricity consumption right now, which is why I am hoping to get this conversation started,” he said in a press release. “I’m doing this research, but a lot of people should be doing it.” It’s not all a one-way street. The problems around Bitcoin’s energy consumption have been known for a while, and there are efforts underway to deal with the problem. There are various proposals for more energy-efficient alternatives to the pointless computation used to verify transactions. Most notable is an approach currently being considered by the second-biggest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, that bases decisions on who makes the next block using a lottery, with your chances of winning based on how many coins you have. Companies like Bitmain are also working on ever more efficient mining chips, and as demand goes up you can expect bigger players to pile in with their expertise too. Intel recently applied for a patent on a high-efficiency specialized Bitcoin mining chip. But it is worth noting that another Bitcoin boom like the one experienced at the end of last year would see that point of equilibrium shift far higher, incentivizing even greater electricity use. While we shouldn’t take the figures from de Vries’ analysis as gospel, they are a useful reality check for anyone assuming that cryptocurrencies, at least in their current form, are the future of our financial system.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "will bi", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "organizations": [{"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T18:02:59.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3d79add3dd57c7c2dfa20b77f7e08cb70fce83ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTINqAdAIhjAo71w2HmImBKenAHs_5ljChPJBQn5hpOszvJXKw1GaUhV6BNllcyUTNwUR.5pPoEgoJbA89hOtN5REls5kGWa8I-", "site_full": "anynote.co", "site": "anynote.co", "site_section": "https://anynote.co/rss/?id=1", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Latest Blogs", "title": "ICO?

It's possible for builders to choose to sell their tokens with out a fixed change rate. In July, the US Securities & Exchanges Fee reported on its investigation of the DAO, a digital organisation, and its use of distributed ledger or block chain know-how to facilitate the offer and sale of DAO Tokens to raise capital. (a) Topic to otherwise expressly supplied on this Part 9, all purchases of MNTP tokens from the Company throughout the Sale are final, and there aren't any refunds or cancellations besides as set forth herein or as may be required by relevant legislation or regulation.\"As alleged, Zaslavskiy and his associates enticed investors by promising returns using novel ICOs although Zaslavskiy knew that no real estate or diamonds had been really backing the investments,\" appearing U.S. Lawyer Bridget Rohde stated last month. Someone has to construct the blockchain, challenge the tokens, Echat For mining rig cooling and preserve some software, though. Ethereum is a smart contract and decentralized purposes platform that has gained lots of traction over time. People like to name it \"digital gold.\" Then got here one other blockchain called Ethereum, which is a more flexible twist that aims to create an entire decentralized network on high of which individuals can construct their very own decentralized apps and tokens. Throughout ICO individuals purchase MNTP (MNT pre-launch) tokens which is able to later migrate from Ethereum to GoldMint custom blockchain and shall be used to confirm GOLD transactions. Its enhance would result in centralization of Bitcoin since solely massive firm's would be able to afford the storage space and computing power. In May 2017, an inventory of profitable crypto foreign money cranes was added to Storj tasks ($ 30 million in less than per week) and Aragon - in just 15 minutes from the start of ICO, the project collected the planned 275,000 ETH (about $ 25 million). By issuing their very own tokens and exchanging them for common crypto-currencies (for instance, bitcoin or Ethereum ) or for fiat currencies (dollars or euros), the venture attracts funding wanted for launch or development. Other ICOs, mining craft have caught with different preexisting platforms like WAVES. If you adored this informative article and you would like to be given guidance relating to echat for data mining news articles generously pay a visit to our own website. It'll additionally point out the monetary instrument to be sold throughout the ICO, usually tokens. Instead, traders are inspired to buy into the startup, after which every investor is given a number of tokens that matches up to the percentage of funding that they injected into echat the project. Accordingly, you have to alternate the digital cash purchased by means of the net commerce to your Ethereum-based wallet that assist the brand new token of the ICO. Platform users should be able to obtain a cryptocurrency or fiat mortgage from GoldMint PTE LTD, utilizing GOLD as collateral. During this time, investors might support the company and get Mastercoin tokens as a reward. Earlier than traders buy into an ICO, it is necessary for them to know what tokens will probably be value once they are in circulation and which of the four pricing mechanisms above will likely be used. Analogous to Preliminary Public Offering, which represents the second when a personal firm is offered to the general public for the first time. ICO (Initial Coin Offering) is a crowdfunding mannequin that enables us to challenge digital tokens in alternate for investments. ICOs are often reported on different digital currency discussions, fairly on Bitcointalk. Skilled neighborhood manager has worked on a number of blockchain associated initiatives and previously has engaged in the software improvement for Brazilian authorities the place held executive positions. In 2014, the Ethereum undertaking was introduced and its ICO raised $18 million in Bitcoins or $zero.forty per Ether. The froth and the attention around ICOs is masking the truth that it's truly a really exhausting approach to raise money,\" Channing stated. In order to defend themselves from such circumstances, investors are suggested to fastidiously study the platform documentation and the knowledge provided concerning the popularity of the challenge creators before becoming a member of the ICO. During this period customers had been allowed to send Bitcoin, Crypty and some other cryptocurrency supported by the ShapeShift automated trade. Adding to the upside for start ups is the involvement of the investor within the decision making course of, whether it is an precise enterprise or a mission, providing the investor a say, lots of the preliminary investors in begin ups being entrepreneurs and experts in their respective fields. ICO principally means that the buyers are provided with models of cryptocurrency which can be new in change for Bitcoins or Ethereum. This can highly reduce the chance of a day one exchange dump that happens to most new tokens that hit the market. Nonetheless, the federal securities legal guidelines could prohibit that recipient's potential to resell the tokens, which clearly would restrict the quantity of people that would be willing to just accept tokens for goods and providers on the platform. GoldMint founders and developers have a protracted report of working with gold and cryptocurrency, and we consider that the team together with the advisers possesses the advertising, programming, logical, technical, and operational abilities wanted to develop, deploy and keep the Platform. There will typically be a cooling off interval after buy the place tokens cannot be bought before they are accessible to transfer at the market price. These cash are referred to as tokens and are just like shares of a company sold to traders in an Preliminary Public Offering (IPO) transaction. Some argue that crowdfunding projects might be Ethereum's \"killer application\" given the sheer measurement and frequency of ICOs.

Cybercrime detectives seized the bitcoin from Grant West, 26, who was sentenced to 10 years and 8 months in prison Friday for attacking some 100 companies worldwide, largely using ‘phishing’ email scams to obtain the financial data. Once he obtained the data, West would then sell the material to market places on the dark web and convert his profits into bitcoin.

It might bring a little bit of a bounce, but clearly we are in a range with 6,000 being the bottom. I think we could very well find ourselves going to 7,000 and then break down to 6,000. I would point out that the highs continue to get lower while we have not collapsed recently.\nBitcoin/JPY — Against the yen, we are not looking healthy either. We have a little bit more well defined consolidation area. What I find interesting is that we just cannot reach that level again. I think that we are going to test the 700,000. Quite often, you will see a move back to roughly the middle of these ranges before you continue down. I suspect that may happen. Rallies are to be sold and I think the biggest problem bitcoin has is that a lot of the hot money has left. This is a mature market and these outrageous prices simply cannot hold, institutions won't have it. So, bitcoin is losing lot of hot money. I think it is going to be a slow drag to the downside.\n© Prabhu for Forex Videos , 2018. | Permalink | No comment | Add to del.icio.us\nPost tags: Bitcoin , Cryptocurrency , technical analysis\nFeed enhanced by Better Feed from Ozh ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoi", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T17:32:53.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "74ee4425245812d470461fa1d70926c08dabceeb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrLqaZhb2dI_9EEqnJznxD.Bwqp3L5ufUZQBK.YUTEBFoSiUa8Uysawa1u5EtadXHj4hMa6Gq8SGakaPakURAXcgKl_6VU_PHyd_JZLzCdTlcvZ_npQMgcHUKfkY7nhjqw-", "site_full": "triblive.com", "site": "triblive.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/tribunereviewbusiness", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "TribLIVE Business Stories RSS Feed", "title": "London police seize bitcoin worth $667,000 from hacker", "title_full": "London police seize bitcoin worth $667,000 from hacker", "published": "2018-05-25T17:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=j08D_RinN6IyEJ9WHLchR8$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYtCOE3kzP2v6d3$moksMlj3WCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&amp;CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 14702, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "74ee4425245812d470461fa1d70926c08dabceeb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrLqaZhb2dI_9EEqnJznxD.Bwqp3L5ufUZQBK.YUTEBFoSiUa8Uysawa1u5EtadXHj4hMa6Gq8SGakaPakURAXcgKl_6VU_PHyd_JZLzCdTlcvZ_npQMgcHUKfkY7nhjqw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The Associated Press", "published": "2018-05-25T17:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "London police seize bitcoin worth $667,000 from hacker", "text": "London police seize bitcoin worth $667,000 from hacker | Friday , May 25, 2018, 9:36 a.m. Getty Images\n 7 hours ago LONDON — London police have seized $667,000 worth of bitcoin from a prolific computer hacker in a case described as the first of its kind for the 188-year-old department. Cybercrime detectives seized the bitcoin from Grant West, 26, who was sentenced to 10 years and 8 months in prison Friday for attacking some 100 companies worldwide, largely using phishing email scams to obtain the financial data. Once he obtained the data, West would then sell the material to market places on the dark web and convert his profits into bitcoin. The London Metropolitan police discovered evidence of cyberattacks on 17 major firms including Sainsbury's, Asda, the British Cardiovascular Society and the Finnish bitcoin exchange. Officers also recovered a memory card containing approximately 78 million individual usernames and passwords.

Speaking at an industry event in London on May 23, 2018, Jeffrey Tessler, head of clients, products and core markets for Deutsche Boerse, said they are considering offering cryptocurrency products: \"We are deep at work with it.\"\nTessler is quoted in Bloomberg confirming that Deutsche Boerse is “not at the same stage” as CME and that they want to make sure that they understand the underlying transaction “which isn’t the easiest thing to do.”\nTwo months ago, Deutsche Boerse announced a plan to work with the financial management firm HQLAX and R3’s Corda blockchain platform to implement a system that can offer more efficient securities settlement via a blockchain. HQLAX and R3 already have a solution for securities lending with a number of large banks, such as ING and Credit Suisse.\nTessler added, “Before moving forwards with anything like bitcoin, we want to understand the volatility and make sure clients are in line and make sure regulators are in line.”\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine . ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : bitcoinmagazine.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "http://deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-en/", "http://www.deutsche-boerse-cash-market.com/dbcm-en/newsroom/press-releases/Deutsche-Boerse-Group-and-HQLAX-partner-to-build-securities-lending-solution-on-the-R3-Corda-blockchain-platform/3357600", "https://www.credit-suisse.com/corporate/en/articles/media-releases/cs-and-ing-execute-first-live-transaction-201803.html", "http://www.cmegroup.com/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-23/deutsche-boerse-s-tessler-says-deep-at-work-on-bitcoin", "http://cfe.cboe.com/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/regulators-greenlight-bitcoin-futures/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tessler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeffrey tessler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "frankfurt stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cme group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche boerse ag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe futures exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche boerse", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T23:03:59.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd9e453afee25fefa72a7ffd293ecbf2f84f81af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9cAvseD0_zUjqSV7Cr2u.Y1HfLIR3Zyfsp2YaW_c1kulC5Eitza0OD1UiXLPXkZ01NV3dnJSK454b02iDXj1Xkl7u7kpde7S1_IhiH5om.traazi0WAJtTt3c2jMfb4Qy.oaP8w5xtg--", "site_full": "btcmanager.com", "site": "btcmanager.com", "site_section": "http://www.xbt.money/feed", "site_categories": ["tech", "business"], "section_title": "XBT.MONEY", "title": "Bitcoin Private Founder Rhett Creighton Alleges BTCP Treasury Mismanagement and Fraud", "title_full": "Bitcoin Private Founder Rhett Creighton Alleges BTCP Treasury Mismanagement and Fraud", "published": "2018-05-25T17:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.xbt.money/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1598px-Rhett_Creighton_cropped-660x330.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dd9e453afee25fefa72a7ffd293ecbf2f84f81af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9cAvseD0_zUjqSV7Cr2u.Y1HfLIR3Zyfsp2YaW_c1kulC5Eitza0OD1UiXLPXkZ01NV3dnJSK454b02iDXj1Xkl7u7kpde7S1_IhiH5om.traazi0WAJtTt3c2jMfb4Qy.oaP8w5xtg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "xbt.money", "published": "2018-05-25T17:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Private Founder Rhett Creighton Alleges BTCP Treasury Mismanagement and Fraud", "text": "Bitcoin Private Founder Rhett Creighton Alleges BTCP Treasury Mismanagement and Fraud Date: in: Bitcoin 0 Views\nBitcoin Private Co-founder and cryptocurrency maverick, Rhett Creighton has leveled a series of remarkable allegations of theft, incompetence, mismanagement, and cover-ups against his former team in a blog post published on May 23, 2018. Sponsored Links Source: Wikipedia\nCreighton has been engaged in a public feud with the Bitcoin Private team since he was reportedly fired in April 2018. The allegations made by him range from the relatively minor such as incompetence and infighting to severe accusations including mismanagement of Treasury funds, fraud, bribery, and several coverups to prevent information from reaching the BTCP community. Bitcoin Theft and Coverup\nCreighton alleges that BTCP Strategy chief, Giuseppe Stuto accidentally paid 5.5 BTC to a developer Jon S. Layton when he intended to pay 0.55 BTC.\nIn a series of screenshots posted showing the conversation between Stuto and Layton, Stuto repeatedly requested Layton to return the 5 BTC overpayment, and Layton shamelessly refused. Source: Medium\nCreighton then posts screenshots of a conversation between himself and BTCP Head of Operations Jacob Brutman in response to a tweet where he criticized the team’s lack of communication with the community on the subject of being listed on Binance. Brutman responds by saying that Creighton is not helping by publicising their internal problems and that BTCP is not listed on Binance because their lowball offer of 55 BTC was not accepted.\nAs the exchange goes on, Brutman then reveals that the developer stole 5 BTC, which Creighton at that point is not aware of. When pushed by Creighton on whether this will be revealed to the community, Brutman responds, “We aren’t going to show that. For now, it’s chalked up as a dev expense. Not sure we want that to be known.” 100,000 BTCP Bribe and Fraud Proposal\nIt will be recalled that on May 22, 2018, Creighton tweeted an allegation stating that he was offered a bribe of 100,000 BTCP to enable Stuto and Brutman steal BTCP coins by writing fraudulent commits in the course of a coin burn. Both Stuto and Brutman have publicly denied the allegation, endorsing a tweet stating that Creighton is looking to take revenge on the team for removing him.\nCreighton then shows a series of conversation between Brutman, Stuto, and members of the BTCP community including Hannah Steinke, where both of them attempt to clear their names of Creighton’s fraud and bribery allegation. Continuous Intent to Defraud\nCreighton infers that “several members” of the BTCP Treasury have an established pattern of fraudulent behavior which they intend to continue as they move on to a new company called Nexus.\nAnother series of screenshots shows conversations between Brutman and community members where he talks about having a non-profit foundation set up in partnership with Nexus.\nCreighton concludes by hinting that there are more allegations to come. He states, “But wait! There’s more! There’s much larger fraud that was never disclosed to the community. Maybe Jake and Guiseppe will disclose it now?”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DanDarkPill/status/990416028864798720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/HeyRhett/status/999097285765140486", "https://btcprivate.org/team.html", "https://medium.com/@heyrhett/bitcoinprivate-treasury-theft-and-coverup-e8b9b1458056", "https://twitter.com/OHHHtis/status/999425334687739905"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rhett creighton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "layton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stuto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coverup creighton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jon s. layton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giuseppe stuto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btcp treasury mismanagement", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wikipedia creighton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "treasury", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T21:27:24.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0902b91a68a34959d59a661c98a2ee40ac6d4e2d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTVWwKspf_DfAyVAjL.0wN9HprQ41Byf4TJft6LKCnQjuYTp0j_TplaUpZ7FAGQ6yekyuhvcSmApd1EMJbCZxmhs9Hwd78yxsG22s9V5AFgcQ--", "site_full": "mycryptofeed.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://mycryptofeed.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "What do you believe in?

They are implementing the Bitcoin Improvement Protocols and using the Ethereum Virtual Machine, digital currency enthusiasts can finally agree on one platform that will offer stability and direction.\nQTUM Hackathon\nQTUM is about to launch its first online hackathon which will last for three months and welcomes anyone who aspires to build on or for QTUM to join. The hackathon will accept online submission and promises handsome financial reward in addition to a spot to QTUM’s global dev con and other community support.\nRecent Developments\nAt Consensus 2018, Jordan Earls, Qtum’s co-founder and lead developer, appeared on the “On Device Key Management” panel moderated by Zaki Manian, executive director of the Trusted IoT Alliance.\nJordan spoke about the unique complexities of storing and staking cryptocurrency on the Qtum blockchain since the token has to be in a hot wallet to take part in validating transactions and securing the network.\nQTUM, together with SpaceChain, Energo, and Bodhi, hosted another tech meetup at Columbia University on May 12th.\nQTUM co-founder and lead developer Jordan Earls gave a brief introduction of QTUM’s upcoming X86 virtual machine and the soon to launch global developer tour and online hackathon. QTUM’s X86 virtual machine will enable programmers to write smart contracts with more mainstream programming languages such as Go, Rust, C++, and more. Jordan is leading the team in developing the said VM and currently, it is in the prototyping phase.\nApril 21st list of development updates\nSome Technical Background on Qtum\nQtum is a hybrid blockchain application platform. Qtum’s core technology combines a fork of bitcoin core, an Account Abstraction Layer allowing for multiple Virtual Machines including the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Proof-of-Stake consensus aimed at tackling industry use cases. This will allow Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications to run on a familiar foundation while offering a robust environment for developers.\nThey use the UTXO model which is similar to having an ecosystem built on bank checks (without an actual bank account, the check itself is the money). There is a “pay to” field which in our example provides instructions to how the money must be spent, and each check has an amount. You can not go to cash the check and say “cash half the check and give me half back”. Your “balance” per-se is the sum of the checks which you are capable of spending. This model is more difficult to explain, but because every token is either “spent” or “unspent” and there is no in-between, it is much easier to secure in a blockchain environment with less logic required to maintain that security.\nWith UTXOs however it is simpler to validate a transaction, which can be done simply by verifying that the transaction has been confirmed by the blockchain, in the case of the SPV protocol. The UTXO model also has been tested and proven to be secure by Bitcoin, which has operated for over 7 years with no significant changes to its core model.\nWhite Papers\nSmart-Contract Value-Transfer Protocols on a Distributed Mobile Application Platform (27 pages)\nBlockchain-enabled smart contracts that employ proof-ofstake validation for transactions, promise significant performance advantages compared to proof-of-work solutions. For broad industry adoption, other important requirements must be met in addition. For example, stable backwards-compatible smart-contract systems must automate cross-organizational information-logistics orchestration with lite mobile wallets that support simple payment verification (SPV) techniques. The currently leading smart-contract solution Ethereum, uses computationally expensive proof-of-work validation, is expected to hard-fork multiple times in the future and requires downloading the entire blockchain. Consequently, Ethereum smart contracts have limited utility and lack formal semantics, which is a security issue. This whitepaper fills the gap in the state of the art by presenting the Qtum smart-contract framework that aims for sociotechnical application suitability, the adoption of formalsemantics language expressiveness, and the provision of smart-contract template libraries for rapid best-practice industry deployment. We discuss the Qtum utility advantages compared to the Ethereum alternative and present Qtum smart-contract future development plans for industrycases applications.\nQtum Blockchain Economy Whitepaper (33 pages)\nThe Qtum Blockchain (“Qtum”) is committed to develop an open source ecosystem for the blockchain community different from that of Bitcoin and Ethereum. It utilizes a Value Transfer Protocol (“VTP”) to achieve the transferring of value from peer to peer and to build up a decentralized application platform, which brings blockchain technology into the financial services, Internet of Things (“IoT”), supply chain management, social media, gaming and other industries. Innovative technology, comprehensive governance structure and board applications give Qtum advantages over Bitcoin and Ethereum as a public blockchain.\nFrom a technical point of view , the highly qualified Qtum development team brings in the technology of identity, Oracle and Data feeds, and is committed to achieve the first IPoS (“Incentive Proof-of-Stake”) Smart Contract platform, which is compatible with Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs based on UTXO model). In terms of compliance, Qtum meets the regulatory requirements from different industries.\nIn terms of governance , Qtum established the Qtum Blockchain Foundation (“Foundation”), which is committed to develop the Qtum Blockchain, to advocate governance transparency, and to promote safety and harmony of the open source ecosystem. In order to ensure the sustainability, management effectiveness, and fund-raising security of the project in the open source community, the Foundation uses a governance model that considers the various dimensions of the project, including code management, financial management, public relations management, and other dimensions to operate and to deal with general affairs and privileged operations.\nRegarding the applications built on Qtum , they bring in the off-chain factors that are used in Decentralized Applications (“DApp”) and Smart Contracts to connect the real world business logic with the blockchain world. By supporting multiple industries and methods, the applications will follow the Go Mobile strategy. In Qtum’s open environment, we not only support and promote the Go Mobile strategy, but also provide mobile services with third party developers, including mobile wallets, mobile DApp store, mobile smart contract applications, etc. In addition, we encourage third party developers to join us and help develop mobile blockchain services for ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://qtum.org/uploads/files/ef2723f33deef1875ef17361f7c696ef.pdf”", "https://forum.qtum.org/topic/109/qtum-development-updates-april-21st-2017/2”", "https://blog.qtum.org/qtum-at-blockchain-week-nyc-a0da8d4ad01e”", "http://rdf.data-vocabulary.org/#", "https://twitter.com/share", "https://qtum.org/uploads/files/a2772efe4dc8ed1100319c6480195fb1.pdf”", "https://qtum.org/en/general-faq”"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ethereum hackathon", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "zaki manian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qtum", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trusted iot alliance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qtum", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan earls", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T22:26:48.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "42cc5dcfb7ff85febcdc59ab40ac7bda8c4ffabf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSf4uNfgM4ciys70cpzzC0SKHraZqV3LWPfoZJ9lu5NmS_dksNhCY6W4RgPPvJd6dWObhnYX9cJ9d", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "What do you believe in?

Dave Jevans, CipherTrace\nGDPR, which passed in 2016 but comes into power today, aims to simplify and consolidate rules that companies need to follow in order to protect their data and to return control of personal information to EU citizens and residents.\nThe implementation of GDPR means that most European domain data in WHOIS, the internet’s database of record, will no longer be published publicly after May 25. WHOIS contains the names, addresses and email addresses of those who register domain names for websites.\nMr Jevans adds that WHOIS data is a fundamental resource for investigators and law enforcement officials who work to prevent thefts and is crucial in performing investigations that allow for the recovery of stolen funds, identifying the persons involved and providing vital information for law enforcement to arrest and prosecute criminals.\nHe said: “So what we’re going to see is that not only the European market goes dark for all of us; so all the bad guys will flow to Europe because you can actually access the world from Europe and there’s no way you can get the data anymore.” Everything you need to know about bitcoin Mon, October 30, 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dave jevans", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "city & business news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anti-phishing working group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T17:45:31.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "12263eaed1b7ee9db44f9c8901710f9ef451dbef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8mUduhycCNXgtOmDFAEkNNytgTnQzqTTTpBY_lo31PAHq8CBnpLmg60.s67IJW1URf.xBytLWpw_44R5aHdCvl848F.d1my6I-", "site_full": "www.wopular.com", "site": "wopular.com", "site_section": "http://www.wopular.com/rss/sections/11327", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "RSS: u.s.", "title": "London police seize bitcoin worth $667,000 from hacker", "title_full": "London police seize bitcoin worth $667,000 from hacker", "published": "2018-05-25T17:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "12263eaed1b7ee9db44f9c8901710f9ef451dbef", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8mUduhycCNXgtOmDFAEkNNytgTnQzqTTTpBY_lo31PAHq8CBnpLmg60.s67IJW1URf.xBytLWpw_44R5aHdCvl848F.d1my6I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sally Duong", "published": "2018-05-25T17:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "London police seize bitcoin worth $667,000 from hacker", "text": "BING NEWS: London Police Seize Bitcoin Worth $667,000 From Hacker London (AP) -- London police have seized half a million pounds ($667,000) worth of bitcoin from a prolific computer hacker in a case described as the first of its kind for the 188 -year-old department.

Bitcoin is the most widely recognized and seen as the first decentralized cryptocurrency when it was launched in 2009. Satoshi Nakamoto was name adopted by an unknown person or people who developed it and authored the white paper.\nDecentralized cryptocurrency technology enables customers to make secure payments and store assets without using banks. Its popularity rocketed in 2017, with bitcoin’s price increasing from $960 in January to a peak of almost $20,000 in December, reports the Times.\nOfficials are said to be investigating two tactics used in the digital currency market. The first is known as “spoofing” . This apparently involves overloading the market with buy or sell orders artificially to send prices up or down and then cancelling the orders after profiting from the price change.\nAnother tactic is supposedly “washing”, whereby a network of individuals and groups trade with each other, to give the impression that there is demand in the market for a particular type of digital currency.\nResearch suggests that about 1,000 people hold 40 percent of all bitcoin, giving these individuals the power to effect the market if they choose.

Representation of the Bitcoin virtual currency (Reuters image) A London mosque is thought to be the first in the world to accept bitcoin donations, one month after an Islamic scholar declared the cryptocurrency permissible under Sharia Law. The Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Hackney announced that it is hoping to raise at least £10,000 in cryptocurrency donations over Ramadan , through both bitcoin and ethereum. Muslims are asked to give away 2.5 per cent of their wealth during the 30-day festival as part of zakat. “We are trying to appeal to a wider audience with the new money,” Erkin Guney, the chairman of the board of trustees, told The Hackney Gazette. “It’s big in the Islamic world, and we have set up a platform for wealthier Muslims outside our community to support and donate to our mosque.” Last month, Muhammad Abu-Bakar of Blossom Finance in Indonesia explored the functionality of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to determine whether they fit with Islam’s strict definitions of money. “Several recent fatawah issued by prominent Muslim scholars offered incomplete or contradictory opinions on the topic,” said Matthew Martin, CEO of Blossom Finance. “With all the confusion out there, we wanted to offer clear guidance supported by solid research that benefits both laypeople and practitioners of Islamic finance.” The conclusion of his study was that bitcoin is permissible in principle as it is accepted by a wide variety of global merchants.

This hard fork of Bitcoin had some high ambitions at first. Several months down the line, it seems things look a lot worse for wear. With one individual controlling most of the network, the ecosystem is facing a serious threat. Solving this matter has proven to be rather difficult. The Bitcoin Gold Network Issues\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, several key issues can affect any network. The so-called 51% attack is perhaps one of the worst scenarios for developers to deal with. It effectively means someone controls the majority of the blockchain’s processing power. As such, transactions, payments, and day-to-day operations are all severely affected.\nIn the case of Bitcoin Gold, the person controlling the network has nefarious intentions. Being able to tamper with transactions can cause all sorts of problems. This is especially true for mining pools, exchanges, and wallet providers dealing with Bitcoin Gold. So far, it remains unclear how much damage has been done in the process.\nThe end result is how all BTG users are at risk during this time. Any transaction broadcast over the network can be tampered with. In the worst case, the transfer will not even be accepted by the network. This would immediately make it impossible to sue Bitcoin Gold, potentially crashing the price in the process. Whether or not that is the objective of the assailant(s), remains unclear at this time. Not The First Major Problem\nAlthough this recent issue is of grave concern, it is not the only one. Ever since the release of BTG, there have been numerous concerns and technical issues. Double-spending attacks go back almost a full week, and things are not looking up. In the past, there have been issues with the mining difficult adjustments as well. Despite hard forking Bitcoin, BTG has not inherited the robustness of Bitcoin in this regard.\nFor the time being, exchanges need to be very careful. Any platform accepting Bitcoin Gold deposits without additional verification will be targeted by these criminals in the coming days. Ensuring all deposits are accounted for and legitimate is the only course of action. Unfortunately, it may also lead to trading platform suspending BTG trading until further notice.\nIt is not the first time smaller cryptocurrencies are affected by such attacks. Verge has been dealing with multiple attacks in recent months. Monacoin and Electroneum have seen their fair share of issues as well. Bitcoin and Ethereum are unlikely to suffer from issues like these anytime soon. Their networks have a lot more mining support, making it nearly impossible for one entity to control the majority of processing power.\nImage from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/04/05/cryptocurrency-verge-has-been-hit-with-a-51-attack-loses-250000-tokens/", "https://forum.bitcoingold.org/t/double-spend-attack-on-exchanges/1362"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T17:38:56.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1b080404c93dc6bc97abb8753512250eef2acf7f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZ_s5cL927qGmFzzxScEdvBB766VrPU_ybDUJZqbOw41yxqBJHYPVOz4g2B5DBhZBWyGdzz7ZJ632UpbulzGEpUaT.9LKqhoFA-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Based on compettition?

The company already holds a financial services license in Gibraltar and is in the process of seeking further authorisations from the regulatory bodies of the British overseas-territory.\nFounded in 2014, Xapo is purported to be the largest custodian of bitcoin in the world. The firm offers customers ‘cold storage’ for their bitcoins meaning their stashes of the cryptocurrency are stored offline in secure vaults. Xapo used to offer bitcoin debit cards but Visa, along with regulatory authorities, put an end to the service earlier this year.\nIn January of this year the Gibraltarian government launched the Digital Ledger Technology Regulatory Framework that provides clear guidance to crypto companies wanting to set up camp on the island. Since then it has announced that it is drafting initial coin offering (ICO) regulation that is likely to go live in October 2018. Xapo has already received a level of regulatory approval from the island’s authorities but is looking get further permissions in order to continue its expansion plans.\nXapo has clearly made some important connections in Gibraltar already. During his recent trip to the island, Wences Casares, Xapo’s CEO, met with the head of the Gibraltarian government, Chief Minister Fabian Picardo, and the Minister for Commerce, Albert Isola.

Speaking at an industry event in London on May 23, 2018, Jeffrey Tessler, head of clients, products and core markets for Deutsche Boerse, said they are considering offering cryptocurrency products: “We are deep at work with it.”\nTessler is quoted in Bloomberg confirming that Deutsche Boerse is “not at the same stage” as CME and that they want to make sure that they understand the underlying transaction “which isn’t the easiest thing to do.”\nTwo months ago, Deutsche Boerse announced a plan to work with the financial management firm HQLAX and R3’s Corda blockchain platform to implement a system that can offer more efficient securities settlement via a blockchain. HQLAX and R3 already have a solution for securities lending with a number of large banks, such as ING and Credit Suisse.\nTessler added, “Before moving forwards with anything like bitcoin, we want to understand the volatility and make sure clients are in line and make sure regulators are in line.”\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\nBitcoinmagazine.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-en/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/", "http://www.deutsche-boerse-cash-market.com/dbcm-en/newsroom/press-releases/Deutsche-Boerse-Group-and-HQLAX-partner-to-build-securities-lending-solution-on-the-R3-Corda-blockchain-platform/3357600", "https://www.credit-suisse.com/corporate/en/articles/media-releases/cs-and-ing-execute-first-live-transaction-201803.html", "http://www.cmegroup.com/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-23/deutsche-boerse-s-tessler-says-deep-at-work-on-bitcoin", "http://cfe.cboe.com/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/regulators-greenlight-bitcoin-futures/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tessler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeffrey tessler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "frankfurt stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cme group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche boerse ag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hqlax", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe futures exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche boerse", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T17:30:19.015+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 18108, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=14100", "requestsLeft": 521}
