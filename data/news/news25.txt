However, he also claims that Bitcoin is “the last thing” he’d want to own in the event of a catastrophe. ‘The last thing I’d want to own is bitcoin’ In an interview with the New York City-based nonprofit think tank The Institute for New Economic Thinking, nocoiner Jim Chanos didn’t shy away from his negative opinions on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nIn addition to calling Bitcoin merely another fiat currency, Chanos ridiculed those who view cryptocurrencies as stores of value for the future while stereotyping Bitcoin proponents as doomsday conspiracy theorists. He stated :\nFor those who believe it’s a store of value in the coming apocalypse, the idea is that you’re going to have to safeguard your key under a mountain with fingerprint and eye scan security while the hordes are outside your bunker trying to get in to use it — for what, I have no idea. Because for those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that’s exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least. Food would work the best!\nNevertheless, Chanos still admits that such a situation could feasibly take place, though provides little advice — outside of investing in food. He merely claims to invest in Bitcoin, which allows you and you alone to maintain access to its stored value, is foolish. He explained:\nAnd if you say, well, fiat currency is going to bring the world down, which could, of course, happen, then I say the last thing I’d want to own is bitcoin if the grid goes down.\n(One can probably think of a few less valuable things to own “if the grid goes down.”) Difference of Opinion\nChanos’ opinion is not shared by everyone, of course.\nClem Chambers, CEO of ADVFN.com and author of Be Rich, The Game in Wall Street and Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner’s Guide , recently claimed Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are the new flight capital . Chambers explained:\nYou can’t head for the airport with gold bars these days, and opening a foreign bank account is a thankless task that can take months or never get done. A normal person sweating a war isn’t a billionaire with a private office, but in the old days they might have stashed a few thousand or even hundreds of thousands in gold if they thought the balloon was going up.\nToday you’d stash it in Bitcoin and be safe in the knowledge that you could fly away on holiday somewhere safe for a few months and your stash would be as safe as the place your hid you private keys. Conveniently Forgetting the Facts\nChanos summed up his opinion on Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market as such:\nSo this is simply a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough in monetary policy.\nAs is the case with many nocoiners, Chanos completely glossed over the “technological breakthrough” aspect of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies — namely, the ability to quickly transfer value across borders without the need for a middle-man via a publicly-verifiable distributed ledger, the ability to truly ‘be your own bank,’ the ability to create self-executing smart contracts, etc.\nWhat do you think of Jim Chanos’ opinions on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies? Can you think of a few less valuable things to own in the event of a catastrophe? Let us know in the comments below.\nImages courtesy of Bitcoinist archives, Shutterstock.

The resolution occurred on May 30, 2018. Perhaps this decision of the Korean authorities was caused not by the desire to assign legal status to digital currency, but to create conditions for the confiscation of digital assets in case of using them in cybercrimes and distribution of prohibited content. The widespread of such precedents in recent times is great.\nKorean legislation states that valuable assets include cash, deposits, shares and other forms of tangible and intangible objects that have a standard value. According to the decision of the Court , now bitcoin is classified as an intangible digital asset in the form of crypto files, it is traded on the exchange and can be used to accumulate profit and to make transactions.\nThis is the first such legal precedent, as for the first time in history the digital currency has received the status of a legal asset. This gives digital assets an increase in legitimacy. At the same time, South Korea is also engaged in the legalization and regulation of initial monetary offers (ICO). Recall that in September of the last year, there was implemented an internal ban on ICO in South Korea, which is still in force.\nIf we turn to the technical picture of the market, bitcoin price continues to consolidate in a narrow range of $7020- $7700, in which the market has been trading for two weeks. Yesterday, the market pushed off from the level of $7325 and was able to show positive dynamics. It is possible that, given the lack of positive news, it was Supreme Court decision news that supported the market and formed a positive impulse. So far, the market sentiment points to the fact that in the coming days there will be an upward impulse and will finally see the capture of the resistance level around $7700. If bulls initiative is supported by the incoming bitcoin volume, the market will be able to test the mark of $8100.\nFortFS ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "supreme court of south korea", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T16:51:34.039+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7ca87fb22f393c134964341b52904de2a101f91e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTx1MBVMId6fvijPOAWWgXv9CO4moMz4ck09TmXalzlcXBuRSzVAfK75ypJ3uS9XhSKM1KGoobhtw1eZDVeOPBgcxva0oDR8VBnbx0IO3L1UrDuhNOvwW0IuoAKU3p3.TkIBZuAOcXd_c_JaQVHYIoDQD7mG8lRPF1OVLypjGjhE2hTmd20_XBH", "site_full": "compliancex.com", "site": "compliancex.com", "site_section": "http://compliancex.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Compliancex", "title": "A secretive Chicago trading firm is planning to move bitcoin trading out of chatrooms and into the 21st century", "title_full": "A secretive Chicago trading firm is planning to move bitcoin trading out of chatrooms and into the 21st century", "published": "2018-06-06T16:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7ca87fb22f393c134964341b52904de2a101f91e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTx1MBVMId6fvijPOAWWgXv9CO4moMz4ck09TmXalzlcXBuRSzVAfK75ypJ3uS9XhSKM1KGoobhtw1eZDVeOPBgcxva0oDR8VBnbx0IO3L1UrDuhNOvwW0IuoAKU3p3.TkIBZuAOcXd_c_JaQVHYIoDQD7mG8lRPF1OVLypjGjhE2hTmd20_XBH", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Steve Haase", "published": "2018-06-06T16:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "A secretive Chicago trading firm is planning to move bitcoin trading out of chatrooms and into the 21st century", "text": "Steve Haase 06T09:51:25+00:00 2018-06-06T09:51:25+00:\nCryptocurrencies are viewed by many of their evangelists as one of the most groundbreaking financial innovations of the modern age. But the way crypto trades looks like something out of an old-school Wall Street flick.\nFor the most part, trading firms are making multimillion-dollar crypto trades over the phone, not electronically. DRW’s crypto arm, Cumberland, uses Skype calls to conduct its bitcoin dealmaking, Reuters reported .\nBut Jump Trading, the Chicago-based firm, has built a platform that will allow it to take the other side of large crypto trades electronically with its counterparties, according to people familiar with the matter. The so-called graphical user interface allows those counterparties to interact with Jump on a desktop. It does not allow users to connect to external trading exchanges.\nJump is known for its ultra-high-speed trading strategies, but it has also been developing what it calls a “ lower frequency trading strategy .” It’s also known for its discretion, with little information on the firm available on its website .\nThe new platform shows that Jump is taking the new market for cryptocurrencies seriously, according to a person familiar with the firm’s thinking. Also, the firm believes that voice and chatroom environments don’t leave a clear audit trail, the person said.\nJump Capital, the venture-capital firm affiliated with Jump Trading, has made crypto a focus for 2018, as previously reported by Business Insider .\n“GUIs are not unique,” Michael Dunworth, the CEO of Wyre, a blockchain tech company, told Business Insider. “But it is impressive that Jump built it.”\nThe move shows the cryptocurrency market is maturing in a similar way to the now multitrillion-dollar foreign-exchange market, which in its earliest days saw trades conducted mostly over the phone, says John Spallanzani, a former FX trader at Sumitomo Mitsui who is now a portfolio manager at Miller Value Partners.\n“We used to call 20 banks at once for spot FX prices,” Spallanzani said of forex trading in the 1990s.\n“It’s without a doubt maturing just by the fact that there’s so many OTC desks out in the mix,” Dunworth added.\nThe crypto exchange Kraken set up an OTC desk in New York, Business Insider first reported . There’s also Genesis Global Trading and itBit, the OTC run by Paxos.\nAt the same time, crypto-focused investment funds are opening up at a record pace, according to new research by Crypto Fund Research. Sixty-one new funds have launched in 2018, according to the firm’s research, bringing the total number above 366 globally. Such funds together manage only a paltry $5 billion, however, a fraction of the $3.2 trillion managed by the hedge fund industry.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-otc/otc-crypto-market-flourishes-powered-by-skype-idUSKCN1H91P4", "http://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-veteran-leaves-credit-suisse-for-crypto-trading-desk-2018-4", "http://www.jumptrading.com/apply.html?gh_jid=564222", "http://www.jumptrading.com/", "http://www.businessinsider.com/jump-trading-is-making-crypto-a-big-focus-2018-4"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve haase", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "skype", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cumberland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T10:06:17.044+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2377f69800c5c0253f379dd63d189d7b27bfba51", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTVhUNUUR.ZzG8nTyBCDgxoLOEOOjD6rlgJEaCXwqRnkzR466QKLcXMJwjJR.mcUPYEc.Oa3fo6pmeLDlhk3IRY8eUk3RhSgzoEmewHm_z0IGBYJYG1QOdke3.HfxPBNCIIRoTpsc4_A9cv_R5IuXaXzpwyLgCpMmrv540dvMNqsQ--", "site_full": "www.newkerala.com", "site": "newkerala.com", "site_section": "http://www.newkerala.com/world-news.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "World News Update", "title": "Bank Robber No Longer Needs Banks: Turns to Stacking Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrency", "title_full": "Bank Robber No Longer Needs Banks: Turns to Stacking Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrency", "published": "2018-06-06T16:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 61094, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2377f69800c5c0253f379dd63d189d7b27bfba51", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTVhUNUUR.ZzG8nTyBCDgxoLOEOOjD6rlgJEaCXwqRnkzR466QKLcXMJwjJR.mcUPYEc.Oa3fo6pmeLDlhk3IRY8eUk3RhSgzoEmewHm_z0IGBYJYG1QOdke3.HfxPBNCIIRoTpsc4_A9cv_R5IuXaXzpwyLgCpMmrv540dvMNqsQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T16:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bank Robber No Longer Needs Banks: Turns to Stacking Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrency", "text": "Bank Robber No Longer Needs Banks: Turns to Stacking Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrency Jun 06, 2018 (14 hours ago) PRN OMAHA, Neb.: The \"Skinny Bandit\" brazenly robbed banks on the mean streets of San Diego, but he no longer needs banks because of his steady success in trading Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Meticulous and calculating, Richard Stanley evaded capture with each additional bank heist. The FBI was puzzled about the elusive yet polite robber who approached tellers saying, \"Put the money on the counter...\" and walked away with thousands in cash in a clear plastic bag.Upon his sudden arrest, the shocking truth was revealed when this criminal mastermind who outwitted authorities turned out to be an eighteen-year-old white kid from the Hispanic gang-filled streets.With his \"degree in business\" from one of California's finest \"correctional\" institutions where he was given a free ride in their eight-year program (with a seven-month sabbatical in solitude), he's graduated from robbing banks to stacking Bitcoin as a legit entrepreneur and shares a vital message: People can change.Today, Stanley is a successful entrepreneur, in business in the adult marketing world, and a daytrader in cryptocurrency.Stanley did his time in Donovan, a rough Southern California prison, where he hustled to stay up on game and where he experienced the real Orange Is the New Black.In his memoir UP ON GAME: From Robbing Banks to Stacking Bitcoin, Stanley recounts a tumultuous childhood of growing up in the dangerous neighborhood of Otay, surrounded by gangs, drugs, violence, and poverty.Stanley illustrates what daily life was like in jail, his interactions with other inmates, and the dark side of the correctional officers whose jobs are to maintain law and order.

Eligma, a financial technology startup, was asked to design a cryptocurrency transaction system called “Elipay” for all shops in the mall to conduct payments using BTC solely.\nBTC company was initially established in 1954 as a warehouse. Nevertheless, it became a large shopping complex under the name of BTC City with nearly 500 business ventures situated on its territory. Now Eligma team is planning to turn this huge commercial project into a unified online platform. This is believed to reduce ownership costs for the retailers as they will need showrooms instead of large stores, keeping all items in stock.\nWith the new fintech testing being arranged for mid-June, a lot of retail shops in the Bitcoin City have started to use this system already now. For example, Atlantis water park, Al Capone, Babadu, Minicity, and some other ventures accept the digital currency, namely Bitcoin as a payment option.\nIt is worth mentioning that the Prime Minister of Slovenia Dr Miro Cerar stopped by BTC city on May 25 during the opening ceremony of the Beyond 4.0 international conference, which was devoted to virtual coins and blockchain.

Jun 06, 2018\nBy Camila Russo\n(Bloomberg) --ETF providers hope to have cracked regulators’ code for creating the first exchange-traded product backed by Bitcoin -- but it’s going to cost you.\nVan Eck Associates Corp. and SolidX Partners Inc. filed a request to list a Bitcoin-linked ETP to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. The fund will be physically-backed, which means it will hold actual Bitcoin, and will be insured against loss or theft of the cryptocurrency, according to the firms.\nThe SEC asked companies to pull about a dozen applications for cryptocurrency-linked products in January, and last year rejected the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF. SolidX and VanEck were among the companies who had filed to list funds. They hope to have addressed regulators’ concerns with changes they made in the new, joint request by increasing the share price and basing prices off regulated trading firms, according to SolidX Chief Executive Officer Daniel H. Gallancy.\n“Based on various comments, it seems that regulators are concerned right now about having an ETF that is available to retail investors,” Gallancy said in a telephone interview. “We think that will change over time, but right now a good place to start is with a product geared purely toward institutional investors.”\nHopes for a Bitcoin ETF were running high last year after the CME Group Inc. and Cboe Global Markets Inc. listed Bitcoin futures, as investors speculated the SEC might approve funds linked to financial instruments trading on major exchanges. But those expectations soured as regulators said they were concerned about the high volatility and lack of depth in the market, and about pricing and trading that would be based on lightly regulated platforms.\nSolidX and VanEck want to address these concerns by basing prices for the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust on an index that tracks over-the-counter trading by U.S.-based institutions, which are regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. MVIS, a subsidiary of New York-based VanEck, will compile the index and publish price updates throughout the day.\nVanEck oversees more than $45 billion in assets and manages more than 70 exchange-traded products. SolidX is a New York-based financial technology company, developing cryptography software and capital markets products.\nIf approved, the fund will have a share price of approximately $200,000, compared with most ETFs which launch with double-digit share price, to target institutional investors, Gallancy said. This would be a change from the focus in the ETF industry, which has traditionally been on individual investors.\nSolidX would handle custody of Bitcoin using a so-called cold storage solution, which means so-called private keys that serve as ownership codes are kept off line. Funds will be insured one-to-one by a syndicate of insurers, which the firms didn’t disclose.\nVanEck had previously filed a Bitcoin future-based ETF. A physically-backed Bitcoin ETF will be attractive as it tracks Bitcoin spot prices more closely, said the firm’s head, Jan van Eck. Both van Eck and SolidX’s Gallancy say they own Bitcoin.To contact the reporter on this story: Camila Russo in New York at [email protected] To contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael P.

(\"Virtual Crypto\", or the \"Company\") ( OTCQB: VRCP ), a technology company dedicated to making cryptocurrencies accessible to the public, announced that it will launch its bitcoin ATM at the TechCrunch Tel Aviv event tomorrow ( June 7, 2018 ).\nIn contrast to most bitcoin ATM platforms, which only allow the purchase of bitcoin, Virtual Crypto's NetoBit ATM is a bi-directional platform that enables users to sell bitcoin as well, i.e. convert bitcoin currencies to regular fiat money, and to buy bitcoin, i.e. convert fiat money to bitcoin. NetoBit ATM is the world's first and only ATM that allows real time conversion, purchase and sale of bitcoin. The product, which already supports most common currencies, is available for purchase globally.\nNetoBit ATM is the second product in Virtual Crypto's NetoBit software and hardware products portfolio. In April 2018 , the Company launched its first product, NetoBit Pay, a retail point-of-sale (\"POS\") device that enables businesses worldwide to securely receive payments in bitcoin in real time, while enjoying protection against exchange rate volatility and guaranteeing transactions up to a value of $3,000 .\nThe cryptocurrencies ATM market, in which Virtual Crypto operates, enjoys exceptional growth rates. According to a study by Coherent Market Insights from October 2017 , the size of the market in 2017 was around $14 billion , but it is expected to grow at a compound average growth rate of 46% between the years 2017 and 2025.\nNetoBit solutions, including Netobit ATM, are different from many other solutions in at least three ways. First, Virtual Crypto's validation algorithm can very precisely and quickly predict if a cryptocurrency transaction will be approved immediately by a blockchain at the moment of the transaction, before the block is digitally signed. This quick process allows the approval of the crypto transaction within seconds to minutes, rather than between 10 minutes and 24 hours and following a process of six confirmations, as is the case today. This way, Virtual Crypto can create a pleasant and immediate transaction experience, minimizing the risk of fraud, which can occur in the usual lengthy transaction approval processes. Consequently, NetoBit ATM users can draw cash and transfer money from and to their digital wallets in seconds.\nSecond, cryptocurrency trading platforms usually allow the customer carrying out the transaction to interact with only one crypto exchange, shackling the customer to the exchange rate which that exchange offers. Virtual Crypto allows the customer to work with several crypto exchanges simultaneously for each transaction. In this way, the Virtual Crypto algorithms can immediately locate the best crypto deal and offer the most attractive exchange rate while the transaction is underway. This ability enables the Company to protect the transaction from currency volatility that is liable to occur during the current lengthy transaction approval process and offer guarantee for transactions of up to $3,000 .\nThird, the implementation of Virtual Crypto's financial management system allows the operation of a large number of cryptocurrency ATMs and points of sale and provides tools that help manage and track the flow of money in each and every terminal. The back-office capabilities include setting currency price limits for each transaction, defining the KYC (Know Your Customer – customer identification), conforming to different regulations and configurations in different countries, managing risk and providing useful statistical data on transactions and points of sale. These capabilities are different from many other solutions that offer back-office capabilities which can manage only one transaction center.\nAlon Dayan , CEO of Virtual Crypto Technologies Ltd. commented on the announcement, \"We continue to set standards for the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. Our proprietary algorithm reduced the typical transaction time from 10 to 60 minutes to several seconds. At this stage, NetoBit ATMs combine that speed with the convenience of an ATM, giving customers the ability to buy and sell bitcoin with fiat money. The result is a vastly improved trading experience for customers, which we believe will be attractive to our business partners as well as consumers.\"\nAbout Virtual Crypto Technologies Inc.\nVirtual Crypto Technologies Inc.

The Tap and Spile in the quaint market town of Guisborough believes it is the region’s first public house to allow payment of Bitcoin and other digital currencies to cover the cost of pints. The pub’s landlord, Phil Barkley, has been investing in Bitcoin himself for a number of months and opted to start allowing his customers to pay using Bitcoin and Litecoin – even though the pub doesn’t accept card payments as it’s not deemed financially viable.\nVisitors to The Tap and Spile can pay for their round of drinks using cryptocurrency by scanning a QR code which automatically removes the cash value of their beverages from their cryptocurrency wallet. Several other pubs have accepted Bitcoin as a form of payment in the last few years, with the trendy Pembury Tavern in London’s East End and Edinburgh’s Royal Dick having two of the most prominent crypto-conscious landlords.\nMr Barkley insists the world is “changing”, thanks to the ability to “pay for something across the world in seconds using Bitcoin without relying on banks or third parties to get involved”. Barkley’s pub does not have a card machine as the costs of hiring the machine and paying for each transaction were deemed too extravagant for a pub that doesn’t serve food. He believes the addition of Bitcoin and Litecoin as acceptable payment methods is a more suitable option, as it is the “future of money”.\nImage: Pixabay.com\nIf the pub’s valued customers grow accustomed to using Bitcoin and Litecoin to pay for their drinks, crypto-payment methods are set to be rolled out across other pubs in the region operating within the same pub group. This includes The Miners Arms in Eston and The Fountain in Ormesby. Barkley intimated that he would be hosting a talk about Bitcoin and Litecoin in a bid to educate his customers about using cryptocurrency in his establishment. Buying Bitcoin has become easier than ever for first-time buyers, as there is a huge range of rated and reviewed Bitcoin exchanges that allow individuals to buy and sell Bitcoin between one another.\nLitecoin, regarded as Bitcoin’s little brother in the cryptocurrency world, was specifically designed to be used as a payment method for goods such as beverages. As the silver of cryptocurrency, Litecoin is faster to process transactions, which is music to the ears of establishments such as public houses. It can confirm payments four times faster than a Bitcoin transaction. This makes Litecoin a more secure crypto-environment than Bitcoin, minimising the chance of so-called double-spending attacks . This cyber-criminal activity sees hackers spend the same cryptocurrency twice to pay for two separate transactions.

The Supreme Court ordered the city court to hear the appeal. Russian Court Overturned Previous Decision St. Petersburg City Court.\nThe St. Petersburg City Court has overturned the ruling of the Vyborgsky District Court of St. Petersburg to block the Bitcoininfo.ru website in Russia.\n“The St. Petersburg City Court quashed the decision of the district court to recognize the information posted on the Bitcoininfo.ru website,” Tass reported the city court explaining on Monday, June 4.\n“Vyborg District Court of St. Petersburg will again consider the case of the blocking of the site on cryptocurrencies, www.bitcoininfo.ru,” Rapsi learned from the city court, adding:\nThe city court canceled the decision to block the site and sent the case [back] to the Vyborgsky District Court for a new hearing. Problem With Spreading Crypto Information\nThis case began in July 2016 when the St. Petersburg Vyborgsky District Court made the ruling to block the Bitcoininfo.ru website in absence of the site owner. The court “considered the statement of the prosecutor’s office that the site contains information about cryptocurrencies” and decided to block the site, the publication detailed.\nAccording to the case file, Tass explained that the prosecutor’s office demanded the site be blocked based on its content about cryptocurrencies that “do not lend themselves to state control,”“promote the growth of the shadow economy,” and “do not have certain consumer properties.”\nThe representative of the website’s owner, Sarkis Darbinyan, told the publication that the prosecutor’s actions “takes place without the involvement of site owners,” adding that none of them received “requests for the removal of prohibited information, and the city court refuses to accept appeals after the actual blocking of websites.”\nHe further detailed:\nAccording to the statements of the prosecutor’s office of St. Petersburg, about 100 sites devoted to cryptocurrencies have been blocked.\nThe domain administrator appealed against the court’s decision, believing it to be illegal. However, the city court did not consider his appeal so he appealed to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, which subsequently ordered the city court to consider his complaint.\nIn March, the St. Petersburg City Court struck down a ban on 40 bitcoin-related websites offering information about cryptocurrencies and exchange services in Russia, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported .\nDo you think bitcoin websites will finally be unblocked in Russia?

The banknote in question belongs to Brunei, one of the most centralized countries in the world, and has one of the richest men alive printed on it.\nBrunei’s B$10,000 bill is worth, at press time, roughly $7,584. Bitcoin, according to CCN’s price Index , is trading at about $7,700 after surging from about $7,460 in the last 24-hour period. The bill has a portrait of Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, and was issued in 2006.\nSultan Hassanal Bolkiah, one of the last absolute monarchs, is notably one of the richest men on Earth, as reports suggest he is worth over $20 billion, thanks to the country’s vast oil and gas fields, which account for nearly all of its economy.\nBrunei has less than half a million residents, and recently adopted strict Islamic sharia law, which drew criticism from various international rights groups. Back in December, when most cryptocurrencies were at an all-time high, the country’s central bank reportedly cautioned against cryptocurrencies.\nPhasing out high-denomination notes The Brunei dollar’s value is legally par with the Singaporean dollar. Singapore itself had its own S$10,000, but reportedly discontinued it. High-denomination bills are being retired throughout the world, as these reportedly make it easier to conduct illicit activities such as terrorism financing, money laundering, and tax evasion.\nRecently, Latvia got rid of its 500-lat note, worth about $982, after becoming the eurozone’s 13th member. The eurozone itself is phasing out its €500 bill over similar concerns. Brunei’s high-denomination bill remains as the country is seen as a low threat for money laundering and terrorism financing.\nSwitzerland, which recently called for a study on the potential risks and benefits of issuing a state cryptocurrency dubbed “e-franc, ” has been resisting pressure to stop printing its 1,00-franc note, which currently accounts for more than 40% of its bills in circulation.\nAccording to an International Monetary Fund (IMF) article , a briefcase with $100 bills would be 70% full, while a briefcase with Brunei’s largest note would only be 1.5% full. Being easy to transport makes these bills ideal for criminals, the article suggests.

However, the city court did not consider his appeal so he appealed to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, which subsequently ordered the city court to consider his complaint.\nIn March, the St. Petersburg City Court struck down a ban on 40 bitcoin-related websites offering information about cryptocurrencies and exchange services in Russia, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported .\nDo you think bitcoin websites will finally be unblocked in Russia?

The 50 SMA is limiting the gains on the upside while the short term support has been highlighted at $44.00.\nBitcoin Gold has become a troubled cryptocurrency lately, simply, because it has fallen victim to a couple of attacks in a period spanning only two months. The team has, however, communicated that in the next software upgrade, it is going to implement a new Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm. This decision has come after experiencing a 51% as well as double spending attacks on the platform.\nThe upgrade will be executed in a “hard fork”, besides it will take this opportunity to address the latest concerns regarding the threat coming from ASIC miners. The algorithm has been dubbed Equihash-BTG and is designed to make ASIC mining extremely unprofitable. The protocol is still in development but the team says the majority of the code has been written. The time and date for the upgrade will be communicated in the near future, moreover, there will be an announcement of the same at least a week before the update. While commenting on security issues, BTG said:\n“We’re also working hard on many fronts to improve security, both now and in the future. We’ve developed monitoring systems for our blockchain and our mining network, and have established channels to rapidly communicate risks to Exchanges.”\nBitcoin Gold price analysis\nBitcoin Gold price declined sharply during the Asian trading hours on Monday, but the downside was supported by the bullish trendline. The buyers battled for a breakout during the session on Tuesday, although the gains were cut short slightly below $46.00. The weak support at $45.00 failed to hold the price which is currently dancing with $44.8. The 50 SMA is limiting the gains on the upside, while the short-term support has been highlighted at $44.00 which also coincides with the bullish trendline.\nBTG/USD 1-hour chart", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis", "https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin gold", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "crypto news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "asic", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T16:11:22.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ea6785d094e6730ae1c4b8827280f7897b81ce4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFTah3Hm78pQVxuABrhojHZ0gAhMbteQYePsf58MskHLQH0bhrsQmYqe9vDqLpEe93YK73SHUQUhpS5e72RDUe8ofUkFswyVwPib6g7vVgnljbN0aoCUm27H", "site_full": "forextv.com", "site": "forextv.com", "site_section": "http://forextv.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "retirement_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "ForexTV", "title": "Dragons’ Den stars used in fake ads to dupe investors into dubious Bitcoin platforms", "title_full": "Dragons’ Den stars used in fake ads to dupe investors into dubious Bitcoin platforms", "published": "2018-06-06T16:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ea6785d094e6730ae1c4b8827280f7897b81ce4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFTah3Hm78pQVxuABrhojHZ0gAhMbteQYePsf58MskHLQH0bhrsQmYqe9vDqLpEe93YK73SHUQUhpS5e72RDUe8ofUkFswyVwPib6g7vVgnljbN0aoCUm27H", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin News Editor", "published": "2018-06-06T16:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Dragons’ Den stars used in fake ads to dupe investors into dubious Bitcoin platforms", "text": "Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Risk Disclaimer - By using this web site you agree to its terms and conditions.

It was one hell of the roller coaster ride that month as Bitcoin then lost almost half of its worth in a matter of days right ahead of Christmas falling to $11k.\nRinse and repeat! The crypto king started to grow again, and then I posted another map at the end of 2017, which implied a pullback to the $16k-$20k area before another huge drop to the $7500 area. Amazingly, both the upside and downside forecasted areas were hit accurately (click on the play button to see how price emerged).\nThe Bitcoin buzz is coming down with the price staying below $10k. It is like a superstar who has seen his best times already and is on the tour to the countries where he is still warmly welcomed as we are not in the $20k euphoria area now (we can call it a “cocaine” time) although you can still buy some pleasant things selling just one coin for more than $7k these days.\nIn this post, I would like to share with you a familiar pattern I spotted recently on the Bitcoin chart. Chart: Bitcoin Weekly: On The Crossroads\nChart courtesy of tradingview.com\nAfter losing 70% of the price from the peak ($20k) to the low of 2018 ($6k), there was another good attempt to start the cooling engine of Bitcoin. Crypto-investors took their chance to buy the coin on the panic selling, and the price doubled as there was follow-through demand as people thought that the $20k is in the cards again, some very optimistic guys called for 100K based on exponential growth. But it appeared to be just a good correction and those who didn’t want to quit the coin below the $10k at the first drop, took their second chance to get rid of it during that temporary strength. Then we saw another rally to the $10k and another drop to the $7k.\nThe volatility evaporated from this market with the smart money pulling out of it. The range of the fluctuations is getting narrower every other zigzag, and it shapes the familiar Triangle pattern (orange). As we are moving closer to the apex of the pattern we should expect the breakout soon.\nI highlighted both upside and downside targets of either case. If we get the upside break, then Bitcoin could hit the $14.6k level to build the hope for a revival. On the other hand, if the crypto-currency goes below the downside of the pattern, then we could reach the $1250, which would mean the oblivion for the coin.\nI added the confirmation levels at the $9950 for the upside move and at the $6400 for another drop to avoid false breaks.

It is the cutting edge cryptocurrency that the market has needed and provides a future platform for all cryptocurrencies, like the new BitRich coin to have a future.\nMore information can be found at: www.nownpay.com\nCryptocurrency and blockchain is the future, and represents a huge shift in the market for a number of industries. It’s for this reason that legendary Apple founder, Steve Wozniak, predicted that blockchain would be the next IT revolution.\nAttending the “We Are Developers World Congress 2018”, he reiterated his early support of blockchain and investing in cryptocurrencies. It is something he knows about through personal experience, as he has seen his initial investment grow to $20,000.\nThe cryptocurrency market is growing at a fast rate, with major players like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple competing with new currencies like BitRich Global. Headquartered in Los Angeles, CA, this cryptocurrency will debut in late June 2018 through its Swiss registered BitRich label in its own ICO.\nBitRich Global is focused on finding individual consumers who are investing in cryptocurrency. However, it is also concerned with consumers who want to spend their BitRich, Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrency investments through the use of a point-of-sale debit-style card.\nThere are those who question investing in cryptocurrency, and many because of its lack of usability in the marketplace, but many entrepreneurs believe that the use of cryptocurrencies and blockchain will increase trade and economic prosperity through further development like NowAndPay.com.\nWozniak saw the future and invested smartly in the cryptocurrency market, and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey concurred. However, the platform to buy and sell goods on a POS system was not available until now.\nNowAndPay is at the forefront of the industry, and changes the way people invest in cryptocurrency. It means that cryptocurrencies can have a real future as a currency, allowing people to buy and sell products and services.\nMore information on BitRich, one of the coins it can benefit, is available at: http://www.bitrich.tech\nContact Info:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.nownpay.com/", "http://www.bitrich.tech/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T17:06:40.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0215b1cf8fc07f11f182d7b2333e86e4d96a92fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScqJxGpeUZ0zn.IcpZp2Z3LBFuiJZN0ktcILwENankP0HS94grPJ7vDhJReApUmY2MYS8XFRe0IrmAU4PQRzjSU54FLuxpEA1i_gI7B6DGRA--", "site_full": "www.politico.com", "site": "politico.com", "site_section": "http://www.politico.com/rss/morningmoney.xml", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics"], "section_title": "Morning Money", "title": "Bitcoin revisited", "title_full": "Bitcoin revisited - POLITICO", "published": "2018-06-06T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.politico.com/da/f5/44342c424c68b675719324b1106b/politico.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 531, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0215b1cf8fc07f11f182d7b2333e86e4d96a92fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScqJxGpeUZ0zn.IcpZp2Z3LBFuiJZN0ktcILwENankP0HS94grPJ7vDhJReApUmY2MYS8XFRe0IrmAU4PQRzjSU54FLuxpEA1i_gI7B6DGRA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jack Shafer", "published": "2018-06-06T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin revisited", "text": "BITCOIN REVISITED — The latest POLITICO Money podcast explains what’s happening with Bitcoin (including what became of MM’s little investment) and other crypto currencies, including the potential for new federal oversight and congressional scrutiny.

CEO Richard Hunt’s prepared testimony at Wednesday’s House Financial Services Committee hearing on the CFPB: “When Congress … created the Bureau, it was granted jurisdiction over more than 11,000 banks and credit unions as well as countless non-depository institutions.\n“It was also given unprecedented rulemaking, supervision, and enforcement powers for nearly every financial institution and virtually all consumer financial products.

Such a deal could presage further progress on trade talks with the Chinese though it would infuriate many lawmakers who view the company as a serious threat to U.S. national security.\nPOLITICO’s Adam Behsudi has the details : “The Trump administration has not yet reached a ‘definitive; deal that would roll back harsh sanctions on Chinese telecommunication company ZTE, a Commerce Department spokesman said. … The statement comes after Reuters reported that a deal in principle had been reached with the Chinese firm, backtracking from a decision in April to ban U.S. companies from doing any business with ZTE for seven years”\nNOBODY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE G-7 — POLITICO’s Andrew Restuccia, Megan Cassella, and Lorraine Woellert with the grim outlook for the gathering that kicks off on Friday: “Foreign diplomats and U.S. officials are looking ahead to this week’s G-7 summit with a sense of dread amid growing international tensions with … Trump and little hope of reaching consensus.\n“With just three days until Trump arrives in Canada for the annual meeting with America’s closest foreign allies, member countries are fuming over the president’s decision to impose steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, a move that could have dire economic consequences for every other member of the Group of Seven major industrial nations.” Read more .\nTRUMP TO AVOID CHINESE IRE IN TAIWAN — Via Zhenhua Lu of the South China Morning Post as part of POLITICO’s content partnership: “When the American Institute in Taiwan — the unofficial U.S. embassy in Taipei — opens its new offices on June 12, the Trump administration will refrain from sending any cabinet-level officials to the ceremony, three sources have told the South China Morning Post.\n“That message was conveyed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to his Chinese counterparts — including Vice-Premier Liu He — during trade negotiations in Beijing in May, one of the sources said.” Read more .\nHOW TOYS “R” US COLLAPSED — Cover story in the new Bloomberg Businessweek looks at the fall of the toy retailer: “When it all came crashing down in March, Toys 'R' Us had just about run out of cash, and it could find no one willing to replenish its accounts.

His preference now, and he asked me to convey this, is to actually negotiate with Mexico and Canada separately,’ Kudlow said on Fox News. ‘He prefers bilateral negotiations and he‘s looking at two, much different countries.’\n“Kudlow added that the president ‘may be moving quickly toward these bilateral discussions’ but cautioned that Trump does not want to pull out of NAFTA. ‘The president is not going to leave NAFTA, he‘s not going to withdraw from NAFTA.

It says, go ahead and police yourselves – we know how well that turned out last time.” Video .\nMNUCHIN TAKES A DIFFERENT VIEW — Per Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin: “The notice issued today by the prudential banking and market regulators will meaningfully improve the regulations that implement the Volcker Rule.

Five big tech companies — Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Nvidia — closed at historic highs on Tuesday. Alibaba and Facebook have done the same in recent days. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has returned to record territory, up 8 percent since the end of April. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average remain 4.3 percent and 6.8 percent off the records they set on Jan. 26.\n“The rally has come as the global economy shows signs of strain.

Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) plans to unveil a measure … that would give Congress power to block …. Trump's tariffs, opening a GOP rift over how and whether to push back on the White House's trade policy. Corker's proposal would set up a fast-track process for Congress to sign off on tariffs linked to national security and is picking up steam as he attempts to attach it to the annual defense authorization bill …\n“Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Tuesday ruled out a stand-alone vote on the legislation but suggested that it could get consideration during the defense debate. The tariff effort remains a long shot, with McConnell describing it as ‘contentious,’ but it still represents a critical test of the GOP's willingness to take on the president.” Read more .\nSTARBUCKS’ SCHULTZ COULD RAISE BIG CASH — CNBC’s Brian Schwartz: “Howard Schultz's departure from Starbucks has stirred fresh speculation he could run for president in 2020. And his strong connection to other business leaders could help him build a big campaign war chest. Schultz, a billionaire himself, has been mingling with c-suite executives ever since he became chief executive officer of the popular coffee chain in 1986.\n“This was particularly evident in 2011 when he called on industry titans to sign a letter pledging to not contribute to political campaigns until lawmakers put an ‘end to partisan gridlock’ and pass a bipartisan debt and deficit package in order to control the increasing debt in the United States.” Read more .\nFAKE CHINESE COMPANIES A RISK TO U.S. MARKETS — Bloomberg’s Hema Parmar and Erik Schatzker: “Fraudulent Chinese companies pose a risk to U.S. markets and investors should consider the nation’s equities ‘sin stocks,’ said short-seller Carson Block. ‘I don’t think there’s any parallel in the history of capital markets where you’ve had this systemic issue of literally hundreds of frauds going to another country’s capital market to suck up capital and expatriate it to their home country,’ Block said at the Bloomberg Invest conference in New York Tuesday.” Read more .\nMULVANEY SIDES WITH PAYDAY LENDERS — NYT’s Stacy Cowley: “Payday lenders fought, and lost, a battle to block new federal rules curbing short-term loans that critics say can trap people in cycles of debt. Now, with the restrictions scheduled to take effect next year, the lenders have moved their fight to the courtroom, and have gained a powerful ally: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which wrote the rules the industry is seeking to overturn.\n“In a joint motion filed late last week in federal court in Austin, Tex., Mick Mulvaney, the bureau’s acting director, sided with two industry trade groups suing the agency. The bureau asked a judge to delay the rules until after the industry groups’ lawsuit is resolved, which may take years. By then, the entire issue could be moot: Mr. Mulvaney has said he intends for the bureau to reconsider, and perhaps repeal, the rules. To do that, the agency has to follow a formal administrative process, which it has said it plans to begin by February.” Read more .\nWORLD BANK SAYS GROWTH WILL SLOW — AP’s Paul Wiseman: “The steadily expanding global economy should remain resilient — at least for a couple of years — the World Bank says.

The elevation of Murray, a Journal mainstay for almost a quarter century, was greeted favorably among staff after a dramatic past couple years that’s included frustrations over Baker’s perceived unwillingness to go after … Trump boiling over publicly, along with high-level departures in New York and a mini-exodus from the Washington bureau.” Read more .\n** A message from the Financial Services Forum: The Financial Services Forum is an economic policy and advocacy organization whose members are the chief executive officers of the eight largest and most diversified financial institutions headquartered in the United States.

Hackernews\nThe Enforcement Directorate (ED)’s questioning by Raj Kundra, businessman, and husband of Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty, at its Mumbai office in connection with an alleged bitcoin scam for eight gruelling hours may have opened up a can of worms with many the names of many celebrities cropping up, according to recent reports .\nThe high-profile celebrities whose names came up during the questioning are Sunny Leone, Prachi Desai, Aarti Chhabria, Sonal Chauhan, Karishma Tanna, Zareen Khan, Neha Dhupia, Huma Qureshi, and Nargis Fakhri. The law enforcement agency may also question Kundra’s wife, actress Shilpa Shetty. The questioning revolves around Raj Kundra alleged links with Amit Bhardwaj, who has been accused of a $300 Mn bitcoin scam .\nAs reported yesterday (June 5), Kundra’s name in the said scam cropped up during the ongoing interrogation of Amit Bharadwaj. Bitcoin Scam: The Ongoing Saga\nIt’s been two months since Amit Bhardwaj and his brother Vivek Bhardwaj were arrested from the Delhi Airport on their arrival from Bangkok on charges of allegedly cheating 8,000 people across the country and abroad to the tune of $300 Mn (INR 2,000 Cr).\nIn 2016, Bhardwaj had established a slew of startups which were dealing with all the aspects of cryptocurrencies — mining, exchange, wallet, research and development, and MLM schemes.\nThe scam came to light when, in July last year, Zakhil Suresh, a GainBitcoin investor , started a petition on change.org. Signed by more than 1,000 people, the petition appealed for Bhardwaj’s arrest for alleged fraudulent schemes.\nThe police had also arrested seven people, including Hemant Vishwas, Hemant Babasaheb Chavan, Ajay Tanaji Saheb, Pankaj Srinandkishore, and Chandrakant Bhope, in connection with the scam. A couple of weeks ago, Darwin Labs founders Sahil Baghla (former Bluegape founder) and Nikunj Jain (former Frankly.me founder and an angel investor) had been arrested in connection with the Bhardwaj case.\nAlthough this is the most high profile cryptocurrency scam to come to light in India, there have been previous instances where cryptocurrency, a relatively new concept with lack of clarity around how the technology works, has been used to lure naive victims all in the hopes of making a quick buck.\nLast year, a gang of crooks which floated a fictitious cryptocurrency Kashhcoins set up a website and duped several people in Delhi and other parts of the country before the crime branch arrested a key player. The arrests came after the police were tipped by one of the buyers who was duped off $21,824 (INR14 lakh).\nCases like these are a definite blow to bitcoin enthusiasts in India who hope to see the digital currency be made legal. Right now, the cryptocurrency is neither legal or illegal, but the government and authorities seem to be very critical of it.\nIn fact, the RBI banned banks from allowing people to transfer money from their bank account into bitcoin wallets. Laws and regulations, to a certain extent, are dictated by the public’s awareness and its perception. Cases like these can lead to increased distrust among both consumers and regulators.\nWith celebrities getting involved in the Bitcoin scam, many will be introduced to the world of cryptocurrency through the Bhardwaj case, which could serve as a precedent of what is to come in the future of Bitcoins and cryptocurrency in India.

Addressing a press conference here, Pradhan reiterated that the government was working on a long-term solution to address oil price fluctuations while taking a holistic view of all factors. He said there was a greater conducive environment to bring petroleum products under the Goods and Services Tax (GST), however adding that the GST Council would have to take a call on that. “I stand by my statement: the government will take a holistic view. There are three major factors for oil price hike — geopolitics leading to fluctuation in international crude oil prices, exchange rate fluctuation between dollar and Indian currency, and taxation structure of our country where some taxes are imposed by state governments and (Centre imposes) excise duty,” Pradhan said. “Taking into account all this and while ensuring that India’s poor and middle classes do not have to bear the pinch (due to oil prices), the government will take all necessary steps.” Asked if as part of the “long-term plan” to deal with rising fuel prices, the government was considering partial rollback of deregulation, Pradhan said: “That question doesn’t arise. It is a reformist government. We cannot go back on reforms.” The Minister said that while reduction in petrol and diesel prices had started, albeit due to international developments, the government is “sensitive and committed towards interests of poor and middle classes”. “No one can predict oil price fluctuations, but I assure (you) that taking into account all factors — and despite there being some factors beyond our control — the government will handle this issue with complete sensitivity and will take responsibility for it,” he said. Terming “unfair” the comparisons of fuel prices during the UPA regime — when crude prices were skyrocketing — with the current government, Pradhan said inflation was responsible for high prices. “Inflation has increased significantly and that’s why high fuel prices. But we will ensure the prices don’t go so high that they get out of the reach of the poor and middle classes.” Referring to Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram’s comments that there was a room for cutting oil prices by as much as Rs 25 per litre, he said: “In the name of oil bonds (issued to oil companies for subsidising fuel), a huge burden has been left by the previous government on the current government. We never complained and are paying off those bonds.” About the possibility of bringing transportation fuel under the new indirect tax regime, the Minister said while GST is imposed on all the processes of the oil sector — production, pipeline and refineries — but there is no GST on the finished goods. “Hence we are not able to realise it (claim input tax credit). That’s why petroleum products should be brought under GST,” he said, adding that the GST Council is responsible for the same. “However, while interacting with Chief Ministers, I am getting more and more positive vibes and I feel that it will be brought under GST soon. The reservations related to the new tax regime are going away after its successful implementation,” Pradhan said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "siddiqui", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raj kundra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pradhan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dharmendra pradhan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pradhan sai", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ians", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gst council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T20:12:23.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c363ecd94a226b2b2eea640e13634eba1b49671f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_ZZEJxw_HVLIVMnaJd1bQMHtSLcLK9kaOU1BlaP33VFyow4K1mzR5p6myG7SWd6ZWmVMQnyqyfKYgAv_l3tdg2Fe1K_IBvbM9HUztjiwJDRn1m6kZplpkXg4CwMBng6X9zJsKjJOWrYONAEogBiKFQzpZw0nvIS2o5tNDoMcvUcZfrS3WIQW6zOh0l_RfOySahPXmSI_79aA--", "site_full": "www.prnewswire.co.uk", "site": "prnewswire.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/rss/rss/financial-services/insurance-news.rss", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance", "business", "marketing"], "section_title": "PR Newswire:", "title": "The Bitcoin Foundation's Llew Claasen and BnkToTheFuture's Simon Dixon to Join All Star Lineup For TokenMarket 2018", "title_full": "The Bitcoin Foundation's Llew Claasen and BnkToTheFuture's Simon Dixon to Join All Star Lineup For TokenMarket 2018", "published": "2018-06-06T15:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/702148/Token_Economy.jpg?p=facebook", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 79167, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c363ecd94a226b2b2eea640e13634eba1b49671f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_ZZEJxw_HVLIVMnaJd1bQMHtSLcLK9kaOU1BlaP33VFyow4K1mzR5p6myG7SWd6ZWmVMQnyqyfKYgAv_l3tdg2Fe1K_IBvbM9HUztjiwJDRn1m6kZplpkXg4CwMBng6X9zJsKjJOWrYONAEogBiKFQzpZw0nvIS2o5tNDoMcvUcZfrS3WIQW6zOh0l_RfOySahPXmSI_79aA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T15:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Bitcoin Foundation's Llew Claasen and BnkToTheFuture's Simon Dixon to Join All Star Lineup For TokenMarket 2018", "text": "Share this article\nGIBRALTAR\nTokenMarket , the leading ICO advisory firm, announced today the second round of guest speakers to appear at its debut blockchain event, ' TokenMarket 2018: Insights into the Token Economy '.

Also, it has been reported that American universities have started investing in crypto hedge funds. The investments are on a limited scale but nevertheless indicate a growing interest from academic institutions. And, authorities in Belgium warn the public about crypto scams with a \"Too good to be true\" website.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Tuesday: Exchange ETF Action and Wozniak Wants Bitcoin to Rule World\nFinancial Authorities in Germany Find Six Institutions Trading Cryptos At least six financial institutions in Germany trade cryptocurrencies, the country's Federal Ministry of Finance revealed. The information emerged from an answer to a question filed by Bundestag member Thomas Lutze. The figure is based on findings of the German financial regulator Bafin , which supervises the financial sector and is also expected to monitor crypto trading activities. The banks involved were not named.\nThere is no case registered with Bafin against financial institutions suspected of any breach of money laundering regulations, due diligence requirements, nor reporting obligations regarding cryptocurrencies, the Bundesfinanzministerium said, quoted by Reuters . Each such institution, which has permission to trade properties, also has the right to set up mechanisms allowing the exchange of bitcoin to euros and vice versa, the ministry noted.\nThe Finance ministry also said that the issuance of a digital central bank money is currently not an option in the Eurozone, \"given the wide range of unresolved issues and significant risks associated with unclear benefits.\" According to the report, the Federal government in Berlin does not see crypto-related risks to the stability of the financial markets due to the low market capitalization of cryptocurrencies and the limited interdependence with the financial sector.\nEast Coast Universities Invest in Crypto Hedge Funds Academic institutions in the US have started making small investments into cryptocurrency hedge funds, according to a lawyer working in the industry. These universities are getting involved on a limited basis for strategic reasons, the founder of Capital Fund Law Group, John Lore, told Business Insider . \"I can't say the names because that's attorney-client but we have people mostly on the East Coast that have begun doing investments in this space on a fairly modest basis,\" he added.\nThe New York-based law group specializes in providing legal services to the hedge fund industry. According to Lore, at this point investors are putting in very small percentages of their net worth into these new funds. He doesn't expect institutional investors, such as pension funds, to invest in crypto soon, with one notable exception – university endowment funds, some of which have already begun to invest on a limited scale. \"We see academia as a tie between these somewhat young and enthusiastic fund managers and capital raising,\" the lawyer said.\nCryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technologies have seen a growing interest from universities. Leading academic institutions, such as Cambridge and Oxford, have introduced crypto and blockchain related courses. In December, the Belarusian National Technical University announced a diploma course covering cryptocurrencies, derivatives, and ICOs, as news.Bitcoin.com reported . In April, the Fundacao Getulio Vargas University in Sao Paulo launched \"Brazil's first Master's degree in cryptofinance.\" It has been reported that North Korea's Pyongyang University is also offering educational courses on cryptocurrencies.\nBelgian Regulators Warn About Crypto Scams with New Website Financial authorities and regulators in Belgium have launched a website dedicated to warning the public about crypto scams and raising awareness about the associated risks. The move comes in response to substantial increase in interest towards investing in cryptocurrencies and related products. The site, temooiomwaartezijn.be (\"Too good to be true\"), can also be used to report suspicious offers and projects in the crypto space.\nBelgians can find there useful tips on how to avoid fraudulent schemes. The site advises investors to make sure they know who they are dealing with, check if a project is registered as a scam and never share sensitive personal data. Regulators say people should always request clear and understandable information, take their time to critically evaluate an offer before accepting it and be wary of promises of excessive profits. \"If the return seems too good to be true, it usually is. Profit is never guaranteed,\" they warn.\nScam-related losses of almost €2.2 million have been reported to financial authorities in the country, with at least 118 victims having contacted Belgium's Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA). Belgian regulators claim only 4% of the cases are reported. According to their estimates, the total financial loss from fraud related to cryptocurrencies amounts to around 130 million euros annually. In March, the financial watchdog published a list of 19 cryptocurrency trading platforms showing signs of fraud. Last month, the FSMA expanded its blacklist including more businesses reported by customers.\nWhat are your thoughts on today's topics in Bitcoin in Brief?

Where will it be? With no less than 16 levels of support converging below the price, the path of least resistance looks to be the upside.\nThe Technical Confluence Indicator shows that the $ 7,610 level is a dense congestion of the following 16 lines: the Bolinger Band 1h-Middle, the Bolinger Band 15m-Lower, the 1h-Low, the Simple Moving Average (SMA) 5-1d, the Fibonacci 23.6% one-day, the SMA 100-1h, the SMA 5-4h, the SMA 10-15m, the SMA 5-15m, the one-week high, the 15m-low, the Bolinger Band 1h-Middle, the SMA 50-15m, the BB 15m-Middle, the 1h-High, and the SMA 1h.\nLooking up, $ 7,761 is the confluence of the Fibonacci 23.6% one-month, the Pivot Point one-week Resistance 1, the Pivot Point one-day Resistance 1, and the Bolinger Band 1h-Upper. Further above, the next target is $ 8,164 , which is the Fibonacci 38.2% one-month.\nOn the downside, there are many lines of support defending the massive line mentioned earlier. The $ 7,403 level is the meeting point of the Bolinger Band 1h-Lower and the Fibonacci 38.2% one-week. Even lower, $ 7,034 is the one-month low and the one-week low.\nHere is how it looks on the tool:\nThe Confluence Detector finds exciting opportunities using Technical Confluences. The TC is a tool to locate and point out those price levels where there is a congestion of indicators, moving averages, Fibonacci levels, Pivot Points, etc. Knowing where these congestion points are located is very useful for the trader, and can be used as a basis for different strategies.\nThis tool assigns a certain amount of “weight” to each indicator, and this “weight” can influence adjacents price levels. These weightings mean that one price level without any indicator or moving average but under the influence of two “strongly weighted” levels accumulate more resistance than their neighbors. In these cases, the tool signals resistance in apparently empty areas.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.forexcrunch.com/category/news/", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://www.forexcrunch.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "forex news bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T15:43:10.093+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "225edc2f1a7fbf9db5d3b4ad4fff85c3498aa9d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmffu0fsztxsCnANJz5sUADQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Simply predict the future of bitcoin", "title_full": "Simply predict the future of bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-06T15:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "225edc2f1a7fbf9db5d3b4ad4fff85c3498aa9d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmffu0fsztxsCnANJz5sUADQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "shoujiuhaituo7", "published": "2018-06-06T15:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Simply predict the future of bitcoin", "text": "According to the k-line of 2011-2017, the major bull markets are basically those that rise after a super rally and then go back a year to two years later.\nWhen should the chance of tuen mun be this time?\nFeel like there's a half-year down period?\nWhile history will not simply repeat itself, shouldn't the bull market come so soon?\nThe ICO bubble is pretty bad.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T21:56:25.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b861d6c43872caec4a601aed3b7d324faaeda4ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmT6H61bwliITU3.rbIJQ7IE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Can Bitcoin or the Blockchain save the environment?", "title_full": "Can Bitcoin or the Blockchain save the environment?", "published": "2018-06-06T15:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.04, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b861d6c43872caec4a601aed3b7d324faaeda4ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmT6H61bwliITU3.rbIJQ7IE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "DeHell", "published": "2018-06-06T15:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can Bitcoin or the Blockchain save the environment?", "text": "Yes, there are now so many companies that take crypto and blockchain in their promotion, but on average after they launch their platforms, they do not use blockchain technology in their platform.

(\"Virtual Crypto\", or the \"Company\") (OTCQB: VRCP ), a technology company dedicated to making cryptocurrencies accessible to the public, announced that it will launch its bitcoin ATM at the TechCrunch Tel Aviv event tomorrow ( June 7, 2018 ). In contrast to most bitcoin ATM platforms, which only allow the purchase of bitcoin, Virtual Crypto's NetoBit ATM is a bi-directional platform that enables users to sell bitcoin as well, i.e. convert bitcoin currencies to regular fiat money, and to buy bitcoin, i.e. convert fiat money to bitcoin. NetoBit ATM is the world's first and only ATM that allows real time conversion, purchase and sale of bitcoin. The product, which already supports most common currencies, is available for purchase globally. NetoBit ATM is the second product in Virtual Crypto's NetoBit software and hardware products portfolio. In April 2018 , the Company launched its first product, NetoBit Pay, a retail point-of-sale (\"POS\") device that enables businesses worldwide to securely receive payments in bitcoin in real time, while enjoying protection against exchange rate volatility and guaranteeing transactions up to a value of $3,000 . The cryptocurrencies ATM market, in which Virtual Crypto operates, enjoys exceptional growth rates. According to a study by Coherent Market Insights from October 2017 , the size of the market in 2017 was around $14 billion , but it is expected to grow at a compound average growth rate of 46% between the years 2017 and 2025. NetoBit solutions, including Netobit ATM, are different from many other solutions in at least three ways. First, Virtual Crypto's validation algorithm can very precisely and quickly predict if a cryptocurrency transaction will be approved immediately by a blockchain at the moment of the transaction, before the block is digitally signed. This quick process allows the approval of the crypto transaction within seconds to minutes, rather than between 10 minutes and 24 hours and following a process of six confirmations, as is the case today. This way, Virtual Crypto can create a pleasant and immediate transaction experience, minimizing the risk of fraud, which can occur in the usual lengthy transaction approval processes. Consequently, NetoBit ATM users can draw cash and transfer money from and to their digital wallets in seconds. Second, cryptocurrency trading platforms usually allow the customer carrying out the transaction to interact with only one crypto exchange, shackling the customer to the exchange rate which that exchange offers. Virtual Crypto allows the customer to work with several crypto exchanges simultaneously for each transaction. In this way, the Virtual Crypto algorithms can immediately locate the best crypto deal and offer the most attractive exchange rate while the transaction is underway. This ability enables the Company to protect the transaction from currency volatility that is liable to occur during the current lengthy transaction approval process and offer guarantee for transactions of up to $3,000 . Third, the implementation of Virtual Crypto's financial management system allows the operation of a large number of cryptocurrency ATMs and points of sale and provides tools that help manage and track the flow of money in each and every terminal. The back-office capabilities include setting currency price limits for each transaction, defining the KYC (Know Your Customer – customer identification), conforming to different regulations and configurations in different countries, managing risk and providing useful statistical data on transactions and points of sale. These capabilities are different from many other solutions that offer back-office capabilities which can manage only one transaction center. Alon Dayan , CEO of Virtual Crypto Technologies Ltd. commented on the announcement, \"We continue to set standards for the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. Our proprietary algorithm reduced the typical transaction time from 10 to 60 minutes to several seconds. At this stage, NetoBit ATMs combine that speed with the convenience of an ATM, giving customers the ability to buy and sell bitcoin with fiat money. The result is a vastly improved trading experience for customers, which we believe will be attractive to our business partners as well as consumers.\" About Virtual Crypto Technologies Inc. Virtual Crypto Technologies Inc. ( www.virtual-crypto.com ), through its wholly owned Israeli subsidiary Virtual Crypto Technologies Ltd., has developed NetoBit, a proprietary, Cryptographic algorithmic technology that it is able to confirm in real-time the purchase or sale of any cryptocurrency. Virtual Crypto's NetoBit products dramatically improve the cryptocurrency trading experience with faster execution and lower costs. These products are setting a new time to transaction standard, trading in seconds rather the industry norm of 20 minutes. Because of its speed, customers enjoy the best crypto exchange rate at the point of transaction. The company is marketing its NetoBit software and hardware products for the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies through ATMs, tablets, PCs and mobile devices (the \"VC Products\"). Virtual Crypto Technologies further believes that the ability to immediately confirm Cryptocurrency transactions in real-time should be a major competitive breakthrough in making the purchase and sale of crypto currencies user friendly.

Hardware and software engineers create programs and machines to compute cryptocurrencies, even as hackers try to harvest them as well. In this series, I will explain the cryptocurrency economy and how people are profiting in it. A Brief Introduction To Cryptocurrency\nThe most famous cryptocurrency is Bitcoin. In its whitepaper, the creator(s) of Bitcoin, under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, described Bitcoin as a distributed database among computers participating that keeps track of ownership transitions among accounts. The transitions are recorded as blocks and the transition history is hashed and linked, forming a blockchain. All participating computers, or \"nodes,\" are supposed to use the longest blockchain as the history, which is the shared consensus. With the history data hashed and the majority of nodes agreeing to use the longest blockchain, it is mathematically hard to fake transactions or create a different transition history. This solid foundation enables Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to track the ownership and transitions of ownership. In other words, there is no physical coin -- the entire database keeps track of ownership and the transitions of ownership of bitcoins.\nTo keep track of all transitions, Bitcoin's network needs nodes to compute the hashes of transitions. Bitcoin's network motivates nodes by awarding a given number of bitcoins to a node who calculates the hash that is \"best\" according to a standard. The more computing power a node contributes to Bitcoin's network to calculate hashes, the better chance this node has to win the award. This is called proof of work (PoW). Other cryptocurrencies use different mechanisms such as proof of stake (PoS). Calculating hashes for a cryptocurrency network is also known as \"mining.\" Some believe the analogy comes from the fact that finding the best hash value in the vast mathematical space is similar to mining gold in the wild.\nThe Computing Power Arms Race\nPoW turns bitcoin mining into a competition of computing power. With higher computing power, one can calculate more hash values and has a better chance to win the bitcoin reward. People build powerful machines to calculate at faster speeds. When bitcoin was first introduced, nodes running on laptops and PCs could mine bitcoin using their central processing units (CPUs). Later, computer clusters and cloud servers joined them, followed by field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). Eventually, dedicated processing chips called application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) were created for the sole purpose of mining. The machines that use ASICs to calculate hashes are called miner machines, or miners.\nEach miner consumes thousands of watts of power, which made power consumption the largest continuous cost for people trying to profit from mining cryptocurrencies. Companies build containers that contain hundreds of miners and ship them to places around the world where they can find low-cost electric supplies and good network connections. It is not surprising to find mining facilities colocated with data centers. To some extent, cryptocurrency mining facilities are data centers, except they are dedicated to one kind of computing: hashing.\nWhen containers of miners are shipped to mining facilities and plugged into the grid, they need to become part of the entire cryptocurrency network. The miners are not talking to the cryptocurrency network directly. Instead, they talk to a website called a mining pool. The pool collects hashing jobs and distributes them to each miner and verifies whether the job was hashed correctly. The more miners connect to a pool, the more hashes this pool can calculate, and the better chance this pool will find the best hash value and be awarded the cryptocurrency. If a pool wins the award, all miners working for the pool will get a share.\nA miner machine can connect to multiple pools. When a pool is not sending a hashing job to a miner, the miner can talk to other pools and get new hashing jobs. This gives miners a chance to distribute their computing power to different pools and not be blocked by a single pool.\nCryptocurrency Mining Costs When mining for cryptocurrencies, there are three major costs that come into play:\n1. Fixed costs such as hardware, land and building.\n2. Maintenance costs like staff salary and network bandwidth.\n3. Power cost.\nAmong the three, power cost is the most significant. Using Bitmain's AntMiner S9 as an example, an S9 will draw 13,140kWh per year. If we use the national average power rate of 0.1262 USD/kWh, the annual power cost is $1,658.27. Other costs, such as land, building and maintenance costs, can be spread among each unit. Change in power cost is often the deterministic factor in whether a mining facility can make a profit.\nTo make profits, crypto miners are constantly seeking low power rates around the world. Attackers are also trying to offload the costs to other people. In the next article, I will explain how attackers are utilizing existing devices to harvest cryptocurrencies without paying the price.\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

But now the Raj Kundra issues a statement clarifying his role in the whole scam. The statement read, “Mr Raj Kundra CMD of Viaan Industries Ltd was summoned by the Enforcement Directorate merely as a witness. An enquiry is underway by the concerned regulatory authorities and Mr Raj Kundra stands committed to extend all his cooperation to the law enforcement agency”\nCommenting on the articles, Mr Raj Kundra, CMD said “I am terribly disappointed by the irresponsible reporting carried out by some sections of the media. Clarity on the issue should have been sought before carrying such headlines. The authorities, summoned me merely as a witness, as the accused Amit Bharadwaj happens to be an acquaintance and some introductions were made hence there is a certain protocol being followed by the agencies. Amit Bharadwaj was intending to buy a team in our poker league and got into a contract with us for the same. However, he was expelled on account of non-payment of fees and I was called as a witness in this connection. While we continuously strive to keep taking steps to improve our reputation, these type of unconfirmed, baseless, reports severely dent our market perception and erode investor sentiments”\nHe continued “Notwithstanding what has happened, at Viaan Industries, we shall continue to focus on growing our gaming and media vertical.

In the recently released report containing the opinions of the ministries involved in the management of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Vietnam, the country’s Ministry of Finance proposes suspending the importation of mining equipment, according to local media. This report, referred to as Document 5964 / BTC-TCHQ, has been submitted to the country’s prime minister.\nZing.vn publication elaborated: According to the Ministry of Finance, mining machines are not on the list of goods banned from importation and are not subject to the list of specialized management or unsafe goods, so enterprises are easily allowed to complete the import procedures. The ministry outlined in its report that the use of mining equipment for bitcoin, litecoin and other cryptocurrencies in the country is difficult for the authority to manage.\n“From there, it is easy for people to use [cryptocurrencies] as a currency or another method of payment,” the City Economic News Kinhte & Dothi quoted the ministry. “This is in violation of the amended government Decree 101 on non-cash payments,” Zing.vn conveyed.\nThe publication also noted that data from the General Department of Vietnam Customs shows that “from 2017 to half of 4/2018, the country imported about 15,600 mining machines,” adding that most of them were imported into Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Da Nang. Last year, more than 9,300 rigs were imported into Vietnam and over 6,300 rigs were imported in the first four months of this year. The ministry also referred the case where Modern Tech Corp in Ho Chi Minh City was “accused [of] over VND 15 trillion [~US$656 million] of fraud by more than 32,000 people through its Ifan and Pincoin virtual currency investment models.” According to the ministry, protecting the Vietnamese people from similar scams in the future “requires state management agencies to take strict control measures with the import and use of this commodity.” The Vnexpress reiterated: To prevent other possible events, in the immediate future, the Ministry of Finance proposed to apply the import suspension measures for the above types of mining equipment.

Also, it has been reported that American universities have started investing in crypto hedge funds. The investments are on a limited scale but nevertheless indicate a growing interest from academic institutions. And, authorities in Belgium warn the public about crypto scams with a “Too good to be true” website. Advertisements\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Tuesday: Exchange ETF Action and Wozniak Wants Bitcoin to Rule World Financial Authorities in Germany Find Six Institutions Trading Cryptos\nAt least six financial institutions in Germany trade cryptocurrencies, the country’s Federal Ministry of Finance revealed. The information emerged from an answer to a question filed by Bundestag member Thomas Lutze. The figure is based on findings of the German financial regulator Bafin, which supervises the financial sector and is also expected to monitor crypto trading activities. The banks involved were not named.\nThere is no case registered with Bafin against financial institutions suspected of any breach of money laundering regulations, due diligence requirements, nor reporting obligations regarding cryptocurrencies, the Bundesfinanzministerium said, quoted by Reuters . Each such institution, which has permission to trade properties, also has the right to set up mechanisms allowing the exchange of bitcoin to euros and vice versa, the ministry noted.\nThe Finance ministry also said that the issuance of a digital central bank money is currently not an option in the Eurozone, “given the wide range of unresolved issues and significant risks associated with unclear benefits.” According to the report, the Federal government in Berlin does not see crypto-related risks to the stability of the financial markets due to the low market capitalization of cryptocurrencies and the limited interdependence with the financial sector. East Coast Universities Invest in Crypto Hedge Funds\nAcademic institutions in the US have started making small investments into cryptocurrency hedge funds, according to a lawyer working in the industry. These universities are getting involved on a limited basis for strategic reasons, the founder of Capital Fund Law Group, John Lore, told Business Insider . “I can’t say the names because that’s attorney-client but we have people mostly on the East Coast that have begun doing investments in this space on a fairly modest basis,” he added.\nThe New York-based law group specializes in providing legal services to the hedge fund industry. According to Lore, at this point investors are putting in very small percentages of their net worth into these new funds. He doesn’t expect institutional investors, such as pension funds, to invest in crypto soon, with one notable exception – university endowment funds, some of which have already begun to invest on a limited scale. “We see academia as a tie between these somewhat young and enthusiastic fund managers and capital raising,” the lawyer said.\nCryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technologies have seen a growing interest from universities. Leading academic institutions, such as Cambridge and Oxford, have introduced crypto and blockchain related courses. In December, the Belarusian National Technical University announced a diploma course covering cryptocurrencies, derivatives, and ICOs, as news.Bitcoin.com reported. In April, the Fundacao Getulio Vargas University in Sao Paulo launched “Brazil’s first Master’s degree in cryptofinance.” It has been reported that North Korea’s Pyongyang University is also offering educational courses on cryptocurrencies. Belgian Regulators Warn About Crypto Scams with New Website\nFinancial authorities and regulators in Belgium have launched a website dedicated to warning the public about crypto scams and raising awareness about the associated risks. The move comes in response to substantial increase in interest towards investing in cryptocurrencies and related products. The site, temooiomwaartezijn.be (“Too good to be true”), can also be used to report suspicious offers and projects in the crypto space.\nBelgians can find there useful tips on how to avoid fraudulent schemes. The site advises investors to make sure they know who they are dealing with, check if a project is registered as a scam and never share sensitive personal data. Regulators say people should always request clear and understandable information, take their time to critically evaluate an offer before accepting it and be wary of promises of excessive profits. “If the return seems too good to be true, it usually is. Profit is never guaranteed,” they warn.\nScam-related losses of almost €2.2 million have been reported to financial authorities in the country, with at least 118 victims having contacted Belgium’s Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA). Belgian regulators claim only 4% of the cases are reported. According to their estimates, the total financial loss from fraud related to cryptocurrencies amounts to around 130 million euros annually. In March, the financial watchdog published a list of 19 cryptocurrency trading platforms showing signs of fraud. Last month, the FSMA expanded its blacklist including more businesses reported by customers.\nWhat are your thoughts on today’s topics in Bitcoin in Brief?

witness in Rs 2,000 cr bitcoin probe Raj Kundra: ED summoned me as witness in Rs 2,000 cr bitcoin probe — By IANS | Jun 06, 2018 05:23 pm FOLLOW US: Mumbai: Mumbai businessman Raj Kundra on Wednesday claimed that he had gone to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) as a witness for the ongoing investigations in the Rs 2,000 crore bitcoin scam. Kundra — the husband of Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty — had appeared before the ED office in Mumbai on Tuesday. According to some media reports (not by IANS), he was reportedly grilled for several hours by the ED investigators. “I was summoned by the ED merely as a witness. An enquiry is underway by the concerned regulatory authorities and I stand committed to extend all my cooperation to the law enforcement agency,” Kundra said, clearing the air on the issue in a statement. A businessman with interest in sports, this is not Kundra’s first brush with law. In the past, he had appeared before different authorities on his investments in the Rajasthan Royals IPL team. Some members of that team were also embroiled in the cricket spot-fixing scandal. In his statement here vis-A-vis the media speculation of his grilling, Kundra said: “I am terribly disappointed by the irresponsible reporting carried out by some sections of the media. Clarity on the issue should have been sought before carrying such headlines.” “The authorities, summoned me merely as a witness, as the accused Amit Bharadwaj happens to be an acquaintance and some introductions were made hence there is a certain protocol being followed by the agencies,” said Kundra. He added that Bharadwaj was intending to buy a team in his Poker League and had entered into a contract with them for the same. “However, he was expelled on account of non-payment of fees and I was called as a witness in this connection.

So you will need two copies of the blockchain if you wish to also run Bitcoin Core.\nAlso, unfortunately, you can not easily run these two clients side-by-side. If you try to install Bitcoin ABC it will install itself over Bitcoin Core and use the same config file. The only solution is some kind of containerization. You can do this by using a second computer. I'm doing it by installing a second Ubuntu into a virtual machine. I use KVM/QEMU with Virt-Manager. Then I install Bitcoin ABC into that virtual machine. I keep a second copy of the blockchain on my host machine and mount that via NFS. Simply add to your /etc/fstab something like:\n192.168.122.1:/home/User/BitcoinCash /home/User/BitcoinCash nfs hard,timeo=14 0 0\nNote that 192.168.122.1 is the default address at which your host machine can be reached. See here .\nSo far this has worked and I have been able to sync up to the fork, but beyond that I am having some trouble which I am asking about here . [I am now able to complete the sync. See that link. Be sure that when copying the .bitcoin directory for use with Bitcoin ABC, you delete the chainstate/ directory and the blocks/{blk,rev}*.dat that contain blocks beyond the fork, or the client will freeze.]\nNote also that you should be careful about the wallet that you feed to Bitcoin ABC. Do not feed it your Bitcoin wallet if you have anything left in it. First, transfer everything out to a second wallet. Then give Bitcoin ABC your first wallet. Since that first wallet had BTC in it at the fork, those BTC will become BCC even though somewhere post-fork the wallet becomes empty. The reason to transfer your BTC out of the wallet to a second one, is that you never want to trust a second piece of software, in this case Bitcoin ABC, with the keys that could give it access to your (classic) bitcoins.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Networking"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "virt-manager", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "abc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin core", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin abc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ubuntu", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T00:18:37.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d653c10c0f35255898bade55ae890f48492d2e44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQFLRFZkmgM8t1GLa5AZQMzVinnjBbrm_QoTgSEKtepysH.VUQKOC.dEjc.ItHx.ugN9UTvqE6EUF0B1xX6UWB4RtSAtO0U25EClf.vQbjpYQ--", "site_full": "www.iftmstrangers.xyz", "site": "iftmstrangers.xyz", "site_section": "https://www.iftmstrangers.xyz/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "IFTM STRANGERS", "title": "EXPOSE AND UPDATE | ETHEREUM, TRON, CHINA BITCOIN HYPE, BINANCE BNB", "title_full": "EXPOSE AND UPDATE | ETHEREUM, TRON, CHINA BITCOIN HYPE, BINANCE BNB", "published": "2018-06-06T14:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d653c10c0f35255898bade55ae890f48492d2e44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQFLRFZkmgM8t1GLa5AZQMzVinnjBbrm_QoTgSEKtepysH.VUQKOC.dEjc.ItHx.ugN9UTvqE6EUF0B1xX6UWB4RtSAtO0U25EClf.vQbjpYQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Magneto Mohit (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-06T14:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "EXPOSE AND UPDATE | ETHEREUM, TRON, CHINA BITCOIN HYPE, BINANCE BNB", "text": "\nEXPOSE AND UPDATE || ETHEREUM, TRON, CHINA BITCOIN HYPE, BINANCE BNB\nThis video covers Expose on TRON and news with regards to BITCOIN hype in CHINA.

Kundra, husband of Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty , had appeared before the ED office in Mumbai on Tuesday. According to some media reports, Kundra was reportedly grilled for several hours by the ED investigators.\nThis is not Kundra’s first brush with law. He had appeared before different authorities when RR cricketers were involved in the 2013 match-fixing scandal. Kundra received a lifetime ban from the Indian Premier League (IPL).\n“I was summoned by the ED merely as a witness. An enquiry is underway by the concerned regulatory authorities and I stand committed to extend all my cooperation to the law enforcement agency,” Kundra said, clearing the air on the issue in a statement.\n“I am terribly disappointed by the irresponsible reporting carried out by some sections of the media. Clarity on the issue should have been sought before carrying such headlines. The authorities, summoned me merely as a witness, as the accused Amit Bhardwaj happens to be an acquaintance and some introductions were made hence there is a certain protocol being followed by the agencies.”\nHe added that Bhardwaj was intending to buy a team in his Poker League and had entered into a contract with them for the same: ”He was expelled on account of non-payment of fees and I was called as a witness in this connection. While we continuously strive to keep taking steps to improve our reputation, these type of unconfirmed, baseless, reports severely dent our market perception and erode investor sentiments.\n“Notwithstanding what has happened, at Viaan Industries, we shall continue to focus on growing our gaming and media vertical. We remain excited about the company’s future and strive to keep adding shareholder value.”\nThe ED, sometime back, had registered a criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against a Bitcoin-based investment website GainBitcoin, its founder Bhardwaj and eight others. The ED had alleged that about 8,000 investors lost around Rs 2,000 crores by transacting in this scheme. The Pune police had later arrested Bhardwaj and his brother Vivek in the case.

According to professors Dirk Baur and Niels Van Quaquebeke, the answer is a resounding no. By applying historical context to the bitcoin craze, the authors shed light on why the currency may be unworkable in the long term without a governing central authority. this thought-provoking article to bankers, investors and anyone interested in the future of bitcoin and blockchain. How bitcoin works, Why bitcoin lacks the key element of trust that currencies have historically derived from central authorities, and Why bitcoin and other digital currencies are unlikely to usurp the role of banks in the monetary system. Summary\nDespite the increasing prominence of bitcoin, banks will undoubtedly continue to play a central role in the global monetary system for many years to come. The reason, quite simply, boils down to trust. Bitcoin relies on blockchain technology, an electronic mechanism that allows one party to send payments to another without going through a financial institution. Instead of trusting a bank, blockchain users place their faith in technology to make the transaction work. History shows that only a few cases exist in which a currency operated successfully without the guidance of a central authority, and bitcoin is unlikely to evolve into the next example. article ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "niels van quaquebeke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dirk baur", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of western australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kühne logistics university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hamburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T15:06:35.052+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "060d79ad3d04dceca9fd99d4a8b2f9ceee19ca4e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0YjaeKLbHKzxbKGmzOJsY9PlrVJBtiN04ol5xWeKnd03QJ1BbKjkwulyZiaz4XGKA--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "‘We Think It Is Going To Exist Forever’: Susquehanna Opens Bitcoin Trading Desk", "title_full": "‘We Think It Is Going To Exist Forever’: Susquehanna Opens Bitcoin Trading Desk", "published": "2018-06-06T14:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "060d79ad3d04dceca9fd99d4a8b2f9ceee19ca4e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0YjaeKLbHKzxbKGmzOJsY9PlrVJBtiN04ol5xWeKnd03QJ1BbKjkwulyZiaz4XGKA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-06T14:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "‘We Think It Is Going To Exist Forever’: Susquehanna Opens Bitcoin Trading Desk", "text": "US financial company Susquehanna International Group announced it will offer Bitcoin trading to 500 clients following two years of offering the cryptocurrency in \"private deals,\" the New York Times reports.\nCrypto Assets Will 'Change Financial Services' Susquehanna International Group , an international trader which has headquarters in Pennsylvania and operates around the world, will move to offer Bitcoin futures and other products , continuing a trend involving an increasing number of major finance players.\n\"We believe that this technology and this asset class is going to change some facet of financial services, and we think it is going to exist forever,\" head of Susquehanna's digital asset group Bart Smith revealed.\nFrom futures, the company will thereafter to allowing buying and selling of both Bitcoin and Ethereum, along with \"a few other\" cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin Cash, the Times adds.\nThe company already trades \"millions of dollars\" in Bitcoin using a team of a dozen traders, having expanded from just one trader in 2014.\nInvestment Momentum Builds Susquehanna's announcement follows plans from Wall Street heavyweight Goldman Sachs, along with New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange, which have both signalled their intention to offer Bitcoin futures.\nThis year has seen a remarkable U-turn in sentiment on cryptocurrency from Goldman in particular, with an executive linked to the trading plans confirming that, unlike JPMorgan , the conglomerate did not consider Bitcoin to be a \"fraud.\"\n\"It is not a new risk that we don't understand,\" Bitcoin quoted the executive as saying last month. \"It is just a heightened risk that we need to be extra aware of here.\"\nThe impact of institutional money flowing into Bitcoin remains a popular narrative tied to shoring up lackluster price performance so far this year.\nAt press time, BTC/USD was trading around $7600 , down around 20% since the same time in May.\nWhat do you think about Susquehanna International Group's cryptocurrency trading plans?

The most important thing is just to learn how to read and write, apart from that education can be a waste of time. I know some of my friends that finished their education with PhD, but today they are just taxi drivers and some of them drive for Uber.\nSome of them cant even afford to buy car to do their taxi work and thats a very big shame after years of education spent. So sometimes is a waste of time. And dont rely only Bitcoin because is not something you can rely on fully. You can combine Bitcoin and Education.\nThat in education that in the crypto currency (bitcoin) should be invested with common sense. That's why your friends work in a taxi. If they were educated in the field of information systems and technology, then obviously now would not have worked in a taxi and received a decent salary!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T13:36:58.000+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 29708, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=2500", "requestsLeft": 637}
