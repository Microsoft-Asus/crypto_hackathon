NEW HAVEN, Conn. ( Project Syndicate ) — The cryptocurrency revolution, which started with bitcoin in 2009, claims to be inventing new kinds of money. There are now nearly 2,000 cryptocurrencies, and millions of people worldwide are excited by them. What accounts for this enthusiasm, which so far remains undampened by warnings that the revolution is a sham?\nOne must bear in mind that attempts to reinvent money have a long history.\nAs the sociologist Viviana Zelizer points out in her book “The Social Meaning of Money”: “Despite the commonsense idea that ‘a dollar is a dollar is a dollar,’ everywhere we look people are constantly creating different kinds of money.” Many of these innovations generate real excitement, at least for a while.\nAs the medium of exchange throughout the world, money, in its various embodiments, is rich in mystique. We tend to measure people’s value by it. It sums things up like nothing else.\nAnd yet it may consist of nothing more than pieces of paper that just go round and round in circles of spending. So its value depends on belief and trust in those pieces of paper. One might call it faith.\nEstablishing a new kind of money may be seen as a community’s avowal of faith in an idea, and an effort to inspire its realization. In his book “Euro Tragedy: A Drama in Nine Acts,” the economist Ashoka Mody argues that the true public justification for creating the European currency in 1992 was a kind of “groupthink,” a faith “embedded in people’s psyches” that “the mere existence of a single currency…would create the impetus for countries to come together in closer political embrace.”\nNew ideas for money seem to go with the territory of revolution, accompanied by a compelling, easily understood narrative. In 1827, Josiah Warner opened the “Cincinnati Time Store” that sold merchandise in units of hours of work, relying on “labor notes,” which resembled paper money. The new money was seen as a testament to the importance of working people, until he closed the store in 1830.\nTwo years later, Robert Owen, sometimes described as the father of socialism, attempted to establish in London the National Equitable Labour Exchange, relying on labor notes, or “time money,” as currency. Here, too, using time instead of gold or silver as a standard of value enforced the notion of the primacy of labor. But, like Warner’s time store, Owen’s experiment failed.\nLikewise, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels proposed that the central Communist premise — “Abolition of private property” — would be accompanied by a “Communistic abolition of buying and selling.”\nEliminating money, however, was impossible to do, and no Communist state ever did so. Instead, as the British Museum’s recent exhibit, “The Currency of Communism,” showed, they issued paper money with vivid symbols of the working class on it. They had to do something different with money.\nDuring the Great Depression of the 1930s, a radical movement, called Technocracy, associated with Columbia University, proposed to replace the gold-backed dollar with a measure of energy, the erg. In their book “The A B C of Technocracy,” published under the pseudonym Frank Arkright, they advanced the idea that putting the economy “on an energy basis” would overcome the unemployment problem. The Technocracy fad proved to be short-lived, though, after top scientists debunked the idea’s technical pretensions.\nBut the effort to dress up a half-baked idea in advanced science didn’t stop there.\nParallel with Technocracy, in 1932 the economist John Pease Norton, addressing the Econometric Society, proposed a dollar backed not by gold but by electricity.\nBut while Norton’s electric dollar received substantial attention, he had no good reason for choosing electricity over other commodities to back the dollar. At a time when most households in advanced countries had only recently been electrified, and electric devices from radios to refrigerators had entered homes, electricity evoked images of the most glamorous high science.\nBut, like Technocracy, the attempt to co-opt science backfired. Syndicated columnist Harry I. Phillips in 1933 saw in the electric dollar only fodder for comedy. “But it would be good fun getting an income tax blank and sending the government 300 volts,” he noted.\nNow we have something new again: bitcoin BTCUSD, -2.25% and other cryptocurrencies, which have spawned the initial coin offering (ICO). Issuers claim that ICOs are exempt from securities regulation, because they do not involve conventional money or confer ownership of profits. Investing in an ICO is thought of as an entirely new inspiration.\nEach of these monetary innovations has been coupled with a unique technological story. But, more fundamentally, all are connected with a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society. The cryptocurrencies are a statement of faith in a new community of entrepreneurial cosmopolitans who hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.\nAnd, as in the past, the public’s fascination with cryptocurrencies is tied to a sort of mystery, like the mystery of the value of money itself, consisting in the new money’s connection to advanced science. Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work.\nThat mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal. None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a compelling story may not be enough.\nThis article has been published with permission of Project Syndicate — The Old Allure of New Money.\nCryptocurrencies taking us back to the Stone Age Blockchain is one of the most overhyped technologies ever", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/cryptocurrencies-scientific-narrative-by-robert-j--shiller-2018-05", "https://global.oup.com/academic/product/eurotragedy-9780199351381?cc=us&lang=en&", "https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11007.html", "https://www.project-syndicate.org/", "https://data.flw.li/piwik/", "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/aug/14/british-museum-exhibition-communist-currencies-russian-revolution", "https://smartasset.com/snippet.js", "https://books.google.com/books?id=v1zqCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA121&dq=robert+owen+AND+%22time+money%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz0_PQ2ofbAhVktlkKHYstDzwQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&q=robert%20owen%20AND%20%22time%20money%22&f=false", "https://www.investing.com/crypto/currencies", "https://books.google.com/books?id=9hIsAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=equitable+commerce+and+warren&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiX9JaG2YfbAhXtt1kKHb9fAM4Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=equitable%20commerce%20and%20warren&f=false", "http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/61?msg=welcome_stranger"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "viviana zelizer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "conn.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T17:16:18.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "432d94fdda2e773e7f6049eee1049f035c76d499", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS2vXhRF24H1rg8m60zoCroY-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Free $100 Bitcoin Daily!", "title_full": "Free $100 Bitcoin Daily!", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "432d94fdda2e773e7f6049eee1049f035c76d499", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS2vXhRF24H1rg8m60zoCroY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Free $100 Bitcoin Daily!", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInvite your friends now to grow your network rapidly.

Wright made his entry into the stage at last week’s CoinGeek Conference in Hong Kong.\n“You’re going to see every month—shortly, ever week, and very soon after that, practically every day—one or two papers coming out from us.”\n“Bitcoin is cash,” Dr. Wright says. “If we want to use Bitcoin, if we want it to be something, it first needs to be cash,” he asserts. “The key behind Bitcoin, the key behind every single blockchain that will ever exist is economic.”\nAtomic swaps\nIn March, Dr. Wright mentioned the “atomic swaps” at another event in Hong Kong, but decided not to elaborate further until all the paper work was done. But he did say that he can drive exchanges to the ground, and hinted that it will all be free for users.\n“I can buy and sell Ethereum to Dash inside Bitcoin today. I can make exchanges obsolete,” Wright declaredtwo months ago. “Right now, I can do a peer-to-peer exchange of Ethereum and Dash on Bitcoin Cash.”\n“I don’t want your money. There’s my scam: I’m not going to take a cent from anyone,” he added. “I’m not going to stop you. I’m just going to basically out-compete you. We’re going to release—freely—a whole [lot of things] that make all that you’re doing there obsolete.”\nAt last week’s conference, however, he was more than happy to talk more about it. The atomic swap would supposedly enable inter-blockchain conversion between different cryptocurrencies to happen on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.\n“I don’t just mean swapping secrets. I mean we can embed key exchanges and you can pre-sell Ethereum, pre-exchange Dash, and using Bitcoin Cash, you can exchange them. One hundred percent safe, one hundred percent secure.”\nReferring to the competition with other blockchains and cryptocurrencies, he added: “Here is my answer to competing with all this: we’ve patented [technology] and we’re going to subsume them.”\n“We’re going to make them a Bitcoin Cash sidechain,” Wright said. “It’s only ever going to run on Bitcoin Cash. We are going to make Ethereum a side chain for Bitcoin, if people want to use it. And we are going to make Bitcoin Core (BTC) a side chain to Bitcoin Cash,” Wright said, instantly prompting laughter and applause from the audience.\nDevelopers and project founders are welcome to build\nInviting developers and project starters to delve in, he added: “This technology will be there for developers, not so that we own it—so that you do . That’s what we want to see: we want to see you guys take what we’re doing and create the new environment.”\nDr. Wright adds that this means a whole world of possibilities for development, and that they will be helping developers get onboard and build projects for themselves. “In the next months, we’re going to start teaching you how you can not only tokenize basic things—we’re going to do the promise of Bitcoin. We are going to get common shares with dividends, with voting rights. We are going to allow you to make a registry that can never be deleted, can never be lost, can never be hacked, can never be subsumed, taken, or stolen by a government, by an individual. That’s what Bitcoin should be about—that’s what we’re going to help you build.” Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (segwit) Chain are Referred to as BTC coins.

In fact, Vanguard is using such technology. As for bitcoin the currency? I see a decent probability that its price goes to zero.”\nDavis argued that bitcoin should not be classified as money, because although it could qualify as a unit of account and medium of exchange it is not an effective store of value. Moreover, he said that its current valuation is based purely on speculation rather than economic fundamentals.\nHe wrote:\n“The investment case for cryptocurrencies is weak. Unlike stocks and bonds, currencies generate no cash flows such as interest payments or dividends that can explain their prices. National currencies derive their prices from the underlying economic activity of the countries that issue them. Cryptocurrency prices, on the other hand, are generally not based on economic fundamentals. To date, their prices have depended more on speculation about their eventual adoption and use.”\nHe further warned investors against allocating even a small percentage of their assets to bitcoin, as this will reduce their exposure to “tried and true asset classes” in favor of an asset class whose investment case is “hardly compelling.”\n“As innovation quickens and competition increases, the majority of networks (and their associated cryptocurrencies) may be rendered obsolete, leaving many cryptocurrencies like tulip bulbs in 17th-century Holland—soaring to incredible heights before the speculative bubble pops,” he said, parroting a common-but-dubious analogy. “And, unlike tulips, they don’t look very nice in a vase.”\nDavis isn’t the first Vanguard executive to disparage bitcoin as an investment and cryptocurrencies as an asset class. Last year, Vanguard Group founder John Bogle advised investors to “avoid bitcoin like the plague” since it has no underlying rate of return. “When it gets back to $100, we’ll talk,” he said.\nOther asset managers, however, are beginning to warm to the nascent cryptocurrency industry. Goldman Sachs is preparing to launch a bitcoin trading operation , and even JPMorgan — whose CEO, Jamie Dimon, has long been one of bitcoin’s most outspoken opponents — may soon help its clients invest in cryptocurrency.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "oldtwitter davis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vanguard economist ⋆ tech talk", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T19:27:50.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "16ea012a89a9982bc3e0f1d355614e85f7518e5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwvAZquwlz8J_336Y61B7Ak-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.137, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "16ea012a89a9982bc3e0f1d355614e85f7518e5c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSwvAZquwlz8J_336Y61B7Ak-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nTo take part in the promo, you need to make public post on your timeline in one of your social networks and keep it live at least before the promo ends.

Large companies accept Bitcoin, the largest and the most popular digital currency at present.\nThe gradually increasing ease of transfer of Bitcoin has made it a legitimate source of trade. This article tries to uncover the answer to questions regarding the acceptance of Bitcoin. Why Do Bitcoin Have Value?\nBitcoin is an efficient means of transferring money through the internet. It is also rolled by a decentralized network where there are a transparent set of rules.\nThis might be the main reason why Bitcoin has become an alternative to the fiat money which is controlled by central banks.\nA set of assumptions have been made on how and why Bitcoin has value. The assumptions are given below:\n1. It is assumed that Bitcoin will derive its value from its use as a means of a transaction as well as a store of value. It must be considered that the utility of Bitcoin as a store of value depends very much on its utility as a medium of exchange.\nIt can be said that for Bitcoin to have a store of value, it needs to have some intrinsic value. So, it can be noted that if Bitcoin is not a successful medium of exchange, it will possess no practical utility. Hence, it will have no intrinsic value and will not be a good store of value.\n2. The current protocol has stated that the supply of Bitcoin will approach 21 million. At present, the supply of Bitcoin is around 13.25 million.\nThere is a decrease in the rate at which Bitcoin is released by half coarsely every four years period. By 2022, the supply of Bitcoin, in this way will pass over 19 million.\nWe assume that this protocol that has been specified will not be changed over time. A change in the protocol will require the agreement a huge number of the computing power which mines the Bitcoin.\n3. As the Bitcoin become legal and acceptable across the world by larger scale investors, its instability will reduce. At this point, the volatility in Bitcoin is not a concern for the people who adopt it.\n4. At present, the value of Bitcoin is also characterized by speculative interest. Bitcoin is often regarded as a bubble due to the drastic changes in price and huge media coverage since 2013. After Bitcoin are adopted by more investors, its speculative interest will gradually decrease.\n5. There will be no involvement of fractional reserve banking for Bitcoin. All the sources of storing Bitcoin will be completely backed by Bitcoin.\nThere is a methodology that has been applied to the assumptions to see the value of Bitcoin. Bitcoin will be looked at as both a currency and a store of value.\nTo know what value Bitcoin holds, we need to see what market penetration Bitcoin will achieve in each both the cases. An arbitrary value of 15%, for both the cases, is taken.\nThis approach is taken to have a current worldwide value of all mediums of exchange and to calculate the value of Bitcoin.\nThe estimate for the global value of stores of value comparable to Bitcoin, which includes savings accounts, small and large time deposits, money market funds, and gold bullion, comes to 47.1 trillion US dollars.\nThe estimate for the global value of mediums of exchange and stores of value roughly lands to 72.1 trillion US dollars. As said above, if the Bitcoin were to achieve 15% of this valuation, its market capitalization in current money would be 10.8 trillion US dollars.\nWhen 21 million Bitcoin is in circulation in the economy, the price of 1 Bitcoin will land to $514,000. Thus, in this estimate, the price of Bitcoin in the future will be 1,000 times its current price.\nThe question that follows this methodology is the adoption that Bitcoin will receive in the days to come. For the current price of Bitcoin, pricing to find out the value of the current price of Bitcoin, it is necessary to involve the pricing of the Bitcoin in the risk of low adoption or failure.\nSome models often consider the velocity of money. thus, it can be said that the predictable velocity of money is said to be more or less equal to its current value. Some models also consider the specific industries or markets that Bitcoin could impact or disrupt after its usage.\nRelated post: How to Convert Bitcoin into Cash?

A new research paper has highlighted the growing problem as major cryptocurrencies seek to solve it. Bitcoin’s Energy Crisis Explored According to the figures, the amount of energy used for each transaction could run a dishwasher for a year. Alex de Vries wrote: “With the Bitcoin network processing just 200,000 transactions per day, this means that the average electricity consumed per transaction equals at least 300 kWh, and could exceed 900 kWh per transaction by the end of 2018.” This doesn’t mean that Bitcoin transactions couldn’t be processed without high amounts of energy, it’s just that there are a lot of miners. Currently , miners earn about $100 per transaction. Digiconomist estimates the consumption of electricity by Bitcoin Miners in its Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index (BEXI). According to its data, Bitcoin uses 67.91 TWh annually which is just greater than Chile, ranked 40th in the world at 66 TWh. They estimate that the amount of electricity used per transaction is higher at 929 kWh which would be the equivalent of running three dishwashers for a year. The main issue is that the figures are rising at a much steeper rate and have been since September 2017. BEXI has to work backwards to calculate the energy used. It starts with how much money the miners are making and works out how much they probably spend on electricity. Then they consider the price of electricity and estimate how much is used. It does rely on several assumptions but it would be much harder to contact all Bitcoin miners and ask how much electricity they use. Will the Lightning Network Help? The Lightning Network will take Bitcoin transactions off-chain by setting up channels between users. Transactions between them will occur and only be recorded on the blockchain when the channel is closed. This will reduce the number of transactions that nodes will have to confirm and in doing so, will reduce the energy required for maintaining the network. However, the majority of electricity used is for Bitcoin mining where computers generate hashes that fulfil a set of criteria. Reducing the number of transactions on the blockchain is unlikely to affect how many miners there are. Bitcoin transactions have halved since December but the mining difficulty has doubled , indicating there is twice as much mining equipment being used. This means that the Lightning Network will only be able to solve some of the problem. In reality, the best bet for Bitcoin, using Proof-of-Work, is using renewable energy, as highlighted in a response to the paper. The International Energy Agency said that renewable energy is set to grow 40% by 2022 and highlighted that renewables are dominant in new energy sources being created. Iceland has already shown how it can work as it runs on 100% renewable energy. In essence, renewable electricity allows the Bitcoin Network to run without changing its underlying structure. Other ways of solving the problem include moving to Proof-of-Stake as Ethereum is doing. Digiconomist estimate that Ethereum uses about a third of the amount of electricity used to mine Bitcoin. NewsBTC reported on the recent publication of the code for Casper. The move is likely to reduce electricity usage significantly, but the question is whether or not the network will remain secure.

This story, astrology-based financial investment, and many more feature in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief.\nAlso Read: Marvel, The Simpsons Go Crypto Parity Shuts Down ICO Passport Service\nThe team behind Parity Technologies, the developers of the Parity multi-signature wallet, have announced they are shutting down PICOPS, a service used by ICO campaigns to comply with KYC/AML regulations by validating that the owner of an Ethereum wallet has already passed an ID background check. The reason for the closure is a new EU dictate called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is meant to bring a new set of “digital rights” for EU citizens and guard their personal data. The regulation that will come into force this Friday has already killed other services in the crypto space such as the P2P exchange Cointouch and has forced others to change the way they do business such as Localbitcoins .\nThe Parity team explained that: “GDPR creates new and untested challenges when storing personal information on the blockchain. These challenges make running a service like PICOPS more difficult. We are looking at ways of resolving the uncertainty and making PICOPS compliant with GDPR while keeping it useful. However, as things stand, the solutions we have identified restrict the service to a very limited set of features. Because of this, the significant resources required to make PICOPS GDPR-compliant, and the fact that PICOPS is not part of our core technology stack, we have decided to discontinue the service, despite overwhelming market needs and demand.” Indian Ban Case Shifts to Supreme Court\nThe Supreme Court of India has taken over the cases of Coin Recoil and others challenging the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) ban on local banks from dealing with bitcoin companies. The n ext hearing of this now combined case is planned for July 20, 2018.\nRashmi Deshpande, Associate Partner at Khaitan & Co., commented: “The Supreme Court has recently transferred the entire batch of petitions pending at High Court level with respect to the contentious issue of RBI effectively banning transactions in cryptocurrencies. This decision highlights the importance of this issue at a national level from not just a legal, but also an economic standpoint. We strongly believe that the RBI’s circular to effectively discourage the business of cryptocurrency exchanges is an arbitrary decision against the freedom of the right to trade guaranteed by the Constitution. We are hopeful that justice will be meted out at the Supreme Court level.” Written in the Stars\nAstrology-based financial investment is apparently a thing, and many practitioners are using it to navigate the tumultuous seas of the cryptocurrency markets. This is according to a Marketwatch report that cited a number of astro-investors and even a professional astro-analyst talking about the practice as well as their predictions.\nThis matter came into the forefront recently after ex-NFL star Ricky Williams shared his use of the of study of celestial objects with CNBC . “When I look at things, I tend to look at astrology to get insight. The insight that got me interested in Bitcoin was the planet Uranus is about to enter into Taurus,” he explained. Roboforex to Compete with Wallets\nRoboforex, an IFSC (International Financial Services Commission of Belize) licensed financial firm offering crypto CFDs , has introduced a new service for its clients to buy BTC with fiat directly from the broker. The company believes that its regulated status will convince users to use their accounts over existing wallets.\nDenis Golomedov, Chief Marketing Officer at Roboforex, said: “Providing the ability for clients to deposit into their accounts in Bitcoin is not only an additional service, which expands clients’ opportunities, but also a standalone product, which significantly dominates over its market counterparts. Security has become very significant issue recently, as more and more information appears about hacking cryptocurrency exchanges and stealing users’ assets. Using the cryptocurrency is much more convenient and safer for clients within the framework of their trading and investment activities, using products and services provided by a regulated broker”.\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates?

Unlike the fiat (physical) currency which can be printed, stored and controlled by the banks, cryptocurrencies can only be held electronically in wallets created solely for the purpose of their storage. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies is made possible through the blockchain. This is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently in a verifiable and permanent way.\nThe peer-to-peer methodology of cryptocurrency transactions are meant to be secure, and in most cases, anonymous. The peer-to-peer approach eliminates the need for a third party as in the case of conventional financial institutions (banks) which will usually oversee the transaction and charge a fee for the services rendered.\nSecurity and anonymity is achieved through cryptography. Cryptography is a process which is used to protect data or information from theft and alteration by converting them into undecipherable codes which can only be interpreted by the person it is meant for. It can also be used for user authentication.\nThe concept of blockchain and cryptocurrency was first introduced by a person (or group of persons) called Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Satoshi’s idea of a decentralized currency, devoid of manipulation and inflation caused by the world’s major financial institutions gave birth to the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin in 2009. Bitcoin became the first digital currency to enable a safe andsecure exchange of product/service between two parties without requiring a third party institution.\nThe process of creating bitcoin is called mining. Although the concept of bitcoin was innovative and ground-breaking, but just like other mother technologies, it had some shortcomings that had to be improved upon. The quest for these improvements that will eliminate the flaws noticeable in bitcoin has led to the creation of numerous other cryptocurrencies called ‘alternative coins’ or altcoins for short. Examples of altcoins are ethereum, ripple, digibyte, litecoin e.t.c.\nBENEFITS OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES\n1. Inflation: The fact that there are a maximum number of units of a certain cryptocurrency that will ever be available makes the issue of inflation of these digital currencies almost non-existent. They cannot be printed at will as in the case of the fiat currencies. Taking bitcoin as a case study, are only 21 million bitcoins that will ever be mined. As it becomes more widely accepted and adopted by the general public as a legal tender, there will be more people in demand for it, and since there is a limited quantity available, there will inadvertently be an increase in the value of the coin with increase in demand.\n2. Transparency: Transactions cannot be manipulated in the blockchain without letting others know about it.\n3. No boundaries: when talking about transactions using cryptocurrencies, there are no limits. The sender and receiver can be in two different parts of the world, and still exchange the digital currency for a product or service rendered without any hassles. The inter-country transaction is extremely easy with cryptocurrency because its function is not under the control of any central bank. There is also no limit to the amount of cryptocurrency that can be\ntransferred at any point in time.\n4. Low transaction fees: Compared to the transaction fees incurred when making use of the services offered by the banks, the fees paid for cryptocurrency transactions are usually negligible, and in some cases, even non-existent.\n5. No Charge-backs: Once a payment is confirmed in the blockchain, it cannot be reversed as in the case of charge-back transactions that are allowed by credit card companies. This considerably depletes the chances of being defrauded by unscrupulous individuals.\n6. Individual Ownership: In a traditional banking or credit card system, you effectively turn stewardship of your funds over to a third party that can exercise the power of life or death over your assets. Accounts may be closed without notice for infringements of a financial institution’s Terms of Service – requiring you as the account holder to jump through hoops in order to get yourself back into the system. Perhaps the greatest of all advantages of cryptocurrency is that unless you’ve delegated management of your wallet over to a third party service, you are the sole owner of the corresponding private and public encryption keys that make up your cryptocurrency network identity or address.\n7. Very Secured: The encryption provided by the use of cryptography makes it next to impossible for someone other than the owner of a particular wallet address to access the wallet and make payments with it, except it was hacked or the information was left where it could be easily accessed.\n8. A Way to Protect against Political Instability: Cryptocurrency is a great way to tuck away wealth outside of the risk of regular currency volatility. This concept probably doesn’t make a lot of sense for North Americans who enjoy fairly stable currency, but in countries with less political — and therefore monetary — stability, cryptocurrency offers an attractive avenue to protect your assets from the long hands of the government, bank and possibly, a currency collapse. If you live in a region where your money is becoming worthless in the global economy by the day, for example Zimbabwe where the Zimbabwean dollar was effectively abandoned as an official currency in 2009, cryptocurrency can protect your personal and family wealth while giving you an asset your government cannot seize.\nTHE DRAWBACKS OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES\nAs with all technologies, cryptocurrency has its shortcomings.\n1. Price Volatility: Just as the volatility of cryptocurrencies can lead to incredible gains, it can also lead to an unexplained drop in the value. In essence, what most people are actually doing in cryptocurrency is gambling. That is why in investing with cryptocurrency, one is advised\nnot to invest more than what he can afford to lose.\n2. Mass Adoption: The very uncertain nature of cryptocurrency is a reason why mass adoption of it as a legal tender is taking so much time.\n3. Possibility of Wallet Loss: If you lose your wallet ID or password, your money is as good as gone since there is no way to do a password recovery and the design of the blockchain ensures that only you know what your wallet ID is. The price for recklessness is steep. Get my video tutorial courses on cryptocurrency where in one of the videos I show you how to adequately secure your wallets from theft and get back access to your wallet if your password was misplaced or forgotten.\n4. Difficult to Understand: This is a relatively new technology but it already has lots of information on the internet. It is a complex concept that will require a lot of learning before it can be fully grasped, but most people just dive in without the appropriate knowledge and end up losing their invested money in the process.\n5. No Payment Reversal: If payment was made in excess for a particular product or service, it is only by dialogue with the receiving party that a refund can be made. That is if the receiving party agrees to send the funds back. In a case where the receiving party is unknown, there is no way to get a refund. Hence, utmost care must be taken when making payments in order to avoid such costly errors.\nAlthough cryptocurrency has not gained significant reception yet, it is slowly and steadily consolidating its position as a force to be reckoned with. With the cryptocurrency market capitalization of about $400 billion (coinmarketcap.com) as at the time of writing this report, we can see the effect it currently has on the world economy. Clearly, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages which is why the base of cryptocurrency will continue to grow as it gets more widely accepted.\nWHAT GIVES BITCOIN ITS VALUE?\nThere are a couple of factors that determine how bitcoin is valued. First of all, bitcoin has some of the characteristics of fiat money (fungibility, divisibility, uniformity, durability, portability). In the same vain, it has some other factors that gives it an edge over money. These factors are a reason why bitcoin has been termed by some as ‘digital gold,’ and also contributing factors to why the mass adoption of bitcoin will happen much sooner than anticipated. Highlighted below are some of those factors that make bitcoin valuable.\n1. Limited Quantity: The amount of bitcoin available, as with most real cryptocurrencies, is limited. As I mentioned earlier, only 21 million bitcoins will ever be mined. This can help curb inflation as more bitcoins cannot be printed at will beyond the cap that has been set at its\ninception.\n2. Decentralization: Unlike the fiat currencies, bitcoin transactions are not subject to approval or opinion of any external authorities. The fact that the blockchain network operates on a peer-to-peer basis makes it almost impossible to shut down. Being a censor-resistant alternative to our conventional payment system has made it an irresistible and disruptive technology.\n3. Elimination of Double-spending: Double-spending is a potential flaw in a digital cash scheme whereby a token of this digital cash can be spent more than once. This is possible when the digital file can be duplicated or falsified, thereby leading to an inflation. This is not the case with regards to bitcoin. The amount available cannot be altered.\nWHAT DETERMINES THE PRICE OF BITCOIN?\nLike every other commodity, bitcoin has its market where it can be bought and sold. Simply put, demand and supply is what drives the price of bitcoin. When demand for bitcoins increases, the price increases, and when demand falls, the price falls. There is only a limited number of bitcoins in circulation and new bitcoins are created at a predictable and decreasing rate, which means that demand must follow this level of inflation to keep the price stable.\nBecause Bitcoin is still a relatively small market compared to what it could be, it doesn't take significant amounts of money, a very sensitive news or information, to move the market price up or down, and thus the price of a bitcoin is still very volatile.\nHOW ARE BITCOINS ACQUIRED?\nThere are basically 4 ways by which one can come in possession of bitcoins:\n1. Trading on an Exchange: An exchange is a platform where cryptocurrencies can be bought, sold, stored and traded against one another. The most common cryptocurrency exchanges include Bittrex, Binance, Bitfinex, Cryptopia etc.\n2. Accepting Bitcoin as a Means of Payment: Bitcoin can be accepted as a means of payment in exchange for a product that is purchased from you or a service you rendered. People are beginning to see the wisdom in this method of payment because of the perceived potential increase in the value of that payment in the nearest foreseeable future. For instance, the famous musical artist, 50 Cent accepted bitcoins (about $400,000 worth) as payment for his album Animal Ambition in 2014. He left the bitcoins untouched until 2018. As at the time of writing this report they were worth between $7 million to $8 million. You can read more about the story here ( https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16930010/50-cent-rich-bitcointwitter- instagram-humblebrag).\n3. Mining: This is the peer-to-peer computer process used to secure and verify bitcoin transactions – payments from one person to the other on the blockchain. Mining is the mechanism used to introduce bitcoins into the system. Miners are rewarded with new bitcoins as a motivation for their role in processing transactions and ensuring that the network is always safe and secure.\n4. Buying from Someone Directly: If you know someone who sells bitcoins, you can simply make a request of the amount you would like to purchase. This individual has to be trustworthy because it is usually payment before service. You cannot afford to make a payment to someone who will run away with your money or someone who will try to short change you in the exchange.\nWHY YOU SHOULD TAKE BITCOIN AND CRYPTOCURRENCY INVESTMENT INTO CONSIDERATION IN 2018\nInvesting in your future is a smart move. For those in their 20s, you may not be thinking about the future and the need for investments. However, it is when you are young that you should begin to get into the habit of investing in your future. Whether you invest in stocks, real estate, or in cryptocurrency, starting your investments when you are younger is a great way to ensure that you have a plethora of funds when you are of retirement age. If you are new to investing, this section will highlight some of the reasons that you should consider before investing at least a small percentage of your net worth into cryptocurrency.\n1 .Easy to do if you know what to look out for: There are different ways to invest in cryptocurrency. You can choose the type of cryptocurrency that you want to invest in which means that you have just as much flexibility in this as you would in stocks. But because cryptocurrency is perhaps the newest way to invest in your future, you may think that it would be difficult to do. The truth, however, is that investing in cryptocurrency is actually quite simple once you get the hang of it. The first thing that you will need to do is to conduct some research on the types of cryptocurrency exchanges that are available. In addition, you will need to determine how you will store your cryptocurrency. Some choose to invest in a virtual wallet, while others prefer to store their currency on an exchange. Both options are quite simple and will not take a great deal of time to learn how to manage.\n2.Trendy: Cryptocurrency is the newest and latest craze when it comes to making investments and having assets. To invest in cryptocurrency, you can do so online and from the comfort of your own home. The level of accessibility to the internet is perhaps a major reason that has contributed to the success of cryptocurrency.\n3. Less transaction fees than other ways of investing: When you invest in stocks or forex, you will most likely need to work with a stock broker or a financial advisor to help you make sound decisions when it comes to your investments. While this is a smart move, doing so will cost you money as you will need to pay for the advice that you are given. However, if you plan to invest in cryptocurrency, you can do so on your own without having to hire a financial advisor or pay for the services of a stockbroker.\nOn a final note, Investing in cryptocurrency is a great way to start off planning for your future. With the accessibility to the internet, low fees, and the ease of making a sound investment with whatever exchange you choose to use, you will be off to a great start when it comes to planning for your future.\nWorld renowned billionaires like Bill Gates and Richard Branson have weighed in heavily and positively on the subject of blockchain technology and how they see it birthing a new era of financial revolution. Also, John McAfee, a computer programmer and founder of the McAfee Antivirus, has also predicted that price of one bitcoin will be worth $1,000,000 by 2020 ( https://bircoin.top ). Do not wait until it is 2020 to get your hands on some, no matter how little.\nMoney as we know it has moved. Your best bet is to figure out where it has moved to and get there before the rest of the world catches on. Position yourself now so that you won’t look back some time in the future and regret why you missed getting your own piece of the pie while it was still early and affordable. As the saying goes, success belongs to those who see opportunities before they become obvious.\nWould you like to learn how to make $200 - $300 monthly from trading cryptocurrencies?\nWould you also like to know what to look out for in order to invest wisely in winning ICOs?\nVisit http://onlinewealthacademy247.com/earlybird/ to get accesss to more advanced, hands-on video tutorials on these cryptocurrency topics.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://onlinewealthacademy247.com/earlybird/", "https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16930010/50-cent-rich-bitcointwitter-"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T20:26:01.056+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d9a25792db2878b642c12ab7b57b26e43d04c6a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjrDl7Vzcp4W_WUzYmXf6dMMeF2pY_BiuaMSnALuxe2yuyKBuAXxzfQ5mc.9FC7E3eJFPIXnR8f7TjYgNE8Soyp75JvQhPLdpqb_l6D88_AtzmR38xABALS9tOsLwiLffA5dwqc1FOxjq2G4fJwD5n", "site_full": "www.fool.com.au", "site": "fool.com.au", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Crypto update: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, and Litecoin surge higher | Motley Fool Australia", "title_full": "Crypto update: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, and Litecoin surge higher | Motley Fool Australia", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "AU", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://www.fool.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bitcoin-currency-3341500_1280.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45571, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d9a25792db2878b642c12ab7b57b26e43d04c6a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjrDl7Vzcp4W_WUzYmXf6dMMeF2pY_BiuaMSnALuxe2yuyKBuAXxzfQ5mc.9FC7E3eJFPIXnR8f7TjYgNE8Soyp75JvQhPLdpqb_l6D88_AtzmR38xABALS9tOsLwiLffA5dwqc1FOxjq2G4fJwD5n", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "James Mickleboro", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Crypto update: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, and Litecoin surge higher | Motley Fool Australia", "text": "James Mickleboro | May 21, 2018\nThe cryptocurrency market has bounced back after a disappointing week of trade with strong gains over the weekend.

Crypto market faces internal resistance and outside hurdles.\nBitcoin is mostly unchanged since the start of the day, though the digital coin No. 1 has gained nearly 3% within recent 24 hours. Positive sentiments returned to the cryptocurrency market. On Sunday, Bitcoin managed to break an important resistance area at $8,400-$8,425, created by 50-DMA and 38.2% Fibo retracement of the decline from $11,567 to $6,483. The breakthrough increased positive momentum allowing the price to touch $8,600 for the first time since May 15. Currently, BTC/USD is trading at $8,500 amid rising trading volumes.\nMeanwhile, investors are deeply disappointed by lack of positive vibes from Consensus2018.

The coin needs to stay above $8,400 to retain short-term positive momentum. Otherwise, the sell-off may be extended towards $8,000 handle with the next target at $7,683 (23.6% Fibo). The upside is capped by Sunday's high at $8,600. Once this level is cleared, the focus will shift onto $8,800. This area capped the recovery in the middle of May.

One recently released study conducted by Alex de Vries says that Bitcoin mining consumes 24 THw of energy or as much as Ireland. To make matters worse, the study estimates that Bitcoin’s energy use is doubling every six months. By the end of 2018, Bitcoin could use as much as 67 THw or the annual energy consumption of the Czech Republic.\nWhile those numbers might seem high, things may not be as bad as they sound . For starters, one of the main issues with Bitcoin mining is that it was originally powered in large part by coal plants in China. In recent years, however, China has worked to rein in its pollution problem, and many Bitcoin mining operations have moved to countries which make use of cleaner energy.\nAnother issue is the matter of distribution. Comparing Bitcoin’s energy usage to countries such as Ireland or the Czech Republic is useful to help visualize the scope of their operations, but that doesn’t tell the full story. Bitcoin mining can happen from anywhere in the world so no one country’s infrastructure is bearing the brunt of the cost.\nBeyond that, there are numerous experts who dispute this study’s findings. Jonathan Koomey, a professor at Stanford who, in the 1990s, disproved similar fears about the internet, says there simply isn’t enough data available to draw conclusions.\n“For two decades, people have been eager to overestimate electricity use by computing,” Koomey told NBC News . “My concern is that we simply don’t have adequate data to come to the strong conclusions that he’s coming to.”\nOne of the issues Koomey points out is that it is difficult to determine how the value of the energy used in Bitcoin mining and the price paid for that energy. He is unsure of where de Vries is getting the two numbers he uses for those values.\n“The worry is that those are two numbers that are picked out of the air,” said Koomey. “There may be some basis for them, but it’s a very unreliable way to do these kinds of calculations, and nobody who does this for a living would do it like that. It’s odd that someone would.”\nThe other issue is the accessibility of Bitcoin data. Many Bitcoin miners are concerned about their privacy which can make it difficult to accurately determine how much energy is used.\nThe mining of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies does consume a fair amount of energy, but it’s unclear as to exactly how much.

Buterin posted a since deleted tweet with a screenshot allegedly from a Google recruiter asking if Google “ma[d]e sense for you now or in the future,” along with a poll to the Twitter community over whether or not to take the job. In his original tweet, Buterin neglected to censor the recruiter’s name, email address, and profile photo. The pool had over 2,000 responses before being taken down, with the majority voting “No” to Buterin leaving Ethereum for Google. At the end of March, Google revealed that it is working on two separate blockchain projects: a “tamper-proof” auditing system and a cloud operations platform. Earlier that same month, Google had announced plans to ban all crypto-related ads. Reddit user Fuyuki_Wataru commented on a post about Buterin’s Google-related tweet and delete, writing: “[Buterin is] free to do what he wants […] honestly his talent is too large to be caged in, even when at a company at [sic] Google. If you’ve achieved this much at such a young age, I think life has more plans for you.

There is a significant ascending channel formed with support at $8,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is likely to accelerate gains above $8,650 if it continues to follow the ascending channel. Bitcoin price is trading with a positive bias above $8,400 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD could extend the current move above the $8.650 and $8,800 resistance levels. Bitcoin Price Analysis (BTC/USD) After a spike below the $8,000 level, bitcoin price found a strong buying interest against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair traded as low as $7,915 before starting an upside move. It gained traction and moved above the $8,000, $8,200 and $8,400 resistance levels. The upside move was positive since there was a close above the $8,400 pivot level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. BTC buyers got in control and pushed the price above the last swing high of $8,506. It opened the doors for more gains and it seems like the price may well test the 1.236 Fib extension level of the last decline from the $8,506 high to $7,915 low. At the moment, the price is consolidating gains above the $8,400 level. There is also a significant ascending channel formed with support at $8,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Should the price gain bullish momentum, it could easily break the $8,600 resistance to test the 1.618 Fib extension level of the last decline from the $8,506 high to $7,915 low at $8,870. Looking at the chart , the price remains well supported above the $8,400 level. A downside break below $8,400 may well call for a short-term reversal of the current trend. Looking at the technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is slightly in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is moving lower towards the 50 level.

Ontology, Tron, AirSwap\nThe majority of tokens in the space have experienced an intensified movement on the downside, mimicking the downward pressure of bitcoin but with larger margins. Consequently, even tokens like ONT, ICON (ICX), and 0x (ZRX), which have consistently outperformed most major cryptocurrencies throughout April and May, fell substantially.\nOn May 21, most of these tokens rebounded from their recent losses, recording large gains against bitcoin which recorded a 4 percent increase against the US dollar. Against bitcoin, ONT recorded a 10 percent increase, AST rose by more than 15 percent and TRX demonstrated a 9.5 percent rise.\nAST is a particularly interesting token to observe, especially as a long-term investment because despite its hype and media coverage it received, it still remains as the 198th largest cryptocurrency in the world with a $62 million market valuation. Although the market cap of AirSwap is relatively small in comparison to other tokens like ONT and ICX, AST has more room to grow in the long-term.\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) of AST is at 53, signifying a neutral zone. Given that AST is still demonstrating a neutral condition after a 15 percent increase against bitcoin and both exponential and simple moving averages show a positive short-term trend, it is likely that AST continues to grow past its current price at 0.00004925 BTC. Strong Bounce\nBitcoin has been on a continuous downward trend ever since it failed to test the $10,000 support level in early May. Over the past 7 days, the bitcoin price has remained in the range of $7,900 to $8,785, struggling to gain momentum above $8,800, which is considered as a major support level that could allow the price of bitcoin to test the $10,000 support level again in the short-term.\nThe latest attempt of bitcoin to breach the $8,800 support level was on May 15, nearly a week ago. After surpassing $8,850, due to the pressure of bears, bitcoin dropped rapidly to $7,925 and bouncing back in the $7,900 region. If the bitcoin price can rebound to $8,800 in the upcoming days, possibly within the next 48 hours, it is likely that the bitcoin price tests the $9,600 support level soon after, eyeing an entrance into the $10,000 region by the end of May.\nOver the past week, bitcoin has been able to gradually build momentum from $7,900 to $8,500, which it has not done in previous corrective rallies. The stability in the price movement of bitcoin could provide more resilience in testing major support levels in the short-term.

May 21, 2018 418 Choosing a particular currency to invest in has very little to do with how well we consider a project or what we believe it stands for. It’s all about trying to figure out if the coin will grow in value as the platform associated with it will be adopted and achieve new partnerships and, as a consequence, the coin’s price will rise. So the main point to consider, if you want to become an investor in the crypto world, is to determine which asset has better chances to be profitable.\nEthereum (ETH) is the world’s most crucial cryptocurrency after Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization, and it’s had several successes recently. Tron (TRX) is not even a full-year-old yet (the crypto will turn one year old this July 1st), but it’s about to launch its very own platform, and has a very respected leader Justin Sun who is hugely admired and respected in the business world, not just among cryptocurrency fans.\nTron’s rise has been so impressive and so quick that it’s now being lauded as a candidate that soon will be playing with all the market’s bigger boys (Ethereum and Bitcoin included). Ethereum (ETH) is the second most recognizable cryptocurrency, thanks to its recent successes and ranks behind Bitcoin only in market capitalization. TRON (TRX) is an emerging platform, soon to launch its Mainnet and lauded as a potential top contender in the market. Which one makes for a better investment? Why TRON (TRX)? TRON is becoming a star cryptocurrency very quickly. It’s been up and down, but behind its fluctuations, Tron’s founder and CEO Justin Sun’s resolution, to make it work and create a web that is decentralized and democratic remains rock solid. TRON’s coin is called Tronix (TRX). It has seriously tanked before, mainly due to the speculative influence that sometimes a massive influx of inexpert investors brings to the market. There are two things about TRON that could make it the superior investment choice: it’s new Main Net’s potential, and Mr. Justin Sun’s proficiency at marketing and leadership Tron’s new Main Net The new Main Net , which is scheduled to come online this next May 31st will impart TRX and the network with a set of advantages that Mr. Sun has hailed as much better than Ethereum’s. While Ethereum fans were less than thrilled to hear that (not to say hostile), Mr. Sun usually delivers on promises and those new features could allow Tron to be adopted in mass very quickly. The transaction fees will be 0.00001TRX per transaction ( you don’t get any closer to zero than that ). The network scalability will grow dramatically (delivering as many as ten thousand transactions per second). These features will be critical as Tron attempts to take over and decentralize the whole world’s entertainment industry which is one of the foundation’s core aims and values. If the gaming industry takes TRX seriously, it will become valuable sooner or later. Effective marketing Last April Tron did a thirty million dollar airdrop to the Ethereum community. This brought TRX into many new user’s awareness, and all these new users are now paying attention to the Main Net launch. The launch includes an incentive package for users and community members worth two billion dollars, no less. This will pull users and developers into the new infrastructure, create a broader community that will be very committed to the project and that will work hard to bring Tron into the mainstream through adoption. Being a little speculative, there is a chance that TRON’s rise could make some of the world’s big tech companies pledge their support through adoption and other means. Alibaba is often cited as the leading candidate because Mr. Justin Sun is Mr. Jack Ma’s (Alibaba’s founder) protegé and former student. This would be delightful news for Tron. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is the crypto world’s darling right now. It’s more influential, known, and has both the market’s momentum and inertia going for it. Some observers even think it could leave Bitcoin behind at some point in terms of market capitalization. Some projections put ETH’s value at its peak by this year’s end. DeVere Group’s CEO, Mr. Nigel Green, is quoted as saying, “The price of Ethereum is predicted to increase significantly this year, and could hit $2,500 by the end of 2018 with a further increase by 2019 and 2020.” While Ethereum remains the platform of choice for developing decentralized applications and launching ICOs, that’s because it’s been virtually unchallenged so far on that. But as five new cryptocurrencies will be releasing their own Main Nets this very year, Ethereum’s dominance in this regard could be short-lived or, at least, seriously challenged very soon. But for the time being, new projects appear all the time on the platform. Gas, weather, space exploration, just to name a few. The new apps developed in the platform (and that end up working) will add value to its underlying currency. Ethereum improves through upgrades Ethereum’s dominance will stay around for a while yet. But it presents some scalability limitations and problems, and the relatively high fees it charges make developers feel attracted to other platforms. Mr. Vitalik Butrin and his team have perceived this problem and are working hard to improve the platform by releasing relevant upgrades. Sharding and Casper are some good examples. It’s possible that the new proof of stake algorithm will send Ethereum through the roof. However, there is a very serious potential problem. Ethereum could be legally classified as a security, and that would make its value drop. While could only be a hiccup that will allow it to recover value in time, it would not play well in terms of investor confidence. Last thoughts Tron (TRX) position as one of the most successful (if not the most) emerging platforms and Mr. Justing Sun has been playing his cards very well, so it’s making it stand out and deliver on short-term goals. There’s a chance it will catapult this year, so this would be the right time to join. Ethereum is in a different situation; it just needs to come up with the correct upgrades to continue it’s unstoppable path to the top. So this is something of a David vs. Goliath situation. If what you want is a cheap coin that holds lots of potentials, then TRON is the way to go. Its current price is cheap enough that buying TRX in bulk will not set you back significantly. If, on the other hand, you have enough money to get into Ethereum, the returns will be nothing to sneer at.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Ma said he has been researching blockchain for years, and believes strongly in its potential to address issues of data privacy and security for society at all levels — governments, corporations and individuals — in an “era of big data.” He stressed that security is a top priority for the e-commerce conglomerate, which reported $39.9 bln in yearly revenue in its latest fiscal Q4 earnings release, and has a trading volume of “trillions of transactions.” Ma added that regrettably, much of the attention the emerging blockchain industry receives comes from speculators who view blockchain as a “huge gold mine.” Ma was wary of Bitcoin even during its peak in December 2017, reportedly telling CNBC Shanghai at the time: “I don’t know about Bitcoin at all. I’m particularly puzzled. Even if it can really work, the rules of global trade and the financial system will be completely changed. I don’t think we are ready. So I’m still paying attention to Alipay … to the US dollar, and the euro. We have a team that studies blockchain, but Bitcoin is not something that I want to pursue. We don’t care about Bitcoin.” Last year, Jack Ma became the richest man in Asia, according to Bloomberg, with his net worth surging to $41.8 bln. The overwhelmingly popular mobile payment app Alipay, run by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, reportedly has 450 mln users. As early as summer 2016, Ant Financial, introduced blockchain technology to improve accountability in its work with the Chinese charity industry, going on to recruit blockchain experts in the company at large the following year. However, in line with Ma’s position, Alibaba Group has stopped short of embracing cryptocurrencies, with Alibaba Cloud recently denying rumours its newly launched ‘P2P Nodes’ network was a cryptocurrency mining platform. Later, in April, Alibaba subsidiary Taobao banned all ICO-related advertising from its platform.

While the process to buy and sell Bitcoin has been simplified over the past few years, many people still find it confusing. With banks, credit card issuers, and governments worldwide getting involved with rules and regulations on how the currency can be bought and used, it’s no wonder some people are wary to invest in cryptocurrencies.\nRecently, Bank of America, Chase, and Citigroup joined Capital One and Discover in banning cardholders from using them to buy cryptocurrencies. Credit cards were one of the most popular payment methods because of their relatively low fees and instant transaction rates, and investors are having to look at other options to make their investments. Different payment method options\nWith credit cards no longer being a reliable option, what are the best payment methods to buy Bitcoin? Each method has its perks and drawbacks, so it really comes down to what your priorities are when buying.\nDebit\nBest For: Small, Fast Investments\nThis option is most similar to using a credit card but without the associated risks of interest rates. You can use a standard debit card that is connected to your checking account, or you can buy a prepaid card. Using a debit card is widely accepted on most exchanges and instantly transfers, meaning you won’t have to worry about Bitcoin prices fluctuating before the transfer is complete. ACH transfer\nBest For: Large and/or Versatile Investments\nConnecting your bank account through an ACH transfer is a versatile option, allowing you to use a checking or savings account to buy Bitcoin or cash out when you want to sell. You’ll also be able to purchase a substantially larger amount of Bitcoin because of their higher buying limits. Just keep in mind that it can take up to 5 days for the transfer to be complete, and the value of Bitcoin can drastically change in that timeframe. Paypal\nBest For: Small, Fast Transactions\nPaypal was one of the first large-scale financial companies to come out in support of Bitcoin, but it has quickly become harder to find exchanges that allow customers to purchase through Paypal. Cryptocurrency purchases are at a high risk for chargebacks, which has caused some exchanges to ban the usage of Paypal. However, for small transactions or more anonymous buying, Paypal might be a good option for you. Bitcoin ATM (cash)\nBest For: Small, Cash Investments\nA rising trend in the world of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin ATMs allow users to purchase Bitcoin with cash through machines that work almost identically to standard ATMs. With over 3,000 Bitcoin ATMs scattered across the world (primarily in large metro areas throughout North America and Europe), you can use search tools such as Google Maps or Bitcoin ATM Radar to find one close. Just remember that while Bitcoin ATMs have low processing fees, they also have a low buying limit. Personal loan\nIf you are wary of using your own funds to invest in Bitcoin, loans are an option. You can borrow money from a family member or friend, or you can use a peer-to-peer lending platform like SoFi to leverage funds for Bitcoin investments. However, be cautious when borrowing money for an investment. Interest rates can eliminate any gains you get from the investment, and the risk of losing money in such a volatile market is high. READ Use bitcoin to hedge during a trade war: Bitcoin bull Brian Kelly Why is Bitcoin so popular?\nThe appeal for many is the fact that Bitcoin is decentralized, meaning no specific group or governing body has control over it. Instead, it is secured by advanced cryptography, a set of military-grade encryptions, and regulated by a network called the Blockchain. The Blockchain acts as a digital ledger, confirming buyer/seller funds and establishing the order in which transactions take place.\nBut what makes decentralized currency such an appealing investment?\n“Blockchain is a system of automated trust,” answered Trevor Welch, Chief Investment Officer at International Blockchain Investments (IBI). “We currently live in a world where some economies lack trust and transparency, others, like the US, apply it manually and with high cost and financial burden as well as a significant degree of human error. As a result any global economy can benefit from processing transactions that are verified and validated on a distributed public ledger.” How to buy or invest in Bitcoin?\nWhile the number of companies and industries that allow cryptocurrencies to be used to pay for goods and services is constantly increasing (you can use Bitcoin to pay for some things on Expedia and Microsoft, for example), the vast majority of people who buy Bitcoin or other popular cryptocurrencies still primarily use them as long-term investments. Cryptocurrencies are a new market (Bitcoin was first introduced less than a decade ago) and therefore an extremely volatile investment. In this pricing graph from Coindesk , you can see how the price of Bitcoin has fluctuated since it first debuted almost a decade ago, down to daily changes in value.\nhttps://www.coindesk.com/price/\nOverall, the USD value of Bitcoin didn’t really take off until the summer of 2016, when it started skyrocketing. By December of 2017, it hit $17.5K USD for 1 BTC. Since then, there have been a series of smaller peaks and crashes.\nThe constant fluctuation in value can make it difficult to determine the best time and method to buy, which is why we’ve compiled a step-by-step guide to help you navigate the world of Bitcoin responsibly. Step one: get a wallet\nJust like any other currency, you have to have a place to store your Bitcoin, or more accurately, store the private keys you can use to access your Bitcoin. These aren’t the type of wallets you buy at Target, though. The software comes in many different forms, most of which can be downloaded on your smartphone, tablet, or computer desktop. Here are the different types of wallets: Hardware. These are physical devices that look similar to a flash drive. If you are planning on buying high-value Bitcoin for a long period of time, this type of hardware is the way to go. Because they’re offline and completely controlled by you, they’re the most secure option for long-term storage and large sums of Bitcoin. Online Storage. Websites like GreenAddress act as an online wallet for users. While this is a convenient option for those looking to quickly buy and sell a small amount of Bitcoin, keep in mind that wallets that live entirely online are far more likely to be hacked than hardware or apps. Apps. Probably the most popular form of Bitcoin storage, wallet apps can be downloaded onto your smartphone or tablet. Samourai and Mycelium are solid options for Android users, while Breadwallet and Edge are the best options for iOS users. Desktop. These wallets combine the technology of hardware and app wallets. You download an application to your computer’s desktop, allowing you to use your house your Bitcoin wallet digitally, yet offline. Electrum is currently the top desktop wallet available. READ Breaking Bitcoin Conference Heading for Lisbon This Summer as “Building ... Step two: register with an exchange\nNext, you need to sign up for an account with an exchange. A Bitcoin exchange is an online marketplace where Bitcoin is bought and sold. There are a lot of different options out there, but make sure that the exchange you choose is reputable with a solid number of users. Step three: ID verification\nBitcoin used to be a way to anonymously send currency, but most exchanges now require identity verification before you can buy or sell. Transactions still offer slight anonymity, but Coinbase (and many other exchanges) are required by U.S. compliance laws to have a record of users on their platform.\nThis step is easy and usually just requires photographing your photo ID and a phone number for two-step verification. Verification can sound like a hassle, but it keeps the exchange protected from black market transactions, making it a safer space for everyone to buy and sell. Step four: payment method\nLastly, you’ll have to connect a payment method. For years, credit cards were the most common way to pay for Bitcoin. Recently, however, credit card issuers and some international governments have put strict regulations on using credit cards as a buying option. Most credit cards are no longer accepted as a method of payment, meaning people have had to look into other options.\nWe give you an overview of the most common methods of payment below to help you decide which is the best option for your investment. Step five: buy Bitcoin\nFrom there, you’re ready to buy and sell Bitcoin based on the current market value. Rather than paying for a set amount of Bitcoin, you will tell the exchange how much money you want to trade, and they’ll break down how much Bitcoin you can buy. Unless you’re investing thousands of dollars into the cryptocurrency, you’re likely to be buying a fraction of one Bitcoin.\nAt the time of this article, the price of 1 BTC was around $9K. But don’t worry if you’re not ready to invest that much. You can purchase as little as one-millionth of one Bitcoin (0. 1 BTC), also known as a Satoshi. Tips for buying and investing responsibly\nBitcoin (and all other cryptocurrencies) is an extremely volatile investment. While any investment is a calculated risk, a market as constantly fluctuating as cryptocurrencies poses a higher level of risk. Investing responsibly can minimize large losses while helping ensure you have the best chances of a positive return. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. This is a valuable piece of advice for any market, but it’s especially true for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. While the hype behind Bitcoin is positive, there is no guarantee of a good return. The value of Bitcoin could soar tomorrow only to crash next week. Know your goals and strategize accordingly. Are you looking to use Bitcoin as a currency to exchange for certain goods and services? Are you wanting a quick turnaround investment? Or are you wanting a long-term investment that will rise in value over time? There are different buying and selling strategies that work best for each goal. READ NYC’s first condo buys using Bitcoin are here\nOfir Beigel, CEO of 99bitcoins.com , suggests taking a slow burn approach to the cryptocurrency market if you’re looking for the best return possible. “Keep in mind there can be a lot of ‘noise’ in the background, like short-term bad news that lead to a crash,” Beigel says. “The key is to find investments you believe will yield after X time according to your targets, and to try detaching yourself from the short-term noise.” Choose trusted wallets and exchanges. The hype surrounding the cryptocurrency market has led many people to jump in headfirst without checking whether they are doing business with reputable sources. As the market starts to settle in the coming years, it’s likely that up to 80% of the wallets and exchanges currently in business will disappear. Don’t make an already risky market worse by choosing an untrusted wallet or exchange. Avoid borrowing money. One of the drawbacks when credit cards were the most popular way to pay for Bitcoin was the concept of borrowing money on such an unpredictable investment. When you borrow money that requires you to pay interest (credit cards and personal loans, for example), you risk having to pay extra for an investment that doesn’t give you a return, which exponentially increases your risk. Be skeptical of the hype. According to Welch, “in every way, the cryptocurrency market is a flow of supply and demand.” It’s one of the reasons it fluctuates so wildly. “When you see a lot of hype and excitement around a volatile investment that depends on supply and demand, take pause and look at what’s really going on.” He advises to take caution when you start to hear phrases like “get it before it’s gone” and “you won’t want to miss out on this.” A lot of hype can often be the precursor to a crash.\nPro Tip:If you want to invest, but aren’t keen on using your own funds, consider utilizing accrued interest on a savings account to invest. Compare savings accounts and their interest rates. If you put a lot of money into savings every year, you could fund a sizable investment with just the money the bank pays you in interest. It eliminates your personal risk and maximizes your chances of a return.\nThe best thing you can do to minimize risk and invest responsibly is to do your research.

Prices traded in a narrow band, near about $8,400. Most of the largest cryptocurrencies traded into the green Monday, but bitcoin teetered lower. Here's what you can't miss. Zcash Cashes in on Gemini News\nAs last week came to a close, most of the top cryptocurrencies by market value ended Friday, May 18, in the red. Zcash, however, certainly did not. Following news that Gemini, the cryptocurrency trust started by venture capitalists Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss of Facebook-founding fame, announced it won approval to start trading zcash, the digital asset soared. Zcash closed out last week higher 50% as daily trading volume jumped 285% on a week-by-week basis. While its 50% rally was meaningful when compared to a down week for most other crytpos, Zcash remains well below its all-time high of $953 set in early January. Bitcoin Miner Maker Files for Hong Kong IPO\nCanaan Creative, one of the largest manufacturers of bitcoin mining chips, has filed early paperwork for an initial public offering on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (HKEX). Canaan's registration remains in its primary stages, so it's unclear how much the China-based company aims to raise in an IPO. A report from Bloomberg suggested the firm wants to raise $1 billion, which, if true, would make it the largest cryptocurrency IPO to date. According to the paperwork Canaan filed with HKEX, the company raked in $204 million in revenue in 2017, a roughly 3,000% increase from a year earlier. Net income was $56 million in 2016, which was six times as large as that of the previous year. Colorado Could Approve Crypto for Politicians\nThe Office of the Colorado Secretary of State has published a new working draft of its political finance rules and regulations, and the state could soon allow political committees to accept contributions in the form of cryptocurrencies. The proposed new rules don't outline any specifics about what digital currencies could be accepted, but they do note that anonymous contributions must be no more than $20 and anything larger than $20 must be donated to a charitable organization or the state treasurer. The proposal states, \"A committee may accept contributions in cryptocurrency, up to the acceptable limit for a cash or coin contribution. The amount of the contribution is the value of the cryptocurrency at the time of the contribution. The committee must report any gain or loss after the contribution as other income or receipts.\" Bitcoin's Energy Problem May Not Be as Bad as You Think\nA study titled \" Bitcoin's Growing Energy Problem \" claimed last week that bitcoin mining was using, on average, as much energy as the entire country of Ireland at any given time, but it might not be as accurate as first thought. The study, published by Alex de Vries in the scholarly journal Joule, sent shockwaves throughout the crypto community, highlighting what many have perceived as one of bitcoin's biggest downsides. But Stanford professor Jonathan Koomey told NBC News the study could be off. \"For two decades, people have been eager to overestimate electricity use by computing. My concern is that we simply don't have adequate data to come to the strong conclusions that [De Vries is] coming to,\" Koomey said. The professor is known for his work in the 1990s that disproved similar fears about the internet. De Vries wrote, \"the bitcoin network can be estimated to consume at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future, making it comparable with countries such as Ireland (3.1 gigawatts) and Austria (8.2 gigawatts).\" But, \"The worry is that those are two numbers that are picked out of the air,\" Koomey said. \"There may be some basis for them, but it's a very unreliable way to do these kinds of calculations, and nobody who does this for a living would do it like that. It's odd that someone would.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kinsey grant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cameron winklevoss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zcash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gemini", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "thestreet", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T00:06:06.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "26d824d83b9078408d21eca14e885aaa60d4b560", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RkeXyWwa2NebdwDnoZzVQqLnk.FUteJun3AfElHVkRsA8ca1vro4PANnTe8Be132EGu5iFl.HpXEP6auftY8dAr5JT7rNoS2RzTSTCA3bQb_X33apPHGeaxql5h_3_lPp9d._cIGVutC", "site_full": "www.marketwatch.com", "site": "marketwatch.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "There’s a ‘decent probability’ bitcoin goes to zero, says Vanguard economist - MarketWatch", "title_full": "There’s a ‘decent probability’ bitcoin goes to zero, says Vanguard economist - MarketWatch", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.04, "main_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GJ604_bitcoi_ZG_20180521201738.jpg", "performance_score": 6, "domain_rank": 900, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 604, "comments": 0, "shares": 604}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "26d824d83b9078408d21eca14e885aaa60d4b560", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RkeXyWwa2NebdwDnoZzVQqLnk.FUteJun3AfElHVkRsA8ca1vro4PANnTe8Be132EGu5iFl.HpXEP6auftY8dAr5JT7rNoS2RzTSTCA3bQb_X33apPHGeaxql5h_3_lPp9d._cIGVutC", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aaron Hankin", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "There’s a ‘decent probability’ bitcoin goes to zero, says Vanguard economist - MarketWatch", "text": "Vanguard economist sees a ‘decent’ chance bitcoin will fall to zero Joe Davis sees central banks as potentially the cryptocurrency's biggest threat By Aaron Hankin May 22, 2018 Updated: 8:48 a.m. GMT\nA senior economist at the Vanguard Group, the $5tn investment house, is the latest market participant to pour cold water on the number one digital currency, MarketWatch reports .\nIn an op-ed Monday , Joe Davis said bitcoin is not a currency, it makes for a poor investment choice and its biggest threats are the very institutions it was meant to overthrow.\n“Over the past few months, I’ve gotten this question more than any other,” wrote Davis. “As for bitcoin the currency? I see a decent probability that its price goes to zero.”\nThe head of the Vanguard Investment Strategy Group argues that bitcoin does not meet the criteria of a currency — which its creator(s) and proponents believe it to be — saying it is a dubious medium of exchange and its excessive volatility does not make it a suitable store of value.\nREAD Bitcoin bull argues for rally to $20,000\nDavis, who works for the largest mutual-fund provider and second-largest provider of exchange-traded funds, said bitcoin doesn’t stack up as a traditional investment. “Unlike stocks and bonds, currencies generate no cash flows such as interest payments or dividends that can explain their prices,” wrote Davis.\nHe added that by adding bitcoin to a portfolio, you would have to reduce a “tried and true asset class”.\nWhile supporters of bitcoin and other digital assets see the technology as an alternative to central banks, Davis said bitcoin is not a true threat to them, arguing that there’s a good chance central banks will eventually adopt their own digital currencies, and will have the upper hand because they impose the regulations on exchanges.\nREAD Financial heavyweights pour scorn on bitcoin\nLike many cryptocurrency naysayers, Davis was more positive on blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that underpins bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but said the two do not go hand-in-hand like some argue.\n“Although cryptocurrencies are built using a blockchain, they are not necessarily tied to the value of blockchain applications that may improve the cost, speed and security of executing transactions or contracts,” wrote Davis.\n“Bitcoin is an investment in blockchain in the same way that Pets.com was an investment in the internet.”\nThis article was published by MarketWatch Filter by Topic ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joe davis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "aaron hankin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vanguard", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "marketwatch", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vanguard investment strategy group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vanguard group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T04:17:56.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9e4e6b14966adca907d698fbba6037376c5333f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8.W3OWbVkf9TITyl3GTFODplR8V0UdMoj5wcN5DVxT9XG4JQfXyvFFMT0ls.ejxKjn6FxtvsWOQzzs0kjklaCbS3ooSMt5UO0_Jfx_zr_wA--", "site_full": "ohiobitcoin.com", "site": "ohiobitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin I Am Satoshi Nakamoto Women's Short Sleeve T-Shirt", "title_full": "Bitcoin I Am Satoshi Nakamoto Women's Short Sleeve T-Shirt", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.03, "main_image": "https://ohiobitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/profile.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9e4e6b14966adca907d698fbba6037376c5333f5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8.W3OWbVkf9TITyl3GTFODplR8V0UdMoj5wcN5DVxT9XG4JQfXyvFFMT0ls.ejxKjn6FxtvsWOQzzs0kjklaCbS3ooSMt5UO0_Jfx_zr_wA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Specials", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin I Am Satoshi Nakamoto Women's Short Sleeve T-Shirt", "text": "\nYour typical 100% cotton t-shirt (except for heather colors, which contain 10% polyester).

There is a significant ascending channel formed with support at $8,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is likely to accelerate gains above $8,650 if it continues to follow the ascending channel.\nBitcoin price is trading with a positive bias above $8,400 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD could extend the current move above the $8.650 and $8,800 resistance levels. Bitcoin Price Analysis (BTC/USD)\nAfter a spike below the $8,000 level, bitcoin price found a strong buying interest against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair traded as low as $7,915 before starting an upside move. It gained traction and moved above the $8,000, $8,200 and $8,400 resistance levels. The upside move was positive since there was a close above the $8,400 pivot level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nBTC buyers got in control and pushed the price above the last swing high of $8,506. It opened the doors for more gains and it seems like the price may well test the 1.236 Fib extension level of the last decline from the $8,506 high to $7,915 low. At the moment, the price is consolidating gains above the $8,400 level. There is also a significant ascending channel formed with support at $8,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Should the price gain bullish momentum, it could easily break the $8,600 resistance to test the 1.618 Fib extension level of the last decline from the $8,506 high to $7,915 low at $8,870.\nLooking at the chart , the price remains well supported above the $8,400 level. A downside break below $8,400 may well call for a short-term reversal of the current trend.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is slightly in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is moving lower towards the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $8,400 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin price analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T12:00:52.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "917702b31a71cc0f067e0c5ae838e1420f012f44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mRlktelIWA5BP_k_YHtoeI1CTecnjDe8R8DYsyTkd1NDhQ3GKX5VsmDugjVlb2aSuKGEbTEGxBba.KEVCh9Vgro4dt5HFeV5fnMygsQzInov8OX0wdpGOj3UnAn58UsLom4ndlj28rhvPNJItpQG8al", "site_full": "1bitcoindaily.com", "site": "1bitcoindaily.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin price weekly analysis 21 May: Price recovers but there are still questions – 1 Bitcoin daily", "title_full": "Bitcoin price weekly analysis 21 May: Price recovers but there are still questions – 1 Bitcoin daily", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "917702b31a71cc0f067e0c5ae838e1420f012f44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mRlktelIWA5BP_k_YHtoeI1CTecnjDe8R8DYsyTkd1NDhQ3GKX5VsmDugjVlb2aSuKGEbTEGxBba.KEVCh9Vgro4dt5HFeV5fnMygsQzInov8OX0wdpGOj3UnAn58UsLom4ndlj28rhvPNJItpQG8al", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "View All Posts", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin price weekly analysis 21 May: Price recovers but there are still questions – 1 Bitcoin daily", "text": "1 Bitcoin daily Bitcoin price weekly analysis 21 May: Price recovers but there are still questions Its been a tough couple of weeks for <b>Bitcoin</b>.

On that day, the Tron blockchain is supposed to migrate from its existent ERC-20 standards to its own blockchain. Recently, more announcements have been made by Justin Sun, the founder of Tron regarding the progress being made for the fated day. If we consider Tron’s recent performance in crypto markets, there are signs of recovery and support from its dedicated community aka Tronics. Token holders have already been notified to transfer their TRX from Ether wallets to exchanges which are supporting the migration in order to avoid withdrawal and trading. In this article, we shall discuss the most recent progress made by Tron Foundation for the upcoming event.\nSupport for Mainnet for D-Day Increases\nTron has already announced that the token migration from ERC20 to mainnet TRX is going to take place between 21 st June to 25 th June. A TRX holder has to deposit the coins to mainnet supporting exchanges before the last date of migration. Some of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges have declared their support for Tron Mainnet migration. Recently on their twitter, Tron foundation shared a picture that contains names of all renowned TRX migration supporters. The list includes Binance, Bitfinex, Gate.io, Coinnest, Coinrail, Bit-Z, BiBox, Bittrex, Bixin and Zebpay. The co-operation Tron has received from these crypto-influencing giants is sure to result in a movement in Tron’s status on charts and contribute to its current rankings. The founder of Tron has already made a clear statement that with the Mainnet release, TRX is headed towards becoming 6 th largest cryptocurrency in the globe once again.\nTron’s Weekly Progress Report\nAccording to the recent technical reports published by Tron foundation, there has been active progress towards the fast-approaching mainnet launch. Developers have improved log information and exception handling of network modules. The stability of network modules has been facilitated. The consensus mechanism documentation was improved by testing and reviewing funds-related code. They continue to work on increasing the transaction speed, repairing bugs and pressure testing. It’s evident that these weeks are going to be extremely busy for people at Tron foundation as they have a responsibility to successfully meet the expectation of the global community. Tron has also accepted on working with more digital asset trading platforms to support the token migration.\nBitpie Wallet Joins Hands with Tron\nThe latest addition to Tron’s token migration list is a well-known wallet service provider called ‘Bitpie’. Every person who has exposure to cryptocurrencies and the wallets holding them knows the efficiency and level of security provided by Ethereum wallets (either hardware/cold wallet storage) such as MyEtherWallet and Ledger Nano S. in case a TRX holder has kept their coins on either wallet are advised to transfer to the above-mentioned exchange wallets. Tron has recently posted on medium regarding Bitpie wallets supporting Tron tokens migration and blockchain upgrade. According to the announcement, TRX holders and investors are being urged to deposit their ERC20 compliant TRX to Bitpie wallets in order to receive the equal amount of TRX tokens. There will be a weekly exchange for those who choose to deposit TRX after 21 st June. This recent announcement has relieved Tron’s community since it’s the first wallet support declared for Tron migration and the Bitpie wallet is a user-friendly wallet with functions such as instant trade, built-in exchange and it can successfully manage blockchain asset for its users.\nOther Upcoming Tron Events\nIt’s not just the token migration and the mainnet release for which Tron has made quite an effort to stand out, the team behind Tron has already mentioned its other launch events which are to take place close to the mainnet day. Tron is also expected to launch Virtual Machine, Tron VM v0.1 on 25 th of May for which TRX holders and investors are keeping their eyes peeled. The virtual machine will pave Tron’s path towards TRX migration and become a separate crypto entity. The Tron virtual machine is made in such a way that it would be compatible with ethereum virtual machine. Among all the details of the upcoming virtual machine release, it is developed to ensure that all dApps which were originally built on Tron’s platform based on Ethereum can migrate their projects with ease. As far as the trails of announcements go, the expectation bar for Tron is rising higher. Although the currency hasn’t made a prominent upward trend since a few days, there are chances that bulls are HODLing TRX closely.\nFinal thoughts\nAs per the current data on CoinMarketCap, Tron is placed as the 10 th biggest cryptocurrency of the world with an individual price of $0.072 USD that’s increasing at the rate of 9.53%. after the recent recovery signs, the total market capitalization of Tron has reached an approximate of $4.72 billion USD and since the past 24 hours almost $468 million USD worth TRX has exchanged hands, which signify that the Tronics have already started depositing their ERC20 Tron coins on mainnet supporting exchanges to prevent all sorts of losses due to the upgrade. Though the current situation is exciting for Tron there’s still chances of the paradigm getting shifted. So its advisable to stay on the safe side and enjoy the show.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

EOS\nClosing price on May 11: $14.90 Current market price: $13.60 Rank as per market capitalization: 5\nEOS fell to three-week lows below $12 last week, according to Bitfinex, indicating the excitement surrounding the coming mainnet launch is no longer boosting its price. However, the cryptocurrency did defend the 50-day moving average (MA) and moved back above $13.00 as seen in the chart below. Daily chart\nNotably, the ascending trendline (in red) is still intact, and EOS is trading well above the 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages, suggesting the long-run technical outlook remains bullish.\nA high volume break above the descending trendline resistance, currently at $15.62, would allow a re-test of record highs around $23.00. On the downside, acceptance below the rising trendline would signal a bearish trend reversal - i.e. the rally from the March 18 low of $3.87 has ended. Bitcoin cash\nClosing price on May 11: $1,372 Current market price: $1,250 Rank as per market capitalization: 4\nBitcoin cash (BCH) ran into offers around $1,500 on May 13/14 and fell to a low of $1,128 on Bitfinex on Friday - the lowest level since April 22.\nA planned software upgrade (or hard fork) to introduce new features came into effect on May 15 as expected, but around 20 percent of nodes have still not upgraded - perhaps negating any potential price boost from the news.\nSubsequently, the weekend's rally in bitcoin prices seems to have had a positive impact and BCH did regain bid tone, but it failed to cut through the key moving average, as seen in the chart below. 4-hour chart\nBCH is now back below the head-and-shoulders neckline, having faced rejection at the descending (bearish) 50-candle moving average hurdle. As a result, the recent low of $1,128 could again be put to test.\nA daily close below that level would mean the rally from the April low of $600 has ended and could yield a drop to levels below the $1,000 mark.\nHowever, a move above $1,500 (last week's high) would put the bulls back in the driver's seat.\nRoller coaster image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

Picture taken\nBy Alun John and Jennifer Hughes\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Bitcoins are worth less than half of what they were in December. Mining them is 60 percent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers.\nWhy, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world's biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date?\nCanaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.\n“Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public.\nThe offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world's second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment.\nThe Beijing-based company's profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin's soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand.\nBut the effects of bitcoin's volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong's central business district, where the IPO has been filed.\nBusinesses selling mining rigs there said demand - especially for high-end machines - was limping along.\nAlvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit.\n\"Since we weren't selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,\" said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district.\nThe change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming. [nL4N1PY242]\nBitcoin prices have fallen 40 percent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400.\nPROMISED LAND\nTo some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment.\n\"Investors are always looking for crypto 'picks and shovels', and that's what this is,\" said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm.\nCanaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock.\nHowever, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens.\nFast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 percent of their 2017 peak at roughly $17 million per day.\nLast month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), the world's largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain.\nCryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator's apparent approval.\nVisiting its factory, he said: “no matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you’re still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,\" according to mainland media reports.\nMARKET TEST\nBitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market - a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan's deal.\nAlthough the two sources were confident the IPO could raise $2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between $500 million and $1 billion.\nA lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price. In Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014. Eighteen months later, however, the company changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus to fintech software.\nLast year in Canada, listed miner Leeta Gold became HIVE Blockchain.\n\"Its not your everyday investment world,\" said HIVE chairman Frank Holmes, who is relatively new to the crypto world, but is a well-known investor in gold.\nHIVE, with a market capitalization of $318 million, mines bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Iceland and Sweden, favored for the energy-intensive process because of their cool temperatures and cheap power.\n\"We became the first public company that allowed institutions to play in this kind of space,\" Holmes added, pointing out that HIVE's second-largest shareholder is Fidelity, the giant U.S. fund manager.\nOther companies are also getting in on the act, with Canaan's smaller rival Ebang also considering a Hong Kong IPO, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.\n\"The excitement about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is not nearly finished, it is only just beginning,\" said Kenetic's Chu, who added that if successful, Canaan's IPO would encourage other cryptocurrency-related firms to list.\nPeople involved in Canaan's IPO say the prospects for the offering depend in part on the price of bitcoin over the next two months.\nWhile soggy prices, combined with rising mining capacity, will hit the hobby miners served by the Sham Shui Po shops far harder than Canaan's industrial-sized customers, they would still cast a shadow over the deal.\nIn Sham Shui Po, meanwhile, Alvin Wong says he will soon unplug his rig to put it and others back on the shelves - just as soon as customer demand returns.\n(Reporting by Alun John and Jennifer Hughes; additional reporting by Sijia Jiang and Fiona Lau of IFR; Editing by Gerry Doyle) More From Technology ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alun john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer hughes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "canaan inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T08:13:13.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc2dd71492ae45f616e17513c81d8b586797919d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS6xb_6u8wxgFKZt7.G6nUwI-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dc2dd71492ae45f616e17513c81d8b586797919d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS6xb_6u8wxgFKZt7.G6nUwI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nWe are going to pay you 15% of your friends earnings from our own mining capacities as soon as they will install CryptoTab by your personal link.Also, we are going to pay you 10% bonus from our own funds when your friends will lead their friends by their own links.Referral network includes payments for up to 10 levels of friends.

Since then, its value has risen and dropped sporadically from day to day. now its around 8,300 usd. So what may cause this drastic change of bitcoin value ?\nThe volatility in the price of bitcoin is something that is part of the bitcoin network and market, since bitcoin also operate on the law of demands and supply it price can never be stable. Bitcoin is not like other commodities that has a fixed price so at that the demands for it will always determine the price at every point in time.

cryptoanalyst Tom Lee, has explained to CNBC why he feels that his predictions of Bitcoin getting an injection from the last week’s New York Consensus Conference , didn’t actually come to fruition.\nAlthough Tom Lee stands by his prediction of $25K by end of 2018 position, he suggests that the reasons the market, not only didn’t receive the suggested boost but in fact, lost value, was mainly due to the current lack of clarity in regulation and custodial announcements at the conference. Firstly, he explained why the bitcoin price should have gained from the Blockchain week of events in NYC:\n“Given conferences like Consensus are chances for the community to gather in a centralized place and meet constituents new to the community (growth in attendance), it seems natural that the combination of ‘sanity check’ (all is OK and progress is happening) plus ‘new interest’ (incremental attendance) should strengthen the crypto-community’s conviction… And coupled with growth in incremental constituents, should have aided crypto-currency prices.”\nLee clearly wasn’t alone in expecting a bitcoin rally after the conference. Many were expecting a surge due to the popularity of the event and the number of attendees, particularly after months of uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market, and bitcoin’s recent signs of slow recovery. The total crypto market cap actually sank by $40 billion during the conference and bitcoin price declined by 3 percent.\nLee maintains that it wasn’t all negative, suggesting, “I think Consensus was a huge success. It is a great conference to bring a lot of people together from around the world. The quality of the people that were there was amazing.” He added:\n“Bitcoin doesn’t have to go up every day to move from $8,000 to $25,000. The ten best days account for all the return of bitcoin in a year. If you didn’t own bitcoin for ten days each year, you lost 25 percent each year.”\nThe Fundstrat analyst suggested that crypto enthusiasts expect that regulation needs further careful clarification and discussion, and was disappointed at the lack of a current nuanced approach by regulators in this regard.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at @BitcoinNewsCom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews\nThe post Tom Lee Explains Why His Post Consensus Bitcoin Prediction Went South appeared first on BitcoinNews.com .

Had bitcoin been labelled an investment, which is what it is, rather than a currency, it would have been blocked in a second by regulators.\n\"Its only value is if someone else buys it ahead of you. And because it's called a currency, investment solicitation rules do not apply to bitcoin in the same way they do to my funds. If they did apply, bitcoin wouldn't exist.\"\nMobius, the 81-year-old asset manager, added: \"I think bitcoin is a real fraud, I really do. The first thing I do is ask people 'can you explain it to me? Who is running it? Who is controlling it?' And nobody can. Whenever anybody asks me about bitcoin, I say 'sorry, I don’t like to talk about religion in public'.\"\nREAD Six of the world’s largest asset managers rule out bitcoin\nBitcoin has gained increasing prominence since its launch in 2009 and the price of the cryptocurrency hit a high of $19,343 on December 19, although it has since fallen back significantly to around $8,250.\nCritics argue the digital currency has no intrinsic value and cannot readily be used as a means of payment.\nMartin Wheatley, the former head of the UK's financial regulator, told Financial News : \"I have always thought cryptocurrencies were a bubble. There is no real underlying rationale for why they should be worth the sort of money they are.\"\nAsked if he would invest in Bitcoin, Wheatley, who was the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority for four years, said: \"Emphatically no.\"\nNick Leeson, the rogue trader responsible for the collapse of Barings Bank, added: \"I've been warning everybody I can against Bitcoin. It has that bubble feel about it. The news pieces on it seemed to be very one-sided while it was rising but greed and envy has taken over. Sadly I think a lot of people bought the high.\"\nThe comments come after renowned investor Warren Buffett said last month that buying bitcoin is closer to gambling than investing. \"If you buy something like bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don’t really have anything that has produced anything. You’re just hoping the next guy pays more,” the 87-year-old head of Berkshire Hathaway said.\nNigel Green, the founder of financial services organisation deVere Group, said in defence of bitcoin: “It comes as little surprise that Mr Buffett and his 94-year-old business partner, Charlie Munger, criticised cryptocurrencies at their annual meeting. They have done so consistently.\n“But what I do find monumentally baffling is that two of the world’s most successful investors cannot see the intrinsic value of some form of cryptocurrency. Do they honestly believe that there is no place for, and no value of, digital, global currencies in an increasingly digitalised and globalised world?\n“Do they not see many of the world’s major tech companies, established banking groups and household name investors investing in, using and/or beginning to adopt cryptocurrencies?\"\nTo contact the author of this story with feedback or news, email Filter by Topic ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://accounts.dowjones.com/auth/fn/login?target=https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/financial-heavyweights-pour-scorn-on-bitcoin-20180521"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mark mobius", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin wheatley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davide serra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark mobius getty", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "algebris investments", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T06:26:13.035+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cfccf564341b50c0857278ec726fea0b64e3d10c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoI8rBmJcD77ELu6zrVjcbptQKwqaXVb93muaTsR8JHc4A0vubhkn2.1pgDcn8zVLrrns9_Gc5KXq2GolBhCIXqZoM1DsUaEhIAO19IPk0mecxE0x4x_fBpHrn3AlEO1XzDOWFmpt5T6nLNisWkRxzM", "site_full": "blog.successwithagile.com", "site": "successwithagile.com", "site_section": "http://blog.successwithagile.com/index.php/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Agile Blog", "title": "Fundstrat Bitcoin Prediction for Consensus 2018… Still True?", "title_full": "Fundstrat Bitcoin Prediction for Consensus 2018… Still True?", "published": "2018-05-21T02:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cfccf564341b50c0857278ec726fea0b64e3d10c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoI8rBmJcD77ELu6zrVjcbptQKwqaXVb93muaTsR8JHc4A0vubhkn2.1pgDcn8zVLrrns9_Gc5KXq2GolBhCIXqZoM1DsUaEhIAO19IPk0mecxE0x4x_fBpHrn3AlEO1XzDOWFmpt5T6nLNisWkRxzM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "edtheadmin", "published": "2018-05-21T02:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Fundstrat Bitcoin Prediction for Consensus 2018… Still True?", "text": "FROM: https://decentralized.tv/netki-solving-investor-identity-validation-so-more-money-can-come-into-crypto/ What exactly is Netki?

Its genesis date was January 3rd, 2009. Bitcoin’s total supply is 17,044,850 coins. Bitcoin’s official Twitter account is @bitcoin and its Facebook page is accessible here . The official message board for Bitcoin is bitcointalk.org . The Reddit community for Bitcoin is /r/bitcoin and the currency’s Github account can be viewed here . Bitcoin’s official website is bitcoin.org .\nAccording to CryptoCompare, “Balances – block chain The block chain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions – private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing – mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends. “\nBitcoin Coin Trading\nBitcoin can be bought or sold on these cryptocurrency exchanges: EXX, Kucoin, CoinEgg, BTCC, Zaif, Negocie Coins, BitMEX, Upbit, Poloniex, Coinroom, Paribu, BitForex, Tidex, Coinrail, TOPBTC, Simex, GOPAX, RightBTC, Bibox, Coinsuper, CoinBene, OTCBTC, ZB.COM, WEX, Omicrex, Octaex, Gate.io, Bittrex, bitFlyer, Bitinka, DragonEX, BCEX, BtcTrade.im, Coinhub, Coinone, OOOBTC, Cobinhood, Livecoin, Fisco, Bitfinex, CoinTiger, C2CX, Iquant, Lbank, xBTCe, OEX, BitBay, Bit-Z, itBit, Hotbit, B2BX, HitBTC, CoinsBank, Neraex, Bithumb, Bitstamp, Luno, CoinEx Market, CEX.IO, Fatbtc, Sistemkoin, BTCBOX, Huobi, fex, Exmo, OKEx, Trade By Trade, Bitbank, YoBit, Quoine, Ethfinex, Exrates, IDAX, Korbit, LakeBTC, GDAX, Gemini, Binance and Kraken.

Last year, bitcoin rallied 69 percent during the Consensus conference, according to Fundstrat. \"Many repeat attendees commented that the panels felt more like commercials than substantive discussions, which was not the case last year,\" says Fundstrat digital currency analyst Alex Kern.\nBY Kate Rooney | Kellie Ell\nMike Segar | Reuters\nImitation gold bars are seen displayed at a vendor's booth on the floor of the Consensus 2018 blockchain technology conference in New York City, May 16, 2018.\nDespite calls that bitcoin would rally throughout New York City's \"Blockchain Week,\" the cryptocurrency's price has dropped about 10 percent since the festivities kicked off.\nBitcoin fell below $8,000 as the conferences wrapped up Friday, hitting a low of $7,931.43 after trading above $8,800 Monday, according to CoinDesk.\n\"Many repeat attendees commented that the panels felt more like commercials than substantive discussions, which was not the case last year,\" said Fundstrat digital currency analyst Alex Kern.\nBitcoin to hit $50,000 by year-end, says CEO of largest bitcoin exchange 8:48 PM ET Mon, 14 May 2018 | 09:57\nIn previous years, bitcoin had rallied significantly around a New York City blockchain conference called Consensus. Between May 22 and 24 when it was held last year, prices jumped 69 percent, Fundstrat said. Prices popped another 138 percent in the two months after the conference.\nIn a note to clients published ahead of this year's event, Fudstrat predicted a bump \"likely greater\" than in previous years \"given dramatic jump in attendance plus the fact BTC is down YTD.\"\nInstead, prices stayed in the low $8,000 range throughout the week, according to CoinDesk. Bitcoin hit a high of $8,835 last week before blockchain enthusiasts flocked to New York. The cryptocurrency has dropped more than 40 percent this year.\nBitcoin's one-week performance\nSource: CoinDesk\n\"While there was not a Consensus bump, our conviction on crypto-currencies strengthened during the conference,\" said Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee, who is the only major Wall Street strategist to cover bitcoin.\nLee even went as far as to say Friday on CNBC's \" Fast Money \" that Consensus was a \"huge success.\"\n\"It's a great conference to bring a lot of people together from around the world. And I think the quality of the people that were there,\" Lee told CNBC. \"It's amazing.\"\n\"It's the people that you know are important to this industry coming together,\" he said. \"But also a lot of decision-makers incremental.\"\nLee called bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies' declines, \"growing pains,\" and pointed that that the conference has more than tripled in attendance since last year.\nIn fact, this year's Consensus conference drew in more than 8,500 attendees, according to Barry Silbert, CEO and founder of parent company Digital Currency Group. CoinDesk reported 2,700 attendees for the May 2017 conference. At roughly $2,000 a ticket, the conference raked in at least $17 million in ticket sales alone.\nKate Rooney | CNBC\nMany attendees had to wait more than an hour to register at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2018 conference at the New York Hilton Midtown.\nMore than 20 other events happened as part of a \"Blockchain Week NYC,\" an event run in partnership with the New York Economic Development Corporation. Among the private, post-conference festivities: Snoop Dogg performed in the West Village for crypto start-up Ripple, and a new venture called rented out the 210-foot party yacht \"Cornucopia Majesty.\"\nZ-cash is one of the the only major cryptocurrencies to rally this week after trading platform Gemini announced it would list the coin on its licensed exchange.\nOther major cryptocurrencies struggled this week. Since Monday, ethereum has fallen roughly 9 percent, bitcoin cash is down 22 percent, and litecoin and XRP have both dropped 12 percent.
