From WhatsApp to Oculus, the company has used its bulging bank balances to stay one step ahead of consumer trends by snapping up tech and talent. And, after last week’s internal announcement that Facebook would be investing heavily in a new blockchain technology research wing, headed by David Marcus , one of the company’s top execs, leader of its Messenger platform and a former CEO of PayPal, it is quite obvious which new emerging technology the company has its sights set on now.\nBlockchain technology — and its incorruptible, decentralized digital ledger — could offer the accountability and transparency needed to pull Facebook out of its recent data security quagmire, which saw CEO Mark Zuckerberg dragged in front of the United States Congress following the Cambridge Analytica scandal . On the flipside, the decentralized nature of blockchains would make it difficult for Facebook to continue with its most valuable business model: harvesting user data and targeting users with advertising based on their online behavior.\nSo, with this conundrum in mind, how might Facebook be planning on using the blockchain, and how will this affect the overall development of blockchain technology? What Is the Plan?\nI would argue that there are three potential incentives for Facebook in building out its blockchain capabilities:\nThe first, and most obvious, is that Facebook is aiming to publicly align itself with a technology which is most famous for providing transparency and offering users control of their own data in the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The scandal has left many users questioning Facebook’s management of user data and the platform’s transparency and privacy terms, which blockchain applications could potentially alleviate.\nThe second is that Facebook wants to continue drawing developers to create apps on its developer platform by capitalizing on the popular trend of coders moving en masse into the crypto space. If Facebook can develop a platform where app developers can raise and earn from their apps via tokens on the blockchain, the speed to reward incentive is much higher. Tokens offer developers immediate value at the point of launch, rather than having to wait years for their apps to mature to hit the jackpot.\nThe third, in light of recent scandals, is that Facebook likely to be monitoring the progress of a number of emerging blockchain-based social media platforms , such as Steemit and YOYOW . However, to date, these competitors are well off being a real threat, with less than 100,000 daily users. As such, the chances are that Facebook is instead looking to the future, to launching a next generation social platform enabled by the blockchain which offers users more control over the use of their data, and the opportunity to be rewarded for sharing their data. How Is Facebook Most Likely to Use Blockchain Technology? Security and Data Management\nBlockchain technology enables immutable and transparent record keeping which could assist Facebook in re-establishing trust and confidence in the way users’ data is stored and used. Through the blockchain, users could see who had been given access to their data, which, in turn, would mean Facebook would have to do a better job of allowing users to set their own data access restrictions and limitations. For example, users would be able to see exactly what personal data they have stored on Facebook and subsequently decide what data can be made available to the public or for sale to marketers. This would also open the door to users being able to monetize the sale of their own data, via the Facebook platform. Marketplace and Cryptocurrencies\nThe creation of Facebook’s own tokens, based on Ethereum or other existing cryptocurrencies, would allow for the exchange of tokens on the Facebook app store and also in newer Facebook initiatives like the Facebook Marketplace.\nThe blockchain is best used in shared economies, where multiple parties cooperate and create a mutual environment of trust. Introducing tokens could allow Facebook apps and marketplaces to become more sophisticated but also more trustworthy. The added transparency of the blockchain, with increased user control of their own data, plus access to more than 2 billion active users, would be enough to bring most developers or brands onboard. What Are the Roadblocks to Adoption?\nThe decentralization of a platform which has based its whole business model on the total control of user data would require a truly radical redesign of the site’s architecture.\nHowever, while the move would be a huge task, it shouldn’t, in theory, pose too many performance-based issues. Technically speaking, there is no reason why decentralized databases could not be applied to social media networks. Existing blockchain technology, with some modifications, would be able to support the size of the platform and its traffic.\nThe bigger impact would be the overall redefinition of Facebook’s platform and architecture, creating a system where data access was controlled directly by the blockchain and its decentralized network of users. In short, Facebook would have to give up the reins of its user data and allow it to be controlled by the community as a whole. This change would blow its current advertising and targeting model out of the water.\nAs such, I think we are unlikely to see Facebook adopt this type of system in the immediate future. It is much more likely that there will be limited applications over the coming years, possibly in regards to the app store and payments, whereas a decentralized Facebook 3.0 platform will be released separately when the time is right. What Will the Long-Term Effects Be?\nIf Facebook integrates blockchain technology in a meaningful manner, we will undoubtedly see other big players in the social media space follow suit. The way in which Facebook uses the technology will be important. If Facebook goes down the route of creating its own cryptocurrencies or adopting existing ones, it will go a long way toward legitimizing and promoting the technology to the greater masses, and moving the blockchain and crypto closer to the mainstream worldwide.\nTime will tell as to whether Facebook will follow its previous path of acquiring startups like Steemit or whether the core values and structures of the companies will be so different that this will be impossible. But, while Facebook has had the resources to buy out competitors in the past, even the largest of businesses cannot purchase a cryptocurrency, such as Ethereum, which no one person owns. That said, we are likely to see Facebook try its hand at some form of decentralized social networking or data management platform in the coming years.\nHowever, while Facebook has the advantage of billions of users and bulging bank balances on its side, it will still face the same blockchain and cryptocurrency related legal issues as any other American business. It is important to note that, for such a large company, setting up a team of less than 10 people is a small step rather than a huge leap into the world of the blockchain. But it might be enough to show social media users around the world that Zuckerberg and his company have learned from their recent time in the naughty corner and are willing to clean up their act in the future.\nThis is a guest post by Jaroslav Kacina, the CEO of Equidato Technologies and the enterprise blockchain platform SophiaX .

The index was created and released by the China Center for Information Industry Development, part of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in Beijing. It evaluates the technological capability, usefulness of the application, and innovativeness of the project. Blockchain, the system powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet. Ethereum, whose currency is called ether, garnered an overall score of 129.4. It has the become the foundation for many initial coin offerings, in which start-ups create their own digital currencies and sell them to investors to generate financing for their projects. Bitcoin, founded nearly 10 years ago, had a rating of 88 and came in at No. 13. Blockchain projects Steem, Lisk, NEO and Komodo took second, third, fourth, and fifth place, respectively, with scores of 115.9, 104.8, 103.0 and 101.5. The index, which has 28 blockchain projects with their corresponding cryptocurrencies, will be updated monthly. The sector currently has more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies, with total market capitalization of nearly $380 billion, according to digital currency tracker coinmarketcap.com. Bitcoin, the largest of the digital currencies, last traded at $8,153.39 BTC=BTSP on the BitStamp platform. Ethereum was down 1.4 percent at $689.62. China in general sees blockchain technology as an active area of innovation and expects public blockchains and decentralized applications to become significant parts of the future economy. In the second half of last year, though, the Chinese government started to crack down on illegal initial coin offerings. China was the most active filer of blockchain patent applications last year, according to data collated by Thomson Reuters’ Practical Law from the World Intellectual Property Organization database. -Reuters ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lisk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steem", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "new index joomla social pic", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ministry of industry and information technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china center for information industry development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global public chain assessment index", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T05:28:31.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d62de959a62cbd797494e8c4cd1473b63cdde46", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS._d8BGQELnDnh0Fr_FvsdM-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "title_full": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5d62de959a62cbd797494e8c4cd1473b63cdde46", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS._d8BGQELnDnh0Fr_FvsdM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nThe number of referral network levels will be reduced for all newly registered users shortly!

It’s also tough to admit you’re wrong. One researcher may deserve some credit for owning up after his latest Bitcoin forecast failed to pan out.\nThomas Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, predicted on May 7 that Bitcoin would rally during Consensus, the cryptocurrency conference this week that drew thousands of enthusiasts (and some Lamborghinis) to a packed hotel in Midtown Manhattan.\nBitcoin didn’t rally. In fact, cryptocurrencies slumped about 10 percent during the past week, Lee admitted in a report to clients Friday.\n“Given conferences like Consensus are chances for the community to gather in a centralized place and meet constituents new to the community (growth in attendance), it seems natural that the combination of ‘sanity check’ (all is OK and progress is happening) plus ‘new interest’ (incremental attendance) should strengthen the crypto-community’s conviction,” he wrote. “And coupled with growth in incremental constituents, should have aided crypto-currency prices.”\nSo what went wrong? Lee said the crypto industry still needs more clarity from regulators like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as increased adoption by traditional companies.\n“Crypto still faces significant internal resistance and hurdles within traditional financial institutions,” Lee said. “But it is encouraging, nonetheless, that a large share of incremental attendance are financial institutions.”\nFundstrat still expects Bitcoin to be worth $25,000 by the end of this year.\n--With assistance from Andrea Tan and Blake Schmidt.\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Lily Katz in New York at lkatz31@bloomberg.net\n Catherine Larkin at clarkin4@bloomberg.net, ;Jeremy Herron at jherron8@bloomberg.net, Dave Liedtka, Andrew Dunn\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "crypto bull tom lee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fundstrat global advisors", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "midtown manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T23:44:36.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f8531a37ce12ad3a641b33f3219676d2d0b3bc36", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2LyKJFvGIayXvDLdNUwe.pnalnLS3teUPy08L1Z1FrLWpLxCYoet9SiGMeQAvDHGmz8TR1OzT4gXw7HWx3sSylIE6VKFUKVLkq0e3tn9rsKpfNw8Vwhyw", "site_full": "btcnewshub.com", "site": "btcnewshub.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "COTI Indicators Up over 2,000 Retailers to its Crypto Funds Service - Bitcoin News Hub", "title_full": "COTI Indicators Up over 2,000 Retailers to its Crypto Funds Service - Bitcoin News Hub", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://btcnewshub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/coti-signs-up-over-2000-merchants-to-its-crypto-payments-service.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f8531a37ce12ad3a641b33f3219676d2d0b3bc36", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2LyKJFvGIayXvDLdNUwe.pnalnLS3teUPy08L1Z1FrLWpLxCYoet9SiGMeQAvDHGmz8TR1OzT4gXw7HWx3sSylIE6VKFUKVLkq0e3tn9rsKpfNw8Vwhyw", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "COTI Indicators Up over 2,000 Retailers to its Crypto Funds Service - Bitcoin News Hub", "text": "Editor 0 Comments cryptocurrency , Ethereum , news , The Merkle\nTel Aviv, Israel , Could 18 2018 – COTI is main the best way within the adoption of cryptocurrency throughout mainstream markets.

Further, BTC has also found acceptance below $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement), a level which acted as a strong support since May 12.\nThe 5-day moving average (MA) and the 10-day MA continues to slope downwards in favor of the bears. The relative strength index (RSI) is also biased bearish (below 50.00 and falling).\nAnd last but not the least, BTC’s turn lower from $8,884 (May 14 high) and drop below $8,100 yesterday have established a lower highs and lows pattern (bearish setup).\nSo, it is quite clear that the drop to one-month lows in the last 24 hours has the put bears in the driver’s seat. View\nBTC looks set to test the immediate support lined up at $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement). A daily close (as per UTC) below that level would be the final confirmation of bearish trend reversal and will likely be followed by a sell-off $7,000.\nOnly a daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA (currently seen at $8,555) would abort the bearish view and could yield sideways to positive action.

Why has Bitcoin Been Crashing Despite Consensus? Pinterest\nConsensus is probably one of the largest annual conferences in the cryptocurrency space. With more than 4000 people in attendance and a large number of people coming in to conduct sessions and discussions about crypto trends of the past year. It is conducted annually by leading cryptocurrency news website Coindesk and is attended by all bigwigs of the industry.\nHistorically, every year the price of Bitcoin increases during the conference by a significant amount. This rise is and has been attributed to a large number of big names and market influencers in attendance who in turn lend a part of their credibility to the market which in turn becomes a reason for people to invest. However, this year’s Consensus broke that pattern. For the first time in four years, the price of Bitcoin has not gone up and has, rather, gone down, failing the predictions of Fundstart expert Tom Lee and others. And everyone wants to know why.\nThis year at Consensus, more than 8000 people were in attendance among them were speakers like Zooko Wilcox from Zcash and Coin Centre’s Neeraj Agarwal. Unlike the years before, this year also saw a lot of stock market tycoons looking to enter the space since the bull in 2017.\nBitcoin, since its gigantic surge to almost $20,000 USD in December, has become somewhat center of attraction once again. But for the first time since its inception, it was seen in a good one. A lot of business skeptics changed their positions and decided to invest and a lot of endorsements came Bitcoin’s way.\nThe price fall after this year’s Consensus meet is being attributed to just that. Endorsements from institutional investors. In the first quarter of the year, Bitcoin was given NASDAQ’s blessing by providing support to a cryptocurrency exchange called Gemini and NASDAQ’s CEO went on to say that the exchange is open to trading in cryptocurrency as soon as the regulation is clear.\nAlso during the first quarter of the year, big family names like Rockefeller and Soros also did a double down on their stance on Bitcoin and invested big bucks in the cryptocurrency. So much so that Bitcoin’s recovery in late January was attributed to these two business families.\nEssentially, the difference between the last and this year’s Consensus is the fact that there is a lot more interest from institutional investors and seasoned stock market expert investors. Which means that these institutions and investors come with and bring well-tested practices and policies of investing into the rather volatile crypto market that make sure that their investment doesn’t cause sudden, short-lived spikes in value.\nAnother reason that sudden spikes aren’t happening now is that people are a lot more experienced in all things bitcoin and it is also a whole lot more expensive to buy on a whim, making sure that the price is somewhat steady.\nExperts are now saying that this market scenario was what was expected and that the after-effects of Consensus will gradually show. And the sluggish response of Bitcoin’s value is purely market manipulation and investment tactics that legacy investors and institutions are applying to the crypto space. But only time will tell whether the post-Consensus price spike is a thing of the past, or is just changing forms and is still very much prevalent.\nWhat do you think?

Bitcoin is trading at $8,127 just below its 50-day moving average, down 2.7% today, and has been stuck in a relatively narrow range by bitcoin standards for the better part of the week of $8,700 to $8,100 , briefly dipping to $7,979 late Thursday London time.\nActivity on the Hong Kong -based BitMEX exchange, run by chief executive by Arthur Hayes\nwho made his name as an ETF trader, and where bitcoin futures are traded on leverage of up to 100x, may have been responsible for the sub-$8,000 drop. The liquidation of long positions in bitcoin on Thursday following a suspension on BitMEX may have contributed to briefly pushing bitcoin below the psychologically important $8,000 level.\nHayes in an appearance on CNBC's Fast Money predicted bitcoin would hit $50,000 by year's end, but he would say that wouldn't he.\nAccording to research site cryptocompare, trading volumes on the crypto exchanges it tracks is at the lowest for more than a year, coming in at 30,460 BTC.\nThe lacklustre performance of bitcoin, even against other altcoins never-mind fiat, continues despite some promising newsflow for the sector.\nBitcoin dominance of the crypto market has fallen to 37.45%, the lowest levels since February, according to coinmarketcap.\nMarket participants will be hoping the tight trading range and holding of support at $8,000 may be a pause before a renewed push higher.Circle to launch dollar-pegged crypto\nPayment startup Circle, whose backers include Goldman Sachs, announced this week that it would be releasing a cryptocurrency pegged to the value of the US dollar.\nCircle also completed a funding round this week, raising $110 million , valuing the company at $3 billion . Bitmain, the Chinese crypto mining giant took part in the funding round.\nCircle chief executive Jeremy Allaire\nplans for its Circle USD Coin project to leverage the use-case of crypto regarding speed of transfers and security compared to current fiat currency processes, as well as solve the volatility problem associated with crypto. \"It's a version of fiat that can move at the speed of the Internet with global reach, with much less cost, with high levels of security. It's a huge improvement for how fiat money transmission can work around the world for consumers and for businesses who might want to collect digital payment with tokens,\" Allaire explained.\nUSD Coin will be a regulated alternative to other so-called \"stablecoins\" such as Tether, which has been surrounded by controversy following the issuance of new coins without verifiable proof of backing by an equal amount of dollars.\nJack Dorsey\nthe Twitter and Square chief executive is doubling- down on his faith in crypto as the \"native currency\" of the internet, although he is not sure bitcoin will be the one. Speaking at the Consensus conference he said: \"I'm just approaching with the principle that the Internet deserves a native currency. It will have a native currency. I don't know if it will be bitcoin, I hope it will be bitcoin. I'm a huge fan.\"\nDorsey also revealed that not everyone at Square was enamoured with crypto and there have been heated debates about to what extent Square should embrace the nascent asset class.JPMorgan - from \"fraud\" to trading desk?\nJPMorgan has been the source of much mirth in the crypto community following its decision a few days ago to appoint Oliver Harris\nto the newly created position of head of crypto-assets strategy. JPMorgan has been working in the blockchain field for some time and, notably, was involved in helping Zcash to enhance its privacy features and it is thought that Harris will be working on a spin-off from that project as well as looking to make investments to bring blockchain start-ups to market.\nAlthough there is no firm indication that JPMorgan is setting up a trading desk imminently, it shows a softening of attitude in that direction. Some might say where Goldman Sachs leads, others follow - Goldman Sachs recently set up a trading desk for crypto.\nAs an aside, Zcash rose 40% this week when it was listed on the Gemini exchange owned by the entrepreneurial twins, the Winklevoss brothers.\nThe news from JPMorgan , the largest US investment bank, follows an interview with co-president Daniel Pinto\nwho claimed that bitcoin will fail, either through being strangled by regulators or because \"people stop believing in it\". Pinto added that he thinks the tokenisation of the economy \"is real\" and that although the bank had not traded bitcoin futures is was a in a position to do so. \"If we need to clear futures of bitcoin, can we do it? Yes. Have we done it? No,\" he remarked in comments to CNBC .\nThe former head of blockchain development at JPMorgan , Amber Baldet\n, revealed the creation of a startup called Clovyr, along with co-founder Patrick Nielsen\n, also formerly of JPMorgan . Baldet aims to position Clovyr as a kind of app store for decentralised applications.Bitmain diversifying, bitcoin mining costs to mushroom Bitmain, aside from making moves in Silicon Valley with its Circle investment, is also moving into artificial intelligence (AI), according to chief executive Jihan Wu\nin a rare interview. Bitmain dominates the manufacture of ASIC chips, which are specialised processors optimised for mining bitcoin.\nGiven the persistent rumours of China's government looking to curtail mining activities in the country, Bitmain is planning to diversify and AI is the perfect fit. \"Artificial intelligence requires lots of computations,\" he told Bloomberg.\nConcerning mining and criticism of the amount power it consumes, a peer-reviewed paper from economist Alex de Vries\nestimates that the bitcoin network will use 0.5% of the world's electricity supply by the end of 2018. Computers compete on the bitcoin network to solve a mathematical problem and are rewarded with 12.5 bitcoins if they win, equivalent to about $100,000 . Blocks are confirmed approximately once every 10 minutes.\n\"The Bitcoin network can be estimated to consume at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future, making it comparable with countries such as Ireland (3.1 gigawatts) and Austria (8.2 gigawatts),\" de Vries concludes.\nInstead of looking at hashrate, which is a measure of the computational resources of the network, to estimate electricity consumption, he extrapolates from the marginal cost of mining (average price x number of minted coins) while allowing for the fixed costs of equipment.\nVries assumes that miners, acting as rational economic agents, will tend to exit and enter mining activity in response to fluctuations in marginal costs.Blockchain ETF launch and China ranks Ethereum No. 1\nBitcoin believer Brain Kelly\n, founder and chief executive of BKCM a crypto-centric investment company, launched an exchange traded fund (ETF) this week. The actively managed fund is blockchain-focused and is a partnership with REX Shares. The REX BKCM ETF trades on the NYSE Acra exchange and has a 0.88% total expense ratio. Kelly said of the Wednesday launch: \"I get asked all the time on how to invest in blockchain technology without dealing with storage, the fears of hacking, hedge funds, etc. My hope is the BKC ETF can provide this desired equity allocation to institutions and individuals alike.\"\nChina's ministry of information technology has created a crypto index listing 28 coins, and released its rating for each constituent a couple of days ago.\nTop of the heap is Ethereum, in second place is the social media network Steem, followed by Lisk, the German blockchain for which developers can code in the popular Javascript language, NEO the Chinese-based blockcain dapp platform with a high degree of centralisation, and in fifth place Komodo, which is a fork from Zcash and uses \"zero knowledge proofs\" to make transactions either totally private or transparent, depending on user requirements.\nBitcoin was rated at 13th in the index, which has produced similar criticisms to when the US ratings agency Weiss gave it a B- rating, with supporters saying not enough credit is given for the longevity (and hence security) of the bitcoin chain and superior adoption rate.HTC blockchain phone, eToro to launch full-blown crypto exchange\nHTC is the latest Chinese phone maker to announce plans for a blockchain phone, following news that Huawei was already in the throes of making one.\nOther industry news sees the global social trading platform eToro announce plans to enter the US market and to build a crypto exchange with accompanying crypto wallet.\nUp until now eToro exposure to crypto has been provided chiefly through contracts for difference products, but new rules in the European Union are making CFD dealing more expensive to provide and there has also been a clampdown on the level of margin that clients can use when trading the products.\nIn another indication that the crypto marketplace is slowly maturing and institutional interest increasing, Thomson Reuters launched real-time price feeds for six crypto and the CME futures exchange has released a reference rate and real-time prices for Ether, the native token of the Ethereum network.\nThe CME started trading bitcoin futures in December last year and the ether developments may signal an intention to launch an ether futures product.\nThere has been speculation since the launch of bitcoin futures on both the CME and CBOE, that they may have played a role in making it easier to short bitcoin and hence dampen the price, although the trading volumes are relatively low which throws some doubt on that line of argument.\nThese articles are provided for information purposes only.

It was down to $7,925 earlier today on Bitfinex. This is its lowest price since April 18. On April 1 the price of BTC hit a low of $6,425 and then recovered to a high on May 5 of $9,990 but was unable to break through the $10,000 level. Since then bitcoin has lost half of the value it had recovered. It has now recovered somewhat and is above the $8,000 level. The minor recovery may be associated with an oversold position. Coindesk's technical analysis An article today in Coindesk claims the rise is likely to be short-lived as technical analysis shows that the odds are bearish. The close yesterday was well below the 50-day moving average (MA). This signals a continuation of the sell-off as well as does the price declining below $8,207. This was a price that acted as a strong support since May 12. The five-day MA and the 10-day MA both are moving downwards a sign that favors bears. The relative strength index (RSI) is below 50 and falling for the day another bearish sign. The turn lower has also established a pattern of lowered highs and lows, another bearish sign. CoinDesk's outlook The bears look to be in control for now: \"BTC looks set to test the immediate support lined up at $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement). A daily close (as per UTC) below that level would be the final confirmation of bearish trend reversal and will likely be followed by a sell-off $7,000. Only a daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA (currently seen at $8,555) would abort the bearish view and could yield sideways to positive action.\" Present situation The price opened today at $8,059.60. At 19:23 UTC time the price was $8,270.37 just below its high so far of $8,273.54. Its low so far today was $7,931.43. As there are over four hours left in the day, the situation could change. There is still quite a ways to go up to reach the 10-day MA of $8,555. However, it is even further downward to the support level of $7,787. The present price can be found here. Analysts see good price support for bitcoin at the $8,000 level The price of bitcoin has fallen below $8,000 a number of times lately but so far has always bounced back. Analysts claim that this shows that bitcoin has built up significant support near that level. Iqbal Gandham, the U.K. managing director of the social trading platform eToro said that there was lots of support at levels near $8,000. Charles Hayter, co-founder of the platform CryptoCompare also claimed that bitcoin had built up good support at the $8,000 level. However, another analyst for eToro took a more conservative view claiming that the strongest support for bitcoin on the downside was the $7,100 level, Market observer Marius Rupsys was even more sceptical, saying: \"There might be some support at $8000 but any price level can be broken. I would sit on sidelines to see where price goes next.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ken hanly", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "coindesk", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "coindesk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T23:42:21.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c24d58260dcf6765ead7fa70fdca6eae7d833c4c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS0s0NmD6oEJW4jpm2aZaCp4-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "How to Earn Free Bitcoin", "title_full": "How to Earn Free Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c24d58260dcf6765ead7fa70fdca6eae7d833c4c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS0s0NmD6oEJW4jpm2aZaCp4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to Earn Free Bitcoin", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\n Become a part of a huge mining pool!

RBI has set “a three-month deadline or by July 5 for financial institutions to comply with its notice, putting the cryptocurrency businesses in India in a disarray,” the Economic Times elaborated.\nThe latest writ petition was filed by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), a non-profit industry body representing the interests of online and mobile value-added services industry. It was filed on Tuesday according to IAMAI president, Subho Ray, and the Supreme Court website, Inc42 reported.\nCrypto exchanges that are part of the association include Unocoin, Zebpay , and Coinsecure. They were originally part of another industry body called the Digital and Blockchain Foundation of India which merged with IAMAI, the publication detailed. Four Other Writ Petitions\nThe fourth writ petition was “filed by a group of 11 different representatives from various crypto-related businesses,” the Economic Times conveyed on Monday. One of the petitioners told the news outlet:\nBanking is an essential service. How can one deny access to an essential service when I am not doing anything illegal? You have not declared VCs (virtual currencies) illegal in the country.\nThree more writ petitions were previously filed. One was by Kali Digital Eco-systems and another by Flinstone Technologies Pvt. Ltd, which conducts business under the trade name Money Trade Coin (MTC).\nMoreover, a joint writ petition was filed by four cryptocurrency exchanges in the Supreme Court against the RBI circular on May 8. According to lawyer Mohammed Danish, the four exchanges are Coindelta Exchange run by Bitfair Technologies, Koinex Exchange run by Discidium Internet Labs, Throughbit Exchange run by Throughbit technologies, and Coindcx run by Neblio Technologies. Supreme Court Taking Charge\nFollowing the petition by IAMAI, the Supreme Court on Thursday reportedly refused to stay RBI’s order. “However, it allowed cryptocurrency exchanges, their shareholders, traders and other individuals to present their cases within two weeks to the RBI, which will look into the issue in accordance with the law,” the Financial Express explained.\nAll petitions relating to RBI’s crypto directive will be heard by the Supreme Court; the hearing is set for July 20. Pending petitions have been transferred to the Supreme Court from two high courts – two in Delhi High Court and one in Calcutta High Court.\nFurthermore, high courts have been ordered not to entertain any more petitions regarding RBI’s crypto order, Business Standard described, adding:\nNo court shall accept petitions on the subject of cryptocurrency.\nDo you think the Supreme Court will reverse RBI’s order?

When bitcoin was introduced to the globe in 2009, it drastically changed the landscape of digital money. Because of the innovation and development in the industry, it has paved the way to the start of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and other hundreds of cryptocurrencies have reached a market valuation of approximately $110 billion.\nSo now, let’s take a close look at how the emerging digital assets landscape started. Are you ready? Keep reading to find out.\nPre-Bitcoin Era\nSince the early days of the internet, the idea of digital money has intrigued lots of people. The time when the World Wide Web (WWW) became popularized from the late eighties to nineties, cypherpunks (online privacy activist) began creating or envisioning digital currencies.\nMany well-known cryptographers like David Chaum helped pave the way for bitcoin. Along with the first digital currencies created by Chaum was Digicash. After a short time of serving the industry, it was later sold and utilized for settlements in different banks.\nDuring those years, there were also other attempts to create excellent internet currency like Bitgold, e-gold, and Hashcash. But all these ideas never caught on till Satoshi Nakamoto revealed his Bitcoin to the world in 2008.\nIn January 2009, the bitcoin network successfully came out in the market while the central banking systems were easing the globe away from potential economic failure.\nBitcoin Produced Hundreds of Cryptocurrencies Providing Different Features\nBitcoin’s success as the first cryptographic currency with an effective blockchain proved its predecessors wrong. Despite the criticisms from some individuals, it showed it had a better and bigger chance to help and succeed.\nAfter its birth in 2009, other cryptocurrencies appeared in the industry like what the experts have expected. Along with the earliest blockchain-based digital assets are Namecoin, Litecoin, Peercoin, and Feathercoin. A few of them provided different algorithms, a range amounts of tokens, and a new feature as well.\nFor example, Tenebrix (the first scrypt coin) led to the countless number of other coins. During the time, they were supposed to be ‘ASIC proof; however, they became untrue. The idea of Tenebrix also served as a pedestal to the development of Litecoin. In fact, the latter is based on the former. More particularly, Litecoin followed the scrypt based algorithm of Tenebrix.\nSince Litecoin’s inception, it has remained one of the most leading contending cryptocurrencies. Also, valuation-wise has been associated with its name.\nAfter Litecoin, Ryan Van Wagenen points out that Peercoin and other cryptocurrencies made their beginning. Peercoin was the first one that developed the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus. But it also employed the Proof of Work (POW) for other salient parts of the system.\nFor the scientific computing POW system, Primecoin was the pioneer. For the Cryptonote protocol, it was Bytecoin, which was followed by a wide array of methods in the cryptographic value exchange. The X11 algorithm, Quark algorithm, Proof of Importance (Pol), zerocash protocol, and other cryptocurrencies infused these techniques into their system.\nThese days, there are more than 870 digital tokens that the public can avail. Most of them can be found or even accessed on an assortment of cryptocurrency exchanges. When the time comes that you need one of them, the global cryptocurrency exchanges are the place to go.\nEthereum’s Domination and the Altcoin Landscape Shift\nOver the past few years, the highest valued digital assets were unable to perform its job. But now it is far different. Cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Stratis, Monero, and Dash have been profitable since the day of their launch.\nRyan Van Wagenen expands that without a doubt most of the market cap valuations for all these digital assets are worth hundreds of millions to even billions these days. Aside from that, Litecoin, Namecoin, Feathercoin, Peercoin and other older cryptocurrencies remain treasured assets. Nevertheless, the topnotch twenty coins in this 21 st century are much better than they were during 2013.\nNowadays, cryptocurrency markets increase their worth more than the cryptocurrency craze in the past. Specifically, the Ethereum economy has more than half of the market share of the mother of all cryptocurrencies surprisingly.\nWho would have ever thought that Ethereum would exceed Bitcoin’s success? Maybe none of the people from different sectors would believe it. But now it performs in a way that continuously surprises many of us.\nThe digital asset is worth more than $300 in each ether. Experts also believe that its value would climb to over $510, overtaking the market capitalization of Bitcoin. Moreover, a range of newer tokens and coins created with Ethereum have gained extreme value this 2018 as well.\nWhat Will Happen in the Coming Years?\nNo one knows what will happen to this emerging environment of cryptocurrencies. Most professionals believe its success will continue within a long span of time. Others think that bitcoin, as well as altcoins, will be the new money shortly. Some also believe that only a few of the digital assets will remain in this complicated industry, and one of those is bitcoin.\nBased on ICO fever as well as speculation on these trading platforms, people believe that an array of altcoin valuations will not be available in the future. They are aware that it is only a matter of time when a crisis could take place. All individuals should do is to come up with their cryptocurrency forecasts. Plus, exert effort to tether that with the information at the moment.\nAs of now, predicting the outcome of how cryptocurrencies will change the industry is not possible. But, all of us are familiar that exchange value is shifting different directions. And the mother of digital money pushed that envelope for the past few years.\nThe environment it has produced resulted in salient technical advancements. For that reason, all of us witness the biggest and the most impressive transfer of wealth in the history. It is an awesome feat for a blockchain technology that does not have ten years of availability in the business. Hopefully, it will continue to be better as more years go by.\nRyan Van Wagenen has been with Global Private Equity since 2009. After being promoted to Director within the firm in 2011, he began focusing within the technology sector. The freedom within the firm to find investments within the sector, led Van Wagenen to focus on the blockchain. After a few years, this led the firm to have interest in Bitcoin and later Ethereum and other more obscure cryptocurrency. Outside of business, Van Wagenen is an avid skier and enjoys the outdoor scene in Cottonwood Canyon near his home.

Like early claims about the energy-gobbling internet, experts find that assertion more than a little problematic. by Phil McCausland / May.17.2018 / 11:35 PM ET Application-specific integrated circuit devices and power units, manufactured by Bitmain Technologies Inc., at a cryptocurrency mining facility in Incheon, South Korea.

SUBSCRIBE\nIn the late 1990s, some experts were concerned that by 2010, half of the U.S. electrical grid would be dedicated to powering the internet, a claim that nearly caused a panic.\nThat proved to be more than a little overblown , as researcher Jonathan Koomey and his team at the Berkeley Lab showed at the time. They then proved themselves correct again in an August 2011 study that concluded that data centers consumed less than 2 percent of the country’s electricity.\nKoomey, a lecturer at Stanford, is now concerned that the same false alarm is ringing once again. This time, the shiny object is Bitcoin and the energy used to “mine” the digital currency.\nThe latest spotlight on the conversation came from a study published Wednesday that was produced by Dutch researcher Alex de Vries , who concluded that the Bitcoin network consumes nearly as much electricity as the nation of Ireland.\nKoomey finds that assertion more than a little problematic.\n“For two decades, people have been eager to overestimate electricity use by computing,” Koomey said. “My concern is that we simply don’t have adequate data to come to the strong conclusions that he’s coming to.” Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE What is cryptocurrency, and should you risk your money with it? 04:13\nDe Vries estimates that the Bitcoin network consumes “at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future.”\n“Economic models tell us that Bitcoin’s electricity consumption will gravitate toward the latter number,” comparable with Austria, which consumes 8.2 gigawatts, de Vries writes. “A look at Bitcoin miner production estimates suggests that this number could already be reached in 2018.”\nDe Vries is not alone in warning about Bitcoin's appetite for gigawatts. The rise in popularity of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has been met with growing concern about the energy usage required by the thousands of computing systems that power these virtual currencies.\nProducing each Bitcoin is called “mining,” and it requires a fair amount of computer processing power to verify the transactions that create the coin as well as add them to the public ledger.\nVarious studies have attempted to quantify the energy used in bitcoin mining with relatively different results . If there's two things all parties agree on, it's that Bitcoin mining is energy intensive, and that it's only expected to increase.\nBut there are a few problems with de Vries’ underlying assumptions, according to Koomey and other experts. They point to how de Vries calculates the value of the energy used in Bitcoin mining and the price paid for that energy.\n“The worry is that those are two numbers that are picked out of the air,” Koomey said. “There may be some basis for them, but it’s a very unreliable way to do these kinds of calculations, and nobody who does this for a living would do it like that. It’s odd that someone would.”\nThe other problem is that much of that mining doesn’t happen out in the open — in fact, cryptocurrency miners tend to value their privacy — which means that the energy consumption data necessary to come to any firm conclusions is far from readily available.\nDe Vries could not be reached for comment for this article, but he said in a news release that his work does require some less-than-rigorous math and stressed the need for more research.\n“We’ve seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed,\" said de Vries, who works at the Experience Center of PricewaterhouseCoopers in Amsterdam and founded the blog Digiconomist . \"Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I’m hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research.\" Related Young South Koreans lured by cryptocurrencies struggle with bust after the boom\nChristian Catalini, an assistant professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management who researches cryptocurrencies and block chain technology, also said researchers need data directly from Bitcoin miners.\n“The only people with good data on this are the miners, so you do need that data to understand the electricity consumption,\" Catalini said. “The main challenge is that this gear is scattered across the globe and faces different prices.”\nAnd it’s not as though the servers that the miners use are particularly easy to keep track of, either.\n“The equipment they’re using is customized to their use,” Koomey noted. “This is not the standard servers that are being sold. These are machines that are assembled using other components. That makes it more difficult. It’s a custom design and those kind of servers are not tracked as well.”\nSome experts are also troubled that the de Vries model concludes that the annual energy consumption of Bitcoin miners would exceed that of major data companies like Facebook and Amazon.\n“This debate keeps popping up, but it would be great if someone did some data sharing with the miners and got some good estimates,” Catalini said.\nTo Koomey, Bitcoin enthusiasts and detractors need to be a little more patient and wait for better research to come out — particularly a study based on conclusive data.\n“We should try to get the numbers right, but these things don’t happen super fast,” Koomey said with a laugh. “It takes money to do research and a lot of time.” Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

This time, the currency is trading for roughly $8,100 – a $200 drop since yesterday’s $8,300 mark.\nSince the beginning of the week, bitcoin has repeatedly been hit with price slumps. The Coindesk Consensus Conference – which lasted from Monday to Wednesday – ultimately failed to garner any lasting publicity for the currency, and following a brief spike to $8,800, the currency has incurred a four-day series of $200 to $300 slips.\nThe good news is that bitcoin has slumped to $8,000 several times in the past and always jumped back. Analysts suggest that the coin has developed solid support at this level, and newfound defense against ongoing resistance.\nSenior market analyst for E-Toro Matt Greenspan has examined bitcoin’s long-term trendline. He’s concluded that the currency’s strongest support level is at $7,100, and says that while any level can snap, bitcoin isn’t likely to drop below this position in the immediate future.\nWhile $7,100 isn’t anything to be excited about, it’s still better than where the currency stood last March (we’re sure investors would like to avoid grazing $6,600 again).\nCryptocurrency investor Marius Rupsys is still advising people to stay cautious when deciding on which cryptocurrencies to trade. When discussing bitcoin, he mentioned:\n“There might be some support at $8,000, but any price level can be broken. I would sit on the sidelines to see where the price goes next.”\nInterestingly, the price of Ethereum has jumped significantly over the last 48 hours, and investors are now turning their attention to the bitcoin competitor and the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Why? Because ether is garnering newfound respect in China – a country that outlawed residences from trading cryptocurrencies on exchanges back in September. The country is now ranking the world’s largest cryptocurrencies with its latest index, and Ethereum has landed the number one spot.\nIt’s an unexpected twist – especially considering bitcoin sits at the 13th position. It’s disappointing for the father of cryptocurrency, but impressive for the second-in-command. Many investors see this as a huge sign that China – a country once hostile towards cryptocurrencies – is keeping an open mind regarding changes in the trading market.\nDaniele Bianchi, assistant professor of finance at Warwick Business School says the move is “basically a government-led assessment of blockchain experts which will be based on feedback and reviews from academics, industry operators and governmental agencies.”\nHe added:\n“The reason why this is important is twofold. First, it makes it clear that a massive market like China is openly considering blockchain technology to boost productivity. Second, it relaxes the view that the Chinese government is openly against cryptocurrencies and their use.”\nCEO of cryptocurrency exchange CoinMetro Kevin Murcko claims that China’s position on crypto is adapting, as authorities are realizing the country must be ahead in the digital economy era to qualify as a global superpower.\n“China wants to be the frontrunner in the digital economy era,” he commented. “And as the nation readies for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it sees cryptocurrency and blockchain – a technology with enormous potential to remove pain points and inefficiencies – as an economic game changer.”\nFull details at themerkle.com/bitcoin-price-watch-currency-sinks-to-8100/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matt greenspan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "network crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coindesk consensus conference", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T08:22:15.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b55aa5d7881dafa4178380cb81736d1a23d952ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWYeQ7j8epcUqYumFNcNqp5xK.JgUlw79UPR85JRev6d7VsY8ijE737a", "site_full": "helpscoin.cryptograbber.com", "site": "cryptograbber.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Ferguson will chair fintech body – Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and Fintech Headlines", "title_full": "Ferguson will chair fintech body – Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and Fintech Headlines", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.432, "main_image": "https://i0.wp.com/helpscoin.cryptograbber.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ferguson-will-chair-fintech-body.jpg?fit=600%2C600", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b55aa5d7881dafa4178380cb81736d1a23d952ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWYeQ7j8epcUqYumFNcNqp5xK.JgUlw79UPR85JRev6d7VsY8ijE737a", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ferguson will chair fintech body – Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and Fintech Headlines", "text": "by HELPSCOINADMIN · May 18, 2018\nFINTECH Scotland has appointed David Ferguson, founder and chief executive of Edinburgh-based investment wrap platform pioneer Nucleus, as the … You may also like...

From government crackdowns to new crypto launches, the arena can seem like a swirling vortex of entropy. Bitcoin, the number one digital currency remains the focal point of the industry. Here are four reasons why Nakamoto’s creation is destined for even greater heights in the future. The Simplicity of the Bitcoin Blockchain\nBitcoin was the first successful implementation of the distributed ledger framework via a blockchain. Since its creation, there have been many other iterations of the technology to varying degrees of success. While not taking anything away from robust functioning environments like Ethereum and co, the bitcoin blockchain triumphs in its simplicity. Now, with upgrades like SegWit and the Lightning Network, the efficiency of its blockchain can be improved significantly.\nWhile other blockchains delve into more sophisticated and sometimes confusing applications, the Bitcoin blockchain remains quite simple and basic. This simplicity tends to create a mass appeal, especially with the not-so-tech-savvy. Fintech Revolution\nThe number one crypto is at the heart of the emerging fintech revolution. The tech market has established itself as a change-driver in the broader financial market. Bitcoin is beginning to dominate fintech with recent reports showing that Square Cash app is outstripping Paypal’s Venmo regarding growth. Such has been the impact of bitcoin that Square sold $34 million worth of bitcoin in Q1 of 2018.\nIn Africa, bitcoin is at the heart of fintech growth with many remittance and payment platforms offering bitcoin products. As a result, payments have become significantly easier thus lifting a considerable burden from millions of unbanked and underbanked people. Price Resilience\nBitcoin, much like the larger crypto market is volatile. However, in recent times, bitcoin has shown itself resilient to otherwise profound market events. While other cryptos decline in the high double-digit percentages, bitcoin usually only suffers single-digit declines. A recent example is the Upbit investigation which saw bitcoin show some resilience despite the general crypto price decline. With the market maturing, bitcoin will begin to show even fewer reactions to negative market signals. Bitcoin Price for the Last Three Months Adoption by Mainstream Finance\nBitcoin is not without its naysayers like Warren Buffet and Bill Gates . However, there is a noticeable increase in the level of adoption coming from the mainstream finance arena. Nasdaq recently partnered with Gemini to ensure the fidelity of the exchange platform’s bitcoin trading infrastructure. In 2017 both the CME and CBOE launched bitcoin futures trading.\n2018 has seen an influx of bitcoin products geared at increasing the presence of institutional investors in the market. Coinbase and Goldman Sachs recently unveiled products targeted at institutional investors. There are also reports of OTC bitcoin trading decks that will allow significant bitcoin buy and sell orders without negatively impacting the market.\nDo you agree that bitcoin will become even more valuable in the future? Will it remain the number crypto despite growing competition in the market?

But this could change for good as Ripple ‘s tech eliminates financial friction from these kinds of transactions. In a press release published a couple of days ago, Ripple declared their xRapid service underwent a successful pilot run which saves from forty to seventy percent of the cost for financial institutions, compared with traditional ways. XRP transactions across borders take mere seconds (XRP to fiat currencies take slightly longer). The pilot tested transactions between US and Mexico (one of the biggest remittance markets in the world). It works like this: a US bank sends USD to a gateway which converts it to XRP ; then it’s sent to Mexico where another gateway turns it into Pesos). These transactions took about two minutes instead of the usual 2.5-day average.\nThis shows how digital currencies will play a key role in the near future making things cheaper and quicker for everybody. Ripple has been getting new partnerships with major banks and financial institutions (think Santander ) with a global presence, so more and more big players are adopting Ripple’s tech as a way to do business. A lot of observers think XRP is undervalued right now, as it had a high of $3 per token. But as demand increases, XRP will go up. xRapid MoneyGram, Mercury FX , and IDT are among the most important names in money transfers. They have all adopted both Ripple’s xRapid and Ripple’s XRP currency to do business. Ripple’s xRapid platform allows banks and other financial institutions to minimize costs and improve customer experience. XRP makes things quicker by substituting on-demand liquidity transfer for pre-funded liquidity. xCurrrent XCurrent is another Ripple solution that banks are using for global payments. It allows for an instant settlement that can be tracked end to end.\nDilip Rao, who is global head of infrastructure innovation at Ripple, says , “Central banks around the world are leaning into blockchain technology in recognition of how it can transform cross-border payments, resulting in lower barriers to trade and commerce for both corporates and consumers” XRP is trading at $.67 right now. The price is under the bearish trend line at $.78. This level acts as resistance for Ripple with crucial support at $.72. The MACD on D1 is in the positive territory; however, it is looking like it is ready to enter the negatives. Ripple presents itself as “the world’s only enterprise blockchain solution for global payments.” Other institutions in this industry are following suit. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication also known as SWIFT is the main way in which banks all around the world exchange money. It includes more than 10,000 members in 212 countries. SWIFT’s traditional ways work like this: if an American bank is to send currency to a Mexican bank, then the Mexican bank bus have dollars, and the US bank must have pesos. It’s the same the world over, but not all banks in the world have every currency available. That’s how XRP is useful. It eliminates that factor in the equation, so the transaction is quicker and easier. As institutional banks and governments adopt XRP, costs and transaction times will go down dramatically. While Ripple is much quicker, it still relies on intermediaries to exchange XRP into fiat currencies. The XRP team, on this matter, states , “The portion of the transfer that relies on the XRP Ledger takes two to three seconds, with the additional processing time attributed to movement across the intermediary digital asset exchanges and local payment rails.” This crypto coin is changing the bank game already. In cryptocurrencies, it’s clear that some will do well and some won’t over the course of this year. XRP is among those that will do very well . Consequently, xRapid and xCurrent are just a couple of reasons out of many that back the fact that Ripple (XRP) is here to stay!\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

The country’s Supreme Court has set a date to hear all petitions but has barred all other courts from accepting any new ones.\nAlso read: US State Issues Emergency Cease and Desist Orders to Two Crypto Investment Firms Latest Writ Petition Against RBI Order\nFive petitions have been filed with Indian courts against RBI’s order banning financial institutions under its control from dealing with cryptocurrencies and servicing entities that deal with them including crypto exchanges. RBI has set “a three-month deadline or by July 5 for financial institutions to comply with its notice, putting the cryptocurrency businesses in India in a disarray,” the Economic Times elaborated.\nThe latest writ petition was filed by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), a non-profit industry body representing the interests of online and mobile value-added services industry. It was filed on Tuesday according to IAMAI president, Subho Ray, and the Supreme Court website, Inc42 reported.\nCrypto exchanges that are part of the association include Unocoin, Zebpay , and Coinsecure. They were originally part of another industry body called the Digital and Blockchain Foundation of India which merged with IAMAI, the publication detailed. Four Other Writ Petitions\nThe fourth writ petition was “filed by a group of 11 different representatives from various crypto-related businesses,” the Economic Times conveyed on Monday. One of the petitioners told the news outlet:\nBanking is an essential service. How can one deny access to an essential service when I am not doing anything illegal? You have not declared VCs (virtual currencies) illegal in the country.\nThree more writ petitions were previously filed. One was by Kali Digital Eco-systems and another by Flinstone Technologies Pvt. Ltd, which conducts business under the trade name Money Trade Coin (MTC).\nMoreover, a joint writ petition was filed by four cryptocurrency exchanges in the Supreme Court against the RBI circular on May 8. According to lawyer Mohammed Danish, the four exchanges are Coindelta Exchange run by Bitfair Technologies, Koinex Exchange run by Discidium Internet Labs, Throughbit Exchange run by Throughbit technologies, and Coindcx run by Neblio Technologies. Supreme Court Taking Charge\nFollowing the petition by IAMAI, the Supreme Court on Thursday reportedly refused to stay RBI’s order. “However, it allowed cryptocurrency exchanges, their shareholders, traders and other individuals to present their cases within two weeks to the RBI, which will look into the issue in accordance with the law,” the Financial Express explained.\nAll petitions relating to RBI’s crypto directive will be heard by the Supreme Court; the hearing is set for July 20.

Pink Taxi issued a statement on Twitter acknowledging the confusion. After the jump.\nBitcoin bull John McAfee was accused of promoting a sham initial coin offering by a group called Pink Taxi, which allegedly stole intellectual property from a blockchain-based taxi platform called A2B Taxi Token.\nThe controversy erupted on May 17, after McAfee promoted an ICO for Pink Tax Group Ltd. U.K. on Twitter.\n“I am advising and supporting the Pink Taxi ICO – created in response to the massive increase in sexual assaults on women, especially in Muslim countries,” McAfee tweeted. “They currently operate in 50 cities, hiring only women drivers trained to support women’s safety.” I am advising and supporting the pink Taxi ICO – https://t.co/bH2by8US6l – created in response to the massive increase in sexual assaults on women, especially in Muslim countries. They currently operate in 50 cities, hiring only women drivers trained to support womens' safety. pic.twitter.com/Gs7mnpOs99\n— John McAfee (@officialmcafee) May 17, 2018\nIn response to a user question asking how much he charged to promote that ICO, McAfee boasted, “My tweets are now $500,000 per tweet. If clients want me to reply to comments, then it is $100,000 per reply.” My tweets are now $500,000 per tweet. If clients want me to reply to comments, then it is $100,000 per reply. But what is your point? Obviously, people feel that it is worth it. Statistically, each tweet averages over $3 million in revenue for my clients – a 600% return.\n— John McAfee (@officialmcafee) May 18, 2018\nLess than 40 minutes after McAfee sent his tweet, A2B Taxi Token launched an epic salvo, claiming Pink Taxi had copied its “website design, content and its whitepaper” to promote its initial coin offering.\n“Dear A2B Taxi community, someone took the advantage of our work and now they are being promoted by the top influencer,” the Lithuania-based company tweeted. “Pink Taxi copied our website design and content. Even our whitepaper.” Dear A2B Taxi community, someone took the advantage of our work and now they are being promoted by the top influencer. https://t.co/5Vx4iKfaF1 copied our website design and content. Even our whitepaper. Please help us raise awareness to this matter by sharing this post. https://t.co/ibQiQtUWGc\n— A2B Taxi Token (@a2btaxitoken) May 17, 2018\nIn an email to CCN, a rep from A2B Taxi Token accused Pink Taxi of being “scammers,” and slammed John McAfee for not doing proper due diligence on the projects he promotes.\n“It is a pity that top influencers do not have a system to [conduct] due diligence before promoting projects and publish misleading information for investors,” A2B Taxi told CCN. Marketing Materials Look Identical\nA2B then attached a dizzying array of screenshots showing that Pink Taxi’s marketing materials are nearly identical to those found on the A2B Taxi Token website.\nBlockchain expert Vytautas Kašėta, an executive with A2B Taxi, told CCN that Pink Taxi used his video to promote their ICO “on their scam site without permission.”\nPink Taxi posted the video in question on YouTube on May 14. It featured Vytautas Kaseta, touting him as an unnamed “blockchain expert.” Pink Taxi later took the video down amid a barrage of complaints from A2B Taxi.\nThe YouTube video posed on May 14 by Pink Taxi is identical to that of A2B Taxi, which posted its video two months earlier, in February 2018.\nSet featured image\nWhen contacted for comment, Pink Taxi told CCN it will email a response. John McAfee has not replied to CCN’s request for comment, but was defiant when contacted by A2B executive ‏Tomas Stasiulevicius, who asked why he was promoting the ICO of a group that stole someone else’s work.\n“What work??? I am unaware of a single city in which you are operating taxis,” McAfee replied on Twitter. “You are a scammer, my friend. I strongly suggest you drop this, unless you would like my FULL attention?” What work??? I am unaware of a single city in which you are operating taxis. Your Twitter account only has produced 4 tweets, half of them to me. You are a scammer my friend. I strongly suggest you drop this, unless you would like my FULL attention?\n— John McAfee (@officialmcafee) May 17, 2018\nWhile this latest ICO controversy will undoubtedly work itself out in time, it spotlights the epidemic of fraud and scams in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\nMost crypto investment promoters are frauds , according a report compiled by the Texas State Securities Board. Texas leads the United States in cryptcurrency crackdowns. Report: 81% Of ICOs Are Scams\nAccording to ICO advisory company the Satis Group, a staggering 81 percent of ICOs launched since early-2017 have been found to be scams. Given these sobering statistics, attorneys say that anyone promoting an ICO could be held responsible for bilking investors out of their money.\nAs CCN previously reported, former SEC attorneys have warned celebrities who endorse initial coin offerings that they could be sued for promoting sham ICOs. Like prospective investors, celebrities are being advised to do their own due diligence before shilling a crypto product.\n“We are going to see lots of litigation surrounding the promoters of these ICOs,” said attorney David Silver, who’s overseeing a dozen cryptocurrency-related class action lawsuits.\nUpdate: On May 18, McAfee tweeted the apology from Pink Taxi. “They have re-written their white paper and are taking action against the agency responsible,” he said. An apology from Pink Taxi. They have re-written their white paper and are taking action against the agency responsible. https://t.co/EmPv9Gx0ET pic.twitter.com/odJ8wGZiNn\nFeatured image from Flickr/ Gage Skidmore .

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

As noted in our last discussion, a break back into the TR would be considered a period of evaluation and an inability to maintain support within the TR would likely lead to a continuation of the downtrend:\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, Downtrend Continuation\nAfter establishing the Major Sign of Weakness (SOW), the market made a feeble rally and ultimately formed a Last Point of Supply (LPSY) at the bottom of the TR. The LPSY is the point where supply begins to overwhelm the market and long positions begin to close as the demand dries up. Shortly after the rejection of the TR, the market established a new low. However, this low was pushed on fairly low volume. The price action and volume are shaping out a reversal pattern called a Falling Wedge (FW):\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, Falling Wedge\nIf the price manages to break out of this FW it will have a modest $ 1,000 move upward. The measured move would have us retesting the lower $ 9,000s once again. However, if we fail to gain enough momentum upward, we would likely test the macro 61% Fibonacci retracement values:\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 3-Day Candles, Macro Fib Retracements\nFigure 4: BTC-USD, 4-Hour Candles, Macro 61% Closer View\nIf we manage to test the 61%, this will again be a zone of evaluation as we wait to see how the market reacts to such strong, macro support. Summary: After a short-lived rally, bitcoin established a LPSY in the $ 8,800s before continuing to make new lows. Currently, the market is pushing new lows but on diminishing volume. The current price action is forming a Falling Wedge which, if it breaks upwards, would have a price target in the low $ 9,000s.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

Bitcoin, the most popular of the bunch, dropped 3.7 percent this week to $8,117.43 even as Arthur Hayes -- the crypto exchange executive whose firm rented the Lamborghinis -- predicted a surge to $50,000 by year-end.\n“While there was not a Consensus bump, our conviction on cryptocurrencies strengthened during the conference,” Lee wrote in a note Friday. He cited over exuberance about the prospects for rising institutional demand and lingering concerns about the regulatory framework for depressing prices.\nThis week’s slump is far from extreme by crypto standards, but the market’s resistance to Blockchain Week’s ballyhoo highlights one of the arguments often used by virtual currency pessimists -- that most people who are willing to buy the coins have already piled in.\nWhile bulls point to a vast pool of pent-up demand from professional money managers, it’s far from clear that regulations in the U.S. and elsewhere will evolve in ways that attract institutional investors.

Its government has asked legislators commission a study on the pros and cons of a Swiss “e-franc.”\nAlso read: Alec Baldwin’s Lambo Movie Backed by Crypto Tech Switzerland Considers State Backed E-Franc\nSwitzerland’s Federal Council explained why it was asking for a formal study of state backed cryptocurrency. “The Federal Council is aware of the major challenges, both legal and monetary, which would be accompanied by the use of an e-franc. It asks that the proposal be adopted to examine the risks and opportunities of an e-franc and to clarify the legal, economic and financial aspects of the e-franc.” Andréa Maechler\nThat appears to be quite a turnaround for the Swiss. As little as just over a month ago, its central bank was making statements about crypto’s inherent instability. “Digital central bank money for the general public is not necessary to ensure an efficient system for cashless retail payments. It would deliver scarcely any advantages, but would give rise to incalculable risks with regard to financial stability,” warned Andréa Maechler of the country’s national bank.\nNevertheless, the next step in the process involves parliament’s lower house. It will ultimately decide whether the request moves forward. Most countries considering the idea openly have sought state backed crypto as a means to run afoul of economic sanctions or as a way to deaden domestic enthusiasm for a currency beyond government control. Sanctions are not an issue for Switzerland, and the government has been rather open to the crypto revolution, comparatively. Not the First, Not the Last\nVenezuela is the most recent and notorious example of state backed crypto, and the only country to have implemented the idea. It launched the petro as a clear poke at US policy made against its present administration. The Maduro government used an ERC-20 token platform to launch the state backed crypto, which Mr. Maduro insists will be ultimately backed by barrels of oil. In addition, the government has announced special initiatives and incentives to encourage Venezuelans to adopt its usage. In the tightly controlled media of the country, figures and facts on the ground are hard to substantiate in terms of petro’s success. For its part, the Trump administration was unnerved enough to issue an Executive Order formally forbidding US citizens from holding the petro. Cédric Wermuth\nRegionally closer, Sweden has taken similar steps to that of Switzerland. Riksbank seems to be in an overt process of encouraging a completely cashless society, and Swedes appear eager to follow. A natural evolution of that idea, and to keep its citizens under the careful eye of government minders, a state backed crypto might just be the answer. Again, a Swiss crypto is by no means a foregone conclusion. Though influential politicians like Cédric Wermuth, Social Democratic Party vice president, have encouraged the study, the idea faces legislative obstacles. As Reuters notes, “In Switzerland, if the proposal is approved, a study will be produced by the Swiss finance ministry. No timing has been given on when it would be published should the go-ahead be given.”\nWhat do you think about state backed cryptocurrencies?

Bitcoin price lost almost $1,800 in the last two weeks.\nSeveral other industry experts are also refuting bitcoin’s potential to work as an alternate currency. They believe the higher level of volatility makes it difficult for the general public to use it as the medium of exchange. Source Image: coinmarketcap.com\nBitcoin price crashed to the $8,000 level today. The New York consensus summit also failed to fuel any rally for the largest coin. PayPal Rejects Bitcoin for Merchants Use\nPayPal CFO John Rainey has rejected bitcoin’s potential to work as the medium of exchange, particularly for merchants that have low margins on their trades. Source Image: twitter.com\nRainey claims that merchants usually have a 10%-15% margin on their products. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has the potential to create price movements of 10%-15% in few hours alone – this makes it difficult for merchants to accept BTC as the tool of payment.\nTalking about the possibility of accepting Bitcoin in future, the CFO said , “ You could have something that appeals to consumers, but if merchants don’t accept it, it’s of little value. Right now, we don’t see a lot of interest from our merchants. But if it’s something that stabilizes in the future and is a better currency, then we’ll certainly support that .” Source Image: twitter.com Market Reaction\nThe market has been apparently supporting Rainey’s stance. The price volatility in cryptocurrency markets is higher than any other asset or currency. Some market participants expect increasing regulators role could help in reducing the price volatility in the long-run. Source Image: twitter.com\nOthers reacted strongly to PayPal’s CFO’s comments. They believe the threat of cryptocurrencies on banks and payment service companies has been forcing them to reject digital currencies as the medium of exchange.\nFeatured Image: Depositphotos/© zephyr18 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john rainey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john rainey rejects bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill gates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rainey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paypal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-19T01:00:37.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "834060d0263ba03149c0a82b3b44f64d723b4107", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTCUy4kRyMWacT_xCYDd0LAqlvA_sNQn3EJJ2EFSVU0XG_itUwyHYLVMheJ.d3x.RMP2hJP6d9hbbX26r2cdhGZyVtDfMPRgbcWMXNIsJPlUsaqNcJnimQ", "site_full": "www.prosyscom.tech", "site": "prosyscom.tech", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Hits One Month Low As $10K Sell Off Resumes- Prosyscom", "title_full": "Bitcoin Hits One Month Low As $10K Sell Off Resumes- Prosyscom", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.prosyscom.tech/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin-Hits-One-Month-Low-As-10K-Sell-Off-Resumes-Prosyscom.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "834060d0263ba03149c0a82b3b44f64d723b4107", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTCUy4kRyMWacT_xCYDd0LAqlvA_sNQn3EJJ2EFSVU0XG_itUwyHYLVMheJ.d3x.RMP2hJP6d9hbbX26r2cdhGZyVtDfMPRgbcWMXNIsJPlUsaqNcJnimQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Prosyscom Technews", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Hits One Month Low As $10K Sell Off Resumes- Prosyscom", "text": "0 Share\nBitcoin’s (BTC) drop to one-month lows below $8,000 has strengthened the bear grip on the markets, the technical charts indicate.\nThe cryptocurrency fell to $7,925 on Bitfinex earlier today – the lowest level since April 18 and has retraced 50 percent of the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 to May 5 high of $9,990.\nAs of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,120, representing a 2 percent drop in the last 24 hours. The recovery from the low of $7,925 could be associated with the oversold conditions shown by the relative strength index (RSI) in the hourly chart.\nHowever, the gains will likely be short-lived as the odds are stacked against the bulls, according to technical charts. Daily chart\nBTC closed well below the 50-day moving average (MA) yesterday, signaling a continuation of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990. Further, BTC has also found acceptance below $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement), a level which acted as a strong support since May 12.\nThe 5-day moving average (MA) and the 10-day MA continues to slope downwards in favor of the bears. The relative strength index (RSI) is also biased bearish (below 50.00 and falling).\nAnd last but not the least, BTC’s turn lower from $8,884 (May 14 high) and drop below $8,100 yesterday have established a lower highs and lows pattern (bearish setup).\nSo, it is quite clear that the drop to one-month lows in the last 24 hours has the put bears in the driver’s seat. View\nBTC looks set to test the immediate support lined up at $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement). A daily close (as per UTC) below that level would be the final confirmation of bearish trend reversal and will likely be followed by a sell-off $7,000.\nOnly a daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA (currently seen at $8,555) would abort the bearish view and could yield sideways to positive action.\nBitcoin image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Concept71", "text": "Bitcoin Mining To Use 0.5% Of World’s Energy By End Of 2018, Peer-Reviewed Research Shows May 18, 2018 1 Views Saved Saved Removed 0 Economist Alex de Vries, who published an article on “Bitcoin’s Growing Energy Problem,” yesterday, May 16, in scientific journal Joule , told the Independent that Bitcoin (BTC) mining will use 0.5 percent of the world’s energy by 2018.\nDe Vries concludes that as the BTC network currently consumes about 2.55 GW of electricity and moves towards consuming 7.67 GW in the future (for reference, Ireland consumes 3.1 GW and Austria 8.2 GW), the network “has a big problem, and it is growing fast.” However, he does note that solutions like the Lightning Network “may alleviate the situation.” Bitcoin mining requires energy for performing the calculations – hashes – that give miners Bitcoin rewards. In mid-February, it was reported that crypto mining in the country of Iceland would consume more energy than households in 2018. The debate over whether Bitcoin mining is overly harmful for the environment is seen by some as a non-issue, due to the real need for Bitcoin in underbanked countries.\nDe Vries told the Independent, however, that “half a percent is already quite shocking:”\n“It’s an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals.” The scientific study goes into detail about the different types of Bitcoin miners and their individual energy usage, noting that “trying to measure the electricity consumed by the Bitcoin mining machines producing all those hash calculations remains a challenge to date.” De Vries uses Bitmain’s Antminers as his main example to show how much energy each machine uses in its lifetime. As De Vries’s study is the first time data on Bitcoin energy consumption has been peer-reviewed, he hopes his paper will “get the conversation started,” as he believes that the world needs “more scientific discussion on where this network is headed” as opposed to “back-of-the-envelope calculations,” he told the Independent.\nConversely, the technology behind Bitcoin, blockchain , is being used to alleviate environmental impact in some cases. This week, IBM announced a partnership with Veridium Labs with the aim of tokenizing carbon credits to allow companies to better track their carbon footprint through blockchain, potentially allowing them to reduce their carbon impact.\nThis news post is collected from Cointelegraph Recommended Read ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "world", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lightning network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "views saved saved removed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iceland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T14:46:45.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ac0b0da48dd4f3182a889470441dd5c4cf98a01f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS8rfYqTjRJAB9MTR.T7FRRs-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ac0b0da48dd4f3182a889470441dd5c4cf98a01f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS8rfYqTjRJAB9MTR.T7FRRs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin Cash!: Get Bitcoins Fast!", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\n Become a part of a huge mining pool!

Koomey told NBC News :\nFor two decades, people have been eager to overestimate electricity use by computing. My concern is that we simply don’t have adequate data to come to the strong conclusions that he’s coming to.\nDe Vries’ conclusions in question estimate that the Bitcoin network consumes “at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future.” Furthermore, the researcher claims:\nEconomic models tell us that Bitcoin’s electricity consumption will gravitate toward the latter number. A look at Bitcoin miner production estimates suggests that this number could already be reached in 2018.\nHowever, according to experts such as Koomey, de Vries’ and others’ underlying assumptions are problematic — particularly in regards to the manner in which they calculate the value of energy and the price paid for said energy. Explained Koomey:\nThe worry is that those are two numbers that are picked out of the air. There may be some basis for them, but it’s a very unreliable way to do these kinds of calculations, and nobody who does this for a living would do it like that. It’s odd that someone would.\nBitcoin mining is a notoriously private enterprise , with a lot of current and future mining operations taking place in remote areas. As such, it’s not exactly cut and dry how much miners pay for energy, especially considering many operations are set up specifically to reduce said costs — such as mining in caves, energy-rich areas, or low-cost countries.\nDe Vries research also neglects to consider how miners often use special mining equipment crafted specifically to maximize efficiency. Christian Catalini, an assistant professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management who researches cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology , told NBC News:\nThe only people with good data on this are the miners, so you do need that data to understand the electricity consumption. The main challenge is that this gear is scattered across the globe and faces different prices.\nKoomey added:\nThe equipment they’re using is customized to their use. This is not the standard servers that are being sold. These are machines that are assembled using other components. That makes it more difficult. It’s a custom design and those kind of servers are not tracked as well.\nWe should try to get the numbers right […]\nSo, what are the correct numbers? According to Jan Čapek, CEO and co-founder of Braiins Systems and operator of massive Bitcoin mining pool Slush Pool, his company uses a lot less energy than critics imply — and turns a pretty penny in the process.\nNotes Čapek, the total cost, at current difficulty, to mine one bitcoin comes to less than $1937 using recent HW @ 5c/kWh, which is far less energy consumed than most naysayers would like you to believe. Let's have some numbers for todays panel in NYC. I have updated the \"1 BTC mining cost estimates and total network power gists\" with current difficulty. It comes to less than USD 1937 for 1 BTC using some recent HW @ 5c/kWh https://t.co/ykBj4wNPgq\n— Jan Čapek (@janbraiins) May 18, 2018\nIt’s worth noting that even de Vries himself admits the flaws in his research’s design. The researcher stated:\nWe’ve seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I’m hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research.\nDo you think the energy costs associated with global Bitcoin mining are overblown?

As noted in our last discussion, a break back into the TR would be considered a period of evaluation and an inability to maintain support within the TR would likely lead to a continuation of the downtrend:\nFigure 1: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, Downtrend Continuation\nAfter establishing the Major Sign of Weakness (SOW), the market made a feeble rally and ultimately formed a Last Point of Supply (LPSY) at the bottom of the TR. The LPSY is the point where supply begins to overwhelm the market and long positions begin to close as the demand dries up. Shortly after the rejection of the TR, the market established a new low. However, this low was pushed on fairly low volume. The price action and volume are shaping out a reversal pattern called a Falling Wedge (FW):\nFigure 2: BTC-USD, 2-Hour Candles, Falling Wedge\nIf the price manages to break out of this FW it will have a modest $1,000 move upward. The measured move would have us retesting the lower $9,000s once again. However, if we fail to gain enough momentum upward, we would likely test the macro 61% Fibonacci retracement values:\nFigure 3: BTC-USD, 3-Day Candles, Macro Fib Retracements\nFigure 4: BTC-USD, 4-Hour Candles, Macro 61% Closer View\nIf we manage to test the 61%, this will again be a zone of evaluation as we wait to see how the market reacts to such strong, macro support. Summary: After a short-lived rally, bitcoin established a LPSY in the $8,800s before continuing to make new lows. Currently, the market is pushing new lows but on diminishing volume. The current price action is forming a Falling Wedge which, if it breaks upwards, would have a price target in the low $9,000s.\nTrading and investing in digital assets like bitcoin and ether is highly speculative and comes with many risks.

U.K. on Twitter.\n“I am advising and supporting the Pink Taxi ICO – created in response to the massive increase in sexual assaults on women, especially in Muslim countries,” McAfee tweeted. “They currently operate in 50 cities, hiring only women drivers trained to support women’s safety.” I am advising and supporting the pink Taxi ICO – https://t.co/bH2by8US6l – created in response to the massive increase in sexual assaults on women, especially in Muslim countries.

Marketing Materials Look Identical\nA2B then attached a dizzying array of screenshots showing that Pink Taxi’s marketing materials are nearly identical to those found on the A2B Taxi Token website.\nBlockchain expert Vytautas Kašėta, an executive with A2B Taxi, told CCN that Pink Taxi used his video to promote their ICO “on their scam site without permission.”\nPink Taxi posted the video in question on YouTube on May 14. It featured Vytautas Kaseta, touting him as an unnamed “blockchain expert.” Pink Taxi later took the video down amid a barrage of complaints from A2B Taxi.\nThe YouTube video posed on May 14 by Pink Taxi is identical to that of A2B Taxi, which posted its video two months earlier, in February 2018.\nSet featured image\nWhen contacted for comment, Pink Taxi told CCN it will email a response. John McAfee has not replied to CCN’s request for comment, but was defiant when contacted by A2B executive ‏Tomas Stasiulevicius, who asked why he was promoting the ICO of a group that stole someone else’s work.\n“What work??? I am unaware of a single city in which you are operating taxis,” McAfee replied on Twitter. “You are a scammer, my friend. I strongly suggest you drop this, unless you would like my FULL attention?” What work??? I am unaware of a single city in which you are operating taxis.

I strongly suggest you drop this, unless you would like my FULL attention?\n— John McAfee (@officialmcafee) May 17, 2018\nWhile this latest ICO controversy will undoubtedly work itself out in time, it spotlights the epidemic of fraud and scams in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\nMost crypto investment promoters are frauds , according a report compiled by the Texas State Securities Board. Texas leads the United States in cryptcurrency crackdowns. Report: 81% Of ICOs Are Scams\nAccording to ICO advisory company the Satis Group, a staggering 81 percent of ICOs launched since early-2017 have been found to be scams. Given these sobering statistics, attorneys say that anyone promoting an ICO could be held responsible for bilking investors out of their money.\nAs CCN previously reported, former SEC attorneys have warned celebrities who endorse initial coin offerings that they could be sued for promoting sham ICOs. Like prospective investors, celebrities are being advised to do their own due diligence before shilling a crypto product.\n“We are going to see lots of litigation surrounding the promoters of these ICOs,” said attorney David Silver, who’s overseeing a dozen cryptocurrency-related class action lawsuits.\nFeatured image from Flickr/ Gage Skidmore .

The businessmen were promised 150% returns in lieu of their investment.\nBhardwaj, a resident of Shalimar Bagh, was arrested by Pune Police from IGI airport in April. He is estimated to having duped over 8,000 people of around Rs 2,000 crore. His name had earlier cropped up in the investigation conducted by Cyber Cell when they had busted a cryptocurrency gang run by two men, Kamal Singh and Vijay Kumar, who had duped around 2,500 people.\nIn a fresh complaint, a victim, who has an export firm at Barakhamba Road, said that Bhardwaj introduced himself as a trader who dealt in gold, diamonds and Bitcoin with expertise in getting good returns on investments. The victim then introduced his father and brother to him.\n“To win my confidence, Bhardwaj introduced me to one Rajesh, who he claimed had collaborated with him to acquire a gold mine in Guinea, Latin America. He also showed some papers in this regard. After a few meetings, he offered to transfer shares held by them in the mine,” the victim said.\nThe crooks also produced a forged share-purchase agreement. When the victim showed interest, the accused gave him a “better” offer. Claiming to be experts in Bitcoin mining, the crooks told the victim to invest in it. The victim had no knowledge about cryptocurrency and sought more information. He was told that the virtual currency gave 100-150% returns on investments.\nThe victim was made to speak to several “clients”, who supposedly got substantial returns. “It later came to the fore that these people were members of the Bhardwaj gang,” an officer said.\nWhen the victim got suspicious, the accused began avoiding his calls and meeting him. The victim then approached police. A case has been filed and cops will seek Bhardwaj’s custody for arresting him in cases pertaining to Delhi.\nBhardwaj ran firms and websites in the name of Variable PTE limited, GB Miners and gainbitcoin.com.

This is amplified by a frankly poor market state, a state which seems to be dragging cryptocurrencies down into figures not seen for well over a month now. The decline which started last weekend, has continued through the week and now looks to be setting us up for a second weekend of market declines.\nWe should use this as an opportunity however, to look at what could happen in the wake of this.\nOn Tuesday the 6 th of February, Bitcoin hit a low of $6,249.11, however, just two weeks later on the 20 th of February, Bitcoin moved up to $11,860.40.\nThese movements within Bitcoin do seem to be quite common, whenever Bitcoin accelerates downwards it is often met with a huge upwards surge. Granted, historically these surges have corrected but what this does encourage, is Bitcoin to make some sort of recovery meaning the losses we see today, could essentially be halved in a couple of weeks.\nAgain, on the 12 th of April, Bitcoin hit $6,878.56, before moving up to $9,735.01, two weeks later.\nWhat can we deduce from this?\nNow of course, this is speculation based, but as it goes this does seem to provide evidence that Bitcoin is resilient enough to bounce back, even from declines on the scale of we see at the moment. It’s not guaranteed that Bitcoin will hit $10,000.00 soon, however the stats do seem to point towards Bitcoin at least taking a big jump up soon enough.\nOverall, we know that eventually, Bitcoin will surpass $10,000.00, experts do even see Bitcoin hitting $20,000.00 soon enough. Perhaps the current climate is suggesting that soon enough, we will see the price of Bitcoin jump back up and reach healthy new heights.

May 18, 2018\nNot only did Consensus 2018 fail to generate a market pump, but by the end of the three-day session, the crypto sphere was dipping again. Crypto Market Falls After Consensus\nThe Consensus event took place in New York from May 14 -16, which saw thousands of attendees from industry startups, investors, financial institutions, enterprise tech leaders, and academic and policy groups flocking to the conference.\nThe idea that Consensus 2018 would create a rally for Bitcoin and by proxy the entire cryptocurrency market was peddled in the financial news by pundits like Tom Lee of Fundstrat, who said during the build-up to the event:\n“Bottom line: We expect BTC and cryptocurrencies to behave similarly to prior years and rally during Consensus.”\nThis ‘consensus pump’ failed to materialize as Bitcoin fell 3.25% to $8,255.2 according to CoinMarketCap and remains close to session lows of $8,054.00 at the time of writing. Considering that Consensus 2017 created a spike that may be considered the start of the bull run that took Bitcoin to nearly $20,000 mid-December, the question many may be wondering is what happened this year? Why Consensus Failed to Create Pump\nThe problems may have started when the tickets were priced from $999 dollars for students to $2,499 for an enterprise (per attendee) and could not be purchased with cryptocurrency.\nYahoo Finance reported that ‘the topic of regulation was hotly debated at the conference but it lacked fresh perspective drawing a muted a reaction from cryptos.’ From media reports, this seems to be the general consensus while comments on Reddit fleshed out the problems further.\nPoster U/korgijoe started a thread entitled “ Consensus 2018: It sucked. Here’s why ” in which he broke down the problems with the conference in three parts: “Talks were superficial, and they didn’t seem to know who their audience was. Sorry folks, normies are gone. Speak to your core enthusiasts. The whole presentation vibe was, let’s bend over backward for bankers and discuss how we’re going to do it. I get that it’s in NYC, but come on. If the suits are here, let’s discuss using their money to lobby Congress in favor of crypto instead of shorting the market. Presenters rehashed cliche after cliche, “muh 90% of ICOs will fail.” Instead of delving into the fundamental problems facing crypto real-world usage by the average Joe, scalability, centralization).”\nThis illicited reponses from other attendees and crypto enthusiasts who were almost unanimous in agreeemnet that the conference was disorganzed and ill-informed. The drop in crypto market cap below $4oo billion reflects the lack of enthusiasim consensus 2018 generated or as U/korgijoe wrote:\n“It was embarrassing for crypto.

The news caused Trueusd (TUSD) to rise by an unprecedented 40% before eventually subsiding. Trust Token, the coin’s developers, have now explained to news.Bitcoin.com how this sequence of events came to be.\nAlso read: “Stablecoin” Trueusd Pumps After Binance Listing Trueusd and the Moon Mission That Wasn’t Meant to Be\nAs reported on Thursday, TUSD pumped to $1.39 off the back of news that Binance would be listing the supposed stablecoin. Binance has since postponed its listing of the token, pushing the event back by a few days “to prepare for sufficient liquidity”. Trust Token, for its part, has responded to the incident in a blogpost, writing:\nTrueUSD saw a large, sudden increase in demand after Binance first announced that they are listing TUSD. We believe that bots (and some misinformed traders) purchased TrueUSD as soon as the announcement was made.\nThe post continues: “Generally, our policy is that “redeemability leads to stability.” The value of a TrueUSD token is that it can be redeemed for one US dollar. There will only be as many tokens in circulation as there are dollars in the escrow account to collateralize the tokens. In the long run, this feature precedes price stability, since the price will return to $1.00 (as it did today) as long as the token continues to be redeemable.” Trust Is Earned\nAs a piece of parting advice, Trust Token advises traders not to pay any more than $1.05 per token, otherwise “you may lose money.” Trust Token’s co-founder and CTO Rafael Cosman spoke to news.Bitcoin.com to clarify some of the issues raised in the blog post, and pointed out that when TUSD was listed on Bittrex in March, traders were issued with the same advice – not to pay more than $1.05 per token.\nAssuaging concerns that TUSD could dip discernibly below $1, Rafael Cosman said:\nPrice stability is maintained by market-making incentives. Today, market-makers buy TrueUSD for $1.00 directly from the bank, anticipating that if the price hits even $1.01 they can arbitrage some profit. The opportunity for redemption incentivizes market-makers to keep at $1.00 and not below: if the price was to dip to $0.99, then market-makers could buy it and redeem it for $1.00. Market-makers would quickly scoop in and buy all the “sell” orders for below $1.00 until none were left and the price returned to $1.00. Bot or Not?\nFollowing up on claims that bots were to blame for TUSD’s sudden price spike this week, Rafael Cosman added: “It’s fairly common knowledge in the crypto industry that there are bots that “listen” for announcements of coins listing on exchanges and buy any coin as soon as it is listed on a new exchange. This is usually profitable, since more buyers for a token can mean a higher price. However, in the case of Trueusd, any person who knows that the token is redeemable for $1.00 knows they will lose money if they buy it for more, and so market-makers holding Trueusd happily sold it to bots for above $1.00 until there was no more demand.”\nStablecoins are still highly experimental at this stage, and while some “stable bears” believe perfect dollar parity will never be reached, others are confident that anomalies such as that which befell TUSD will be ironed out in time.

The state CID (crime), which is probing the case, had moved court after Kotadiya didn’t appear despite repeated summons and attempts to trace him. Earlier, the CID officials had twice issued summons under section 160 of the Code of Criminal Procedure but the former MLA from Dhari in Amreli district didn’t respond. On May 7, Kotadiya had faxed his reply, stating that he would appear on May 12 but he failed to do so. Kotadiya is alleged to have been involved in the crime for which he allegedly received money from the other accused.\nKotadiya has been accused of being one of conspirators behind the kidnapping and extortion in February in Gandhinagar. A team of policemen from Amreli, led by police inspector Anant Patel, abducted Surat builder Shailesh Bhatt, his friend Kirit Paladiya and Bhatt’s driver in Gandhinagar and kept them in illegal confinement. Later, probe revealed that it was all planned by Kirit Paladiya with the help of policemen, including Amerli SP Jagdish Patel, who has also been arrested.\nPaladiya had kept 119 Bitcoins worth nearly Rs 9 crore in his digital wallet which actually belonged to Bhatt since the former knows how to trade in cryptocurrency. On the day of abduction, Paladiya portrayed as if the Bitcoins have been transferred to accused policemen.

The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.

So if you buy today, no, you cannot do anything with it for 7 days, but you are locked in at today's price (at the time you made the transaction). In 7 days, you can sell it or move it to another exchange. In 7 days it might have gone up or down, who knows. Lots of waiting.If you are planning on moving it to another exchange for alt coins, you need to start getting those lined up now too, because some of those take several days.If you plan to move it to another exchange, sign up for GDAX (free sister site of CB), transfer your BTC to GDAX (free), buy LTC with it instead, then send the LTC to the other exchange. Fees will be noticeably smaller and the transfer time is much faster. When you get the LTC to the other exchange, sell it for BTC to buy the alts.Yeah, it's a serious pain to get started.

Figuring out how to purchase it has been frustrating to say the least. To be honest, it all seems like a pyramid scheme built around everyone skimming fees off of every little transaction or transfer.\nCurrently, I've deposited money onto coinbase with the intentions of depositing it onto gdax to avoid the fees (everywhere else seems to be 1-3% where as take orders on gdax are fee free). Everything on their websites said the transfers were \"free and instant\" but that's anything but the truth. It took 2 days for my funds to show on coinbase (Tuesday) and now I'm being told my funds can't be transferred until Thursday the 24th. Free and \"instant\" has turned into a 9 business day wait. Support just keeps telling me that I basically screwed up by depositing into coinbase first and I should have just done it to gdax. The gdax interface specifically states that it'll take 3-5 business days minimum and could possibly take 7-12 so I don't see where they are getting that it would have been instant.\nSo simply put, is there a way to purchase bitcoin without huge fees and having to wait days/weeks to actually buy btc?\n submitted by /u/blorgensplor\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T21:54:09.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dab2c6c4f5a1f5b53cf86efb0423651b0f7fa350", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSeLeeG3OnwAksOFgO8fYaTN.frgZZEzjvX_aN0L17SwseSNHeqP5Yfl3OaOvdO8xkyKtY9zRqW.ZHWWGiHr5LyYJAdavVNTQ-", "site_full": "newsletterdepot.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newsletterdepot.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Newsletter Depot", "title": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-18T02:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dab2c6c4f5a1f5b53cf86efb0423651b0f7fa350", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSeLeeG3OnwAksOFgO8fYaTN.frgZZEzjvX_aN0L17SwseSNHeqP5Yfl3OaOvdO8xkyKtY9zRqW.ZHWWGiHr5LyYJAdavVNTQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "llgeek89 (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-18T02:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin Laufende Aktualisierung ⋅ 17.

Jenny Cheng/Business Insider Forget bitcoin and ethereum, there's a new cryptocurrency in town: zcash. The Winklevoss twin's cryptocurrency exchange Gemini announced on Monday that it would start trading zcash on May 22. This sent the price spiking up more than 40%. Here's everything you need to know about zcash.\nJenny Cheng/Business Insider In the world of cryptocurrencies, it can often feel like there is an innumerable amount of coins to invest in. So when major players in the space double down on one coin in particular, it's worth taking notice.\nOn Tuesday, the Winklevoss twin's bitcoin exchange Gemini announced the addition of trading and custody for a coin called zcash , starting May 22. The price of zcash quickly shot up more than 40% on the news, from around $250 a coin to over $360.\nThe US-based Gemini is small compared to other cryptocurrency exchanges, but it is also fairly selective. The exchange presently only lets users trade the two most popular cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and ethereum, so the addition of a new coin is a sign that it sees a future for zcash.\nZcash is a lot like bitcoin in that it lives on blockchain technology and is designed to be used as digital money. But it has one key thing that bitcoin doesn't: privacy.\nGemini's VP of engineering Eric Winer called it \"a truly innovative privacy coin that offers confidentiality for peer-to-peer transactions similar to those afforded\" by normal money.\nThis is because unlike bitcoin, which keeps a permanent record of every single transaction in meticulous detail, zcash lets users choose when to hide their identity or the amount of currency being moved around.\nHere's what you need to know about zcash: Zcash is run by a venture-backed startup, but it's open source\nZcash (ZEC) is a decentralized cryptocurrency designed and maintained by the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company, or Zcash Company, a venture-backed startup founded by Zooko Wilcox (that's his real name, though the Z in Zcash apparently stands for zero, not Zooko). Advertisement\nZcash Company built the platform and pays a team of engineers to maintain it, while the Foundation supports education and community efforts, like grants to grow the space. Down the line, the Foundation will take on a more active role, the company said.\nBecause zcash is open source, anyone with the technical know-how can make changes to the code and create what's known in the space as a \"hard fork\" — an update which splits the cryptocurrency into two different coins. But at the moment, it is Zcash Company which issues official updates to the network.\nToday, there are around 3.9 million zcash coins in the world. Like bitcoin, zcash transactions are processed by miners who volunteer their computer power in exchange for newly generated coins.\nBut unlike on bitcoin, when a miner mines zcash, some of the newly generated coins go to the Zcash Company and Foundation. The company treats these coins as revenue, and use them to pay its engineers and leadership team, as well as investors. Zcash is like bitcoin but transactions can be made privately\nThe price of zcash spiked on May 14 when Gemini announced its support for the coin. CoinMarketCap Zcash is designed to be more practical than other cryptocurrencies.\n\"It's similar to bitcoin in most respects,\" said Jack Gavigan, chief operating officer at Zcash Company. \"The key difference is that with bitcoin, all details are transparently visible on the bitcoin blockchain, and with zcash you have the option of shielding the coin.\" Advertisement\nShielding the coin means that in any given transaction, the sender and receiver can hide their identities as well as the amount of currency being moved. The blockchain will record that a shielded transaction occurred, but it won't say what specifically happened.\nGavigan believes this makes zcash more friendly to both consumers and privacy-focused regulations like Europe's GDPR — two factors which could increase the chance of the cryptocurrency being used by businesses or by average people in their day-to-day lives.\n\"Privacy is a common requirement that people want and it's mandated by law in certain jurisdictions,\" Gavigan said. \"Would you like it if your credit card statements and bank statement were published on the internet?\"\nBut zcash also lets people leave their transactions public, which may be useful in some case, such as auditing \"how foreign aid is distributed or paid.\" It means a single cryptocurrency can be used to privately pay rent or receive a salary, as well as publicly move money across borders. It also costs less money to make transactions on the blockchain\nOne concern that has emerged with bitcoin is that its price-per-transaction can get so expensive at times that it is impractical to make small purchases using the cryptocurrency. In December, for example, when bitcoin was at its peak price, it cost up to $55 in mining fees to make a single transaction. So if you bought a $1 item using bitcoin at that time, you paid $55 in fees on that purchase. Advertisement\nBut this isn't an issue with zcash since it has larger block sizes and blocks are created more frequently on zcash than they are on bitcoin, according to Gavigan. Zcash blocks are mined every 2.5 minutes, compared to every 10 minutes on bitcoin.\nBut like bitcoin, it could also fork at any time. The code is open source, and it's possible that there will be disagreements in the zcash community which are so disruptive that two separate coins are created.\nYou can read more about forks here .\nThis has happened with bitcoin numerous times, which is how we ended up with both bitcoin and bitcoin cash. And while it could happen with zcash eventually, Gavigan doesn't foresee any major forks in the future.\nHowever, there are still upgrades coming. The zcash crew is preparing a new edition of zcash called Sapling, which it will release in September. Advertisement\nCurrently, transactions on zcash take 30 to 40 seconds to process since the cryptography associated with the coin is so intense. But Gavigan said the update with drastically reduce this processing time, \"bring more efficient transactions and open up the usability of zcash a bit more.\"\nGet the latest Bitcoin price here.>>", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko_Wilcox-O%27Hearn", "https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zcash/", "https://medium.com/gemini/gemini-is-now-the-worlds-first-licensed-zcash-exchange-dfa7da992816"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zcash", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jenny", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "winklevoss", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T21:25:49.042+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5a221f151590e4508b51f94f7e82e7bf70113853", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmV85845BsUfTepHMn2baTPU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Earn bitcoin in your ways?", "title_full": "Earn bitcoin in your ways?", "published": "2018-05-18T02:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5a221f151590e4508b51f94f7e82e7bf70113853", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmV85845BsUfTepHMn2baTPU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "RokokGudangGaram", "published": "2018-05-18T02:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn bitcoin in your ways?", "text": "Quote: from: PrinceCaspian on May 17, 2018, 05:32:42 PM Quote: from: Gracefs on May 14, 2018, 09:03:20 AM Can your share for everyone how you earn bitcoin ?\nI am earning bitcoin by joining bounty campaigns and paid by token and sell it to turn into bitcoin.\nBounty is easiest way to earn bitcoin in this forum.\nI also like you to get the bitcoin by following bounty campaign, because with easy way to get bitcoin by not using capital yes follow bounty campaign that exist in this forum", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T21:56:27.013+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32209, "moreResultsAvailable": 9109, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=23100", "requestsLeft": 431}
