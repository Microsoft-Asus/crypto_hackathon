The billionaire e-commerce guru said bitcoin is the bubble and not blockchain. He made these comments at the recently concluded World Intelligence Congress in Tianjin. Blockchain not Bitcoin Narrative Lives On\nDuring his address at the conference, Ma revealed that Alibaba focuses solely on blockchain implementation. According to Ma:\nBlockchain is now a hot word. First, blockchain is not a bubble, but Bitcoin is a bubble. Bitcoin is just a tiny application of blockchain. At least inside Alibaba, blockchain must be a solution that addresses the privacy and security issues in the digital era.\nThe Alibaba executive also went to say that blockchain was the true technological breakthrough that would drive the coming digital revolution . He identified the technology behind cryptos as having immense potential for all kinds of business processes. Ma also revealed that his company was exploring several blockchain applications. Alibaba is investing in data security and privacy solutions built on the blockchain. Such is the extent of the company’s activities in the arena that it presently holds the most number of blockchain-related patents in the world.\nMa is, however, dissatisfied with the current extent people are exploring the technology. According to Ma, too much emphasis is placed on blockchain as a money-making tool when it ought to be used as a value creation technology. He reiterated the need for the focus to be on improving the global business process rather than treating blockchain as a “gold mine.” Bitcoin is a Bubble\nOn the subject of bitcoin, Ma ironically called the world’s most popular and secure blockchain, i.e. Bitcoin, a bubble. In the past, the Alibaba founder had shown a lack of interest in Bitcoin. Has even previously said that he knows little about the crypto preferring only to focus on the blockchain. Most of the company’s efforts in the blockchain realm focus on e-commerce and public welfare protocols. In 2016, Alibaba launched a blockchain email repository , and in 2017, the company signed a partnership with PwC to develop a food traceability architecture based on the technology.\nWhile previously noncommittal to the Bitcoin argument, Ma’s recent comments put him with the likes of Warren Buffett , Charlie Munger, Bill Gates and many others. These notable business figures all have negative things to say about the world’s first cryptocurrency much to the chagrin of the Bitcoin enthusiasts.\nDo you agree with Jack Ma’s comments? Are you in agreement with folks who say only blockchain technology has value and not bitcoin?

The billionaire e-commerce guru said bitcoin is the bubble and not blockchain. He made these comments at the recently concluded World Intelligence Congress in Tianjin.\nBlockchain not Bitcoin Narrative Lives On During his address at the conference, Ma revealed that Alibaba focuses solely on blockchain implementation. According to Ma:\nBlockchain is now a hot word. First, blockchain is not a bubble, but Bitcoin is a bubble. Bitcoin is just a tiny application of blockchain. At least inside Alibaba, blockchain must be a solution that addresses the privacy and security issues in the digital era.\nThe Alibaba executive also went to say that blockchain was the true technological breakthrough that would drive the coming digital revolution . He identified the technology behind cryptos as having immense potential for all kinds of business processes. Ma also revealed that his company was exploring several blockchain applications. Alibaba is investing in data security and privacy solutions built on the blockchain. Such is the extent of the company’s activities in the arena that it presently holds the most number of blockchain-related patents in the world.\nMa is, however, dissatisfied with the current extent people are exploring the technology. According to Ma, too much emphasis is placed on blockchain as a money-making tool when it ought to be used as a value creation technology. He reiterated the need for the focus to be on improving the global business process rather than treating blockchain as a “gold mine.”\nBitcoin is a Bubble On the subject of bitcoin, Ma ironically called the world’s most popular and secure blockchain, i.e. Bitcoin, a bubble. In the past, the Alibaba founder had shown a lack of interest in Bitcoin. Has even previously said that he knows little about the crypto preferring only to focus on the blockchain. Most of the company’s efforts in the blockchain realm focus on e-commerce and public welfare protocols. In 2016, Alibaba launched a blockchain email repository , and in 2017, the company signed a partnership with PwC to develop a food traceability architecture based on the technology.\nWhile previously noncommittal to the Bitcoin argument, Ma’s recent comments put him with the likes of Warren Buffett , Charlie Munger, Bill Gates and many others. These notable business figures all have negative things to say about the world’s first cryptocurrency much to the chagrin of the Bitcoin enthusiasts.\nDo you agree with Jack Ma’s comments? Are you in agreement with folks who say only blockchain technology has value and not bitcoin?

Also since their transactions are offchain, no tracking is possible, unless the exchange complies with a warrant.\n(But if no one know what exchange you are using , they would not know where to send a warrant. )\nThe Exchanges work right now without the complexities / confusion of LN.\nHere is the kicker , any coin on the exchange can do it.\nExchanges don't have the time locks or limitations of LN and will probably be cheaper than LN fees.\n* Decries LN \"banks\" which aren't actually banks at all, then tells people to use exchanges like actual banks *\nYou realise that's pretty stupid advice right? With exchanges, you're trusting that third party to be the custodian of those funds. You are giving them your money, making them the owner of that money, and asking them to look after it for you. With a multisig setup, you still have control over your funds. I don't care how complex or confusing you think it is, it's still more secure to control your own private keys.\nIf you want to hand your money over to total strangers on the internet, go right ahead. Don't come crying to us when you lose it.\nQuote: from: Zin-Zang on May 20, 2018, 10:58:14 AM FYI:\nLN hubs , use their own LN Notes (promises to redeem/pay bitcoin) , all LN hubs will be required to conform to AML/KYC regulations.\nSo LN transactions will not stay private and will be reported.\nNo Governments are going to allow LN Hubs= Unlicensed Banks to bypass all of their AML/KYC regulations.\nThey will eventually require a banking license for all LN Hubs and full reporting compliance.\nCentralised exchanges are far more likely to be subject to KYC/AML than LN is, again demonstrating the absurdity of your argument. But again, go right ahead and take the \" too dim to understand the benefits \" option and hand your money over to strangers. It's not like you'll have any other option if you're using BCH anyway. At least BTC is giving users a choice over how they want to handle their privacy and security. I would much rather open a payment channel over depositing funds to an exchange.\nPlus, for altcoin trading, we won't even need exchanges anymore when atomic cross chain transfers mean we can hop from one blockchain to another without any middlemen holding funds in between. Although, again, BCH users won't have the option to attend that party due to their limited vision.

He elaborates his views on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. He believes that taxonomy of all the cryptocurrency related objects is a necessary step for a clearer market.\nCoinshares is a company that analyzes and research on the cryptocurrency market. They are known for publishing strategies for private investors.\nHe gives his personal opinion saying it is very early to judge Bitcoin’s growth prospects. The energy trading industry that he worked for before, he watched it for around 15-20 years and saw it develop from industrial logistics business to high-frequency trading business.\nHe said that 3 years back when cryptocurrency was very small, he had launched Bitcoin Tracker One. Bitcoin Tracker One is an exchange-traded node [ETN] designed to provide access to investors regarding the returns of the underlying asset.\nHe says:\n“We need to do a taxonomy for all the assets and token. We need to see the structure continue to build, we need to see the custody, solutions and provided we need performance measures.”\nHe also mentioned that issue of custody can be solved as the institutional presence in cryptocurrency increases. Many platforms have come up with new institutional products and that’s what institutions want from them.\nDaniel also said that none of the national jurisdiction can really kill cryptocurrency as it’s more of a global phenomenon.\nHe says that China and the rest of Asian countries are the major market regulators.

He countered most of the arguments and statements made by fellow MBA students as presented in the article. The piece in question had called for responses from MBA students of some of the top business schools in the world in the aftermath of the successful HSBC blockchain-based finance transaction.\nThe article identified regulation as a considerable issue within the ecosystem and wanted to know the views of the students on the potential impact of government regulations on Bitcoin. According to Tabatabai, the article made for “disappointing reading” as the responders did not offer a visceral assessment of Bitcoin as far as Tabatabai is concerned. He then went on to offer his own opinions on the matter. Bitcoin is a Monetary Asset\nTabatabai believes that Bitcoin is more than regular assets like oil or equities. In fact, Bitcoin is a monetary asset . As a result, the number one crypto is speculative in nature. He also said that Bitcoin is the epitome of Austrian Economics, calling it the hardest money ever created. Some notable Bitcoin enthusiasts such as Dan Larimer have described themselves as Austrian economists or proponents of the philosophy of Austrian economics.\nThe Westminster MBA student also declared that volatility is an essential component of the market. He identified the inelastic supply and variable demand metrics as part of the reason for the volatility. The total Bitcoin supply is capped at 21 million BTC. Tabatabai expects that the volatile nature of the market will continue until in-flow of money into the arena far exceeds the amount of money already in the market. Bitcoin, Not Blockchain is the Real Value Concept\nHe also countered responders who said that blockchain and not Bitcoin holds the real value. There is a growing blockchain only trend that believes blockchain is the only value creation concept in the emerging crypto market. Tabatabai believes Bitcoin is the foundation upon blockchain implementation will be driven. Commenting on the matter, he said:\n“Bitcoin is the underlying monetary asset around which economic incentives are aligned such that millions of actors across the globe are able to reliably operate/trust a decentralized, distributed ledger of ordered, immutable transactions — ie: a blockchain. The value is not in the technical architecture of the distributed ledger, but that the data inside it can be trusted without the need for third-parties.” Regulations Will Have Little Effect on Bitcoin\nOn the subject of the impact of regulations on the Bitcoin market, Tabatabai expressed his belief that regulations were inevitable. He refused to get into the argument of the degree to which regulation will impact the market. According to him, Bitcoin has enough resilience not to be affected by the regulatory storm.

So I also created a simulation to try and understand and simulate the conclusions reached in this paper. I could not find that mininers can in any way be incentivised to follow or join a selfish strategy as it simply is not more profitable than honest mining.\nWhat baffles me most I suppose is that neither the paper nor most of the discussions take any consideration for cost of mining operations and including a time variable. The paper concludes that selfish miners “earn revenues in excess of their mining power”. Do I understand correct that revenue refers to income before cost of producing that income? If so how is revenue even relevant without considering expenses when discussing incentives?\nNote I do not say the paper is wrong - at least not yet. I am simply asking for clarification in pointing out my possible error. As a hypothetical miner seeking to increase my profits by any means, how can I change the simulation to show that it can be more profitable to selfish mine so that I can apply it to a real mining operation?\nSimulation: https://repl.it/repls/HealthyUnwillingBetatest\nSource: https://github.com/pvrooyen/sm\nI cross referenced my results with u/theGreyWyvern ‘s simulation here:\nhttp://www.greywyvern.com/code/javascript/selfishmining , as well as getting some algorithmic ideas from the source.\nHere is a sample output at first retarget and the end of day 100:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.greywyvern.com/code/javascript/selfishmining", "https://repl.it/repls/HealthyUnwillingBetatest", "https://github.com/pvrooyen/sm"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T15:33:28.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "158dd554914a8fc8dbd8dd0070039b3e0bf5abc9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKKyIkA2j5ihptshYbBylWWVz.GKMraLqa5f6AjEqmBF26cjVJQMzxlzrif1HFD1at44wFUniKE1k-", "site_full": "www.freelancer.com", "site": "freelancer.com", "site_section": "https://www.freemarket.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["job_search", "hobbies_and_interests", "jobs", "freelance_writing"], "section_title": "Freemarket.com - New Projects", "title": "buid me a responsive matured binary + bitcoin investment website", "title_full": "buid me a responsive matured binary + bitcoin investment website", "published": "2018-05-20T19:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.f-cdn.com/assets/img/facebook/default-04d56222.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1547, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "158dd554914a8fc8dbd8dd0070039b3e0bf5abc9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4vWGx0nMOiZTL5gYeRosKKyIkA2j5ihptshYbBylWWVz.GKMraLqa5f6AjEqmBF26cjVJQMzxlzrif1HFD1at44wFUniKE1k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-20T19:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "buid me a responsive matured binary + bitcoin investment website", "text": "Graphic Design buid me a responsive matured binary + bitcoin investment website\ni want the website to be automatic once users deposit money start counting instantly and i want it matured and smooth just like [login to view URL] Offer to work on this job now!

Lee has claimed that the crypto market still “faces significant internal resistance and hurdles within traditional financial institutions,” Bloomberg reports May 18 Having accurately predicted the growth of crypto markets after the US tax day in April, Tom Lee made another Bitcoin prediction on May 7, saying that the cryptocurrency will rally during and after the Consensus conference takes place in New York May 14-16. “We expect BTC and cryptocurrencies to behave similarly to prior years and rally during Consensus,” Fundstrat’s co-founder stated back in the beginning of the month. In a report to his clients Friday, Tom Lee explained his forecast was based on such factors as the crypto community coming together in a “centralized place,” as well as the “growth in attendance.” These factors were expected to have a positive effect on cryptocurrency prices and “strengthen the crypto-community’s conviction.” In his tweet May 18, Tom Lee confirmed the fact the crypto markets have instead lost up to 10 percent during Consensus, although the conference counted 8,700 participants, which is “more than a tripling of attendance in the prior year.” CRYPTO: #Consensus2018 rally did not happen, very disappointing. What we needed was a trifecta of progress: (i) institutional custody/tools; (ii) buy-in by banks/investment managers; (iii) regulatory clarity (3 of 3 needed), but we got progress on (i) and (ii).

Earlier this month, Tom Lee himself predicted Bitcoin to be worth $36,000 by the end of 2019, “based on the historical average 1.8x P/BE multiple.” Related Articles", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/mining-will-propel-bitcoin-price-to-36k-in-2019-says-latest-fundstrat-research", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-18/crypto-bull-tom-lee-owns-up-after-bitcoin-prediction-goes-awry", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/taxes", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/banks", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-markets-see-more-gains-in-the-wake-of-americas-tax-day", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/tom-lee", "https://t.co/XcqNhgYgK7", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-regulation", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/usa", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-fails-to-accomplish-predicted-rally-following-nyc-crypto-conference", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-price", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-07/bitcoin-to-rally-on-consensus-conference-fundstrat-analyst-says", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Consensus2018?src=hashref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/fundstrat/status/997499507083538435?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fundstrat global advisors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T19:38:51.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "82292162e2c16fc21a01f0d80f6742c95d3b7977", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYOJVZy3HxkezvQzQys.PBc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Should government consider bitcoin as a legal global currency?", "title_full": "Should government consider bitcoin as a legal global currency?", "published": "2018-05-20T19:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "82292162e2c16fc21a01f0d80f6742c95d3b7977", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYOJVZy3HxkezvQzQys.PBc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Md.salauddin", "published": "2018-05-20T19:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Should government consider bitcoin as a legal global currency?", "text": "I think the government of every country should legalize bitcoin for their own interest.

German grad student @ TU Munich. ☕️+✍🏼=❤️. If you like my writing, follow the journey: http://niklasgoeke.com. May 20 Photo by Andre Francois on Unsplash Why Is Everyone Investing In Bitcoin? Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. What follows is my personal, subjective, biased opinion. There’s a great story being told over and over around the web. It’s the story of the 10,000 Bitcoin pizzas. In May 2010, one Bitcoin was worth less than a penny. A forum user, Laszlo Hanyecz, made the first ever real-world transaction: he bought 2 pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoin. If you recall today’s prices, ranging anywhere from $1,000 to $20,000 in the past year, that dude paid between $10 and $200 million for two pizzas. It’s easy to consider this a foolish investment now, of course, but eight years ago no one could possibly know what Bitcoin would become. Maybe, if it wasn’t for people like Laszlo, we never would’ve gotten here. However, given Bitcoin’s meteoric rise, especially in 2017, many people now look at its astronomical price and think it’s too late to get involved. The problem here, as most human problems, is mainly a psychological one. So let’s walk through the thought process and mental obstacles most, if not all people, encounter before they first decide to invest into Bitcoin. Three Types Of Bitcoin Bias I like to think of cognitive biases as raindrops on your mental windshield . A few won’t cloud your vision too much, but once it’s full, you better turn on the wipers. When it comes to Bitcoin pre-ownership, there are three in particular that mess with your mind. 1. Unit Bias This is our tendency to want to measure things by whatever metric the world gives us for them. Originally discovered in a study about food intake , what it means is that you’d rather eat one burger than half a burger, even if both should work out to 250g of meat. For Bitcoin, stocks, gold, or any other investment, we gauge how expensive the asset is based on how much each unit costs. “One Bitcoin costs $8,000? I don’t have that kinda money!” Even for those who have the money, owning two, three, even ten Bitcoin doesn’t feel as powerful as owning a million of something else with a smaller price. This is nonsense, of course. Bitcoin is divisible up to eight points after the decimal, potentially more, if need be . But we don’t want 0. 1 BTC. We want one. 2. Probability Neglect Another tendency we have is to only respond to the magnitude of an event, not its likelihood. We estimate the size of the risk or the reward, but don’t factor in probability. As a result, we don’t judge based on expected value , as good poker players, investors, and traders do, but by the severity of the threat or the joy of the upside. This makes the chances of losing all our money look bigger than they are. Combined with unit bias, it also makes it harder to see how the price of one Bitcoin could possibly go up more. In reality, the two aren’t related. How bad it is to lose $1,000 or $10,000 is subjective, but calculating the probability of that happening is another task altogether. 3. Endowment Effect An investor’s worst enemy is impatience. But, once we own an asset, we expect it to go up in value immediately, simply because it’s ours. On the other hand, we’re rarely willing to pay the current market price for something, because, well, it’s not ours yet! The researcher who originally studied this phenomenon , Daniel Kahneman, gave half his students mugs, and then asked all of them how much they’d be willing to buy or sell the mugs for. Those who had mugs quoted prices about twice as high as what those without mugs were willing to pay for them. So if Bitcoin is at $10,000, a good rule of thumb is that you tell yourself “I’d buy it at $5,000,” but at the same time, if you had one, you wouldn’t let it go for less than $20,000. There are as many variants to this process as there are people, but these elements strike me as common and they definitely got to me. So why did I and millions of others change our minds? A Chronology Of Bitcoin Price Predictions Giving in to biases doesn’t mean we don’t doubt them. First and foremost, there’s FOMO, the fear of missing out, as we see others making money — or at least claiming to — left and right. The space provides many opportunities to make a fortune beyond investing. Naturally, we’re scared to be left in the dust. But one of the main factors that keeps eating at us as we follow the news more and more is that time and again, reputable people stick out their neck to make bold price predictions for Bitcoin. This trend really caught fire when, in July 2017, the infamous John McAfee predicted Bitcoin to land at $500,000 within three years. He later updated this to $1,000,000 by the end of 2020 . McAfee is a lose cannon, to put it bluntly, but even more conservative folks don’t shy away. Like Mike Novogratz, former billionaire and crypto fund manager, who correctly predicted Bitcoin going to $10,000 in 2017: “I’m pretty confident to say it’s going higher…It would not surprise me if in the next 6–10 months we are over $10,000.” —  Mike Novogratz, Oct 10th, 2017 He then doubled down and said it could go to $40,000 by the end of 2018 . The former VP of JPMorgan Chase, who was a Wall Street trader for 10 years, Tone Vays, sees the long-term price potential at $100,000 per coin . Thomas Lee, who served as J.P. Morgan’s Chief Equity Strategist from 2007 to 2014, puts the price around $20,000 by 2022 , with room up to $50,000. The list goes on and on. Of course we have no clue if any single one of these is right and there are some biases in crowd predictions too , but the more predictions you see, the larger the question in your head gets: How likely is it that every one of them is wrong? Oh Holy Context, Where Art Thou? I don’t know anything. Bitcoin could go to $0 tomorrow, for all I know. What I do know is that making good decisions requires lots of context . This is where psychology hits its limits. Context is the environment of facts surrounding your subjective opinion. And there’s nothing more factual than math. Right now, 10–20 million people are haggling over 17 million Bitcoins . Because of how the system works , only 21 million Bitcoins will ever be created. Ever. The global population is about 7.6 billion people right now and it’s growing. Fast. Source If all Bitcoin does is stay around , supply and demand dictate that the price, in the long run, should go up. That’s a big if, but the math that backs it pierces a potential first-time investor’s doubts because it’s simple, yet sound. Another valuable piece of context comes from placing Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies against other asset classes as a whole. The global market for gold is around $6-$8 trillion . Placing not just Bitcoin, but the whole crypto asset class inside it makes the new kid on the block look like a drop in the bucket. Yes, the size relation is accurate. Calculated for a $200B total crypto market cap back in November. Even at its height, the speculative crypto market barely topped the capitalization of Apple, a huge company, but still just one company. None of these data points are guarantees Bitcoin will be a good investment, but to a stressed potential investor, the math makes it easy to argue psychology into the ground. There are many ways to spin the math so that it works out. There are few ways to spin the math so it doesn’t. Putting It All Together To recap, potential investors into Bitcoin are initially held back by three biases. The fear of missing a big opportunity along with a plethora of price predictions, among other things, gets them to doubt these biases. Furthermore, the mathematical context around Bitcoin is simple and convincing, which is what gets many to ultimately pull the trigger. Once you spend some time in the space, you’ll notice most arguments against Bitcoin are based in psychology too. They make points around ethics, security, and convenience, like “if people stop believing in it, it will be worth zero.” But that’s just as true of the US dollar or any other currency. So while a lot of these arguments are universal, they also quickly lose steam if probed for facts. There are some more rational, fact-based ones as well, like transaction costs, excessive energy use, and governance issues, but few of them dare to go near the math around the price, because, well, it checks out. Will there be huge ups and downs, booms and busts along the way? Absolutely. But probability-wise, it might not be the stupidest idea for millennials to focus some, maybe even a lot of their retirement planning around crypto investments, not stocks. It is and likely will be the biggest growth sector for private investments for years to come. More people, more biases, more predictions, more believers. Like the 10,000 Bitcoin Laszlo paid for his pizzas, it’s only the math that will stay the same.

Since 2014, when we started developing our platform, we were driven by the unique community spirit surrounding Bitcoin, and, equally importantly, by Bitcoin’s technological potential. As such, we decided to operate accordingly: aiming to contribute to the network to the best of our ability whilst reaping the benefits that Bitcoin presented to us. And so, since 2015, all of our transactions have been batched to minimize the strain we put on the network, and in December of last year we became one of the first payment processors to integrate SegWit.Today, we have an exciting announcement to make, regarding a further improvement of our platform and adoption of a Bitcoin scaling solution.Lightning Network is the next major technological innovation in the Bitcoin space. Although still in its early stages and more suited to advanced, technical users, LN is, without doubt, the most awaited upgrade to the Bitcoin network.Implementing Lightning payments has been our aspiration for a long time and we are excited to finally launch it in our Sandbox environment. An intense testing phase is ongoing and we welcome everyone to give Lightning Network a try by purchasing a virtual cup of coffee on our test shop.In the meantime, we are preparing to run pilot integrations in live environment with a select group of merchants that wish to join us in becoming early adopters of this exciting tech. If you are interested in accepting Bitcoin payments via Lightning Network with CoinGate, please fill out this form.A word of warning though - the Lightning Network is in its early stages:it is not yet user-friendly, and really more suited to advanced (technical) users, though we are sure this will change soon with growing adoption;there will be bugs, both in the Lightning Network itself, and in our implementation of it; this is expected, and the reason we are publishing this post is precisely to get community feedback and squash those bugs before releasing the Lightning Network in the live environment.Any feedback is very welcome and encouraged; please write to us at lightning@coingate.com regarding anything related to LN.To those unfamiliar with CoinGate, we are based in Vilnius, Lithuania, and have been building and operating our platform since mid-2014. We started off slowly, but grew very quickly in 2017 and, at the present time, we serve over 4,000 merchants using our gateway to accept 50+ cryptocurrencies. We are quite popular among technical businesses (VPN, hosting and similar) and niche industries, but our focus and ultimate goal is to bring cryptocurrency payments mainstream and to make them one of the default payment methods in everyday shopping. We have always strived to be a community-oriented payment processor, and we are proud to still charge zero transaction fees to shoppers, and to source our exchange rates without hidden markups.

It makes up for the deficiency of the existing monetary system and should also promote the reform of the existing monetary system.\nLike insurrection, it is either extinguished or assimilated into the long river of history.\nBitcoin is very known worldwide and for countries accepted this is now already consider as their currency alternate to their traditional currency so bitcoin has a chance to be the global currency on top of our 'fiat\".", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T14:30:48.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b677cf0f89d135107339bf0c8d167b3ea20de8d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5uVLlyanVHNtSOgu6faAXVV2jUFh27TTenKqZNaoUiebOMmTjRdtNaTaUlI30Iumcg--", "site_full": "cryptogeeks.com", "site": "cryptogeeks.com", "site_section": "http://cryptogeeks.com/news/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin: What Is the Future of Bitcoin in China?", "title_full": "Bitcoin: What Is the Future of Bitcoin in China?", "published": "2018-05-20T19:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b677cf0f89d135107339bf0c8d167b3ea20de8d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5uVLlyanVHNtSOgu6faAXVV2jUFh27TTenKqZNaoUiebOMmTjRdtNaTaUlI30Iumcg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsbot", "published": "2018-05-20T19:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin: What Is the Future of Bitcoin in China?", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T20:28:23.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "676c0d4f767f53c8ea26df3ed9a0dd41c2486c85", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5uVLlyanVHNt.DRj1xABH.VYu606QS03ASA3Al.DBW7JLxGe15XNCdyJD604Fo.QSJL6HUbJ6knOQv4WOht.fYlxsUAhxbyLmg--", "site_full": "cryptogeeks.com", "site": "cryptogeeks.com", "site_section": "http://cryptogeeks.com/news/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin: Buidl.js -

At press time, entities like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin all experienced small, yet noticeable hikes in their prices, while others, such as Bitcoin Cash, are showing even more noticeable gains over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin is sitting just beyond $8,362 – roughly $262 higher than where it was during our previous price article.\nNew reports about Bitcoin mining have emerged, and suggest that global operations for extracting new coins now require as much electricity as the entire nation of Ireland. The Emerald Isle’s population is considerably larger than that of Iceland, which a few months ago, was identified as the first country to outdo itself via Bitcoin mining.\nCryptocurrency mining ultimately required more energy than what was needed to power all of Iceland’s residences. Its newfound status with Ireland’s electricity use shows just how powerful, and even common, Bitcoin mining has become.\nIn addition, Bitcoin mining may use as much energy as Austria by the end of 2018. At press time, global operations require about 3.1 gigawatts of power.\nThe number of gigawatts necessary to power all of Austria is roughly 8.2, suggesting Bitcoin mining energy may possibly double by the time 2019 rolls along. It seems everyone is eager to get their hands on new coins.

Good reflection and better control system can make more valuable in economic sector. now by the help of bitcoin selling and buying system is easier than other transection. At age of technology we can collect or hire so many proficient worker for the purpose of different sectors development and then we can provide their salary through bitcoins because of its popularity.\nOn above this conversation we dont need to worry about future of virtual currency or bitcoins.\nFor me the future of the bitcoins is really bright becquse I can see them being the currency to be used as a mode of payment in the future by almost all the stores establishments and everything.

Maybe due to the high expectations over Consensus, which did not create that much demand over bitcoin, at least not as much as it happened during previous years. I understand it’s your money that is at stake and the market has been quite bearish. But it’s also mine and everyone else’s who decided to change from fiat-currency to cryptocurrency. To most people you know bitcoin is an investment vehicle; maybe a bit more worrying, is the fact that the focus is not even bitcoin anymore, it’s mostly altcoins. Where else we could we get those massive gains (bruh)? But greed comes at a cost. I love new ideas, new projects, new ways of thinking and innovation in general. I also love the concept of decentralizing trust and money and the super-power/super-responsibility that comes with it. Obviously, the debate is considerably more interesting when the total marketcap of (insert top-10 project name) is worth billions. At some point we need to stop and ask ourselves, how happy are we with the actual progress of the cryptocurrency space? So many companies have surged, yet where is the real change? Is there a bubble or is the market undervalued? Is price aligned with technology development and adoption, in any way? More importantly: Can you still go to the moon? –this article shouldn’t be taken as financial advisement as it represents my personal opinion and views. I have savings invested in cryptocurrency so take whatever I write with a grain of salt. Do not invest what you cannot afford to lose and always read as much as possible about a project before investing. Never forget: with great power, comes great responsibility. Being your own bank means you’re always responsible for your own money– I have absolutely no idea, plus I couldn’t care less. Don’t take me wrong, I hope the market turns bullish and we do see a massive bull-run, breaking the CME futures market trend of keeping Bitcoin below 10k. I hope all projects deliver upon their promises. I hope price, technology development and business development align themselves. My desire is that everything works out just fine and everyone who invested takes home some profit. The problem is, of course, reality works a little bit differently. Maybe in a different universe where we make no bad choices and aren’t greedy by nature, that could happen. What I see is many projects being clearly overvalued, a definite lack of research on actual proven concepts and too much money wasted on marketing campaigns, ads, advisors, ICO trackers, paid promotional content instead of focusing on actual product development and fixing important issues. “In order to make money, you need to spend money” Sure. Welcome to the VC western mentality world. You either think big or go home, right? No. That’s not why I joined cryptocurrency. I do want to make money, get rich and don’t have to worry about anything else for the rest of my days, focusing only at doing what I love. But there are many ways of achieving that goal. You don’t need 1000 BTC to start a decentralizing (whatever business) platform with economic incentives. Or at least you shouldn’t. One of the things that drive my passion towards cryptocurrency is what’s about to come: when people with an actual need for the technology start participating, hordes at a time. Sure, our gains are important. But there’s something way bigger coming which will influence the entire marketcap. Imagine when those 33% unbanked people around the world realize they can simply download an app and get paid in a currency accepted everywhere. The true beauty of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies remains to be its decentralized, permission less and transparent nature. But in order for that to happen, we might need to put greed aside for a second and think of ways of better-redistributing money. If you don’t see how that is important for your personal gain, let me clarify. Think of what happens when you include 30 billion people on the financial system. Can you even do it? I cannot conceptualize the impact on our daily lives, but from a financial standpoint, this is what I see: 30 billion more customers for every business, potentially. By financially including people who did not have a chance to participate in the world economy, you can now reach new customers everywhere; because the means of exchanging are borderless and permissionless, no one can be blocked from exchanging value and services. The digitalization of the world, via mobile smart-phones with internet access, could change how we do business forever. For example, if you do business in Africa or Latin American countries you might know it’s near impossible to take money away, due to the many currency-related restrictions. You can now hop over that problem, just by transacting in cryptocurrency. Or maybe if you’re willing to train a whole new workforce, who needs much less cash to sustain an acceptable standard of living. It might not be easy but with the right set of tools, motivation and people we might see new specialized businesses flourishing through developing countries. How will cryptocurrency change jobs and economies worldwide? In order to get to the bottom of that question, first we need to worry about adoption. I personally believe there are 3 reasons that could lead to potentially increasing worldwide adoption of cryptocurrency: A Better User Interface; A Better redistribution of money; Standardized multisig/escrow contracts. If you think I forgot about scalability, transaction fees or block size, please rest assured I haven’t. To me those aren’t real problems; as the network grows in security (more miners), user adoption and developer community, I believe we will see those issues getting resolved. Some others will appear, of course, but that’s the nature of innovation. You need to break stuff in order to build new things so it’s not the tech problems that frighten me, to be honest; the values and paths we choose to support our decision-making, that is what concerns me. But we’ll get into that in a bit. So, why is User Interface at the top? Simple answer: would you be able to use the internet without DNS being active? If you do not understand the question, let me rephrase it: how easy would it be to, instead of accessing https://ccn.com , you would have to know a bunch of different IP addresses to be able to connect to the provider website? I’m sure you wouldn’t like that at all. Killer user-friendly apps, which make the bridge between the infrastructure and the user are the key which might unlock this puzzle. The first real challenge is making cryptocurrency indistinguishable from digital fiat-currency. We need ways to safe-guard users from making bad decisions, like not keeping their private keys safe, accessing websites via ads, or keeping their entire assets in a single place. To achieve that, we have two main schools of thought to follow. Learning by doing or, Regulating the markets. As regulation is usually the way to avoid, especially during the early development stages of any new technology, we should educate people and allow them to make bad decisions. It’s hard to lose your money, I have been there. I have also been scammed, tricked, made bad decisions on where to store my money, lost private keys and so on. What’s the only good thing about it? Each time I failed I learned something that helped me making better decisions in the future. What “experts” usually don’t say is that you shouldn’t be afraid to fail, especially if you’re starting in a new field. Consider the following: the sooner you fail the sooner you learn. This is, if I had not made all those mistakes back in the day, I would probably do them later on. And I could have lost way, way more money! The hardest lesson we all learn with time is that there are no safeguards in real-life. A stupid comment on twitter can lose you your job; a click in the wrong ad can infect your laptop; just being in the wrong place at the wrong time can change your life drastically. We need to accept we don’t control most things that come our way. We’re either prepared to deal with them or we’re not. One thing I’m pretty sure of: blocking people from investing because it’s in their best interest is just dumb. Why? For one, how is it ok we allow some guys sitting at a table somewhere think they know better? Oh I see, they’re “protecting” us. If it isn’t morally wrong or illegal, don’t even try to tell me what to do. Let me do stupid stuff and make incredibly irrational decisions. That’s how I learn. I mean.. If it’s ok to gamble, it should be ok to buy cryptocurrency. If it’s ok to share my data with the highest bidder, it should be ok to let me monetize it as I see fit. Secondly, everyone makes bad decisions at some point. No exceptions here. If someone tells you how certain they are about a certain event, run like the wind. Honestly, nothing is for certain, much less an unregulated market subject to the will of the whales and institutional investors. I mean, when JP Morgan comes out saying “ We’re considering entering the crypto market ” it means they’re already in, as most of you know. People are greedy by nature, right? Banks, institutions, corporations, any type of organization are just groups of people trying to get the maximum utility of each play. Sometimes, even the greatest people make the most stupid mistakes. Do you follow, for example, the brilliant Andreas Antonopoulos? I’m sure if you do, you think highly of him. Did you know his co-author on “Mastering Bitcoin”, a blockchain bibble for so many crypto-enthusiasts, was the person responsible for creating Parity? Which got hacked not so long ago? Do you think he was an idiot for trusting such a person to be his co-author? This is the harsh truth you don’t read many times. People make mistakes and bad things happen. What matters are the intentions and values on which decisions were made. Either a commercial airplane pilot who wasn’t able to account for time correctly or a doctor who failed to diagnose a disease, people sometimes make bad decisions that lead to destructive outcomes. Those events, however, can have a positive impact on future generations, because Human Beings have the capability to learn from theirs and others’ mistakes. Critical thinking is key for cryptocurrency, as we cannot impose too many regulations on something that is already internally regulated. That’s why Bitcoin works, as its internal consensus mechanics promote good behaviour and punish bad actors. If you wonder why we might need to slow down on regulation think of what the current state of finance is doing to the world. There is a clear separation and segregation of classes as the rich can invest while the poor can only work for a pay-check. Screw that. Make money work for you. This is not a new idea, not even related to cryptocurrency at all, but it’s an important mmindsetto have. Maybe the story of rich-dad, poor-dad can be an inspiration to you, regarding how to look at money. Now, let’s get back on track at the question at hand. How can we better redistribute money? –I hope you don’t judge my rant too seriously; sometimes we just need to let it all out— Bitcoin initiated a process of rewarding participants for securing the network. That’s already pretty cool and quite an achievement, but we need to aim at doing it better. Right now you need special hardware to maintain the security of the network. In time, I hope the mechanics change in order to allow for more people to be rewarded for maintaining the network’s security. Real change, in my opinion, will come from different proof-of-consensus. For example, there might be a different implementation that requires all participants to secure the network. This is, anyone who participates needs to validate transactions at some point, getting rewarded to do it. Currently ,the logic dictates you need to spend energy to maintain the network’s security, which is a fair trade-off. But other logics might appear with different goals. What if instead of energy you staked your time or attention? You do not need a massive data structure change, like switching from a blockchain to a DAG or Hashgraph, to improve consensus mechanics by giving more rewards to users. If everyone agrees to a change in the protocol rules you can potentially just fork bitcoin into a new proof-of-work mechanic, rewarding everyone who already participates in the current bitcoin blockchain (like bitcoin cash, private, gold etc). There are of course opinions against keeping doing hardforks, as it potentially “steals” hashing power from the main network. But hey, that’s a feature of decentralization. People should be able to do whatever the hell they want. If someone believes they have a better way of reaching consensus, let them try. I understand the current feeling is many projects are just forking Bitcoin so that founders and early adopters get rich quick. Is that a lie? I doubt it. Again, we humans are quite greedy. That doesn’t refute the fact hardforks can have a potential good outcome! If the overall goal is to improve the network, adoption and user reward why wouldn’t you do it?! I hope people try new things, as it’s the only way to achieve the best possible outcome for everybody. let’s get crazy for a second, shall we? Tokenizing the world economy Another potential solution is if businesses everywhere start adopting a different mentality. What if instead of giving people equity, you can give them a direct way to make money by using your product/services? I understand it’s hard to conceptualize a token which has no real value, as it’s not connected to an organization’s equity, but try to see it from a different perspective: you can now purposely give away tokens to users, for free, as they use your product or service. Those tokens could let them vote upon governance, reward them with a fixed income or allow them to donate back tokens so you can build new features or maximize your business utility. The goal here would be to directly redistribute gains, for example, among the people who support your network: users. Those users can be anyone, your suppliers, buyers, employees, investors, etc. Everyone who interacts with your business could potentially be rewarded for participating. Imagine not having just a source of income, but potentially dozens at the same time, just from sharing your data, buying products, using services or interacting with a network. We could completely shift how the world works by literally giving back to your network. We now have a chance to shift from measuring wealth in profits to measuring wealth in network users. Because all users would have tokens! As crypto-assets are inter-changeable, everyone can easily exchange them for digital cash. Or any other digital asset you see fit. Maybe instead of having 150 currencies, we will end up with hundreds or thousands of digital assets, all of which could potentially be exchanged amongst themselves. We now come to the final point that can greatly influence overall adoption. Standardized multisig/escrow contracts Although this point would definitely work “under the blockchain hood”, its key for people to trust each other. Meaning, only with standardized and trusted contracts deployed, which use a very easy and friendly interface, we actually have a chance of people trusting the entire system. It’s pretty cocky to say “the blockchain can’t be hacked” when software and websites built over it, could. We can’t forget we still live in an analogue world. People still lookup to institutions and governments for guidance and expect them to behave according to everyone’s best interest and their intrinsic values. The issue is that sometimes, leaders forget those values they swore to abide to when making decisions and base them solely on personal gain. To destroy that mentality we also need a solid and stable infrastructure aligned with a set of organizations lead by people who do not care about personal gain. Hence I understand the role Vitalik, David, Dan or Charles play at their projects. How achievable is that goal? It will depend, again, on all of us. If we promote and invest in projects just for gains, not caring about the purpose or goal, then I don’t see a real future. If we make an effort to bet on projects and people who put the benefit of the many ahead of their own, then I do. I think it’s up to us to let good projects and ideas live, bad ones to die and mistakes to happen. Someone said if we do good deeds the world responds in kind. For more than 2 centuries we had a system that only worked in some parts of the world, it wasn’t all inclusive, it was permissioned and required people to identify themselves to participate. We had a system that did not work 24/7 nor did it reward participants. Come to think about it, no one born after 2008 will ever live in a world where fiat-money is the only option. That’s somehow reassuring. Things have changed and we all must make an effort to turn this market into a huge success. From investors, to developers and from miners to users, it’s up to all of us as individuals to promote good agents and to punish bad actors. Don’t forget: the more selfish your actions are the worst the overall outcome for the most. I understand that for some of us to win, others need to lose; that’s just how balance works. Except this time the winners can be the many and the losers the few. I know it’s a bit of a stretch, but who knows? With a different attitude comes a different outcome. Is Bitcoin a bubble? No. Our immense greed and money lust is. If you fear the market will collapse think of the Internet bubble. Do you remember how it ended? Great. Now think of how you’re reading this article. No bubble will destroy bitcoin, we’ve been there already. Now, if there is a bubble it means we weren’t able to control our greed for quick profits and allowed for enormous over-valued silly projects to emerge. Just like during the 2000s. The only good thing is that with any failure comes an important lesson. My only conclusion is that Bitcoin is the new digital internet money. No one was ever able to stop P2P file-sharing; do you really expect cryptocurrency will be any different? If there’s a 51% attack, the network simply forks.

The subject – due to its environmental impact – is slowly beginning to attract interest similar to the sharp and speculative ups and downs of Bitcoin’s value.\nDutch dean Alex de Vreas, a blockchain technology expert behind Bitcoin, and founder of the Digiconomist blog that informs users of cryptographic data, writes in the journal Joule that in 2017 the minimum global use of electricity due to Bitcoin was calculated to 2.55 gigabatts a year, almost as much as Ireland had consumed last year.\nHowever, by the end of 2018, it is expected that the energy demand will be more than doubling due to Bitcoin’s requirements, at 7.7 gigawatts. As he estimates, a single transaction with Bitcoin uses both electricity and an average household within a month.\n“0.5% is already sufficiently shocking and it is something extremely different compared to the traditional financial system. Bitcoin’s ever-growing demand for electricity will certainly not help us catch up with climate change targets, “said Alex de Vreas. It seems likely that if Bitcoin’s price continues to climb up, the computer network that supports the coin will reach 5% of global electricity, “which is too ugly,” he warns.\nBitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency, which is not regulated by a central authority, e.g. central bank. Bitcoin users themselves record their transactions and assure each other of who owns what, keeping a common digital record. This depends on computers scattered around the world, who put a “time stamp” in the chain of successive transactions, to prevent double transactions in the same currency. As blockchain demands, computers on Bitcoin’s network make continuous mathematical computations and compete with each other in order to have the opportunity, once every ten minutes, to create the next “block” in the chain of transactions.\nThe winning computer user, having solved the mathematical problem first, is rewarded with 12.5 new encryption (worth about $ 104,000 today), a process known as Bitcoin’s “Extraction”. Users are constantly adding new computers and expanding their computing power, hence their energy needs, in order to increase their share of the world’s “pie” and thus increase their chances of “mining” new cryptosnotes. In fact, Alex de Vreas warns that Bitcoin will become so costly in the future because of its big energy needs, which may be no longer profitable.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chris d", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vreas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T08:04:57.063+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "47ed626164f289cae90eb78163c371b1ffc2d8bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYkJSrOMCN5CJUg3q5_giPNzN6.0BXI.yjxbWHqfBj_pWFHlKjts8tFpgfi5_cygccco75_hwEoqZw-", "site_full": "finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://finance.yahoo.com/live/gstalks", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Talks at GS", "title": "CEO Blankfein to Step Down, Bestowing Complex Bitcoin Relationship", "title_full": "Goldman Sachs CEO Blankfein to Step Down, Bestowing Complex Bitcoin Relationship", "published": "2018-05-20T18:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/D27HTmiW3M5I_8LIIZK0VA--~B/aD0xMzYzO3c9MjA0ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/376fa6c8e1e446d98d1c5b351584d652", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "47ed626164f289cae90eb78163c371b1ffc2d8bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThiio0hiTRCuDRHUBYjhYkJSrOMCN5CJUg3q5_giPNzN6.0BXI.yjxbWHqfBj_pWFHlKjts8tFpgfi5_cygccco75_hwEoqZw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CCN", "published": "2018-05-20T18:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "CEO Blankfein to Step Down, Bestowing Complex Bitcoin Relationship", "text": "Lloyd Blankfein, 63, is expected to step down as CEO of Goldman Sachs in December, leaving the bank’s future uncertain in several ways, including its relationship with bitcoin.\nThe New York Times reported that Blankfein will likely depart following the company’s December annual dinner for retired partners. While the bank earlier this month announced plans for a bitcoin trading desk and a futures contract tied to bitcoin, its embrace of bitcoin has been undermined by Blankfein’s stated doubts.\nBlankfein’s Doubts In late November, he called bitcoin a tool for fraud when its price reached $10,000, amidst reports the company was exploring a cryptocurrency trading desk. He denied the company had a bitcoin strategy and said the cryptocurrency’s volatility made it a bad store of value. If it stops fluctuating 20% in a day, he said he’d reconsider.\nBlankfein had said previously he was “open” to bitcoin and that he would not allow his own opinions to impact the company’s strategy.\nIn early November, he said bitcoin could prove to be the “next step” in money’s evolution. While he was uncomfortable with bitcoin, he said he felt the same skepticism with cell phones when he first encountered them.\nOver the years, he noted, he has learned a lot of things work out that he does not love. He went as far as to say that in the new world, it is possible a consensual arrangement about value could exist rather than a government fiat. If bitcoin did become mainstream, he said it would be hard money’s natural evolution.\nThen in mid-November, he said he didn’t like bitcoin and it could be a bubble.\nThe future without Blankfein remains unclear.\nA Goldman Sachs spokesperson said most people involved in the bitcoin operation are still skeptical about it.\nBank Acknowledges Activity, Cites Uncertainty The company disclosed in a Feb. 26 filing with the SEC that its cryptocurrency and blockchain related investments and its intention to support clients’ bitcoin futures trades could hurt the company should there be issues with blockchain protocols.\nBitcoin, however, is only one of many uncertainties the bank faces going forward.\nIts mergers and acquisitions advising is far less profitable than before the financial crisis, The New York Times reported, and consumer and investment banking aren’t large enough to make up the difference.\nThe bank has since bolstered its investment banking into mid-size cities and expanded its online lending and currencies and commodities trading for big corporations.\nFeatured image from Flickr.\nThe post Goldman Sachs CEO Blankfein to Step Down, Bestowing Complex Bitcoin Relationship appeared first on CCN .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ccn.com/im-open-to-bitcoin-goldman-sachs-ceo-lloyd-blankfein/&quot;", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/business/goldman-ceo-lloyd-blankfein-david-solomon.html", "https://www.ccn.com/goldman-sachs-ceo-blankfein-to-step-down-bestowing-complex-bitcoin-relationship/", "https://www.ccn.com/a-vehicle-to-perpetrate-fraud-goldman-sachs-ceo-blankfein-sours-on-bitcoin/", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/business/goldman-ceo-lloyd-blankfein-david-solomon.html&quot;", "https://www.ccn.com/a-vehicle-to-perpetrate-fraud-goldman-sachs-ceo-blankfein-sours-on-bitcoin/&quot;", "https://www.ccn.com/goldman-sachs-will-launch-a-bitcoin-trading-desk/", "https://www.ccn.com/goldman-sachs-ceo-blankfein-to-step-down-bestowing-complex-bitcoin-relationship/&quot;", "https://www.ccn.com/goldman-sachs-will-launch-a-bitcoin-trading-desk/&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Fa.59z4oYJWmUBoST05bjw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/376fa6c8e1e446d98d1c5b351584d652", "https://www.ccn.com/im-open-to-bitcoin-goldman-sachs-ceo-lloyd-blankfein/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lloyd blankfein", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "blankfein", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T20:09:23.055+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d899179dda0257fb0f1a2832bc7df2da397f41d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTINqAdAIhjAo71w2HmImBKAPlB2E1nOf4twwZFwzQkaCprAIVS2yhizb9N0w6xtlQGp6d48ughp8b.TH_2BA.LYIcWCQ08qBrX_5QMq8e59sj7chwyXp._OzxzAW1tNR4vnxL46xXh0w--", "site_full": "anynote.co", "site": "anynote.co", "site_section": "https://anynote.co/rss/?id=1", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Latest Blogs", "title": "Completes Move Of Frequent Shares From Its Own Blockchain To The Bitcoin Blockchain Bitcoin Trade", "title_full": "Completes Move Of Frequent Shares From Its Own Blockchain To The Bitcoin Blockchain Bitcoin Trade", "published": "2018-05-20T18:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d899179dda0257fb0f1a2832bc7df2da397f41d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTINqAdAIhjAo71w2HmImBKAPlB2E1nOf4twwZFwzQkaCprAIVS2yhizb9N0w6xtlQGp6d48ughp8b.TH_2BA.LYIcWCQ08qBrX_5QMq8e59sj7chwyXp._OzxzAW1tNR4vnxL46xXh0w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Joanna Pruett", "published": "2018-05-20T18:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "Completes Move Of Frequent Shares From Its Own Blockchain To The Bitcoin Blockchain Bitcoin Trade", "text": "by Joanna Pruett on 3 minutes ago 3 views AirToken will allow billions of offline and pre-paid cell subscribers in rising markets to have access to capital for each data, the fuel of the smartphone, and ultimately digital and bodily items within the cellular ecosystem.

Bitcoin and other digital currencies are based mostly on blockchains—cryptographic ledgers that file every transaction carried out bitcoin talk using Bitcoin tokens (see Why Bitcoin Could Be A lot More Than a Foreign money \"). Individual computers everywhere in the world, linked via the Web, verify each transaction using open-source software. Presearch is an open, decentralized search engine that rewards community members with Presearch Tokens for their utilization, contribution to, and promotion of the platform. The central financial institution mentioned tokens cannot be used as currency available on the market and banks cannot supply companies regarding ICOs. But to get to that subsequent step, Blockstack plans to raise extra funding via an ICO, through which it will promote its own cryptocurrency to set a precedent for different apps that will use its platform. ICOs are a way for start-ups to lift money by selling traders tokens in alternate for equity, similar to an preliminary public providing (IPO). The crew collected 1235 ETH — price around $375,000 at ICO time — and shortly after the CFD tokens turned tradable their worth skyrocketed. Some tokens are built on top of recent variations of Bitcoin's blockchain that have been modified indirectly—examples embody Litecoin and ZCash. But now, just two weeks after the ICO ended, the project's web site and founders are all gone, and the value of the Confido token (CFD) is close to zero. Intenext guys are constructing a decentralized web primarily based on the blockchain that strives to provide a new, safer, private and environment friendly web. What was recently a handful of largely properly though-out blockchain infrastructure tasks, has became thousands and hundreds of potential ICO's. Our proposed network daemon (hybridd) 'glues' cryptoassets and cash together by passing round datasets or tables - utilizing a FIFO (first-in-first-out) blockstream for sharing and verifying data - that include identification information about each invidual blockchain-based mostly asset, and rulesets that govern their relationship to form a hybrid asset. Oh, and tokens aren't simply stand-ins for stock—they can be set up so that as a substitute of a share of an organization, holders get companies, like cloud space for storing, for example. Although there are profitable ICO transactions on report and ICOs are poised to be disruptive progressive instruments within the digital period, buyers are cautioned to be wary as some ICO or crowdsale campaigns are literally fraudulent. GLA is principally an ERC20 token based mostly on the Ethereum blockchain , and users who take part in swimming pools can earn GLA tokens by validating incoming requests.

Disclosure: I did not take part within the Confido ICO and I've never owned CFD tokens. The tokens distributed for the Web of Coins challenge are referred to as HYBRID. Tokens usually are not fairness and shouldn't represent the longer term worth of the challenge or future cash flows. The token that will probably be launched by the ICO will go a good distance in facilitating decentralized hosting. Group manager for technology at the ICO, Simon Rice, explained in a blog submit that users are nonetheless making the same errors they did two years in the past, when a significant story hit the headlines around IoT flaws. For these causes, ICOs are referred to as crowdsales.

Keep in mind that if you go this route, PyBitmessage will need to be re-installed multiple times for each user that needs to use it. python setup.py install --user Using PyBitmessage\nTo start communicating with PyBitmessage, you’ll first need to create a new identity. Do this by opening the program. Once it’s open, click the “new identity” button. Leave the settings at default, and click “OK” to get started.\nShortly after setup, PyBitmessage will show a notification in your system tray saying “connected.”\nTo send a message with PyBitmessage, click the “Send button.” Clicking “send” doesn’t automatically send anything. Instead, it opens the message dialog, where users can compose new things to send. Sending Ordinary Messages\nNeed to send a Bitmessage to a friend? First, get their Bitmessage address. Once you’ve got it, click on “Send ordinary Message.” Paste their address in the “To” box.\nNote: PyBitmessage sends disposable messages. To determine when your message will expire, drag the slider next to “TTL.”\nPyBitmessage won’t automatically use your address in the “From” section. Instead, you’ll need to click the “From” box and select your address when it comes up in the menu. Fill out the subject, and the message box. When everything looks good, click the “send” button. Sending Messages To Subscribers\nIn addition to sending messages from person to person, PyBitmessage allows users to send items to “subscribers,” or people who follow your PyBitmessage address. To use this feature, click “send,” then the “Send messages to your Subscribers” button.\nLike in “Ordinary Messages,” click on the “From” box and click add to your address. Then fill out the subject and the content of your post. Click send to publish to your followers.

Research predicts that Bitcoin is going to use up around 0.5 % of the entire world’s electricity by the end of this year. Estimating the rapidly increasing demand for electricity that the Bitcoin network requires in a year, there is a necessity for studying the impact of power consumption by the cryptocurrency. After properly understanding the demand for power, we have to come up with a sustainable electricity policy or find another renewable source of energy. The study conducted was based on economic principles, which states that a single Bitcoin transaction consumes as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands consumes during a month. The minimum electricity consumption of Bitcoin network is at 2.55 Gigawatt but the study predicts that the Bitcoin network could consume around 7.7 Gigawatt. Ironically it is around 0.5% of the entire world’s consumption. The Bitcoin network is completely dependent on computers for running its day to day transactions and utilizing other benefits of the Blockchain. They require computers which can time-stamp transactions into an ongoing chain to verify and prevent duplication of these transactions. The computers in the blockchain have to perform calculations continuously to create the next block of transactions in the particular chain. This hectic chain of events is called “mining” the coin, the user would be rewarded with 12.5 new coins for the successful completion. Alex de Vries, an economist, and blockchain expert working for the PwC in the Netherlands has explained that they have seen a lot of back of the envelope calculations, but they require more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. He is hoping that other people would also do more research on the matter, as the information available is not sufficient. The increasing electricity requirement means the higher production of electricity is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals.

For much of the fund’s history, that allocation was relatively stable in number of shares, and hovered between 6 percent and 10 percent of the portfolio, according to FactSet data. Bitcoin often led the list of top holdings in ARKK. Only one other ETF on the market offered parallel access to bitcoin ARKK’s internet-focused counterpart ARK Web x.0 ETF (ARKW).\nMore from ETF.com:\nThe next bond crash: An ETF story\nWhy I don’t use target date funds\nWorld’s cheapest ‘do good’ ETF\nBitcoin, accessed through the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), was a major driver behind both these funds’ returns last year. ARKK and ARKW were each up more than 87 percent in 2017. GBTC itself was up a whopping 1,550 percent.\nHere’s the ETFs’ rally last year, and that impressive rally relative to GBTC’s, in two charts:\nBut these ETFs’ big bet on bitcoin is no longer the case. In mid January of this year, ARK began trimming exposure to bitcoin in both funds, and today bitcoin represents only 0.5 percent and 0.6 percent in ARKK and ARKW, respectively. The cryptocurrency is almost a negligible allocation in these portfolios now.\nWhy? According to ARK, the “complicated decision” to dramatically trim bitcoin exposure was more driven by regulatory and tax-related concerns than by the “merits” of bitcoin itself.\nBut performance probably played a major role in this portfolio shift. Bitcoin as measured by GBTC rose dramatically in 2016 and in early 2017, and then began to fall later in the year. So far in 2018, GBTC has already dropped 37 percent, bringing its losses from its mid-December 2017 high to more than 63 percent in just five months. (ARKK and ARKW are each up about 15 percent year-to-date.)\nshow chapters\nEarly bitcoin investor reveals which cryptocurrencies he would HODL or FODL 21 Mins Ago | 10:16\nIt could very well be that ARK was simply taking profits on its bitcoin allocation earlier this year, and has been trimming that position since as bitcoin prices continue to struggle. If GBTC price performance did in fact motivate the move, any recovery in bitcoin prices could mean an increase in allocation down the road.\nFor now, however, given that the Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve the launch of a bitcoin ETF many issuers have thrown their hats into that ring investors who want access to the cryptocurrency through an ETF wrapper have slim pickings at best.\nBy Cinthia Murphy, ETF.com.

Since 2014, when we started developing our platform, we were driven by the unique community spirit surrounding Bitcoin, and, equally importantly, by Bitcoin's technological potential. As such, we decided to operate accordingly: aiming to contribute to the network to the best of our ability whilst reaping the benefits that Bitcoin presented to us. And so, since 2015, all of our transactions have been batched to minimize the strain we put on the network, and in December of last year we became one of the first payment processors to integrate SegWit.\nToday, we have an exciting announcement to make, regarding a further improvement of our platform and adoption of a Bitcoin scaling solution.\nLightning Network is the next major technological innovation in the Bitcoin space. Although still in its early stages and more suited to advanced, technical users, LN is, without doubt, the most awaited upgrade to the Bitcoin network.\nImplementing Lightning payments has been our aspiration for a long time and we are excited to finally launch it in our Sandbox environment. An intense testing phase is ongoing and we welcome everyone to give Lightning Network a try by purchasing a virtual cup of coffee on our test shop .\nIn the meantime, we are preparing to run pilot integrations in live environment with a select group of merchants that wish to join us in becoming early adopters of this exciting tech. If you are interested in accepting Bitcoin payments via Lightning Network with CoinGate, please fill out this form .\nA word of warning though - the Lightning Network is in its early stages:\nit is not yet user-friendly, and really more suited to advanced (technical) users, though we are sure this will change soon with growing adoption; there will be bugs, both in the Lightning Network itself, and in our implementation of it; this is expected, and the reason we are publishing this post is precisely to get community feedback and squash those bugs before releasing the Lightning Network in the live environment. Any feedback is very welcome and encouraged; please write to us at lightning@coingate.com regarding anything related to LN.\nTo those unfamiliar with CoinGate, we are based in Vilnius, Lithuania, and have been building and operating our platform since mid-2014. We started off slowly, but grew very quickly in 2017 and, at the present time, we serve over 4,000 merchants using our gateway to accept 50+ cryptocurrencies. We are quite popular among technical businesses (VPN, hosting and similar) and niche industries, but our focus and ultimate goal is to bring cryptocurrency payments mainstream and to make them one of the default payment methods in everyday shopping. We have always strived to be a community-oriented payment processor, and we are proud to still charge zero transaction fees to shoppers, and to source our exchange rates without hidden markups.

With the development of the bitcoin gambling casino which has introduced provably fair gaming to the online world and implementation by brands such as Subway and Steam, the cryptocurrency is continuing to grow. Despite numerous restrictions being placed on Bitcoin, the debate around its potential is continuing, and in turn the cryptocurrency has begun to market itself. Here, we’re taking a look at how. The Characteristics Of Bitcoin\nThere are numerous exciting opportunities which Bitcoin provides, and a lot of these come from the characteristics behind the blockchain technology which makes up the cryptocurrency. Firstly, the decentralised element to the Bitcoin offers numerous advantages which is actually leading to disrupt numerous financial institutions. Despite its unpredictability and its evolution under the auspices of a nebulous entity, it is this challenging nature which is actually attracting numerous investors. The cryptocurrency is almost completely anonymous, and as such, many users feel protected when making purchases.\nThe blockchain technology itself is also exceptionally secure, with fraud being somewhat deterred by the make-up of the cryptocurrency. All of these characteristics have gradually marketed themselves, and with the boom in investment, more individuals are turning to this cryptocurrency as an alternative payment method. Price Performance\nA major indicator of the cryptocurrency’s growth is its price performance, and with the huge amount of investment going into the currency in recent months, it’s unsurprising to see that the price has boomed. Despite many critics believing that the currency remains unstable, the Bitcoin is marketing itself as a well-performing investment opportunity for many. While many are concerned about the regulations which are beginning to be imposed, these will only stabilise the cryptocurrency, further opening opportunities for use.\nFear By Financial Institutions\nOne of the major marketing aspects for Bitcoin is the fear it has imposed in some traditional financial institutions, which may now have to evolve their techniques in order to keep up with this ever-growing technology. While traditional financial institutions may see this as a negative, consumers and individuals will see this as a positive, as banks will now have to adapt their methods in order to keep funds as secure, yet accessible, as possible. Some financial institutions, such as Barclays, have already started to adopt cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, and have begun discussions with regulators on how to bring this technology into play more efficiently. With big brands such as these, alongside the likes of Subway, Microsoft, PlayStation and more embracing this technology, Bitcoin is being marketed in more ways than ever before.\nWhile many associate Bitcoin with having an image issue, in modern times, this is very much the opposite. With increasing regulations being implemented, Bitcoin is only going to stabilise more efficiently, and as a result grow with more investments. Since the boom, Bitcoin’s marketing has been handled by the news and simply by word-of-mouth.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://betking.io/", "http://www.printfriendly.com/print?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwall-street.com%2Fhow-is-bitcoin-marketing-itself%2F&title=How%20Is%20Bitcoin%20Marketing%20Itself"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T19:05:25.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d67c41fca33fe1222bf3f3cbe79046a6df7d6e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSMynr3a25ohs9Ku3IhkM9U3KpqUAu2bwcfaBv_x8SX6cD9h_a29gcrDOYLw2LfA0lX58hxHwz6veo7B5UYhIeb3JNusTxrPPo-", "site_full": "funnyjunk.com", "site": "funnyjunk.com", "site_section": "http://funnyjunk.com/rss/latest_funny_pictures.rss", "site_categories": ["entertainment"], "section_title": "FunnyJunk Latest Pictures", "title": "Bitcoin energy consumption", "title_full": "Bitcoin energy consumption", "published": "2018-05-20T17:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3997, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d67c41fca33fe1222bf3f3cbe79046a6df7d6e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSMynr3a25ohs9Ku3IhkM9U3KpqUAu2bwcfaBv_x8SX6cD9h_a29gcrDOYLw2LfA0lX58hxHwz6veo7B5UYhIeb3JNusTxrPPo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-20T17:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin energy consumption", "text": "Percentage that could be powered by BitcoinDescription Value Hitpoints current estimated annual electricity consumption' (Taro 02.? -it Annualized global mining revenues \", 867, 898 Annualized estimated global mining costs 77, 501 Current cost percentage % Country closest to Bitcoin in terms of electricity consumption Czech Republic Estimated electricity used over the previous day (kWh) 185. 598, 767 Implied Watts per / s Total Network Hashlete in PH/ s (1, 000, 000 Ems] 33, 204. 00 Electricity consumed per transaction (kWh) 924 Number of us. households that could be powered by Bitcoin 6272, 551 Number of US. households powered day by the electricity consumed for a single 31. 22 transaction Hitpoints electricity consumption as a percentage of the world' s electricity consumption % Annual carbon footprint (kt of COY) 33. 194 Carbon footprint per transaction (kg of COY) 452. 6 ...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T18:32:58.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2bace43ce1be46949ec450df86ff5a724fb2062b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdBZmkl07Nt1Y0ZUXTos7JY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=74.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Legal", "title": "Is it legal to sell bitcoin for cash ?", "title_full": "Is it legal to sell bitcoin for cash ?", "published": "2018-05-20T17:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.031, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2bace43ce1be46949ec450df86ff5a724fb2062b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdBZmkl07Nt1Y0ZUXTos7JY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lang09", "published": "2018-05-20T17:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is it legal to sell bitcoin for cash ?", "text": "For legal matters, sell it only on accredited exchange so you know what is okay and what is not.

Since 2014, when we started developing our platform, we were driven by the unique community spirit surrounding Bitcoin, and, equally importantly, by Bitcoin’s technological potential. As such, we decided to operate accordingly: aiming to contribute to the network to the best of our ability whilst reaping the benefits that Bitcoin presented to us. And so, since 2015, all of our transactions have been batched to minimize the strain we put on the network, and in December of last year we became one of the first payment processors to integrate SegWit.\nToday, we have an exciting announcement to make, regarding a further improvement of our platform and adoption of a Bitcoin scaling solution.\nLightning Network is the next major technological innovation in the Bitcoin space. Although still in its early stages and more suited to advanced, technical users, LN is, without doubt, the most awaited upgrade to the Bitcoin network.\nImplementing Lightning payments has been our aspiration for a long time and we are excited to finally launch it in our Sandbox environment. An intense testing phase is ongoing and we welcome everyone to give Lightning Network a try by purchasing a virtual cup of coffee on our test shop .\nIn the meantime, we are preparing to run pilot integrations in live environment with a select group of merchants that wish to join us in becoming early adopters of this exciting tech. If you are interested in accepting Bitcoin payments via Lightning Network with CoinGate, please fill out this form .\nA word of warning though - the Lightning Network is in its early stages: it is not yet user-friendly, and really more suited to advanced (technical) users, though we are sure this will change soon with growing adoption; there will be bugs, both in the Lightning Network itself, and in our implementation of it; this is expected, and the reason we are publishing this post is precisely to get community feedback and squash those bugs before releasing the Lightning Network in the live environment.\nAny feedback is very welcome and encouraged; please write to us at regarding anything related to LN.\nTo those unfamiliar with CoinGate, we are based in Vilnius, Lithuania, and have been building and operating our platform since mid-2014. We started off slowly, but grew very quickly in 2017 and, at the present time, we serve over 4,000 merchants using our gateway to accept 50+ cryptocurrencies. We are quite popular among technical businesses (VPN, hosting and similar) and niche industries, but our focus and ultimate goal is to bring cryptocurrency payments mainstream and to make them one of the default payment methods in everyday shopping. We have always strived to be a community-oriented payment processor, and we are proud to still charge zero transaction fees to shoppers, and to source our exchange rates without hidden markups.
