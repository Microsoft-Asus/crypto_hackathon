The banknote in question belongs to Brunei, one of the most centralized countries in the world, and has one of the richest men alive printed on it.\nBrunei’s B$10,000 bill is worth, at press time, roughly $7,584. Bitcoin, according to CCN’s price Index , is trading at about $7,700 after surging from about $7,460 in the last 24-hour period. The bill has a portrait of Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, and was issued in 2006.\nSultan Hassanal Bolkiah, one of the last absolute monarchs, is notably one of the richest men on Earth, as reports suggest he is worth over $20 billion, thanks to the country’s vast oil and gas fields, which account for nearly all of its economy.\nBrunei has less than half a million residents, and recently adopted strict Islamic sharia law, which drew criticism from various international rights groups. Back in December, when most cryptocurrencies were at an all-time high, the country’s central bank reportedly cautioned against cryptocurrencies. Phasing out high-denomination notes\nThe Brunei dollar’s value is legally par with the Singaporean dollar. Singapore itself had its own S$10,000, but reportedly discontinued it. High-denomination bills are being retired throughout the world, as these reportedly make it easier to conduct illicit activities such as terrorism financing, money laundering, and tax evasion.\nRecently, Latvia got rid of its 500-lat note, worth about $982, after becoming the eurozone’s 13th member. The eurozone itself is phasing out its €500 bill over similar concerns. Brunei’s high-denomination bill remains as the country is seen as a low threat for money laundering and terrorism financing.\nSwitzerland, which recently called for a study on the potential risks and benefits of issuing a state cryptocurrency dubbed “e-franc, ” has been resisting pressure to stop printing its 1,00-franc note, which currently accounts for more than 40% of its bills in circulation.\nAccording to an International Monetary Fund (IMF) article , a briefcase with $100 bills would be 70% full, while a briefcase with Brunei’s largest note would only be 1.5% full. Being easy to transport makes these bills ideal for criminals, the article suggests. A similar argument, coupling said feature with bitcoin’s semi-anonymous nature, was also used against the cryptocurrency in the past.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hassanal bolkiah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quartz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brunei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T12:06:42.038+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f64f04ef564144b560555ec91ec77022778a5cdc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKdTCfr5pZfAWoIuPDrPlbKx8EqhV913agV1i3DT9Qxg96u29depJTGUdplqq8u61ninNa85i5ROUeJYEc4UMKwI_P7W1Jc4Wd9oMI_loZMRA-", "site_full": "www.newsbtc.com", "site": "newsbtc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Bull Tom Lee Refutes Bearish Sentiment, Predicts Further Gains | NewsBTC", "title_full": "Bitcoin Bull Tom Lee Refutes Bearish Sentiment, Predicts Further Gains | NewsBTC", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2018/05/10113805/bitcoinbulls.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40893, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f64f04ef564144b560555ec91ec77022778a5cdc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC77tRqaFxxJKdTCfr5pZfAWoIuPDrPlbKx8EqhV913agV1i3DT9Qxg96u29depJTGUdplqq8u61ninNa85i5ROUeJYEc4UMKwI_P7W1Jc4Wd9oMI_loZMRA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rick D.", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Bull Tom Lee Refutes Bearish Sentiment, Predicts Further Gains | NewsBTC", "text": "Bitcoin Bull Tom Lee Refutes Bearish Sentiment, Predicts Further Gains nickchong | June 6, 2018 | 8:00 am Bitcoin Bull Tom Lee Refutes Bearish Sentiment, Predicts Further Gains nickchong | June 6, 2018 | 8:00 am\nTom Lee is back, with another round of Bitcoin bullishness on-air CNBC’s ‘Fast Money’ segment. PermaBull Tom Lee Appears on CNBC Fast Money\nOn Monday, Tom Lee, long known as a cryptocurrency bull in the space, went on CNBC to dispel bearish sentiment against Bitcoin’s viability and more importantly, its price. ‘Fast Money’ host, Melissa Lee, pointed out that bears held three things against Bitcoin.\nFirstly, that the Google search trends for Bitcoin are down, dropping to almost 25% of the levels seen at the start of the year. Many Bitcoin bears believe that this indicator shows that direct investment interest in this cryptocurrency. Although this may be somewhat true, this indicator tells far from the whole story. As well, Tom was quick to point out that the Google Trends indicator was not fully indicative of the price and popularity of Bitcoin :\n“Google searches aren’t the leading indicator for Bitcoin, but instead, acts as a ‘coincident indicator,’ and therefore shouldn’t be looked to as some sort of BTC price predictor .”\nIn this case, this “coincident indicator” means that it moves in correlation with Bitcoin’s price, instead of preemptively signaling the price movement of the popular cryptocurrency. Lee also assured viewers that he believes that traditional institutions are still interested in investing in the space, despite the short-term bear market which the cryptocurrency market has experienced.\nAnother point which Bitcoin bears made was that trading volumes have plummeted since last year’s bull run. According to CoinMarketCap , trading volume is down by over 75% since the late December highs seen in the industry.\nTo help combat this supposed bearish indicator, Lee called the run-up last year a “parabolic blow off.” This essentially means that he thought that the volume seen during late last year was an abnormal figure, and should not be as relevant now. He also compared the daily figures to other volume figures from earlier in 2017;\n“Compared to a year ago, (over) the same time (the first 6 months of 2017), Bitcoin volumes are up nine hundred percent .”\nThis fact affirming that he believes that the volume present in the cryptocurrency trading space is still “healthy.” Tom Lee Affirms That Bitcoin Will Move In An Upward Direction\nFinally, Lee addressed the bearish sentiment that Bitcoin has been struggling to break over the mental and technical barriers in the $10,000 range. To help assist his bullish views on the market, he utilized some research done by his market analysis firm, FundStrat. The Bitcoin bull said specifically:\n“Bitcoin makes all of its performance in 10 days, in any year. So I don’t think that the fact that it is at the current levels is going to prevent it from actually rising before the end of the year.”\nAccording to his prior appearances on CNBC segments, Bitcoin’s price movements can be mainly attributed to 10 days throughout a whole year. If you took out those 10 days in any year, Bitcoin would be down an average of 25% in that year. With this data, he made it apparent that he believes that a Bitcoin price surge will occur within the time span of a few days.\nIf Bitcoin somehow manages to continue its downward trend, Tom Lee made it clear that he believes that Bitcoin will hold price levels at the cost of mining a single Bitcoin. According to research from his firm, the current cost of mining a Bitcoin sits at an average of $6,000 and if history is any indication, that means Bitcoin should hold at $6,000 if worst comes to worst.\nImage from Shutterstock Bitcoin Bull Tom Lee Refutes Bearish Sentiment, Predicts Further Gains was last modified: June 6th, 2018 by nickchong ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin bull tom lee", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "permabull tom lee appears", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melissa lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T11:42:06.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "161354d91d2ac1d22b7d087564e22e6cb316e204", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeqQMe90ltUZl6LBMeZt3QFXlQ82nGEUUsjfQwH7viLxyBcn3Mo39CcsjFSLQMf99RO1Sozva7KUJ8SddPAEv5HKCA0wcTmlo-", "site_full": "alterminds.xyz", "site": "alterminds.xyz", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Vietnam Proposes Import Ban on Bitcoin Mining Equipment • Alter Minds", "title_full": "Vietnam Proposes Import Ban on Bitcoin Mining Equipment • Alter Minds", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i1.wp.com/alterminds.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/vietnam-ban-768x768.png?fit=768%2C768&#038;ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "161354d91d2ac1d22b7d087564e22e6cb316e204", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeqQMe90ltUZl6LBMeZt3QFXlQ82nGEUUsjfQwH7viLxyBcn3Mo39CcsjFSLQMf99RO1Sozva7KUJ8SddPAEv5HKCA0wcTmlo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Vietnam Proposes Import Ban on Bitcoin Mining Equipment • Alter Minds", "text": "\nVietnam’s Ministry of Finance has officially proposed that the country bans the import of cryptocurrency mining equipment. Bitcoin mining rigs are currently easily imported into Vietnam. This proposal follows the largest crypto fraud case in the country involving over $656 million and more than 32,000 victims. Advertisements\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Ministry of Finance’s Proposal\nIn the recently released report containing the opinions of the ministries involved in the management of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Vietnam, the country’s Ministry of Finance proposes suspending the importation of mining equipment, according to local media. This report, referred to as Document 5964 / BTC-TCHQ, has been submitted to the country’s prime minister. Zing.vn publication elaborated:\nAccording to the Ministry of Finance, mining machines are not on the list of goods banned from importation and are not subject to the list of specialized management or unsafe goods, so enterprises are easily allowed to complete the import procedures.\nThe ministry outlined in its report that the use of mining equipment for bitcoin, litecoin and other cryptocurrencies in the country is difficult for the authority to manage. “From there, it is easy for people to use [cryptocurrencies] as a currency or another method of payment,” the City Economic News Kinhte & Dothi quoted the ministry. “This is in violation of the amended government Decree 101 on non-cash payments,” Zing.vn conveyed.\nThe publication also noted that data from the General Department of Vietnam Customs shows that “from 2017 to half of 4/2018, the country imported about 15,600 mining machines,” adding that most of them were imported into Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Da Nang. Last year, more than 9,300 rigs were imported into Vietnam and over 6,300 rigs were imported in the first four months of this year. Decision to Ban Mining Imports\nThe ministry also referred the case where Modern Tech Corp in Ho Chi Minh City was “accused [of] over VND 15 trillion [~US$656 million] of fraud by more than 32,000 people through its Ifan and Pincoin virtual currency investment models.” According to the ministry, protecting the Vietnamese people from similar scams in the future “requires state management agencies to take strict control measures with the import and use of this commodity.” The Vnexpress reiterated:\nTo prevent other possible events, in the immediate future, the Ministry of Finance proposed to apply the import suspension measures for the above types of mining equipment.\nThe Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc recently signed a directive to strengthen “the management of activities related to bitcoin and other virtual currencies,” as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported.\nWhat do you think of the proposal to ban mining rig imports?

ASIC Miners to Face Unprofitable Times\nIn an official announcement on June 4, 2018, the BTG organization laid out changes to their blockchain expected in the upcoming network upgrade to be accomplished via a “ Hard Fork .”\nThe organization cited two reasons for the development. The first offers ways to improve the security of the BTG protocol after the 51 percent and double spend attacks. The second addresses the industry-wide threat of ASIC miners arriving in the Equihash mining space.\nThe new algorithm is called the Equihash-BTG. As stated on their forum, it requires significantly larger memory to run, and aims to make ASIC mining “impossibly unprofitable.” With the new <144,5> parameters, a minimum RAM 700 MB and 2.5 GB in storage will be needed to run the algorithm, successfully making mining activities expensive. However, it is noted that “most graphics cards that miners use already have that much memory or more.” Advertisement advertisement Timelines to Be Soon Released\nThe organization is currently testing the protocol but assures that most of the necessary components for the upgrade have already been coded. Additionally, the mining protocol is being developed such that many people will be able to mine BTG as soon as the update is completed.\nThe exact update timelines will be shared in the days to come, and the organization will give a notice of at least seven days before the update.\nThey claim to have alerted all related services, such as exchanges, wallets, and mining pools about the impending update and stated that it may be delayed based on the latter’s untimely responses. Regarding security, BTG reported:\n“We’re also working hard on many fronts to improve security, both now and in the future. We’ve developed monitoring systems for our blockchain and our mining network, and have established channels to rapidly communicate risks to Exchanges.” Developer Teams Coordinating\nOn a final note, the organization observed that while 51 percent attacks are a part of the nascent ecosystem, developer teams are working in coordination with each other and sharing information about security risks. The blog stated:\n“We can report that the crypto community is coming together and will be supporting each other as we work to get through these difficult times as quickly as possible.” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "face unprofitable times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T16:22:25.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b2521215b71b1989b4dafa9314270353839b567c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmlMLpJ0ovoQzQz6em8Xhbe7jz8T44AvuTfX5otrCEkrjyC8j9q4u4PgFPOrnVmMm1cZrhFAii8xi3RN6_qe7MURF90CTvdwm4IMvRyBWnSwC8GN7FZMYnPBePF6sz74FU1hsVwrzYbNSe1aEShDPhQAmZA9ora70ucRxdptI3_4bdnHENMRjjZ9GxTKBhE._lbF.4OopaK.b_lWjWKyiBTK", "site_full": "razzletazzle.com", "site": "razzletazzle.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "The Bitcoin Foundation's Llew Claasen and BnkToTheFuture's Simon Dixon to Join All Star Lineup For TokenMarket 2018 | RazzleTazzle", "title_full": "The Bitcoin Foundation's Llew Claasen and BnkToTheFuture's Simon Dixon to Join All Star Lineup For TokenMarket 2018 | RazzleTazzle", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.428, "main_image": "https://i1.wp.com/razzletazzle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/razzlelogo.gif?fit=1400%2C1145", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b2521215b71b1989b4dafa9314270353839b567c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmlMLpJ0ovoQzQz6em8Xhbe7jz8T44AvuTfX5otrCEkrjyC8j9q4u4PgFPOrnVmMm1cZrhFAii8xi3RN6_qe7MURF90CTvdwm4IMvRyBWnSwC8GN7FZMYnPBePF6sz74FU1hsVwrzYbNSe1aEShDPhQAmZA9ora70ucRxdptI3_4bdnHENMRjjZ9GxTKBhE._lbF.4OopaK.b_lWjWKyiBTK", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Bitcoin Foundation's Llew Claasen and BnkToTheFuture's Simon Dixon to Join All Star Lineup For TokenMarket 2018 | RazzleTazzle", "text": "The Bitcoin Foundation’s Llew Claasen and BnkToTheFuture’s Simon Dixon to Join All Star Lineup For TokenMarket 2018 By RazzleTazzle.com / Published on Wednesday, 06 Jun 2018 05:40 AM / No Comments / 0 views\nGIBRALTAR, June 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ — TokenMarket, the leading ICO advisory firm, announced today the second round of guest speakers to appear at its debut blockchain event, ‘TokenMarket 2018: Insights into the Token Economy’.

Although he didn't not name which of the brother had been corresponding with his company, he said that they were interested in purchasing a team in the Poker League that Kundra's company offered.\nIn a video recorded by news-agency ANI , Kundra admitted, \"We have terminated contract with Bhardwaj after he refused to pay,\"\nThe Bhardwaj brothers were arrested in the month of April after complaints surfaced pointing to their masterminding a Rs 2000 crore bitcoin scam.\nKundra, who had been called up for questioning by the Enforcement Directorate said the sleuths were keen to interrogate him about the email interactions. Although his company had started a contract, it didn't materialize since the Bhardwaj's didn't honor their payment-commitments.\nIn fact, Kundra said that the Bhardwajs wanted to pay in bitcoins, but he opposed that idea.\n\"Because we terminated the contract, the deal didn't happen... But we have a copy of that on email correspondence... I had to basically, connect, rectify and show them everything... That this is what has happened, and there has been no transaction...\" said Kundra.\nWhen a journalist asked Kundra about participating at promotional campaigns organised by Gain Bitcoin and the Bhardwaj brothers, Kundra replied in the negative.\nHe said the interaction with the Bhardwaj brothers was owing to the full-page ads that were flashed across newspapers. \"We thought he was a reputable person... And we allowed him to buy a team, and got into a contract...\" he is heard saying in the video.\nWatch the video here:\nWhat is the Gain Bitcoin Scam\nA file photo of one of the Bhardwaj brothers\nThe scam masterminded by Amit and Vivek Bhardwaj, referred to as Bhardwaj brothers, involves duping investors in Multi-Level-Marketing and bitcoin related schemes​ to the tune of over Rs 2000 crore. The Bhardwaj brothers were nabbed in April after multiple failed arrests. Nearly 8000 people have been reportedly cheated by various dubious investment plans from companies headed by the Bhardwaj brothers.\nVivek and Amit hailing from Shalimar Bagh area in Delhi were the founders of companies​ - Gain Bitcoin, GB Miners, and GB21. These companies were fronts for bitcoin mining, trading and multi-level marketing​, according to the cops.\nInvestors were lured in​to investing in Gain Bitcoin through several multi-level marketing concepts. At one time Amit, who has been alleged to be the mastermind​, also launched his own cryptocurrency flavour called MCAP.\nInvestors were promised inflated returns. And as the heat from investors surged, the Bhardwaj brothers left the country. An Enforcement Directorate lookout notice helped ​find them​ - first in Dubai then in Thailand.\nThe duo would have been nabbed in Dubai had it not been for Amit reportedly faking a heart attack. The fake heart attack helped the Bhardwaj brothers time their escape to Thailand. ​\nThe brothers were nabbed finally in April. By then, the major arrests in the Bhardwaj case were that of Pankaj Adalakha, a motivational speaker and Akash Sancheti, a software firm operator. The investigation authorities had also recovered 32 bitcoins, nearly 80 Ethers, and Rs 38.96 lakh in cash.

Unfortunately, for many newbie traders the lure of an offer that may seem too good to be true can often be too much to pass up. As a result, investors are finding themselves duped into schemes that promise great returns, but fail to live up to perceived expectations.\nIn a report from The Telegraph , it noted that this tactic is increasingly being used with promises of multimillion dollar returns on small investments. Bitcoin Trader is one such platform, the report states, that claims a ‘typical’ user can earn $13,000 a day for as little as 20 minutes of work.\nLudicrous promises such as these should instantly illustrate red flags, but when they are advertised with celebrities such as those from Dragons’ Den, they provide a level of authenticity to them. One of the dragons, Peter Jones, has been falsely used to promote these adverts. So much so, that a fake news article is reported to have appeared on Yahoo news claiming that two entrepreneurs managed to get Jones to buy 25 percent of their business for £2 million.\nFellow dragon Deborah Meaden’s reputation has also been used, with claims that she invested £250 live on air before making over £100 in eight minutes through the platform. Unsurprisingly, both dragons have refuted these claims while Action Fraud has issued warnings on the use of celebrity images to endorse scams.\nDespite this, though, victims can still be found. One 76-year-old man is reported to have invested £300 into Cryptopoint, which is connected to Bitcoin Trading, after he saw an advert of it while on the internet. He initially became suspicious when a pushy sales representative continued to ask him for information that he didn’t think was relevant. He has since been refunded £225, the remaining allegedly taken as a fee.\nThis, however, isn’t the first case where the images of celebrities have been used to promote fake ads. In April, Martin Lewis, founder of consumer help site, MoneySavingExpert, revealed that he was suing Facebook in a defamation lawsuit. At the time, Lewis wrote that within the past 12 months, the social media site has published around 50 fake Martin Lewis adverts that are regularly seen by millions of people in the U.K.\nUnfortunately, while steps are being taken to highlight the risks of investing in offers that sound too good to be true, there will also be some who will still blindly invest into fake offers.

While the process to buy and sell Bitcoin has been simplified over the past few years, many people still find it confusing. With banks, credit card issuers, and governments worldwide getting involved with rules and regulations on how the currency can be bought and used, it’s no wonder some people are wary to invest in cryptocurrencies.\nRecently, Bank of America, Chase, and Citigroup joined Capital One and Discover in banning cardholders from using them to buy cryptocurrencies. Credit cards were one of the most popular payment methods because of their relatively low fees and instant transaction rates, and investors are having to look at other options to make their investments. Different payment method options\nWith credit cards no longer being a reliable option, what are the best payment methods to buy Bitcoin? Each method has its perks and drawbacks, so it really comes down to what your priorities are when buying. Debit\nBest For: Small, Fast Investments\nThis option is most similar to using a credit card but without the associated risks of interest rates. You can use a standard debit card that is connected to your checking account, or you can buy a prepaid card. Using a debit card is widely accepted on most exchanges and instantly transfers, meaning you won’t have to worry about Bitcoin prices fluctuating before the transfer is complete. ACH transfer Best For: Large and/or Versatile Investments\nConnecting your bank account through an ACH transfer is a versatile option, allowing you to use a checking or savings account to buy Bitcoin or cash out when you want to sell. You’ll also be able to purchase a substantially larger amount of Bitcoin because of their higher buying limits. Just keep in mind that it can take up to 5 days for the transfer to be complete, and the value of Bitcoin can drastically change in that timeframe. Paypal Best For: Small, Fast Transactions\nPaypal was one of the first large-scale financial companies to come out in support of Bitcoin, but it has quickly become harder to find exchanges that allow customers to purchase through Paypal. Cryptocurrency purchases are at a high risk for chargebacks, which has caused some exchanges to ban the usage of Paypal. However, for small transactions or more anonymous buying, Paypal might be a good option for you. Bitcoin ATM (cash) Best For: Small, Cash Investments\nA rising trend in the world of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin ATMs allow users to purchase Bitcoin with cash through machines that work almost identically to standard ATMs. With over 3,000 Bitcoin ATMs scattered across the world (primarily in large metro areas throughout North America and Europe), you can use search tools such as Google Maps or Bitcoin ATM Radar to find one close. Just remember that while Bitcoin ATMs have low processing fees, they also have a low buying limit. Personal loan\nIf you are wary of using your own funds to invest in Bitcoin, loans are an option. You can borrow money from a family member or friend, or you can use a peer-to-peer lending platform like SoFi to leverage funds for Bitcoin investments. However, be cautious when borrowing money for an investment. Interest rates can eliminate any gains you get from the investment, and the risk of losing money in such a volatile market is high. Why is Bitcoin so popular?\nThe appeal for many is the fact that Bitcoin is decentralized, meaning no specific group or governing body has control over it. Instead, it is secured by advanced cryptography, a set of military-grade encryptions, and regulated by a network called the Blockchain. The Blockchain acts as a digital ledger, confirming buyer/seller funds and establishing the order in which transactions take place.\nBut what makes decentralized currency such an appealing investment?\n“Blockchain is a system of automated trust,” answered Trevor Welch, Chief Investment Officer at International Blockchain Investments (IBI). “We currently live in a world where some economies lack trust and transparency, others, like the US, apply it manually and with high cost and financial burden as well as a significant degree of human error. As a result any global economy can benefit from processing transactions that are verified and validated on a distributed public ledger.” How to buy or invest in Bitcoin?\nWhile the number of companies and industries that allow cryptocurrencies to be used to pay for goods and services is constantly increasing (you can use Bitcoin to pay for some things on Expedia and Microsoft, for example), the vast majority of people who buy Bitcoin or other popular cryptocurrencies still primarily use them as long-term investments. Cryptocurrencies are a new market (Bitcoin was first introduced less than a decade ago) and therefore an extremely volatile investment. In this pricing graph from Coindesk, you can see how the price of Bitcoin has fluctuated since it first debuted almost a decade ago, down to daily changes in value.\nOverall, the USD value of Bitcoin didn’t really take off until the summer of 2016, when it started skyrocketing. By December of 2017, it hit $17 500 for 1 BTC. Since then, there have been a series of smaller peaks and crashes.\nThe constant fluctuation in value can make it difficult to determine the best time and method to buy, which is why we’ve compiled a step-by-step guide to help you navigate the world of Bitcoin responsibly. Step one: get a wallet\nJust like any other currency, you have to have a place to store your Bitcoin, or more accurately, store the private keys you can use to access your Bitcoin. These aren’t the type of wallets you buy at Target, though. The software comes in many different forms, most of which can be downloaded on your smartphone, tablet, or computer desktop. Here are the different types of wallets:\n• Hardware. These are physical devices that look similar to a flash drive. If you are planning on buying high-value Bitcoin for a long period of time, this type of hardware is the way to go. Because they’re offline and completely controlled by you, they’re the most secure option for long-term storage and large sums of Bitcoin. • Online Storage. Websites like GreenAddress act as an online wallet for users. While this is a convenient option for those looking to quickly buy and sell a small amount of Bitcoin, keep in mind that wallets that live entirely online are far more likely to be hacked than hardware or apps. • Apps. Probably the most popular form of Bitcoin storage, wallet apps can be downloaded onto your smartphone or tablet. Samourai and Mycelium are solid options for Android users, while Breadwallet and Edge are the best options for iOS users. • Desktop. These wallets combine the technology of hardware and app wallets. You download an application to your computer’s desktop, allowing you to use your house your Bitcoin wallet digitally, yet offline. Electrum is currently the top desktop wallet available. Step two: register with an exchange\nNext, you need to sign up for an account with an exchange. A Bitcoin exchange is an online marketplace where Bitcoin is bought and sold. There are a lot of different options out there, but make sure that the exchange you choose is reputable with a solid number of users. Step three: ID verification\nBitcoin used to be a way to anonymously send currency, but most exchanges now require identity verification before you can buy or sell. Transactions still offer slight anonymity, but Coinbase (and many other exchanges) are required by U.S. compliance laws to have a record of users on their platform.\nThis step is easy and usually just requires photographing your photo ID and a phone number for two-step verification. Verification can sound like a hassle, but it keeps the exchange protected from black market transactions, making it a safer space for everyone to buy and sell. Step four: payment method\nLastly, you’ll have to connect a payment method. For years, credit cards were the most common way to pay for Bitcoin. Recently, however, credit card issuers and some international governments have put strict regulations on using credit cards as a buying option. Most credit cards are no longer accepted as a method of payment, meaning people have had to look into other options.\nWe give you an overview of the most common methods of payment below to help you decide which is the best option for your investment. Step five: buy Bitcoin\nFrom there, you’re ready to buy and sell Bitcoin based on the current market value. Rather than paying for a set amount of Bitcoin, you will tell the exchange how much money you want to trade, and they’ll break down how much Bitcoin you can buy. Unless you’re investing thousands of dollars into the cryptocurrency, you’re likely to be buying a fraction of one Bitcoin. Tips for buying and investing responsibly\nBitcoin (and all other cryptocurrencies) is an extremely volatile investment. While any investment is a calculated risk, a market as constantly fluctuating as cryptocurrencies poses a higher level of risk. Investing responsibly can minimize large losses while helping ensure you have the best chances of a positive return.\n1. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. This is a valuable piece of advice for any market, but it’s especially true for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. While the hype behind Bitcoin is positive, there is no guarantee of a good return. The value of Bitcoin could soar tomorrow only to crash next week. 2. Know your goals and strategize accordingly. Are you looking to use Bitcoin as a currency to exchange for certain goods and services? Are you wanting a quick turnaround investment? Or are you wanting a long-term investment that will rise in value over time? There are different buying and selling strategies that work best for each goal.\nOfir Beigel, CEO of 99bitcoins.com, suggests taking a slow burn approach to the cryptocurrency market if you’re looking for the best return possible.\n“Keep in mind there can be a lot of ‘noise’ in the background, like short-term bad news that lead to a crash,” Beigel says. “The key is to find investments you believe will yield after X time according to your targets, and to try detaching yourself from the short-term noise.”\n3. Choose trusted wallets and exchanges. The hype surrounding the cryptocurrency market has led many people to jump in headfirst without checking whether they are doing business with reputable sources. As the market starts to settle in the coming years, it’s likely that up to 80% of the wallets and exchanges currently in business will disappear. Don’t make an already risky market worse by choosing an untrusted wallet or exchange. 4. Avoid borrowing money. One of the drawbacks when credit cards were the most popular way to pay for Bitcoin was the concept of borrowing money on such an unpredictable investment. When you borrow money that requires you to pay interest (credit cards and personal loans, for example), you risk having to pay extra for an investment that doesn’t give you a return, which exponentially increases your risk. 5. Be skeptical of the hype. According to Welch, “in every way, the cryptocurrency market is a flow of supply and demand.” It’s one of the reasons it fluctuates so wildly. “When you see a lot of hype and excitement around a volatile investment that depends on supply and demand, take pause and look at what’s really going on.” He advises to take caution when you start to hear phrases like “get it before it’s gone” and “you won’t want to miss out on this.” A lot of hype can often be the precursor to a crash.\nPro Tip: If you want to invest, but aren’t keen on using your own funds, consider utilizing accrued interest on a savings account to invest. Compare savings accounts and their interest rates. If you put a lot of money into savings every year, you could fund a sizable investment with just the money the bank pays you in interest. It eliminates your personal risk and maximizes your chances of a return.\nThe best thing you can do to minimize risk and invest responsibly is to do your research. Look into different wallets and exchanges. Find trusted sources to answer your questions. If you need some guidance on how to break into the market, find a firm like IBI or International Blockchain Consulting to help you navigate the constantly fluctuating market.\nYou don’t have to know everything about the cryptocurrency market, but having a handle on the basics of how Bitcoin transactions work, the best platforms and software to use, and the overall trend of the market will help you determine the best strategy for you to maximize returns and minimize the risk of such a new, volatile market.

They’re proposing a physically backed bitcoin ETF, the Van Eck Solid X Bitcoin Trust , and it just might be poised to break the losing streak of mainstreaming BTC on Wall Street. This time, they’re aiming at institutional investors by pricing it at $200,000 per share.\nAlso read: Russian Farming Village: Local Crypto, Bitcoin Reserves, No Govt Money\nVan Eck and Solid X Team for Bitcoin ETF Priced at $200,000\nVan Eck CEO Jan van Eck cheered, “I believe that bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of ‘digital gold’ that may make sense for investors’ portfolios. The Solid X team has in-depth experience with bitcoin, cryptography, and capital markets. We’re pleased to join with them in supporting the effort to bring a physically-backed bitcoin ETF to market.” The Van Eck Solid X Bitcoin Trust will also offer itself as being insured against bitcoin lost or stolen.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports, “The firms also set a relatively high per-share price: $200,000. The price tag is designed to aim the product at institutional rather than retail investors.” And in “determining a marketing partner,” Solid X CEO Daniel H. Gallancy underscored, they “looked for a firm with a clear understanding of the potential of bitcoin and the role it can play in an investment portfolio. Van Eck is deeply involved in this space, understands its potential, and has a long track record of successfully opening new avenues for investors to access unique and compelling investment opportunities.”\nThe two have in common being New York-based and the dubious honor of having been shot down by the SEC when they attempted individually to list a bitcoin ETF. The present filing, as of 6 June 2018, will be watched closely by the ecosystem. Jan van Eck expressed optimism at their latest tactic, “We believe that collectively we will build something that may be better than other constructs currently making their way through the regulatory process. A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin.”\nChicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) and its BZX Equities Exchange is believed to be where such a fund, pending approval, would ultimately be listed. The Cboe market maker was the first to list Bitcoin Futures back in December of last year. Results have been decidedly mixed after ecosystem enthusiasm almost promised BTC would moon in response. Now, some have taken to blaming exchanges such as Cboe and its crosstown rival CME for retarding the BTC spot price, for essentially being Crypto Winter’s catalyst as it were.\nCould be the Right Combination at the Right Time\n“It is important to communicate with investors about the risks as well as the opportunities, especially for new investment areas, and we have been committed to this effort,” the Van Eck CEO stressed.\nIndeed, earlier this year, these pages reported how in a “ Staff Letter: Engaging on Fund Innovation and Cryptocurrency-related Holdings of 18 January, signed by newly appointed Director Dalia Blass from the Division of Investment Management, the SEC wrote to the Investment Company Institute and Asset Management Group Securities Industry & Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) about the prospects of bitcoin ETFs.” It was a letter filled with admonitions and warnings and potential confusions. One thing was glaringly clear: any bitcoin ETF going forward must contend with its concerns.\nTwo months ago to almost the day, however, hopeful signs appeared to emerge. Presumably in response to a Cboe open letter plea for action from President and COO Chris Concannon, the SEC seemed to be moving along further than it had previously while it considered two fund candidates from Pro Shares. Comment portion of the process has just wrapped.\nThe Journal quotes Mr. Gallancy of Solid X as reminding they “never had any intention of giving up.” Neither has the broader crypto investment community, showing how it is not content to just sit back and wait for permission. “Huobi, the Singapore-headquartered cryptocurrency exchange, has decided to create its own ETF style instrument based on its recently launched index of ten digital assets,” News.Bitcoin.com explained. In further anticipation, “Okex, the Chinese-run cryptocurrency exchange based in Hong Kong, has joined the recent trend of trading platforms creating their own ETF-like investment tools for their users. It launched its first exchange traded tracker (ETT) on June 5, which was fully sold out within just three minutes,” we explained recently.\nAre Wall Street bitcoin ETFs around the corner?

IAM ensures content creators and owners have full control over how their data is accessed, shared and monetised.\nBy developing its own public blockchain with IAM technology, DACC aims to address issues of content ownership at the infrastructure level. In addition, a full suite of developer tools will be available for developers to build any content-related platform and decentralised application (DAPP) on top of DAC’s platform and infrastructure.\nInternet and network technology have pushed tremendous growth in the digital content industry, with more data, channels and platforms available than ever before. The data explosion has highlighted major concerns in how personal data privacy is secured, prompting regulations such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation. Yet these measures ignore the fundamental problem in today’s data-driven society – data that is owned and maintained by centralised interests will always be subject to security risks, non-transparent sharing and access grants, and unfair monetisation.\n“Centralised digital content platforms have struggled to authenticate and protect original content, which has led to a hotbed of pirated works that leaves the vast majority of content creators unable to support their creative endeavours,” said Vincent Nguyen, CEO of DACC. “DACC places data ownership and management back in the hands of their respective owners and creators. By combining blockchain technology with IAM, DACC is launching its platform to support the digital content industry’s growth and advancement, nurture creativity and protect data ownership.”\nThe DACC platform aims to build the world’s largest digital content database based on blockchain and AI technology. The DACC platform will establish a transparent, secure, decentralized, and incentives driven framework for the open creation and exchange of digital content, while protecting privacy and data ownership.\nOne example of a decentralised application (DAPP) that can be built on the DACC platform is an audio content database.\nToday, digital platforms largely rely on centralised business models which stifle revenues and incentives for content creators. An audio content DAPP would establish a transparent, secure and incentive-driven of experiencing audio content through an innovative token economy. Using tokens to incentivise and reward content creators and consumers works to connect creators with their audience, fan base, and other professionals to foster a global community that will proliferate the creation of audio content and data.\nThe platform will also bridge audio content to the next generation of smart audio. Such an open and robust platform will empower and reward the audio content community while advancing audio content platforms and devices towards unprecedented levels of innovation and progress.\n“Today’s digital content industry is largely threatened by the lack of data ownership and privacy. A decentralised IAM content presents a huge opportunity for the industry to solve content and data access management issues, and supporting the creative endeavours of content creators,” added Sky Zhu, Partner of DACC. “DACC will provide decentralised, scalable blockchain infrastructure for all content-based platforms that will revolutionise how we appreciate and interact with digital content— creating new revenue streams and new possibilities for the audio industry.”\nDACC will be launching their Initial Token Offering (ITO) on 10 June 2018. The sale will run for one week and is expected to be worth $10,000 ETH, which is worth about US$6.3m today. A total of 30 billion DACC Tokens will be issued as an ERC20 utility token to be used within the DACC platform.\nCheck out the DAC Whitepaper – http://www.dacc.co/whitepaper/Dacc.pdf\nChat on Telegram – https://t.me/dacc_official_group_english\nAbout Decentralised Accessible Content Chain (DACC)\nDecentralized Accessible Content Chain (DACC) is revolutionizing the digital content and media industry. As a public blockchain featuring content ownership and access management at the infrastructure level, the DACC platform is set to introduce a new interactive way of experiencing digital content with an innovative token economy that incentivises and rewards content creators and consumers.\nFor more information, please contact:\nBenjamin Tan ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "binance", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "charts, guides & analysis sponsored", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digital content industry - bitcoin network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iam", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T05:37:38.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3d92a1d97ada2e8d88d591d6d9cca0e88890cc1d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7eqUfoTZy7nItb_K1ohXRE-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "title_full": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3d92a1d97ada2e8d88d591d6d9cca0e88890cc1d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7eqUfoTZy7nItb_K1ohXRE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nStart earning today, keep your income in your BTC wallet and it will be getting worth more in USD because Bitcoin exchange rate is constantly rising.

The team states that the planned network upgrade is underway and that the majority of the components needed for it are already prepared.\nA hard fork is seemingly underway for the Bitcoin Gold network as announced in an official update dated June 4 th . The upgrade comes as an answer to two pressing issues – the threat of ASIC miners for the Equihash space and the spate of 51% attacks that have plagued Bitcoin Gold, Verge, and ZCash of late. The Threat of ASIC Miners\nBack in October 2017, Bitcoin Gold emerged as a hard fork of the main Bitcoin blockchain, taking place at block 491407. The forked network introduced an alteration to the hash algorithm which is used to mine Bitcoin. It rendered Bitcoin application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) useless.\nHowever, Bitmain has since introduced a new ASIC called Antminer Z9. It’s specifically designated to mine cryptocurrencies based on Bitcoin Gold’s underlying Equihash Proof-of-Work algorithm. To this, the team quickly responded :\nWe will not allow that to happen. ASIC-resistance is central to our mission.\nThe team will be carrying out upgrades over the existing Equihash algorithm, calling the newer version Equihash-BTG. In a nutshell, the solution is to adopt new parameters to the existing algorithm, requiring “dramatically” more memory for the ASIC to run and causing mining attempts to be “impossibly unprofitable.” Tackling 51% Attacks\nThe algorithm update, according to the team, has a secondary effect. Immediately after the fork, the new network is going to become a lot safer from 51% attacks. As it stands, Bitcoin Gold shares its algorithm with a lot of other coins. This suggests that the collective pool’s Equihash power is far greater than the one of BTG’s underlying network, making it easily susceptible to attacks of the kind.\nAccording to the team, as soon as the updated Proof of Work algorithm comes to light and Bitcoin Gold takes off on its own algorithm, the network’s hashpower won’t be large enough for someone to try and control.\nThe news must come as a relief to the BTG community, especially after the recent events. In late May, Bitcoin Gold’s network was subjected to 51% attack in which the hacker made off with $18 million in BTG tokens.\nThe team has noted that “most of the necessary components for the Network Upgrade have been coded, but need more thorough testing.” While there are no dates specified for the release, seven days’ notice will be given prior to the upgrade, according to the official statement.\nDo you think the planned changes will help the BTG circumvent the aforementioned issues or will they just temporary delay them?

Electronic sensor networks powered by the Internet of Things (IoT) are an untapped platform for deploying the next generation of blockchain technology, which stands to improve operating efficiency in numerous sectors, including manufacturing supply chains.\nThe key challenge to adopting blockchain technology on a large scale is adequately quantifying the costs and risks of deployment and ensuring security. Blockchains were first adopted in fintech, where products have short qualification cycles and are not safety critical. IoT networks can help to address these hurdles and extend blockchain technology to other sectors that require higher reliability. Authenticated Workflow Automation\nIn a blockchain-powered supply chain, real-time IoT sensors enable authenticated workflow automation through smart contracts — self-executing scripts that can be triggered by blockchain transactions.\nSmart contracts allow IoT sensor nodes to bypass the middle man (i.e., a central authentication server). To validate activity on the network, sensor nodes simply need to communicate with their nearest neighbors, which could then quickly authenticate new activities or transactions without connecting to a central server in the cloud or farther away in a private network.\nAs such, IoT blockchain networks accelerate data exchange in manufacturing supply chains, thus increasing operational efficiency and reducing system vulnerability. Energy and Security Challenges\nThe trade-off in operating efficiency versus the cost of energy and network maintenance deserves some attention. While a blockchain IoT network may reduce the number of bottlenecks in a supply chain, the cost of energy for each sensor to continuously validate transactions and update its copy of the distributed blockchain ledger is not a commonly published metric. Frequent blockchain updates also reduce the average sensor lifetime, thus increasing the frequency and cost of part replacement.\nThe security of IoT blockchain networks is also not well understood. Unlike a public cryptocurrency network (where most of the mining power is not controlled by any single user), the mining or validation pool in a private blockchain may be limited to the nodes in the network.\nAn intruder — with more computing power than 50 percent of the IoT nodes on the private network — could potentially hijack an entire private blockchain. By hashing faster than the rest of the network, the intruder has the luxury of deciding which new transactions are validated and added to the distributed ledger. This is commonly referred to as a “51 percent attack.”\nIn May 2018, such an attack was performed on the Bitcoin Gold network . A 51 percent attack on an IoT sensor network could result in supply chain delays, manufacturing defects, service outages and human safety concerns, to name a few. Platform Scalability Through Standards\nTechnical standards, such as those currently in development by the IEEE , could provide a framework for building scalable and secure IoT blockchain platforms. Such standards would ensure the interoperability of IoT blockchain devices from different vendors, with the goal of reducing costs and energy, while maximizing security and efficiency.\nAddressing the energy and security challenges of deploying IoT blockchain networks in manufacturing supply chains will allow us to better quantify the costs and risks. This will inevitably pave the way for future deployment in other sectors, such as healthcare, smart grid, shipping and transportation.\nThis is a guest post by Mario Milicevic, Ph.D. Views expressed are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Media or Bitcoin Magazine.

The fund will be physically-backed, which means it will hold actual Bitcoin, and will be insured against loss or theft of the cryptocurrency, according to the firms.\nThe SEC asked companies to pull about a dozen applications for cryptocurrency-linked products in January, and last year rejected the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF. SolidX and VanEck were among the companies who had filed to list funds. They hope to have addressed regulators’ concerns with changes they made in the new, joint request by increasing the share price and basing prices off regulated trading firms, according to SolidX Chief Executive Officer Daniel H. Gallancy.\n“Based on various comments, it seems that regulators are concerned right now about having an ETF that is available to retail investors,” Gallancy said in a telephone interview. “We think that will change over time, but right now a good place to start is with a product geared purely toward institutional investors.”\nHopes for a Bitcoin ETF were running high last year after the CME Group Inc. and Cboe Global Markets Inc. listed Bitcoin futures, as investors speculated the SEC might approve funds linked to financial instruments trading on major exchanges. But those expectations soured as regulators said they were concerned about the high volatility and lack of depth in the market, and about pricing and trading that would be based on lightly regulated platforms.\nSolidX and VanEck want to address these concerns by basing prices for the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust on an index that tracks over-the-counter trading by U.S.-based institutions, which are regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. MVIS, a subsidiary of New York-based VanEck, will compile the index and publish price updates throughout the day.\nVanEck oversees more than $45 billion in assets and manages more than 70 exchange-traded products. SolidX is a New York-based financial technology company, developing cryptography software and capital markets products.\nIf approved, the fund will have a share price of approximately $200,000, compared with most ETFs which launch with double-digit share price, to target institutional investors, Gallancy said. This would be a change from the focus in the ETF industry, which has traditionally been on individual investors.\nSolidX would handle custody of Bitcoin using a so-called cold storage solution, which means so-called private keys that serve as ownership codes are kept off line. Funds will be insured one-to-one by a syndicate of insurers, which the firms didn’t disclose.\nVanEck had previously filed a Bitcoin future-based ETF. A physically-backed Bitcoin ETF will be attractive as it tracks Bitcoin spot prices more closely, said the firm’s head, Jan van Eck.

Very quietly.\nThe financial firm, Susquehanna International Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, just outside Philadelphia, is one of the largest players in trading traditional investments like stocks , options and exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. Over the past two years, the privately owned company has also built up a trading desk of around a dozen people that buys and sells millions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin and other virtual or cryptocurrencies in private deals.\nNow the firm is opening trading to a small group of its 500 clients, with plans to expand.\nThe move is the latest sign that the virtual currency markets , which were once relegated to the fringes of the financial world, are being embraced by big, mainstream investors.\nThe parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, the Intercontinental Exchange, has been in talks about opening a subsidiary for cryptocurrency trading, and Goldman Sachs is on the verge of opening its own trading operation.\nBut Susquehanna, which has around 1,800 employees around the world, has a lot more money backing its trading desk — and a lot more ability to interact with clients — than the hedge funds and trading firms that have also been early participants in the virtual currency markets.\nThe arrival of big financial institutions has raised concerns among some bitcoin aficionados, who worry that it will harden bitcoin’s status as a speculative trading asset like gold and diminish hopes that it can be used in day-to-day transactions.\nNot so, said Bart Smith, the head of the digital asset group at Susquehanna. The firm believes bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies inspired by it are likely to have a wide array of uses, but for now, he said, bitcoin’s best bet is to challenge gold as a scarce commodity that can be moved around more easily.\nThe original bitcoin software determined that only 21 million bitcoin would ever be created. That cap isn’t expected to be hit until 2040, and the limited number of tokens currently in circulation has made the online currency appealing as a commodity.\nSmith said he could also imagine bitcoin, or some competitor, becoming a digital payment method for the internet — as Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, recently predicted — but he wasn’t too worried if that didn’t happen.\n“We believe that this technology and this asset class is going to change some facet of financial services, and we think it is going to exist forever,” he said.\nSusquehanna first experimented with trading bitcoin in 2014 after the investor twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss asked the firm about being involved with a bitcoin ETF that they had applied to regulators to create.\nRegulators eventually denied that application. But Susquehanna kept its one bitcoin trader on board, and then added a few more last year when the cryptocurrency markets took off.\nThe firm decided to step up its operation, and go out to clients, after seeing the success of bitcoin futures contracts, which were introduced by exchanges in Chicago late last year and have been growing in volume in recent months.\nSusquehanna will trade futures, which are contracts tied to the future price of bitcoin. It will also allow customers to buy and sell actual bitcoin and a few other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and bitcoin cash.\nTo make these available to customers, Susquehanna recently amended the broker dealer license it has on file with regulators. That change will allow the company to trade cryptocurrencies that are labeled by regulators as securities. Regulators in the United States have recently indicated that many newly created virtual currencies — although not bitcoin — should likely be categorized as securities and traded only by regulated entities.\nMost of the cryptocurrency exchanges where Susquehanna trades are largely unregulated. Bloomberg recently reported that U.S. authorities were investigating whether some traders were taking advantage of this to manipulate the price of bitcoin by posting lots of trades that they didn’t intend to complete.\nSmith said he had not seen clear evidence of manipulation, but cryptocurrency markets are still very immature compared with the other markets where Susquehanna trades, especially given the lack of regulations for many of the largest exchanges holding cryptocurrencies.\nHe said the single biggest problem for sophisticated investors was the security risk in holding virtual currencies. In other markets, Susquehanna doesn’t have actual custody of stocks or bonds.\nBitcoin was built so that users can hold and transfer their tokens with a password or private key that no one else knows. If the private key is compromised, a hacker can take the coins, and the owner has no way to get them back. That has led to big losses at several bitcoin exchanges.\nSusquehanna built its own systems for storing the cryptocurrencies it is holding for more than a day. To deter hackers, the private keys are kept in devices in an off-site facility that is not connected to the rest of the company’s computer systems.\n“There were no financial services firms out there two years ago that were storing and moving large amounts of cryptocurrencies, so there is no road map,” he said.\nThen there is the matter of trying to figure out on a daily basis what a single bitcoin or Ethereum token should be worth.\nThere is still little agreement on what factors traders should take account of when deciding on a value for cryptocurrencies, given that many of the expected uses for digital tokens are still hypothetical. While Smith’s teams look at the technical and security specifications of the coins, it is much harder to answer the most important question: Will they be used as something other than a digital commodity?\n“The value is: What do you think the best-case scenario of these different digital assets is in the future — and handicapping what is the percentage chance that they will get there,” he said.\n0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Why", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/why-this-firm-is-way-ahead-of-wall-street-on-bitcoin/articleshow/64476692.cms&title=Why"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nathaniel popper", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bala cynwyd", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intercontinental exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "susquehanna international group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T11:40:10.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "82949a07af5b7f93e99096940a0c335c674a215a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS2hgff5_T4eBtZjMbUCfnoQ-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "title_full": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "82949a07af5b7f93e99096940a0c335c674a215a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS2hgff5_T4eBtZjMbUCfnoQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn $10 free bitcoin in 5 minutes", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInvite new users and get 0.3 BTC!

Several companies, including VanEck, have tried unsuccessfully to launch bitcoin ETFs in the United States.\nVanEck first filed for an ETF based on bitcoin futures in August, but withdrew the application in September at the request of SEC staff since the futures didn’t exist yet. The company and several other firms filed again when bitcoin futures launched on CME and Cboe in December. But they had to withdraw those applications in January at the request of SEC staff.\nIn a letter that month, the commission raised concerns such as extreme price volatility and the ability for customers to withdraw funds easily.\nThe SEC did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment on Wednesday. Bitcoin traded near $7,500 on Wednesday, holding within the trading range of the last few months.\nSolidX has also struggled to launch a bitcoin ETF. In March 2017, the SEC rejected the company’s application for an exchange-traded product based on physical bitcoins. Around the same time, the commission also rejected, then said it would review, the Winklevoss twins’ proposal for a similar bitcoin fund.\nVanEck will help market the new bitcoin ETF, SolidX will sponsor or create the underlying index and Bank of New York Mellon will be the custodian, the filing said. If approved, the ETF is slated to trade under the symbol XBTC on Cboe BZX Exchange.\n“I believe that bitcoin has emerged as a legitimate investment option, as a type of ‘digital gold’ that may make sense for investors’ portfolios,” Jan van Eck, chief executive officer of VanEck, said in a statement.\n“A properly constructed physically-backed bitcoin ETF will be designed to provide exposure to the price of bitcoin, and an insurance component will help protect shareholders against the operational risks of sourcing and holding bitcoin,” he said.

The BCH Geek event was held on June 1-3 and firms like Bitmain Technologies, Viabtc, and BTC.top were in attendance. According to local reports and BCH-focused forums , the hackathon featured 100+ programmers who produced solid research, prototypes, and applications built using the BCH blockchain. The BCH Geek event was initiated by the blockchain video portal Chongqing TED.CC, and other members of the BCH community. BCH-Based Browser Plugins, an Authenticator, and a Quiz App\nThere were more than 11 teams who consisted of developers from firms like Viabtc, and students from Chongqing University. This week on Reddit, a BCH Geek attendee stated the hackathon resulted in a “satisfactory way,” while detailing the platforms created by a few of the top teams who participated in the event. Three teams mentioned in particular were the groups Mempool, Viabtc, and Gon. According to the report, Mempool created a URL-paying browser plug-in based on bitcoin cash which integrates with the HTTP and Status Code 402 protocol. Image credits: Cindy Daily\nViabtc developers designed a BCH-based authenticator that can store data and synchronize across multiple devices. The application does not require a server and authentication data can be restored easily. Another team called Gon designed an application called Token Dice which is a decentralized on-chain 1v1 quiz application based on BCH. The Token Dice programmers used the OP_Code , ‘ OP_DATASIGNVERIFY,’ to build the quiz platform. Another application featured was called ‘ IF Password’ a password management software (ifpass.cash) that is tethered to the BCH blockchain. Image credits: Cindy Daily New BCH Apps to Appear in the Wild Soon\nAttendees also heard from speakers such as Edward Liu, the co-founder of Bitkan, and Jiang Zhuoer, the founder of BTC.top, who talked about the innovation being built on top of the Bitcoin Cash network right now. The industry luminaries also spoke about currently built platforms like Memo , Blockpress , and Cointext that are providing the on-chain ‘killer apps’ once heralded a few years ago. The BCH Geek event ended with great success and it’s safe to say quite a few bitcoin cash-infused platforms demonstrated at the event in Hangzhou will be released into the wild shortly.\nWhat do you think about the BCH Geek event held in China this week?

The government pitted 28 cryptocurrencies against one another, declaring Ethereum as the top crypto on the scene right now.\nIn addition, President Xi Jinping recently called blockchain part of the “new industrial revolution.” It happened during a speech at the annual conference of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.\nThe country is backing blockchain in a major way, and will release national blockchain standards for companies by the end of next year.\nA new article in the Global Times , a daily Chinese newspaper published by the People’s Daily , China’s largest newspaper, is also praising cryptocurrency and pushing for change. “There’s an increasing belief that just saying no to Bitcoin won’t be the eventual solution to the cryptocurrency issue. A more fundamental approach would be to embrace the new technology without putting the country’s financial system at stake… But fencing off bitcoin exchanges can’t effectively end bitcoin trade, and fears of a bitcoin bubble could leave China behind in the digital currency revolution. Instead, the country should consider rules and regulations that can ensure the technological advance works in the economy’s favor.”\nSince announcing an all-out ban on cryptocurrency last year, China has forced crypto-to-fiat trading platforms to block Chinese citizens. The government has also shut down P2P and over-the-counter exchanges, and enforced a complete ban on ICOs. Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Whilst we can’t really work out where this progress is coming from just yet, it is pretty clear that Bitcoin Cash is racing ahead of the markets. This is of course catalysed by the overall positive market movements that we are seeing at the moment, overall though, Bitcoin Cash is flying above its neighbours.\nAt the time of writing, whilst Bitcoin , Ethereum and Ripple are all up 2.03%, 2.23% and 1.74% respectively, Bitcoin Cash is up 5.26%, coming in at a nice round value of $1,138.00. If this continues, we can expect to see Bitcoin Cash exceed $1,200.00 through this afternoon.\nDuring the mid-April market surge, the last bull run that saw prices drive, Bitcoin Cash managed to surge up by almost 200% in the space of just one month. Of course, since then Bitcoin Cash has retreated somewhat, however given its current good form, we should consider how another surge of that capacity would affect Bitcoin Cash now, given its far higher value.\nLet’s track back to April. At the start of the month, Bitcoin Cash came in at a value of around $606.59. Through the month and as a result of the mid-April market surge, we saw Bitcoin Cash move up and hit $1,818.63 by the start of May, increasing in value by over $1,000.00, and by just shy of 200%.\nWith speculation heating up surrounding the next bull run, and another market surge looming, we should consider how gains of a similar velocity will affect Bitcoin Cash this time round, considering that as it stands, its value is almost double the value that Bitcoin Cash started April at.\nSo, assuming another market surge does take hold soon enough, and assuming that when it does, Bitcoin Cash will sustain its current value, of around $1,138.00, a rise of 2005 (like last time) will see Bitcoin Cash reach $3,415.00. If this happens, Bitcoin Cash will finally be less than $1,000.00 shy of its current all time high of $4,091.70, as recorded on the 20 th of December 2017.\nOf course, there are two extraneous possibilities here. Firstly, Bitcoin Cash could even see a surge bigger than 200% across the month. Secondly, Bitcoin Cash may not see any such surge, nor will the markets, therefore, you should remember that these calculations are inspired by speculation.\nOverall, whilst a surge is expected, it is something we can’t truly predict, therefore, if you are looking to invest, you should do adequate prior research first off, to ensure you know what you are doing. Be aware of the risks… as you can see here, currencies like Bitcoin Cash do have the potential to rise and encourage big returns, overall though, the markets are volatile and truthfully, the above isn’t really guaranteed to happen.

Free Video\nWall Street continues to show a great interest in Bitcoin. Various firms are looking at the concept of introducing trading desks. One company, which has flown under most people’s radar, already took the plunge a while ago. Susquehanna International Group has built up a trading desk of a dozen people buying and selling cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is an Appealing Currency\nA lot of money can be made and lost with cryptocurrencies. The volatile nature of this industry makes it appealing to speculators and investors. It was a matter of time until the Wall Street big shots began dabbling in these currencies as well. So far, most of the major firms are still in the early process of developing these new options for their clients.\nThat is not the case for Susquehanna International Group. The firm is best-known for trading stocks, ETFs, and options. In that regard, it is not all that different from most Wall Street firms on the market today. What does make it unique is its position in the cryptocurrency trading industry. The privately owned firm has been buying and selling Bitcoin and other currencies through private deals for two years.\nExpanding this functionality will occur shortly. The company indicates they will expose 500 of its clients to cryptocurrency trading in the coming weeks. If successful, the venture will be expanded upon rather quickly. It is another sign of how cryptocurrencies are bound to go mainstream very soon. Moreover, it seems a matter of time until other financial institutions follow this lead by example. A Major Gamble by the Wall Street Firm\nTwo years ago, Bitcoin was not in the position it is right now. In fact, its value was a lot lower and far less attractive to Wall Street. Even so, this particular Wall Street firm saw merit in jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon at such an early stage. In hindsight, it seems to have been a very smart decision when it comes to Bitcoin.\nUnder the current circumstances, not everyone favors Wall Street getting involved in cryptocurrency trading. A lot of people wonder whether or not this will lead to even more speculation and price volatility. Susquehanna’s head of the digital asset group isn’t too concerned in this regard. In his opinion, Bitcoin is poised to challenge gold as a scarce commodity. Even so, Smith acknowledges the currency has a “wide array of uses”, but did not further specify which those may be.\nAll of this shows there is a bright future ahead for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. When Wall Street firms prepare to take the plunge on this industry, it is a matter of time until mainstream traction occurs. Even so, cryptocurrencies still have very few real-world use cases outside of speculation. Changing that will not be easy by any means. Future scaling solutions for Bitcoin and Ethereum may effectively speed up that change a lot sooner than people anticipate.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "susquehanna international group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T23:15:43.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eae86bd38361571ebc51bb06ce1fbbae0d1476f1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS5khQ4Mdf5OotkqEMHvV4LE-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "title_full": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eae86bd38361571ebc51bb06ce1fbbae0d1476f1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS5khQ4Mdf5OotkqEMHvV4LE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn FREE Bitcoin & Gold", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInvite new users and get 0.3 BTC!

We regulate the offering of that security, and we regulate the trading of that security.”When asked to make clear his statement on whether Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) are securities, Clayton told the interviewers, CNBC’s Bob Pisani, “Bob, I just did.”Clayton added that the SEC won’t support changing the definition of a security to support the ICO community, as they are not “going to do any violence to the traditional definition of a security which has worked well for a long time.”The SEC chair had previously praised distributed ledger tech, blockchain as an example, during February’s SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) cryptocurrency hearing. At the time, Clayton had noted that every ICO that the SEC had seen so far would be considered a security.Altcoins Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) have come up in the cryptocurrency security question, with Joseph Lubin of Ethereum emphatically denying that ETH was ever a security, and Ripple similarly rejecting a security classification.Ripple is now facing a class action lawsuit from a disgruntled investor claiming that the sale of XRP is the sale of an unregistered security, with a former SEC chair recently appointed to represent Ripple in court.

At the time of the interview, the average BTC transaction was 42 minutes according to Blockchain.info , while XRP transactions take approximately four seconds, although it worth pointing out that Bitcoin’s trading volume is far greater than that of XRP as well.\nHowever, Bitcoin’s transaction speeds are a result of the use of blockchain technology which has not yet been successfully scaled to allow for a wider user base. Ripple transactions are carried out natively on the Ripple protocol, not on a blockchain. Ripple still owns the majority of XRP. | Source: Shutterstock\nRipple is seeing successful adoption as a cross-border payment service with mainstream financial institutions, offering products that enable large transactions to be carried out across borders from one fiat currency to another in seconds, using XRP as a “bridge” asset.\nHe went on to say that the maximalist ideology of there being only one currency is not the way to go. “There’s some people in this, the crypto space, the blockchain space — for them, it’s almost a holy war of one versus the other. I don’t look at that at all,” he said.\nGarlinghouse said there would be “many winners” in the adoption of cryptocurrencies, and recently in a separate CNBC interview said that he expected Bitcoin’s influence on the price of the other currencies in the cryptocurrency market would soon weaken as people begin to explore other options.\n“I think that what we’re seeing is the overall growth of this space and there will be many winners,” he added.\nWhile Ripple as a company is a separate entity from the XRP currency, 60% of the XRP supply is owned by the company, much of it by the Ripple founders themselves. Ripple is being sued in a class-action lawsuit by a trader who lost money trading XRP and who now claims the company violated US securities law by selling the token to the company.\nFeatured image from Flickr/ Christopher Michel Follow us on Telegram .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://blockchain.info/charts/avg-confirmation-time?daysAverageString=7", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/30/bitcoins-influence-over-cryptocurrency-prices-could-end-soon-says-ripple-ceo.html", "https://hacked.com/continue-reading", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/05/ripple-ceo-bitcoin-is-not-the-panacea-people-thought.html", "https://telegram.me/ccncom"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brad garlinghouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garlinghouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amsterdam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "euorpe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T03:45:40.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "008a0245df4d6ae6fa7f86879a4adc422f2768a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9GpoK49ucKkRXWUnl5lOwQIvQFkSk6yAquYfodBRliOTrlU00tdMPDWrIwMmjg4ai7HlcuTLqqoHvRJitv1elEqEI4UEbtigTvktq8obCW0w--", "site_full": "www.bitcoin.name", "site": "bitcoin.name", "site_section": "http://www.bitcoin.name/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News", "title": "$1,999: GMO Reveals Details of Its New 7nm Bitcoin Miner", "title_full": "$1,999: GMO Reveals Details of Its New 7nm Bitcoin Miner", "published": "2018-06-06T02:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "008a0245df4d6ae6fa7f86879a4adc422f2768a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9GpoK49ucKkRXWUnl5lOwQIvQFkSk6yAquYfodBRliOTrlU00tdMPDWrIwMmjg4ai7HlcuTLqqoHvRJitv1elEqEI4UEbtigTvktq8obCW0w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "adminbtc", "published": "2018-06-06T02:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "$1,999: GMO Reveals Details of Its New 7nm Bitcoin Miner", "text": "Japanese IT giant GMO Internet has revealed prices and specs for its new-from-the-ground-up bitcoin miner – the world’s first based on a 7nm chip.

This was made possible through the efforts of FinTech startup Eligma.\nEligma has created a point of sale system known as Elipay. The system will be used across the shopping complex, which is coincidentally named BTC City as the company who owned it was named BTC Company.\nMiro Cerar, the prime minister of Slovenia, recently visited the complex and was bought a ‘crypto coffee’ by his State Secretary, Tadej Slapnick. The coffee was bought using the Elipay service. On the project, he stated:\n“[It is] a business and shopping ecosystem based on the latest technological solutions including blockchain, AI, and cryptocurrencies.”\nThe city was founded in 1954 as a warehouse and logistics enterprise, and as more buildings were added by BTC Company, it was repurposed in 1990.\nThe repurpose resulted in its conversion to a shopping complex, which then grew to include Slovenia’s tallest building, a casino, a sports complex, a multiplex, and a hotel. It has over 500 buildings and describes itself as the most popular “European business, shopping and recreational/leisure and culture centre”.\nThe Elipay system is installed in the water park and stores such as Al Capone, Babadu, Big Bang, istyle, Martino, and Sneakers. The complex also boasts of Slovenia’s “biggest mining rig”.\nEligma said:\n“The purpose of his visit was to open the Beyond 4.0 international conference, dedicated to digital society and blockchain, as well as to get acquainted with BTC City’s strategy to become Bitcoin City.”\nReddit user btcinvesteringalex said:\n“How did I not read about this by now.

All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. Transactions – private keys A transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the block chain. Bitcoin wallets keep a secret piece of data called a private key or seed, which is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody once it has been issued. All transactions are broadcast between users and usually begin to be confirmed by the network in the following 10 minutes, through a process called mining. Processing – mining Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm waiting transactions by including them in the block chain. It enforces a chronological order in the block chain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be packed in a block that fits very strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all following blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively in the block chain. This way, no individuals can control what is included in the block chain or replace parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends. “\nBuying and Selling Bitcoin\nBitcoin can be bought or sold on the following cryptocurrency exchanges: Korbit, BtcTrade.im, Exmo, Binance, Bithumb, BCEX, IDAX, CoinEgg, HitBTC, GOPAX, C2CX, B2BX, BitBay, Ethfinex, Cobinhood, Neraex, Coinhub, Upbit, Coinroom, Bitfinex, OEX, YoBit, CoinBene, Tidex, Kucoin, Bitbank, Sistemkoin, Trade By Trade, Livecoin, BitForex, Bit-Z, Paribu, Fatbtc, Simex, Bibox, DragonEX, Gate.io, Bitstamp, Kraken, Luno, Lbank, Coinrail, xBTCe, OKEx, OOOBTC, LakeBTC, Exrates, bitFlyer, RightBTC, Octaex, BTCBOX, Huobi, CoinTiger, Negocie Coins, Bittrex, Iquant, BTCC, itBit, Poloniex, Quoine, CoinsBank, TOPBTC, CEX.IO, Coinone, CoinEx Market, OTCBTC, Zaif, GDAX, fex, ZB.COM, Gemini, Coinsuper, Omicrex, Fisco, EXX, Bitinka, WEX, Hotbit and BitMEX.

The businessman was summoned at the ED's office here and was asked questions about the purported links of the alleged main accused of the case Amit Baardwaj with his businesses. They said Kundra was questioned for over nine hours and his statement was recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Coming out from the agency's office, Kundra told waiting reporters that he was called as a \"witness\" in the case as Bhardwaj, the alleged kingpin of the case, was unsuccessful in investing in a poker league promoted by him. Officials added that Kundra's statement would be that of a witness in the case. Kundra soon tweeted to reiterate his statement. \"Dear Media thanks for your breaking news across the country. I have given you all bytes outside the ED office where I was called as a witness to give evidence. \"The accused (Amit Bhardwaj) was to buy a team in my league which didn't happen due to non payment. Thank you,\" he said. Officials said they had come across these links and hence Kundra, Chairman of Viaan Industries, was asked to depose and record his statement. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had registered a criminal case under the PMLA against bitcoin-based investment website GainBitcoin, its founder Amit Bhardwaj and eight others. It is alleged that about 8,000 investors lost about Rs 2,000 crore funds by transacting in this scheme. The ED had filed its case based on an FIR of the Maharashtra Police in this case and the Pune Police arrested Bhardwaj and his brother Vivek from Delhi in April. Bhardwaj reportedly was behind ventures such as GainBitcoin, GBMiners, MCAP and GB21, and the investors were allegedly duped after transactions on these portals. The central agency has expanded its probe into this case and is also investigating related bitcoin or cryptocurrency transactions that are under the scanner of other departments. It is alleged that Bhardwaj and his associates allegedly duped investors to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore in Mumbai, Pune , Nanded, Kolhapur and other places in the state. Last year, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had informed Parliament that there were no regulations governing virtual currencies in India and the RBI had not given any licence to any entity/company to operate such currencies.

Although the cryptocurrency reversed some of its losses over the last few days of the month, there has been a notable reduction in total transaction volume across exchanges. Adjusting our forecast for transaction volumes in our interactive Bitcoin Price Estimator now leads to a year-end price target of around $12,500 – down from our earlier estimate of $15,000. The graphic below captures our base case forecast for the monthly average price of a Bitcoin this year based on our estimates for transaction volume and number of Bitcoin users, and also shows a possible price range for cryptocurrency taking into account a relatively bullish as well as bearish outlook for the rest of the year.\nTrefis\nUnderstanding What Drove The Price Fluctuations Over Recent Months\nThe global cryptocurrency industry has seen a flurry of new developments since December. Many of these developments had a negative impact on the growth prospects of cryptocurrencies, like restrictions by banks on the use of credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies, and calls by financial regulators across the world for caution while investing in digital currencies (with some countries even banning their use). This sent cryptocurrencies sliding in value from the all-time highs seen in mid-December 2017, as demonstrated by the slump in Bitcoin’s price from almost $20,000 then to below $6,000 in early February.\nHowever, Bitcoin prices saw a sharp recovery over April and May, primarily because the traditional financial industry began warming up to cryptocurrencies. While Goldman Sachs became the first investment bank to start a cryptocurrency trading desk, IntercontinentalExchange (which owns the NYSE) reported its ongoing work on a new trading platform that will allow institutional investors to buy and hold cryptocurrencies. As this points to increased adoption of cryptocurrencies in the near future, the good news propelled Bitcoin prices higher.\nBut Bitcoin prices hit a hurdle in May due to erstwhile cryptocurrency leader Mt. Gox dumping more than 8,200 Bitcoins on existing exchanges – an event that dragged down prices sharply. Mt. Gox had also dumped more than 40,000 Bitcoins in early March (which had also resulted in a crash in Bitcoin prices). More importantly, as the Mt. Gox trustee has set a target of disposing of roughly 200,000 Bitcoins as a part of bankruptcy proceedings, more such sales are expected over coming months – something that will drag down Bitcoin prices on several occasions in the near future.\nWe believe this expectation has kept Bitcoin investors wary over recent months, and explains the sharp decline in monthly trading activity for Bitcoin from $914 million in March 2018 to just $429 million in May 2018. While we expect trading volumes to increase steadily going forward thanks to an increase in the number of Bitcoin users, the growth rate is likely to be slower than what we forecast earlier this year.\nTrefis\nWhat Does This Mean For Bitcoin’s Price?\nLike the price for anything, Bitcoin’s fundamental price depends primarily on two things: demand and supply, i.e. how many people want it vs. what is available. Demand for Bitcoin is primarily driven by two factors: the number of active users, and how much they transact. On the supply side, the number of available Bitcoins is capped, and about 80% of the capped number is already mined. As such, it is sensible to focus on the demand, both in terms of users and transaction volumes. In our interactive Bitcoin Price Estimator , we forecast changes in the number of unique users as well as transaction volumes for each month over the rest of 2018 to arrive at our estimate for Bitcoin’s fundamental value.\nAs we detailed above, we expect both these metrics to grow steadily over coming months – albeit at a slower rate than what we forecast earlier. As a result, we believe that Bitcoin is poised to settle around $12,500 by the end of the year as opposed to our original estimate of $15,000.\nThis video shows how to leverage our bitcoin pricing dashboard.

Trillions of dollars circulate through the global financial system every day in transactions that impact billions of people. In January 2018 an average of $1.8 trillion was traded daily in the foreign exchange market alone. These transactions are an attractive target for fraud and theft. Forty-five percent of financial intermediaries, including stock exchanges, money transfer services and payment networks report being the victim of an economic crime. Blockchain addresses these vulnerabilities through a peer-to-peer transaction process driven by distributed networks.\nLeveraging networks to power commerce The technology that enables entities to directly transact value without a trusted third party was originally developed to support bitcoin. A blockchain is a shared, distributed ledger that records transactions through a secure, verifiable process that does not flow through an intermediary. By leveraging the combined computing power of a distributed network, it manages all of the verifying, contracting, settling and record-keeping tasks that are the basis of all forms of commerce. For the first time in modern history, two or more parties can build or exchange value independent of institutions like banks, government bureaucracies and rating agencies. Though initially utilized to trade cryptocurrencies, blockchain can record the transaction of anything that has been assigned value.\nBlockchain exists as a shared database distributed across a public or private network of computers. A network uses its combined computing power to continuously reconcile data so that the shared ledger of transactions is updated and audited frequently. Secure, direct exchanges make blockchain ideal for trusted transactions. Individuals or businesses can utilize it to transfer intangible values such as equities, currencies, votes, patents or copyrights, as well as tangible property such as gold, real estate, pharmaceuticals or commodities.\nReshaping business models Emerging network-based business models are poised to transform the financial services industry. For example, consider the process for trading an equity on blockchain. The buyer initiates an order to purchase shares of stock at a particular price. This transaction is grouped with other transactions and represented digitally as a \"block\" that is broadcast to every user on the network. The network utilizes known algorithms to validate the data in that block, including verifying the buyer's status and the trade. Then the block transfers the title of the securities from the seller to the buyer. Once the transaction has been validated, it is added to the blockchain, and the updated blockchain is distributed to the network and utilized for future verifications.\nThese same principles also apply to larger transactions such as how companies access growth capital. When companies seek investment through traditional channels, they initially pursue angel investors, then target venture capital and may ultimately issue an initial public offering (IPO). These stages rely on multiple intermediaries, including exchange operators, investment bankers and lawyers. Blockchain upends this process by enabling companies of any size to raise money through a peer-to-peer global distributed share offering. Many companies have already utilized this new funding mechanism, called an initial coin offering (ICO). In 2017 startups raised $5.6 billion in ICOs and nearly a third of that funding was generated for blockchain infrastructure projects.\nRevolutionizing financial services Executing trades via blockchain disrupts today's exchanges by making transactions faster, more secure and less costly for clients. Many of these advantages can be attributed to the transparent, self-auditing transaction process that eliminates the need for middle men like clearing agencies and custodians. Streamlined trade validation enables a near real-time transfer of assets.\nNetwork-based business models also offer strategic benefits for brokers. With the ability to establish and implement identity verification rules, blockchain facilitates compliance with know-your-client regulations. Blockchain technology increases efficiency by enabling the coding of simple contracts that automatically execute when the conditions are met. Perhaps most importantly, utilizing a distributed ledger reduces vulnerability to cybercrime.\nMany firms recognize these solutions as an opportunity to reduce friction and costs and are investing accordingly. According to a 2017 PwC survey, 36 percent of financial services firms plan to make a substantial investment in blockchain technology in the next three years. The digital revolution has already begun, and blockchain is shaping a new landscape in the financial services industry.\nSecurities and Advisory services offered through LPL Financial, a registered investment advisor.

He told his employees he will consider his options, including public service and philanthropy. A Political History\nSchultz in 2017 said his company would hire 10,000 refugees in a five-year period after Trump announced an executive order to block refugees from some Muslim majority nations. He told his employees the next month that Trump caused chaos for the U.S. economy.\nHe also criticized a Republican tax plan last year which Congress passed in December. At the DealBook Conference in November, he claimed Trump wanted to cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, the profit of which he said would not help small businesses or the half of the people in the country who don’t have $400 in the bank for a crisis.\nSchultz gave $10,800 to Hillary Clinton’s joint fundraising committee with the Democratic Party in 2016. This year, he gave $1,250 to Washington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell’s campaign, and $5,000 to VoteVets, a progressive political organization.\nAlso read: Starbucks could serve up a blockhain payments app Opposed To Bitcoin, But Not All Digital Currency\nSchultz earlier this year said bitcoin is not a legitimate currency , but said a digital currency could play a key role in a cashless future. He said distributed ledger technology could be used beyond cryptocurrency. Schultz said he thinks a future digital currency could have legitimacy and trust.\nHe also said Starbucks was not planning to introduce its own digital currency, as Burger King Russia and Kodak have done.\nIn February, Schultz said a proprietary digital technology could be integrated into Starbucks’ mobile app.\nIf rumors of his planned presidential run do prove to be true, the blockchain industry will have much to keep an eye on.\nFeatured Image from US Marine Corps Follow us on Telegram .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://hacked.com/continue-reading", "https://telegram.me/ccncom", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/howard-schultz-became-a-player-in-politics-while-he-was-at-starbucks.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anti-bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pro-blockchain howard schultz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schultz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "howard schultz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pro-blockchain howard schultz to exit starbucks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "starbucks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T03:45:42.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5835fefc86ab4944f206c11c4139377523f6e53c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkgz6eTlVHKdmK77vMTDWx0Fv5Ia5LOr40CmssZleNmSdwSrzxgWCNAG5cw8sv4J6CKvXAuTjbZu_Oja8OylI70Ly_wNqXZ_vGHkZ6LM9m2w--", "site_full": "bitcoinwarrior.net", "site": "bitcoinwarrior.net", "site_section": "http://bitcoinwarrior.net/feed/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Cash [BCH] adoption grows with its popularity", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash [BCH] adoption grows with its popularity", "published": "2018-06-06T01:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5835fefc86ab4944f206c11c4139377523f6e53c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRkgz6eTlVHKdmK77vMTDWx0Fv5Ia5LOr40CmssZleNmSdwSrzxgWCNAG5cw8sv4J6CKvXAuTjbZu_Oja8OylI70Ly_wNqXZ_vGHkZ6LM9m2w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin Warrior", "published": "2018-06-06T01:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash [BCH] adoption grows with its popularity", "text": "Bitcoin Cash [BCH] adoption grows with its popularity Jun 6, 2018\nBitcoin Cash [BCH] hard forked off the Bitcoin blockchain on August 1st, 2017.

This is because the Bitcoin Cash community believes their blockchain operates much more closely to what Satoshi envisioned at Bitcoin’s advent.\nLow transaction fees, ‘on-chain’ scaling, a reliable payment network-this is what Bitcoin was supposed to do, but the Bitcoin Core developers strayed from these ideals, and Bitcoin Cash was born. Over the recent months, many projects have chosen the Bitcoin Cash technology to build their platform on.\nBlockpress is a social media application in its beta phase that works on the BCH blockchain and uses IPFS. The IPFS, just like Twitter, users can set an avatar, add their names and set cover photos. Each action costs a microtransaction of BCH.\nEach user has something like a ‘handle’. This is their BCH wallet address, and there is also a QR code, so one can send [BCH] to specific people.\nNishant Sharma, @nishantsharma87, replying to BlockPress App beta launch announcement, said,\n” Great work!

Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The value of currencies may fluctuate and investors may lose all or more than their original investments. Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The leveraged nature of FX trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds and such may work against you as well as for you.

Its graphical user interface allows it to trade with counterparties electronically in a way that leaves a clear audit trail and records, rather than via phones or Skype. The development shows the company is seriously exploring the crypto market and is a sign that market is maturing. Cryptocurrencies are viewed by many of their evangelists as one of the most groundbreaking financial innovations of the modern age. But the way crypto trades looks like something out of an old-school Wall Street flick.\nFor the most part, trading firms are making multimillion-dollar crypto trades over the phone, not electronically. DRW's crypto arm, Cumberland, uses Skype calls to conduct its bitcoin dealmaking, Reuters reported .\nBut Jump Trading, the Chicago-based firm, has built a platform that will allow it to take the other side of large crypto trades electronically with its counterparties, according to people familiar with the matter. The so-called graphical user interface allows those counterparties to interact with Jump on a desktop. It does not allow users to connect to external trading exchanges.\nJump is known for its ultra-high-speed trading strategies, but it has also been developing what it calls a \" lower frequency trading strategy .\" It's also known for its discretion, with little information on the firm available on its website .\nThe new platform shows that Jump is taking the new market for cryptocurrencies seriously, according to a person familiar with the firm's thinking. Also, the firm believes that voice and chatroom environments don't leave a clear audit trail, the person said.\nJump Capital, the venture-capital firm affiliated with Jump Trading, has made crypto a focus for 2018, as previously reported by Business Insider .\n\"GUIs are not unique,\" Michael Dunworth, the CEO of Wyre, a blockchain tech company, told Business Insider. \"But it is impressive that Jump built it.\"\nThe move shows the cryptocurrency market is maturing in a similar way to the now multitrillion-dollar foreign-exchange market, which in its earliest days saw trades conducted mostly over the phone, says John Spallanzani, a former FX trader at Sumitomo Mitsui who is now a portfolio manager at Miller Value Partners.\n\"We used to call 20 banks at once for spot FX prices,\" Spallanzani said of forex trading in the 1990s.\n\"It's without a doubt maturing just by the fact that there's so many OTC desks out in the mix,\" Dunworth added.\nThe crypto exchange Kraken set up an OTC desk in New York, Business Insider first reported . There's also Genesis Global Trading and itBit, the OTC run by Paxos.\nAt the same time, crypto-focused investment funds are opening up at a record pace, according to new research by Crypto Fund Research. Sixty-one new funds have launched in 2018, according to the firm's research, bringing the total number above 366 globally. Such funds together manage only a paltry $5 billion, however, a fraction of the $3.2 trillion managed by the hedge fund industry.\nSEE ALSO:& A stock exchange behemoth is quietly powering crypto markets across the world\nJoin the conversation about this story »\nNOW WATCH: Millennials are leading an investment revolution — here's what makes their generation different", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?a=zaFyI_aDVOg:88CwMGIXuDo:7Q72WNTAKBA", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo", "http://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-are-driving-a-huge-shift-in-the-way-we-shop-and-invest-2018-5", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?a=zaFyI_aDVOg:88CwMGIXuDo:bcOpcFrp8Mo", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?i=zaFyI_aDVOg:88CwMGIXuDo:gIN9vFwOqvQ", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?a=zaFyI_aDVOg:88CwMGIXuDo:cGdyc7Q-1BI", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?a=zaFyI_aDVOg:88CwMGIXuDo:qj6IDK7rITs", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?d=QXVau8BzmBE", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?i=zaFyI_aDVOg:88CwMGIXuDo:V_sGLiPBpWU", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?d=cGdyc7Q-1BI", "http://www.businessinsider.com/jump-trading-is-making-crypto-a-big-focus-2018-4", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-otc/otc-crypto-market-flourishes-powered-by-skype-idUSKCN1H91P4", "http://www.jumptrading.com/apply.html?gh_jid=564222", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider/~4/zaFyI_aDVOg", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?a=zaFyI_aDVOg:88CwMGIXuDo:V_sGLiPBpWU", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?d=qj6IDK7rITs", "http://www.jumptrading.com/", "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider/~3/zaFyI_aDVOg/a-secretive-chicago-trading-firm-has-built-a-bitcoin-platform-that-shows-crypto-is-shaking-off-its-scrappy-roots-2018-6", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?a=zaFyI_aDVOg:88CwMGIXuDo:QXVau8BzmBE", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?a=zaFyI_aDVOg:88CwMGIXuDo:yIl2AUoC8zA", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?d=7Q72WNTAKBA", "http://www.businessinsider.com/a-secretive-chicago-trading-firm-has-built-a-bitcoin-platform-that-shows-crypto-is-shaking-off-its-scrappy-roots-2018-6#comments", "http://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-veteran-leaves-credit-suisse-for-crypto-trading-desk-2018-4", "http://www.businessinsider.com/a-stock-exchange-behemoth-is-powering-crypto-markets-across-the-world-2018-6", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider?a=zaFyI_aDVOg:88CwMGIXuDo:gIN9vFwOqvQ"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "skype", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cumberland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T17:53:09.001+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 29008, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=3200", "requestsLeft": 630}
