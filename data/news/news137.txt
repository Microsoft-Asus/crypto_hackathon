This means that, at any given moment, BCH is vulnerable to 51 percent attacks from four of the top five mining pools hashing on the BTC mainnet. What’s worse, BCH adjusts difficulty every few hours (on a one-day moving average). This means a Verge-style “time warp attack” could be easy to execute on the smaller network.Also see: Cryptocurrency Stunt Involving Mt. Everest Goes Terribly Wrong No Chain (With Fast Retargeting) Is Safe Verge, Bitcoin Gold, Monacoin — all have been attacked recently for millions of dollars in value. These increasingly common “black swan” events shine a light on just how badly small chains can be broken, if developers haven’t put enough thought towards security.A 51 percent attack is bad enough, but if you have a fast retargeting algorithm, like Verge (or Bitcoin Cash) it makes the potential fallout even worse. A bad actor with a significant amount of hash power can drop the mining difficulty on your chain to such a low level that they can mine blocks close to instantly.One of the most commonly voiced concerns in the BCH community is bad actors attacking their network in support of Bitcoin. That paranoia may be justified: if any one of the larger Bitcoin mining pools wanted to coordinate an attack, they could pose a credible threat to the entire BCH network.Image via Coin Dance Bitcoin Cash is Uniquely Vulnerable, Good Solutions Hard to Find Solving this problem in BCH is a double-edged sword: the reason the Bitcoin Cash difficulty adjustment was changed in the first place was because miners could just jump on and off in coordinated intervals, to maximize profits. As a side effect, this caused massive disruptions of the network during the “off” periods.There are some steps the Bitcoin Cash developers could take that would legitimately protect against time warp and 51 percent attacks (the same goes for other smaller networks. The problem, though, is that most of them would be hard pills to swallow for the community.Explicit merged mining would probably be the most sensible, but a perception that BCH is dependent on Bitcoin for security would be damaging to its brand. The other immediate option would be to fork to another algorithm with less ASIC support, but all its current mining support comes from people heavily invested in Bitcoin ASICs, and it risks alienating those mining pools.If the Bitcoin Cash devs care about securing the future of BCH, the community is going to have to take stock and get its priorities in order.Do mining pools and their incentives present a clear and present danger to BCH and smaller networks?

This marks a $100 spike from yesterday’s price, though that, in turn, marked a $100 fall from 48 hours ago, when bitcoin had previously been trading for $7,500. Thus, while bitcoin’s new position is a move in the right direction, it’s hardly something to get super excited about.\nPreviously, the currency had broken key support levels in the $7,000 range, but while the bears still have primary control, sentiment does suggest that this is only temporary, and that one uptrend is all that’s really needed for the bulls to step in and take the reins.\nOne of the reasons behind bitcoin’s latest price drop may stem from India . The country isn’t exactly known for being entirely friendly towards crypto (the RBI has already banned banks from working with companies that deal in bitcoin and digital assets), but now, the government is considering an 18 percent goods and services tax (GST) on cryptocurrency trading.\nA new report is being considered by India’s Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs. A hearing is set to take place on July 20; until then, all courts in India are barred from hosting any case related to the matter.\nIndia seems to have a solid grip on cryptocurrencies. Back when the RBI first announced its ban on bitcoin business-bank relationships, the asset took the first of several nasty falls that would ultimately bring it down to the $6,000 range, where it hovered for quite some time. Now that recovery has begun, it appears India is once again stepping into the mix and enforcing its power. Bitcoin just can’t seem to catch a break…\nHowever, one source suggests that the long-winded price bends of the last few weeks (or months, considering bitcoin’s high of $19,000 in December) may finally be coming to an end . A new theory suggests that many institutional investors bought stakes in bitcoin just before the launch of bitcoin futures. Futures trading – which many now believe may have been the cause for bitcoin’s subsequent price drops – allowed these holders to short their coins with ease. From there, fake-out dumps, failed rallies and major price dumps could occur accordingly.\nThe theory was suggested in a series of tweets by a cryptocurrency community known as the Crypto Fam. Analysts in the group suggest that the bears’ hold on bitcoin may be coming to an end relatively soon, as institutional bitcoin holders’ stashes are starting to run short.\n“The bear market is running out of gas,” the researchers said. “This is a very simplified explanation of how markets work. A great deal of the total BTC supply is not traded. Some is lost forever in idle or forgotten wallets, while other bitcoins are hodled by strong hands who never sell. This gives [market markers] greater power with their share of BTC.”\nThe researchers further claim that despite falling to $6,000 in March, bitcoin has ultimately failed to test new lows, and suggest that rallies to $10,000 and $12,000 could occur sooner than investors anticipate.\nFull details at themerkle.com/bitcoin-price-watch-currency-spikes-up-to-7500/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T04:02:17.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9a3141a6a828aebcd2f08e185ebce6aba0b871aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS08wGL2bUPp5CX2xvMBVuBs-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "title_full": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "published": "2018-05-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9a3141a6a828aebcd2f08e185ebce6aba0b871aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS08wGL2bUPp5CX2xvMBVuBs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\n Become a part of a huge mining pool!

By Telegram\nAccording to Revolut’s blog , in December 2017, the European company launched a cryptocurrency option that “would allow our customers to instantly buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies at the touch of a button” with no exchanges, cold storage or private keys.\nWhile they began with Bitcoin , Litecoin , and Ether, on May 24, 2018, they’ve introduced the option to instantly exchange “any of our 25 supported fiat currency directly into XRP and BCH.” 🤩 The wait is over. You can now buy, hold and sell #XRP and #BCH instantly with Revolut. 🚀 https://t.co/WgvhpdEoTP\n— Revolut (@RevolutApp) May 24, 2018 Advertisement\nAs reported by TechCrunch , Revolut is currently working with Bitstamp to process the cryptocurrency transactions. For cryptocurrency transactions, the fintech startup charges a 1.5 percent transaction fee. They currently have approximately 100,000 cryptocurrency transactions every day.\nWhile Revolut allows consumers to purchase, hold, and sell cryptocurrencies on the app, there are however certain limitations with the app. Users cannot receive or send cryptocurrencies from their Revolut account. Furthermore, while the option to purchase is available, if users decide to transfer the tokens, they will have to convert it to fiat currencies and purchase cryptocurrencies on another exchange. Revolut’s customers are highly supportive of cryptocurrencies\nAlthough Revolut is a mobile banking company, their userbase is very supportive of cryptocurrencies. As reported by Forbes , about 20 percent of their 400,000 users have undergone cryptocurrency trades ever since December 2017, when the cryptocurrency option launched on the app.\nHowever, when Revolut introduced cryptocurrency trading , the company also saw a significant increase in its customer base with 500,000 new members joining, taking the fintech company’s total customer base to 1.5 million.\n“We’ve been asking the Revolut community which cryptocurrencies they would like to see next, and the demand for both XRP and Bitcoin Cash has been absolutely overwhelming,” said Vlad Yatsenko, chief technology officer of Revolut.\nThe fintech startup also mentioned that Revolut decided to expand their cryptocurrency options to include Bitcoin Cash and Ripple because “other major cryptocurrency exchanges are yet to support these digital currencies, ” said Yatsenko.\nRevolut’s goal is to eventually replace existing bank accounts. While their vision may appear ambitious, they currently process $1.8 billion in transactions every month. Revolut introduces a new feature called Vaults\nRevolut has also introduced a new feature known as Vaults. Vaults were designed to encourage users to save more money over time.\nThe idea is to round up any spare change from users when they undergo a transaction. For example, when a user purchases $4.35 for a hamburger, they’d save 65 cents in their vault. Users also have the option to multiply the amount and can even set up recurring payments on specific schedules. For example, users can set aside some money per day, per week, or once per month with the ability to choose the type of currency that enters the vault.\nWhile users do not earn interest in the vault, it’s a smart way to encourage saving. Users can also close the vault account whenever they choose to.\nThe fintech-based startup may have established only a few years ago in July 2015. However, they’ve already processed 60 million transactions hitting a total transaction volume of $15 billion. It’s, therefore, no surprise that Forbes named the 3-year-old company as “Europe’s fastest growing so-called Unicorn.”\nFollow us on Twitter | Telegram | Facebook Featured Image from Shutterstock.

One of the bigger upcoming developments is the Lightning Network. Over the past few months, thousands of new payment channels have been established, signalling a major step in the right direction toward mass adoption of this new technology. The Lightning Network Payment Channels\nScaling Bitcoin to offer instant and cheap transactions requires major developments. This code upgrade is known as the Lightning Network . It allows users to open direct payment channels between one another on a global scale. Doing so requires the necessary network participation. Without sufficient support, the Lightning Network will not make any meaningful impact.\nEarlier this year, things did not look all that promising. Just 89 channels existed on January 19th. To some people, it showed how this scaling solution is unfeasible. Others considered it to be a lack of adoption because the technology is still not finished. Instead, it is being tested under open beta rules and caution remains advised at all times.\nFast forward to a few days ago, and the number of channels has grown significantly. As of May 24th, over 6,600 direct connections exist. It is still a drop in the proverbial bucket when looking at the financial sector. However, it also confirms there is genuine interest in this technology. Scaling Bitcoin will remain an ongoing process for some time to come. These numbers may look very different a year from today. Looking Ahead\nEven though this growth is impressive, not everyone is convinced. Until the Lightning Network technology is fully developed, adoption will remain relatively low. Various important aspects still need to be implemented. There is no double-sided funding, no watching for offline transfers, and so forth.\nAll of these issues will – hopefully – be addressed by the developers in the future. Most small and traditional purchases do not necessarily require all of those advanced features. However, the current implementation of the Lightning Network will not necessarily suit everyone. Giving users a lot of different options will remain one of the top priorities.\nAfter nearly nine years of development, it seems things are finally looking up for Bitcoin. Scalability has always been the Achilles heel of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. The Lightning Network may not solve all of the problems in one go. With constant updates and refinements, it will eventually turn into a global payment ecosystem. That is, if enough people embrace this new technology for everyday purposes.

This follows a lawsuit that was filed by a local cryptocurrency exchange which argued that the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe did not have any authority to declare cryptocurrencies illegal. On the 12th of May, Zimbabwe’s financial services regulator, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), issued a directive to all financial institutions to stop all forms of transactions related to cryptocurrencies and to wind down all accounts tied to cryptocurrencies within 60 days.This was followed a few days later by an order to all cryptocurrency exchanges in the country to shut down their operations. Zimbabwe’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Golix, submitted an urgent High Court challenge contesting the RBZ’s actions. Through its lawyers, Golix argued that, as a regulator, the RBZ was not authorized to place any prohibition on cryptocurrencies.Despite Zimbabweans’ significant interest in virtual currencies, they are not recognized as official, legal tender in the country, and there has also been no legal and regulatory framework set up for cryptocurrencies. The decision suspends the ban and will allow Golix and other cryptocurrency exchanges to resume operations. The victory will likely bolster Zimbabweans’ confidence in the country’s cryptocurrency space, which already enjoys a notable amount of activity.

Scott, CEO of Outlier Solutions , moderated a panel of experts that spoke about the energy issue as part of a discussion on the topic of proof of work (PoW) vs. proof of stake (PoS).\nScott told Bitcoin Magazine that there was a lot of discussion at the conference about the new energy report in part due to the attention it’s currently receiving in the press.\n“This is an area where there is a spectacular amount of FUD [fear, uncertainty and doubt],” she noted. “This is in part because it’s a nuanced issue that can’t be summed up in simple statements about net energy consumption.\n“I think that part of the reason that Bitcoin has been a ‘target’ in this respect is that there are relatively straightforward calculations in terms of power consumption in conjunction with the underlying value not being well understood or widely accepted. For instance, few people question the utility costs of a bank or ATM, and the energy consumption cannot be calculated in a straightforward way,” she added.\nScott Howard, CEO and co-founder of Toronto-based ePIC Blockchain Technologies , told the conference audience what many there were already saying: that the energy consumption issue is “fake news” and has been oversimplified to suit Bitcoin opponents. High Energy and Environmental Costs of Traditional Fiat and Banking\nTraditional banking and fiat creation have their own high energy costs, noted a number of conference panelists, including Alex Petrov, CIO of Bitfury ; Jan Čapek, CEO of Slush Pool ; Samson Mow, CSO of Blockstream ; and Howard.\nThey talked about the high infrastructure costs, in terms of both energy and the environment, associated with traditional banking systems, including ATMs, security and servers.\n“There are 3.6 million ATMs deployed in the U.S. Each of them are using 7 to 800 watts just in standby mode,” said Petrov. “This alone generates huge numbers of electricity usage, slightly higher than the Bitcoin network.\n“If you add … internal banking systems, CTVs, communicating with other banks, additional protection … you get higher costs than the cost of Bitcoin,” he added.\n“Gold mining consumes enormous energy. Portions of the electricity crypto mining consumes come from power generation and distribution originally built to supply ore and precious metals extraction or processing,” said Howard.\n“Where traditional energy consumers like gold mines really fall down is all the other negative externalities of the ‘wealth’ they create. Gold mining during and after is one of the most toxic and destructive operations on the planet.”\nHoward talked about the use of abandoned industrial sites for Bitcoin mining, like pulp and paper mills that had been closed due to dwindling forestry supplies and increased concerns about energy use and toxic waste pollution.\n“Lots of crypto mines are sitting in old industrial sites with a 100-megawatt transformer sitting next to them,” he said.\nBy way of example, in the Q&A session that followed the panel, one conference participant talked about his mining operation in British Columbia in a partly abandoned manufacturing site where water is pumped through his mine for cooling and then recycled into a warm-water fish farm. Mining Doesn’t Create New Hydro Infrastructure: Power Is Produced Even If Unused\nAfter the panel, Howard reiterated to Bitcoin Magazine what other conference panelists had said: that large energy mega-projects like hydro dams produce electricity whether they’re used or not.\n“To my knowledge, no one has built out any net-new power generation to supply a crypto mine. Power generation stations are major pieces of infrastructure that take years to put in place and in the range of a decade to pay off. Most power generation is done, certainly in the western world, by publicly owned and/or regulated utilities. Those stations run 24/7, 365 for decades. The energy goes onto the grid no matter what and, until we figure out storage, is a perishable commodity.\n“Crypto mining takes full advantage of this, typically sucking up energy at very low prices. The prices are low because the energy can’t find more productive use, often taking over abandoned industrial sites far away from urban centers,” he added.\nČapek told the conference that “China has been overinvesting in hydro power and has large amounts of power that is not being used” as a result of overbuilding hydro dams in anticipation of industrial needs (principally aluminum manufacturing) that never materialized.\n“Cheap hydro power has helped China dominate the world’s Bitcoin mining business, and this power would be generated with or without Bitcoin mining,” said Čapek, who recommended a recently released study on the energy costs of mining in China.\nČapek said a rough estimate of global Bitcoin mining energy use is 25 terawatt hours per year, only a fraction of the amount of energy used in manufacturing aluminum globally. PoW vs. PoS\nThe panelists mostly agreed that proof of work’s higher energy use is necessary for real security and that proof of stake is not likely to happen soon. They noted that PoS would not give the Bitcoin network the security it needs, even if it was more energy efficient.\n“The more energy that’s expended, the more security you have,” noted Mow. “The system has to be nuclear-proof.”\nPetrov defended the possibility of a hybrid model of both PoW and PoS, saying, “Proof of stake may work for some specific purposes, not necessarily in the financial area but inside private blockchains.”\nMow responded that using both PoS and PoW “brings out the worst of both worlds,” while Howard noted that Dash is using a hybrid model with some success, though it’s very expensive to use.\nHoward concluded: “It [Bitcoin mining] is a positive economic activity, typically in places where it is needed, as well as meaningful revenue to the utilities which are major employers and usually profit centers for governments. The ‘waste of energy’ argument, like most establishment arguments against blockchains, does not pass the test of science.”\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .

Bitcoins and Basset Hounds\nLast weekend, Patricia Howell lost her basset hound, Happy. She quickly took to local online forums and in-town pet communities, posting pictures of the dog and her telephone number while asking people to call her right away if they had seen him.\nWithin a few days, she received a text message from a burner phone demanding $600 in Bitcoin or else Happy would be sold off or even killed. The scammer claimed to be using a burner phone, supposedly so that the call couldn’t be traced, and advised Howell not to go to the police.\nThe only issue was Howell had been reunited with Happy earlier that day thanks to the help of someone who had seen the online post. Apparently, the scammer had found her personal phone number from the lost dog advertisements.\nHowell immediately recognized it as a scam as she could literally see her dog. She reported the call to the police, who said that they had heard of similar cases from around the country. Fake Threats Becoming Common\nAnother North Carolina resident and his duo of dogs also fell victim to the same scam. After posting his information on websites that look to help people find lost dogs, he received an all-too-similar text message from a burner phone, demanding approximately $2,000 in Bitcoin or his dogs would be killed in less than ten days. Like the case with Howell, the dogs were already back with the owner before the text message was sent out.\nIt seems scammers are hoping that the attachment that owners have for their pets will convince them to pay up. Not to mention the ease of Bitcoin transactions along with the lack of actually having to physically receive any ransom demand. In the end, Howell says it best when she states:\nThey need to find a better way to make money. They need to leave people alone and realize that what they’re doing is hurtful and so cruel.

The strategy game was created by two cryptocurrency investors who were tired of hearing about people doing unbelievable things like selling their home or using their student loan money to go ‘all in’ on a portfolio of digital assets.\nAlso read: Project to Build Satoshi Statue Gains Support in Kiev Win Big or Lose it All Playin ‘Bitcon’\nTwo guys named Brandon and Sam who call themselves the ‘two stupid investors,’ created a tabletop card game that replicates cryptocurrency investing called ‘Bitcon.’ Basically, players are dealt a hand of five cards each and players draw cards in sequence to find out if the market goes up or down, or maybe even collapse. Alongside cards that move the market, there are also other action cards like the ‘Reverse the Market’ card which changes the direction of the current market trend. There’s also the ‘Cash Out’ card which can enable a player to cash out and cause the next player to pick up the remaining cards. Moreover, each deck of Bitcon cards has three ‘Pop’ cards — a card that serves as market collapse warning and when the last card is used the bitcoin market crashes and the game ends.\nThe two creators who designed the Bitcon card game say they kept hearing about individuals doing wild and unbelievable things to obtain bitcoin. Then soon scouring Reddit forums and social media their game concept became an amusing simulation showcasing the risks and rewards tied to cryptocurrency investments.\n“If you like fast-paced strategy games, laugh at people that sold their house to buy bitcoin, or simply want to show grandma how to lose all your cash online,” explains the creators of Bitcon.\nBuy Bitcon — You’ll soon be addicted to losing all your money. A Representation of What it Feels Like Riding Markets Up and Down\nThe Bitcon creators say they wanted to create a game that allows the “ thrills of being a big money investor with zero risks.” According to the Kickstarter campaign, a Bitcon strategy tournament can be roughly fifteen minutes of gameplay.\n“Bitcon is our perfect representation of what it feels like riding markets up and down, using strategy to protect yourself but also attack opponents, and be ready to cash out your position before your investment is fully lost,”\nIts 15 minutes of pure strategy, pace, and gambling. Betting addicts we’ve found you a solution .\nBitcon is not the first Kickstarter card game campaign featuring a bitcoin-esque theme as news.Bitcoin.com reported on Bitcoin Empire back in January of 2017. The game featured many cryptocurrency luminaries within the industry and even a Pepe the frog playing card.

One of the bigger upcoming developments is the Lightning Network. Over the past few months, thousands of new payment channels have been established, signalling a major step in the right direction toward mass adoption of this new technology. The Lightning Network Payment Channels\nScaling Bitcoin to offer instant and cheap transactions requires major developments. This code upgrade is known as the Lightning Network . It allows users to open direct payment channels between one another on a global scale. Doing so requires the necessary network participation. Without sufficient support, the Lightning Network will not make any meaningful impact.\nEarlier this year, things did not look all that promising. Just 89 channels existed on January 19th. To some people, it showed how this scaling solution is unfeasible. Others considered it to be a lack of adoption because the technology is still not finished. Instead, it is being tested under open beta rules and caution remains advised at all times.\nFast forward to a few days ago, and the number of channels has grown significantly. As of May 24th, over 6,600 direct connections exist. It is still a drop in the proverbial bucket when looking at the financial sector. However, it also confirms there is genuine interest in this technology. Scaling Bitcoin will remain an ongoing process for some time to come. These numbers may look very different a year from today. Looking Ahead\nEven though this growth is impressive, not everyone is convinced. Until the Lightning Network technology is fully developed, adoption will remain relatively low. Various important aspects still need to be implemented. There is no double-sided funding, no watching for offline transfers, and so forth.\nAll of these issues will – hopefully – be addressed by the developers in the future. Most small and traditional purchases do not necessarily require all of those advanced features. However, the current implementation of the Lightning Network will not necessarily suit everyone. Giving users a lot of different options will remain one of the top priorities.\nAfter nearly nine years of development, it seems things are finally looking up for Bitcoin. Scalability has always been the Achilles heel of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. The Lightning Network may not solve all of the problems in one go. With constant updates and refinements, it will eventually turn into a global payment ecosystem. That is, if enough people embrace this new technology for everyday purposes.

Market Overview\n‘Rumour has it Bitcoin won’t see 10k anymore’ would serve as a suitable alteration to the chorus of Adele’s mega-hit, ‘Rumour Has It.’ It’s obvious that for the time being, bears are in full control of bitcoin price but this time it’s a little bit harder to discern the source of BTC’s recent turmoil.\nCould it be one of the following? Lingering effects of the Mt. Gox sell off? Simmering scandal from the Upbit and Bithumb investigations? Or perhaps it’s the whales on the run phenomenon as Bitfinex requested client tax and social security information to comply with federal SEC regulations?\nThose partial to conspiracies might be willing to entertain theories of institutional investors and whales manipulating prices to buy near the bottom before flooding crypto markets with cash and bringing on the greatest pump 2018 will ever see.\nWhatever the reason(s), Bitcoin is currently stuck in the mud, and it appears likely to continue languishing as the expected purchasing appetite just isn’t present right now. Daily Chart The RSI has struggled to stay out of bearish territory (above 50) and a pattern of lower highs and lower lows continues as BTC slipped below the downward channel and is down nearly 15% over the last seven days. Notice that the RSI is not oversold (above 30) which supports the possibility of further price decline and in the event of a deep sell-off, BTC could drop below lower leg of the triangle. At the time of writing, the 5-day MA sits below the 10-day MA and both are sloping downward indicating further short-term decline. Last week the concern was whether BTC would dip below the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level whereas this week there is the possibility of a full retrace back to the April low near $6,425. 4HR Chart The 4-hour chart shows the 20-day MA well below the 50-day MA as both trend downward. At the moment, BTC is nowhere near crossing the 50-day MA at $7,969 and remains far away from the recent high (May 21) at $8,644. Notice that the Stochastic oscillator approaches overbought territory, yet BTC price continues to decline, opening the door for deep loses in BTC price as there is plenty of room for the oscillator to fall in the event of a sell-off. At the time of writing the RSI is flattening while remaining near bearish territory which is indicative of further decline (see the direction of moving averages) but it is possible that BTC could continue trading sideways for the short term until buyers, sellers or some breaking news event impacts BTC price. Alas, all is not lost in the world of cryptocurrency. In a recent Twitter post, The Crypto Fam make a strong case that this current bear reversal will end near $7,000 and purchasing appetite for BTC will return as whales, small investors and institutional investors return to purchase BTC near the bottom. Vision BTC is nearing a full retrace to the April April low near $6,425. Panic selling below $7,000 could open the doors for price decline below the lowest support at $6,000 A full retrace to $6,425 could signal the completion of the current bear reversal. BTC needs to close above the 50-day MA at $7,969 and sustained price gains above the upper descending channel ($8,050) would indicate that the current correction has ended.\nAs highlighted by The Crypto Fam , each leg down in the bear market since December 2017 has have shown reductions in selling volume and the price drops less extreme. They have interpreted this as an indication that the bear market is running out of steam as bears, whales, and market makers have reduced their BTC holdings and will be prepared to purchase aggressively once the cryptocurrency reaches a bottom.\nTheir charts, along with the daily chart in this article show a bottom somewhere between $6,000 – $6,800.\nTraders are advised to watch from the sidelines as most technical indicators show bears having the advantage but aggressive investors could consider purchasing when the 20 and 50-day MA reverse and maintain upward momentum on the 4-hour chart.\nAt current prices, longs could take positions starting at $7,300 (and probably below) as Bitcoin has been range bound between $6,000 to $12,200 since February 2018.\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in this article are not intended as investment advice.

Out of the total number of taxpayers with miscellaneous income of 100 million yen or more, excluding public pension, 60% of them reported income from crypto transactions.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Declaring Crypto Income\nThe Japanese National Tax Agency announced on Friday the number of people with 100 million yen (~US$914,000) or more miscellaneous income that includes income from cryptocurrency transactions, according to local media. Nikkei elaborated:\nIt is the first time that the agency announced the result of the counting of virtual currency related declarations.\nThe tax agency revealed that 21.98 million people filed income tax for the year 2017. Last year, “The number of taxpayers with miscellaneous incomes of 100 million yen and over from sources other than public pensions jumped from the previous year’s 238 to 549,” according to Jiji Press. Of these 549 people, more than 60% or 331 of them “gained income from cryptocurrency transactions,” the news outlet conveyed.\nThe “total income [reported for all taxpayers] was 41.4988 trillion yen [~$379 billion] (up 3.4% from the previous year),” the Sankei Shimbun detailed, noting that the “declared tax payments amounted to 3.0207 trillion yen [~$28 billion] (a 4.6% increase), which was the highest in 10 years.”\nAccording to Nikkei, tax reporting of crypto transactions is challenging because each crypto exchange reports transaction data differently. According to industry stakeholders, some exchanges do not separate purchase and sale transactions and “there may be upper limits on the number of transaction records that can be acquired,” the publication added. 55% Tax Possible\nThe National Tax Agency released guidance on how cryptocurrency profits are taxed in December last year. “In Japan, profits from cryptocurrency trading are categorized as miscellaneous income,” Jiji Press explained. The Japan Times described:\nIf you earn ¥200,000 [~$1,828] or more from cryptocurrency trading, you must pay tax.\nThere are seven tax brackets based on taxable income. Those earning 1.95 million yen (~$17,823) or less are taxed at 5 percent, the news outlet described, adding that the highest tax rate is 45 percent for taxpayers who earn more than 40 million yen (~$365,600). However, the publication pointed out that “your income is also subject to a residential tax of 10 percent. Together, the maximum tax rate is 55 percent.”\nWhat do you think of how Japan taxes crypto transactions?

Rooting out Bad Actors in ICO Market\nFerguson’s comments were said at a seminar recently held by the Bank of England, where he shared his support for Bitcoin, but spoke out against the associated, often unregulated fundraising method of ICOs.\n“I wish I had a Bitcoin for every phony white paper I’ve been shown the last six months, by people trying to raise money before the SEC clamps down,” Ferguson, a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, said according to Quartz . “When there’s no regulation, then the rogues are very quickly on the scene.”\nICOs have been increasingly making headlines — especially following the astronomic rise in the value of cryptocurrencies that was seen toward the end of 2017. Just last week, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) released an analysis of the fundraising method , but Ferguson believes the organization might just be scratching the surface. ICO Red Flags\nTo research the industry, the WSJ combed the white papers — documents outlining the specifics of a company’s ICO — of 1,450 ICOs, finding 271 ‘red flags.’ These red flags include things like celebrity endorsements, promises of exceptionally high returns, and (false) claims of regulatory compliance.\nOf the projects that the WSJ singled out as suspicious, most were uncovered because of plagiarized texts, images of team members and/or investors taken from stock photography banks. In 111 cases, entire sections of company white papers were simply copied and pasted from competitors websites.\nEven more scary is that, put together, the 271 ICOs identified as having red flags they have garnered a combined sum of over $1 billion from investors. This is according to a review of company statements and online transaction records performed by the WSJ. Regulators Strike Back\nWhile some of the projects are still raising money, others have shut down or have been frozen by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), the federal regulatory authority that has been tasked with investigating ICOs and other potentially fraudulent activities in the cryptocurrency space.\nThese moves by U.S. regulators come less than a week after the SEC created their own fake ICO website , which was developed in attempts to show potential investors the obvious signs of ICO scams.\nOn the site , HoweyCoin — which takes its name from the 1946 four-part Howey test, created to determine what qualifies as a security — is presented as a way to invest in the luxury travel market. But it’s all a ruse, created to show potential investors just how easy it can be to fall victim to such scams.\nThe WSJ is not alone in its scrutiny of ICOs. In fact, other reports signal even deeper problems in the market. For example, according to news organization Izvestia, who cited the Russian Association of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain, half of the $300 million raised by ICOs in Russia in 2017 were pyramid schemes.\nAnother source, Bloomberg’s Matt Levine, was asked what the percentage of ICO fraud is, to which he answered: ‘Somewhere north of 50?’\nWhile the numbers here are clearly hard to properly grasp, and although they may vary, they’re still indicative of a large problem. Moving forward, if regulators want retail investors to stop being scammed by unregulated schemes, they have to demonstrate the value of oversight, promote fairness, and emphasize the common adage that if something seems too good to be true, then it probably is.

He talked about this prediction in his guide and stands by it.\nEarlier, on 23rd May, he introduced his imaginative and prescient for digital governments primarily based on blockchain know-how in a gap keynote speech on the GovTech Pioneers Conference.\nHe defined this imaginative and prescient for the long run, when it comes to Healthcare:\n“Insurance, healthcare, and the real estate industry are offering a terribly poor service and need a lot of money. Governments that burn a lot of money for the worst service feel that first.”\nHe caught to his prediction that Bitcoin will soar to $250,000 by 2022. In the Next Web convention, he spoke concerning the potential in know-how concerning the banks and enterprise capital. He spoke about his hopes about cryptocurrency, the brand new world order, and his bullish beliefs concerning the token, Bitcoin [BTC].\nHe additionally believes that fiat foreign money will lose its worth, he mentioned:\n“So, you’ll go in and try to buy coffee with fiat and the barista will laugh at you.. Because there is so much more friction with fiat currency than there is with cryptocurrency. And I think you’ll be able to buy it with Bitcoin, Ether, or Bitcoin Cash.”\nIn 2014, he made a purchase order of 30,000 BTC when it was buying and selling at $650 at a public public sale.

It walled off capital from fleeing the system.\nAnd the response was a group of folks applied the teachings of Austrian Economics and Ludwig von Mises’ Regression Theorem to create a digital asset which became less resistant to fraud the more it was adopted.\nThe result was Bitcoin.\nBitcoin was a catastrophic mutation. A thing born out of necessity to free human beings from a central issuing authority of new monetary units. That relationship needs to be broken if we are going to free ourselves from the cycle of tyranny of the few at the expense of the many.\nThis isn’t to say that Bitcoin itself is the end of the story. No, in fact, it’s simply the beginning of the next story in human development. But it shows us where we are headed. What Goes Around …\nThe ebb and flow of the human generational cycle and its relationship to natural cycles is at the heart of the economic cycle with its booms and busts. They create the interplay of how the rate of wealth generation proceeds.\nIt’s not possible to end the business cycle, like the Utopian Marxists and their economic brethren the Keynesians believe.\nThe business cycle is tied to forces far beyond the control of any one person.\nThe central control of money is an accelerant of both sides of the economic cycle, the boom and the bust.\nExcess credit creation, an inevitability during boom times, without underlying assets pull forward production from the future. It does this by cheating the slower formation of capital through industry and savings.\nThe risk associated with that credit is almost certain to be under-priced via the loan’s interest rate because the lender didn’t earn the money it is lending.\nThe result is a high probability that the loan will not be repaid as the project was unsupported by the pool of real savings within the economy. Gene Callahan’s excellent book, “ Economics for Real People ” covers this brilliantly in the first few chapters.\nExcess credit creation thanks to the imperfect knowledge of all economic actors accelerates the boom and exacerbates the subsequent bust as the credit money is destroyed and the assets it was supporting fall in price. Misaligned Incentives\nCentralized money issuers have a vested interest in selling more monetary units. Because they make their wealth on the arbitrage between the price of what they buy now versus the higher price later.\nThey institutionalize the underpricing of capital risk by issuing money at lower interest rates than the economy can support. The result is a shift of the demand for money farther out in time because the most interest rate sensitive projects are the most capital intensive with the longest time horizons to completion.\nThis not only subsidizes uneconomic capital spending building roads to ghost cities but also crowds out investment in the projects the society actually needed because that capital was bid away from those projects.\nOnce the pool of real savings is exhausted because borrowers can’t generate enough revenue to cover the cost of the loans the whole system starts to collapse. Borrowers miss payments, the banks get caught short of cash and liquidations and bankruptcies rise.\nThe banks are leveraged up, having lent up to ten times the amount of money they have in their ‘vaults.’ Once the borrowers stop paying, the savers have to be paid their part of the interest on the loan and the bank runs out of cash.\nWelcome to a bank run. The Lobster Trap\nInflation is the result of more money chasing the same number of goods. And prices are a reflection of the knowledge of the two participants in the transaction. There is a mismatch between the two if there is a central issuer of new currency.\nFor example, say I’m a central banker who whips up $1000 for my weekly lunch tab. I know that $1000 will inflate prices later. New money gets spent at today’s prices because the restaurant owner doesn’t know where the money came from.\nHe just knows business is good and that I buy the most expensive lunches he offers. This gives him the false signal to up the price of that dish, say lobster. He knows he can then outbid his competition for lobsters, driving up the price.\nI’ll always pay the new, higher market price for the lobster.\nBecause why the heck not? I’m printing money out of ‘thin air’ and sticking taxpayers with the bill.\nThis form of income, unearned through honest labor, is called rent.\nAnd so on. With each transaction the new money raises prices along the way. The closer you are to the issuer of the new currency, the more of the total arbitrage between the original price and the final higher price you receive.\nThis is why wealth inequality is accelerating in the Age of Central Banking at an exponential rate.\nAs the central banker pay off Congress, the banks, the lawyers, the media and everyone else with my new money first to ensure I can continue foisting the costs of my life off on the taxpayers.\nThe old system was simply debasing the coinage by cutting down the amount of gold or silver in the coins. The modern system is to issue new money units as debt against someone else’s labor, i.e. the taxpayers.\nBitcoin and the blockchain say nuts to all that. They say new money units should be divorced from human desires and their capacity for corruption. Let’s have math govern that and let the humans figure out how to earn wealth through the system itself. Tying Risk Down\nSovereign consumers are always looking for ways to grind out arbitrage by bidding as little as possible for what they buy. Enforcers of control are always looking to earn rent by keeping prices higher than consumers want.\nBankers love inflation, consumers love deflation.\nBitcoin, alongside gold, is the ultimate weapon against the rent-seekers because its supply is not governed by humans. This small difference changes everything. There is certainty as to what the supply of money will be tomorrow or next week.\nAnd as such demand for it can be more predictably forecast by market actors. There is no guess work as to what the central bankers are going to do at the next meeting. There are no gonzo gold deposits that could radically change the supply of it on the horizon.\nWhile market forces guide the hands of the central bankers and the gold miners to some extent, nothing is changing how many Bitcoins will be available tomorrow. Yes, there is loss due to attrition and small, uneconomical balances lying around in wallets all over the world. But, there is a known maximum of coins, governed by math, that removes the human element from money creation.\nAnd because of that eventually Bitcoin, or some other suitable cryptocurrency or basket thereof, will form the reserve asset pool against which all other assets are measured. Because that stability of supply and its growth will grind out opportunities to collect rent created by the uncertainty and unfairness of the current system.\nIt simply costs too much to regulate dollars, euros, etc. Those lowered costs will now be passed to consumers who retain ownership over the value of their money.\nBitcoin returns sovereignty back to the consumer, the rights-holder, which is exactly where it belongs. It distributes (in theory) the ownership of the transaction network and pays them to maintain it. Consumers are the ones who have money to convert into goods. They should be the sole arbiters of their money’s exchange rate, not a President, Board of Directors or Banker.\nIf the market needs more money in the short term it will create it. Banks can issue credit based on its Bitcoin balances. But, they will be constrained in how they do this because no Federal Reserve stands behind them ready to bail them out.\nSo, be good at risk assessment or be driven out of business.\nHard forks and other blockchains can create new cheaper currency units and keep the owners of the older network honest through competition and potentially better service, e.g. Bitcoin Cash, Zcash, Litecoin, etc. And So it Begins…\nAnd that’s why consumers will over time choose to do business in cryptocurrencies over debt-based ones. The value of their money is based on the operational excellence of the owners of the network not the needs of corrupt bankers and politicians.\nThe miners/witnesses/notaries update and improve it to meet consumers’ needs rather than sitting behind a wall of laws and dictating that inflation is too low and dumping a bunch of euros on the market, devaluing your wages and your savings.\nThe costs of paying the network operators will be regulated by the market far more efficiently than the current system. And those cost advantages will translate up and down the financial services industry to steal market share from traditional banks over time.\nThat arbitrage is what is fueling the growth of the cryptocurrency markets now. We’ll still see all the same things that happen today happen in a world governed by cryptocurrencies – bank runs, bad loans, too much or little credit, etc.\nBut all of those things will not be institutionalized and protected by laws. They will be isolated and far better contained as long as they are allowed to develop as companies free from government interference. The discipline of a crowded market will inspire innovation in risk management.\nAs we approach the moment in history when the confidence we have in central banks will be tested to the extreme, the timing of cryptocurrency adolescence couldn’t be better. When the monetary system seizes up and people look for new solutions the ‘cryptos’ will be there to keep things flowing.\nThose that are have cryptos in their portfolio of assets now are holding them as savings, hedging against this very risk. And in the process they are becoming their own central bank holding reserves to protect their wealth unwittingly ushering in the inevitable.\n* * *\nTo support more work like this and get access to exclusive commentary, stock picks and analysis tailored to your needs, join my more than 100 Patrons on Patreon and see if I have what it takes to help you navigate a world going slowly mad.

With the crash of the market in 2009, digital currencies started showing up as an alternative. They are meant to function without central banks or any kind of regulatory bodies backing them up. There are no money as we know it but they are stored on the computers more specific in a digital wallet or on your cloud. Of course, this means that they can be used in all kinds of transactions. One of the crypto currencies that catches the eye is certainly Bitcoin. The not so sudden interest and attention directed to bitcoin, contributed to its phenomenal rise and the wish of the people to invest more and more in digital currencies. Bitcoin has broken the records this year growing to more than $13.000 for one Bitcoin (December 6th, 2017). From people talking about it…To people investing in it…And ultimately, governments regulating it – Bitcoin has surged with a 1000% growth in 2017 alone. Now, if you are asking yourself if this trend is going to continue, it’s best to read our blog and see the potential growth of Bitcoin and the records it could achieve. Good luck!

By \"group\" I am referring to an estimated 1.6 billion Muslims of the world, or 23% of the world's population according to the December 2012 Global Religious Landscape report from the Pew Research Center’s Forum on Religion & Public Life. Due to the core belief of Muslims that Islam is a complete code for life, its followers look up to the teachings and laws of Sharia and live their lives accordingly. As stated by the Library of Congress, \"In its Islamic context, Sharia may be defined as the totality of God’s commands and exhortations, intended to regulate all aspects of human conduct and guide believers on the path of eternal salvation\". The primary sources of Shariah are the Koran and the Hadith. Muslims generally believe that Koran is the word of God transmitted to Prophet Muhammad, and Hadith is the collection consisting of the deeds and sayings of Muhammad. These texts hold the same value in expressing the divine will of God.If a Muslim today wants to invest, or be involved in Bitcoin, the information available to them mainly depends on the route they take. A practicing Muslim with an inquiring mind may have to go through several loops, to find a reasonable argument, before reaching a conclusion. An argument, no matter how balanced, has to have its origins from within the proposed Islamic Finance Model as described by the Shar'iah. Considering the fact that there is no hierarchy in Islam, common law rulings and scholarly interpretations known as 'Fatwas' act an interpretation of the Sharia and its text. There's a Fatwa on Bitcoin which you can read here . Dr Monzer Kahf explains his understanding of Bitcoin from the Sharia angle, in the first paragraph of the Fatwa. He argues, \"Like any other currency it is money within its community and exchanging it with other currencies is definitely subject, in my opinion, to [the] same conditions of exchanging currencies\" Professor Monzer reaches a conclusion that Bitcoin is just like any other FIAT currency, and is subjected to the same scrutiny. He goes on to clarify, \" no leverages and no futures\" adding, \" no speculation\" The aforementioned Fatwa talks about one of the broad principles adhering to Islamic Finance, known as Qimar (speculation). Along with strict prohibition on Maysir (gambling) and Riba (interest), Islamic finance closed the window on conventional debt-based instruments. It is a consensual belief of Islamic scholars and jurists that a system like this would prevent unfairness and exploitation. However, the main criticism in the Bitcoin Fatwa revolves around the manipulation of a currency in closed circles, which he suspects Bitcoin is a victim of. There have allegations of several Bitcoin exchanges faking trade volume in the last year, and market manipulation.By imposing these rules, preventing the use of conventional financial instruments, Islamic Finance then offers different ways of conducting financial transactions for service providers. Basic instruments like cost-plus markup financing (murabaha), profit-sharing (mudarabah), leasing (ijarah), partnership (musharakah), and forward sale (bai' salam) allow a range of other financial services to be built upon permitted instruments. This suggests that there is a lot of room for financial innovation among the Islamic financial markets.\nWith regard to Bitcoin's compatibility with Islamic Finance, an expertise in both these areas is required to reach a conclusion. Jan Bergstra, a Dutch computer-scientist with an inkling towards Islamic finance gave a presentation at the start of 2014. In his presentation, he classifies Bitcoin as \"a money-like informational commodity (MLIC)\" and then goes further to point out that \"Bitcoin, both in its design and in its development, contributes to the understanding of the concept money.\"\nDue to the open and decentralized nature of Bitcoin, Jan argues that ownership and access of Bitcoin as an MLIC can easily be identified and accessed - hence, Riba (interest) on Bitcoin assets is not plausible. Jan also outlined five basic principles of Islamic Finance which constitute the basic requirements for compliance. Among those five principles, he argued that a Bitcoin-like system doesn't adhere to only one requirement; prohibition of gambling.\nHis viewpoint on the mining mechanism indicates a process similar to a lottery, where the entity with the most resources has the highest probability of winning. This interpretation is based on personal opinion and is open for discussion. Apart from the technical tone of his research, it would serve as good resource for anyone looking clarity on this matter.However, in the process of examining literature on Islamic finance, it must not be forgotten that Fiqh. or Islamic law, is a process rather than a strict code. The differences between several legal schools of thought must be utilized to resolve a problem at hand in light of modern circumstances rather than obstructing the way to progress.Both Islamic finance and Bitcoin contribute to the ongoing development of unconventional financial methodologies, both are in contrast to the so-called Western financial system. In a way, it wouldn't be unfair to conclude that they have a mutual opponent. If Bitcoin is to really become the future of money, as its proponents suggest, it would certainly be interesting to watch its evolution from an Islamic point of view.\n- Originally published Dec 2014 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "javed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prophet muhammad", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pew research center’s forum on religion & public life", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "library of congress", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T16:41:59.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "17f369fa9db8c27743fe777516a9b0e259852fac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSFD_7QAGYb4VeM0xlXva_Z7bplaXlxrOsEYa7xFhnlNLOdqUSy2dvR5XeCP6N5FD34fMGLn7RIhAITu9pJSDB._ydAmDl.b88y5gB.dEIBUA--", "site_full": "crypto.directpath.club", "site": "directpath.club", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Technical Analysis (May 26, 2018) | Direct Path CryptoCurrency", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Technical Analysis (May 26, 2018) | Direct Path CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "17f369fa9db8c27743fe777516a9b0e259852fac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSFD_7QAGYb4VeM0xlXva_Z7bplaXlxrOsEYa7xFhnlNLOdqUSy2dvR5XeCP6N5FD34fMGLn7RIhAITu9pJSDB._ydAmDl.b88y5gB.dEIBUA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Technical Analysis (May 26, 2018) | Direct Path CryptoCurrency", "text": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Technical Analysis (May 26, 2018) Posted on May 26, 2018 by admin in Uncategorized // 0 Comments\nFundamentals and development of Bitcoin Cash is not a problem. The issue we all have is the failure of price,-value-to reflect the effort of the community. Not only do we have a robust network that can scale and settle transactions faster, there is wide adoption of the coin from different payment providers and merchants. As it is, Bitcoin Cash is down 14 percent for the week and two percent in the last 24 hours but these metrics would widen should there be a dip past $930 or May 24 lows. Today’s price action is therefore important in my view. From the News A cryptocurrency would be useless if there it has no real user case encouraging retail or corporate adoption. This is why behemoths like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple for example are driving hard selling their products to the masses. Bitcoin Cash is doing the same and few days after forking, Revolut is listing BCH as a tradable asset or investment to their customers. In essence, the London based payment provider is making it possible for customers to integrate their fiat banking details and link it directly to their Revolut card. This way, their users would enjoy instant fiat-crypto transfer via Bitstamp who charges 1.5 percent transaction fees via a simple dash board. Going forward, Bitcoin Cash would be an option for buyers and it’s not a speculation or ifs because whenever a coin is available to the masses, market capitalization and liquidity follow suits. We expect the same to happen to Bitcoin Cash in the days to come. Thousands of miles away, there is good news for Bitcoin Cash supporters in Colombia. Bitek might turn out to be their gate-away. As a payment provider, merchants spread throughout Colombia can now receive payment in Bitcoin Cash and convert them to Pesos should they want to liquidate. This is not the first such service as it is similar to what BitPay is doing. Services like these protect merchants from price volatility as they can sell their BCH stash anytime and get their Pesos in an instant. To facilitate this, Bitek will use BCH-Pesos approximates from local cryptocurrency exchanges and Bittrex. It’s official! We accept #Litecoin #BitcoinCash and #Dash and of course continue to take #Bitcoin ! Help us spread the word #cryptocurrency fans! https://t.co/WJG9GdW1sq — CheapAir ✈ (@CheapAir) May 22, 2018 On daily user case front, Cheap Air now accepts payment in Bitcoin Cash and a host of other currencies including Litecoin and Dogecoin. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Technical Analysis Weekly Chart Bitcoin Cash Weekly Chart by Trading View Before this week, many enthusiasts thought Bitcoin Cash hard fork would jolt prices to higher levels as buy pressure flow back to the market. Disappointingly, that was not and hasn’t been the case considering price action this week. What we are seeing is sellers pushing prices and printing new lows as days pass. In the last seven days for example, Bitcoin Cash was the third worst performer in the top 10 after Cardano and IOTA. The question in everybody’s mind is this: will this trend change or Bitcoin Cash liquidation continues despite better features in their new network update? In my view, the general crypto sentiment is still bearish and any bear candlestick today reversing attempts of higher highs in the last two days might initiate another wave of sell pressure driving prices back to $850. On the same vein, any extension of that long lower wick this weekend could create a spring board effect propelling Bitcoin Cash back to $1500. Daily Chart Bitcoin Cash Daily Chart by Trading View After May 18 higher highs and fake bullish break out, prices broke below $1100 and now, we are trending at previous key support lines around $850. Our stops were obliterated and many more are likely to be hit if we maintain a bullish outlook in a yet to be confirmed bullish reversal. The trend is down but market participants would be telling us a different story if we see higher highs building on May 24 bullish candlestick bouncing off from around main support at $850. Then again, on the back ground there is a divergence between prices and volumes. While the later increases, prices are going down. Regardless, we remain neutral at the moment and the only time I will recommend buys is when an up-thrust above $1300 happens. Otherwise, any drop below May 24 lows at $930 and BCH would likely test $850.

Analyst Willy Woo said the virtual currency may only find its upside in Q3/Q4 2018. Until then, bulls may find bid opportunities at prices as low as $5,500. Bitcoin to Complete Downside At $5,500-$5,700, Analyst Says\nThe cryptocurrency market has been under pressure in 2018 following an extensive race to the top, with Bitcoin breaching the $20,000 level. Traders were expecting the Blockchain Week in New York to trigger a new bullish momentum, but the market lost $52 billion after a disappointing event .\nBitcoin stalled below the $10,000 area in early May and has been steadily returning to the 2018 lows. Willy Woo, a BTC technical analyst with 62,500 followers on Twitter, is not very optimistic about where the market is moving next. Woo expects the market to give in to bears for a downswing towards $5500-$5700. I think we are gonna go to $5500-5700 next, I can't see $7000 holding. Most likely we'll balance a bit, then we'll slide through. Long timeframes here, looking into June for rough timing of this to play out at a best guess. /1 pic.twitter.com/pCN0N97vp6\n— Willy Woo (@woonomic) May 26, 2018\n“NVT Signal is still too high. We need more blockchain transactional activity to justify the current price, or the price to drop to reconcile the difference. To drive up transactional activity in a bear slide is very unlikely IMO”, Woo said, also referring to the extreme market moves. “Volatility is still too high. I’m looking for a sustained low band of volatility which tends to be a signal for the end of the detox and the next accumulation phase. It’s still got some time to ride down.”\nThe BTC analyst argues that his $5500-$5700 prediction is further supported by a high Standard NVT and a Volume Profile cliff below $6800.\n“When I run the above scenarios against detoxing at a $6800-$7000 floor, it seems a very unlikely path we’ll play out at the $7000 level. This is given the time we need for NVT and volatility to baseline. (…) I don’t necessarily think we’ll fall through the 5000s… sure it’s a possibility but it doesn’t have to. It’s not a repeat, it’s not Mt Gox and Willybot pushing up price with faked orders, we aren’t detoxing from a scam bubble. Technically $5000s is a very strong support band.”\nThe cryptocurrency market in 2018 is more mature compared to 2014 as there no longer “a few whales randomly pushing things around anymore”, which provides a more reliable understanding of price based on fundamentals. Woo says that BTC is not a market on long time frames. Instead, it is an adoption curve (climb, consolidation, climb, consolidation).\nThe analyst expects Bitcoin to steadily drop to $6,800 before plunging to $5700, which should be followed by a leveling out of the drop and a flat zone. The next bullish momentum should come in Q3/Q4 2018 , according to Woo.

Hougan hinges his prediction on the cryptocurrency becoming an actual store of value and the blockchain permeating several facets of human life. Is Bitcoin a Store of Value?\nFinding a consensus on any argument related to Bitcoin is almost a futile effort at this point. There’s the bubble argument , the economic definition argument, and of course, the store of value argument. Matt Hougan, in a recent op-ed for Forbes , examines the store of value debate for Bitcoin, drawing some interesting parallels with gold.\nRight from inception, the virtual currency has been compared with gold. Some proponents are even in the habit of calling the crypto “ digital gold .” Critics, however, dispute this idea, saying that the cryptocurrency cannot be compared to gold because it is highly volatile and, as such, cannot be a store of value.\nOne of the most basic definitions of a store of value is an asset that is both tradable and can be stored for future use. By this definition, a store of value must maintain some stability over a reasonable period. Bitcoin is a volatile asset, no arguments there. However, is the volatility exhibited by the number one crypto a misnomer in the finance world? It turns out the answer is no, and Hougan provides hard evidence. A Little Bit of History Featuring the Post-1971 Gold Market\nToday, gold is not only solid based on its physical form, but as an asset, it maintains some level of price rigidity. However, it wasn’t always so. In 1971, U.S. President Richard Nixon dropped the gold standard for the USD. The price of gold and the value of the dollar was no longer tethered together. What happened next? Well, the table below gives an idea of the wild volatility in prices of gold in the decade following 1971.\nToday’s crypto critics would be bellowing that gold isn’t a store of value if they examined these figures. However, today, it is universally accepted that the precious metal is indeed a store of value. So, what has changed? The answer isn’t utility as some might point out. Gold has some industrial application use cases but that it is not enough to justify its current price. According to Hougan:\n[Gold] is worth $ 1,300 per ounce because people are willing to pay $ 1300 per ounce for it as a store of wealth. Bitcoin Mirrors Post-1971 Gold\nBitcoin is less than a decade old, which means it isn’t yet a fully formed asset. Hougan believes that expecting the cryptocurrency to behave like a fully matured asset is an argument that lacks economic merit. According to the cryptoanalyst, Bitcoin is passing through the two-stage process of rapid appreciation and declining volatility over time.\n2017 saw a parabolic rise in prices that seem to have plateaued in 2018. The Bitcoin volatility, while still considerably high, is declining over time. This pattern exhibited by the number one crypto bears striking similarities to gold after 1971. Speculative Investment Will Give Way to Real World Use\nIf Bitcoin follows the pattern set by gold, then it is well on its way to establishing itself as a store of value . Right now, the crypto is held as a speculative investment, but within the next decade, as blockchain utility increases, Bitcoin will become an even more significant part of global finance. The current market capitalization for the virtual currency is $ 130 billion , which is approximately two percent of the $ 7.5 trillion gold market cap.\nIn ten years, Bitcoin could comfortably hold 10 percent of the value of gold, which would mean a conservative price estimate of $ 40,000. A lot of this depends on how quickly real-world utility applications can be implemented for the cryptocurrency and the assumption that it continues on a similar trajectory to gold.\nDo you agree with the argument that Bitcoin is like gold, and as such, a store of value? Will an increase in real-world utility drive the price of Bitcoin higher?

The Deputy Governor focused on security and scalability as key issues that still need to be resolved before industrial scale implementation can take off. Skorobogatova divided blockchain applications into two major use cases. Firstly, blockchain systems that offer a distributed settlement infrastructure, such as Corda and Ripple , that can be used for banks’ payment processing. Secondly, blockchain platforms that provide smart contract functionality such as Ethereum and Hyperledger . \"Technology for the sake of technology is pointless,” Skorobogatova said, adding that 2018 would be the year that Russia and the international community would come to “a pragmatic understanding” of the purposes for which blockchain is beneficial, after which they would transition to tackle industrial scale realization. Skorobogatova has previously spoken of blockchain as “a revolutionary technology [that] certainly needs to be invested in,” while highlighting that understanding the associated risks and how to manage them was essential for the mainstream financial sector. Fully-controlled integration would require “seven to ten years,” according to her estimation in June of last year. Just this week, news was released that the country’s first officially regulated ICO would be tested using the Russian central bank’s newly-established regulatory sandbox, with major state-owned Sberbank acting as the project’s anchor investor.\nAlso this week, the Russian parliament approved the first of three readings of new laws regulating the crypto and blockchain industries, which define both cryptocurrencies and crypto tokens as property.

One of the bigger upcoming developments is the Lightning Network. Over the past few months, thousands of new payment channels have been established, signalling a major step in the right direction toward mass adoption of this new technology. The Lightning Network Payment Channels\nScaling Bitcoin to offer instant and cheap transactions requires major developments. This code upgrade is known as the Lightning Network . It allows users to open direct payment channels between one another on a global scale. Doing so requires the necessary network participation. Without sufficient support, the Lightning Network will not make any meaningful impact.\nEarlier this year, things did not look all that promising. Just 89 channels existed on January 19th. To some people, it showed how this scaling solution is unfeasible. Others considered it to be a lack of adoption because the technology is still not finished. Instead, it is being tested under open beta rules and caution remains advised at all times.\nFast forward to a few days ago, and the number of channels has grown significantly. As of May 24th, over 6,600 direct connections exist. It is still a drop in the proverbial bucket when looking at the financial sector. However, it also confirms there is genuine interest in this technology. Scaling Bitcoin will remain an ongoing process for some time to come. These numbers may look very different a year from today. Looking Ahead\nEven though this growth is impressive, not everyone is convinced. Until the Lightning Network technology is fully developed, adoption will remain relatively low. Various important aspects still need to be implemented. There is no double-sided funding, no watching for offline transfers, and so forth.\nAll of these issues will – hopefully – be addressed by the developers in the future. Most small and traditional purchases do not necessarily require all of those advanced features. However, the current implementation of the Lightning Network will not necessarily suit everyone. Giving users a lot of different options will remain one of the top priorities.\nAfter nearly nine years of development, it seems things are finally looking up for Bitcoin. Scalability has always been the Achilles heel of the world’s leading cryptocurrency . The Lightning Network may not solve all of the problems in one go. With constant updates and refinements, it will eventually turn into a global payment ecosystem. That is, if enough people embrace this new technology for everyday purposes.

The most popular currently is Solidity, with Vyper hoping to take the throne in the near future.\nHowever, the mechanism driving Ethereum can’t understand the high-level languages, but instead talks in a much lower-level language. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\nEthereum smart contracts are sets of programming instructions being run on all the nodes running a full Ethereum client. The part of Ethereum that runs the smart contract instructions is called the EVM. It’s a virtual machine not unlike Java’s JVM. The EVM reads a low-level representation of smart contracts called the Ethereum bytecode.\nThe Ethereum bytecode is an assembly language made up of multiple opcodes. Each opcode performs a certain action on the Ethereum blockchain.\nThe question is, how do we go from this: pragma solidity 0.4.24; contract Greeter { function greet() public constant returns (string) { return \"Hello\"; } }\nto this: PUSH1 0x80 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE PUSH1 0x4 CALLDATASIZE LT PUSH2 0x41 JUMPI PUSH1 0x0 CALLDATALOAD PUSH29 0x1 SWAP1 DIV PUSH4 0x AND DUP1 PUSH4 0xCFAE3217 EQ PUSH2 0x46 JUMPI JUMPDEST PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT JUMPDEST CALLVALUE DUP1 ISZERO PUSH2 0x52 JUMPI PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT JUMPDEST POP PUSH2 0x5B PUSH2 0xD6 JUMP JUMPDEST PUSH1 0x40 MLOAD DUP1 DUP1 PUSH1 0x20 ADD DUP3 DUP2 SUB DUP3 MSTORE DUP4 DUP2 DUP2 MLOAD DUP2 MSTORE PUSH1 0x20 ADD SWAP2 POP DUP1 MLOAD SWAP1 PUSH1 0x20 ADD SWAP1 DUP1 DUP4 DUP4 PUSH1 0x0 JUMPDEST DUP4 DUP2 LT ISZERO PUSH2 0x9B JUMPI DUP1 DUP3 ADD MLOAD DUP2 DUP5 ADD MSTORE PUSH1 0x20 DUP2 ADD SWAP1 POP PUSH2 0x80 JUMP JUMPDEST POP POP POP POP SWAP1 POP SWAP1 DUP2 ADD SWAP1 PUSH1 0x1F AND DUP1 ISZERO PUSH2 0xC8 JUMPI DUP1 DUP3 SUB DUP1 MLOAD PUSH1 0x1 DUP4 PUSH1 0x20 SUB PUSH2 0x100 EXP SUB NOT AND DUP2 MSTORE PUSH1 0x20 ADD SWAP2 POP JUMPDEST POP SWAP3 POP POP POP PUSH1 0x40 MLOAD DUP1 SWAP2 SUB SWAP1 RETURN JUMPDEST PUSH1 0x60 PUSH1 0x40 DUP1 MLOAD SWAP1 DUP2 ADD PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE DUP1 PUSH1 0x5 DUP2 MSTORE PUSH1 0x20 ADD PUSH32 0x48656C6C6F DUP2 MSTORE POP SWAP1 POP SWAP1 JUMP STOP LOG1 PUSH6 0x627A7A723058 KECCAK256 SLT 0xec 0xe 0xf5 0xf8 SLT 0xc7 0x2d STATICCALL ADDRESS SHR 0xdb COINBASE 0xb1 BALANCE 0xe8 0xf8 DUP14 0xda 0xad DUP13 LOG1 0x4c 0xb4 0x26 0xc2 DELEGATECALL PUSH7 0x8994D3E002900 Solidity Compiler\nFor now, we’ll be focusing on the Solidity compiler, but the same principles apply for Vyper or any other high-level language for the EVM.\nFirst things first: install Node.js.\nAfter you’ve done this, go to your terminal and run this: npm install -g solc\nThis will install solc — the Solidity compiler. Now make an empty directory. In that directory create a file called SimpleToken.sol and put the following code: pragma solidity ^0.4.24; contract SimpleToken { mapping(address => uint) private _balances; constructor() public { _balances[msg.sender] = 1 ; } function getBalance(address account) public constant returns (uint) { return _balances[account]; } function transfer(address to, uint amount) public { require(_balances[msg.sender] >= amount); _balances[msg.sender] -= amount; _balances[to] += amount; } }\nThis is the simplest token smart contract, but it has several important features that will be useful for this tutorial. They are: public functions private functions properties\nAfter you’ve done this, run the newly installed solc on your file. You do this by running the following: solcjs SimpleToken.sol\nYou should get an output similar to this: Invalid option selected, must specify either --bin or --abi\nAnd your compilation should fail.\nWhat just happened? What is bin and what is abi?\nbin is simply a compact binary representation of the compiled bytecode. The opcodes aren’t referenced by PUSH, PULL or DELEGATECALL, but their binary representations, which look like random numbers when read by a text editor. ABI — Application Binary Interface\nOnce our bin output is deployed to the blockchain, the contract will get its address and the bytecode will be pushed into Ethereum storage. But a large problem remains: how do we interpret the code?\nThere’s no way of knowing, from bytecode only, that the contract has functions transfer( and getBalance(:). It’s even less clear whether these functions are public, private or constant. The contract is deployed without context.\nCalling such a contract would be next to impossible. We don’t know where each function is in the bytecode, which parameters it takes, or whether we’ll be allowed to call it at all. This is where the ABI comes into play.\nThe ABI is a .json file that describes the deployed contract and its functions. It allows us to contextualize the contract and call its functions.\nLet’s try running our solcjs once again. Run the following commands: solcjs SimpleToken.sol --abi solcjs SimpleToken.sol --bin\nYour directory should now have a structure like this: . ├── SimpleToken.sol ├── SimpleToken_sol_SimpleToken.abi └── SimpleToken_sol_SimpleToken.bin The SimpleToken_sol_SimpleToken.abi file should look like this: [{ \"constant\": false, \"inputs\": [{ \"name\": \"to\", \"type\": \"address\" }, { \"name\": \"amount\", \"type\": \"uint256\" }], \"name\": \"transfer\", \"outputs\": [], \"payable\": false, \"stateMutability\": \"nonpayable\", \"type\": \"function\" }, { \"constant\": true, \"inputs\": [{ \"name\": \"account\", \"type\": \"address\" }], \"name\": \"getBalance\", \"outputs\": [{ \"name\": \"\", \"type\": \"uint256\" }], \"payable\": false, \"stateMutability\": \"view\", \"type\": \"function\" }, { \"inputs\": [], \"payable\": false, \"stateMutability\": \"nonpayable\", \"type\": \"constructor\" }]\nWe can see that the file describes the functions of the contract. It defines: their name: the name of the functions their payability: whether you can send ether to them the outputs: the return value(s) of the function their state mutability: whether the function is read-only or has write access.\nThis is all reasonably easy to understand from reading it. But earlier I mentioned that the ABI also defines how the user can call the functions — that is, the location of the function in relation to the smart contract address.\nKnowing the name of the function is not enough; we also need to know how (where) to call it.\nThis is done by running a deterministic algorithm on the function properties we mentioned earlier (the name, the payability, the outputs etc.). The details of this function can be found here. Example\nThe ABI is the description of the contract interface. It contains no code and cannot be run by itself. The bytecode is the executable EVM code, but by itself it is without context.\nIn order to call functions in smart contracts, we need to use both the ABI and the bytecode. Luckily for us, this is all abstracted away when we’re interacting with smart contracts by using one of the provided frameworks.\nAn example using the web3.js framework would look like this: var simpletokenContract = web3.eth.contract([{\"constant\":false,\"inputs\":[{\"name\":\"to\",\"type\":\"address\"},{\"name\":\"amount\",\"type\":\"uint256\"}],\"name\":\"transfer\",\"outputs\":[],\"payable\":false,\"stateMutability\":\"nonpayable\",\"type\":\"function\"},{\"constant\":true,\"inputs\":[{\"name\":\"account\",\"type\":\"address\"}],\"name\":\"getBalance\",\"outputs\":[{\"name\":\"\",\"type\":\"uint256\"}],\"payable\":false,\"stateMutability\":\"view\",\"type\":\"function\"},{\"inputs\":[],\"payable\":false,\"stateMutability\":\"nonpayable\",\"type\":\"constructor\"}]); var simpletoken = simpletokenContract.new( { from: web3.eth.accounts[0], data: \"0x608060405234801561001057600080fd5b50620f42406000803373 1673 16815260200190815260200160002081905550610252806100666000396000f30060806040526004361061004c576000357c01 900463 168063a9059cbb14610051578063f8b2cb4f1461009e575b600080fd5b34801561005d57600080fd5b5061009c600480360381019080803573 169060200190929190803590602001909291905050506100f5565b005b3480156100aa57600080fd5b506100df600480360381019080803573 1690602001909291905050506101de565b6040518082815260200191505060405180910390f35b806000803373 1673 168152602001908152602001600020541015151561014257600080fd5b806000803373 1673 16815260200190815260200160002060008282540392505081905550806000808473 1673 168152602001908152602001600020600082825401925050819055505050565b60008060008373 1673 1681526020019081526020016000205490509190505600a165627a7a72305820c9da07d4976adbf00a4b5fe4e23330dbaf3cdcbfd4745eed78c702bf27d944060029\", gas: '47 ' }, function (e, contract){ console.log(e, contract); if (typeof contract.address !== 'undefined') { console.log('Contract mined! address: ' + contract.address + ' transactionHash: ' + contract.transactionHash); } })\nFirst we defined the simpelTokenContract, which is a description of how the contract looks from the outside. We did this by passing it the ABI of the SimpleToken.sol.\nThen we created an instance of the contract simpletoken by calling the simpletokenContract.new(…) and passing into it the data of the contract (the executable code).\nweb3.js combined the two in the background and now has all the required information to call functions on our smart contract. Conclusion\nIn this short overview of smart contract compilation, we explained ABI and how smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain can get invoked. While you’ll never actually have to use this directly, it’s worth being aware of it, as too much abstraction can lead to bugs.

Today, that would be worth $83,746,850. Many people have started to use Bitcoin and it is now the most popular cryptocurrency in the world. Many countries whose currencies have become hyperinflated have thought about switching their national currency to Bitcoin. For something to be classified as money, it needs to be a good unit of account, medium of exchange, and store of value. Since Bitcoin has become extremely popular, I wanted to explain to investors and Bitcoin users that Bitcoin isn't a legit currency. The main three reasons why Bitcoin isn't a legit currency is because it is a poor unit of account, medium of exchange, and store of value.\n One of the big three parts of a currency is that it is a good unit of account. For something to be a unit of account, people have to be able to compare its price to the prices of alternative retail goods. Since the value of a bitcoin changes so much, it would be hard and confusing for both the consumer and the seller to recalculate the prices every day. Because the value of a bitcoin compared to other currencies changes greatly on a day-to-day basis, retailers that accept the currency have to recalculate prices very frequently, a practice that would be costly to the merchant and confusing to the consumer. This Quote: from David Yermacks article Is Bitcoin a Real Currency? An Economic Appraisal Bitcoin shows why Bitcoin isn't a good unit of account. That is one reason why Bitcoin can't be a form of currency and why Bitcoin isn't a legit currency.\n The second part of something that is classified as a currency is that it is a medium of exchange. A medium of exchange is an intermediary instrument used to facilitate the sale, purchase or trade of goods. Since bitcoin doesn't have any intrinsic value, so its worth is held up by its usefulness as a currency in the consumer economy. The Youtube video Why Do Banks Fear Bitcoin by VisionVictory explains that there is a set amount of Bitcoins and by the year 2140, there will be a total of 21 million bitcoins. Miners have already mined 11.9 million of them, and this means that there is only 9.1 million left. Once all of it is mined, there wont be any more left to be mined. Dollar bills can be printed by the U.S. government if they were needed. Some more reasons why Bitcoins isn't a good medium of exchange are that Bitcoins transactions each take around 10 minutes each, which is very slow compared to using a credit or debit card, which takes a few seconds. Also, Bitcoin transactions can cost around $20, which is extremely expensive. Because of all of these reasons, Bitcoin can't be a good medium of exchange, which is very important if it were to be a legit currency.\n The third and final part of a currency is that it has to be a good store of value. A store of value means that the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time. In the long podcast on Youtube by Paul Vigna & Michael Casey: The Age of Cryptocurrency, they explain what a decentralized currency is. Bitcoin is an atrocious store of value and one of the reasons why is because of its constant hacking attacks and other security problems. This is mostly because Bitcoin is decentralized, which means that there is no central authority that can stop any Bitcoin transaction or any hacking attempts. One of the reasons why Bitcoin is so popular is because people can stay anonymous and make transactions without people knowing who they are. The downside of using a decentralized currency is that people can do illegal things anonymously and get away with it. And also, Bitcoins exchange rate has no correlation at all with any other big currencies like the Dollar, Euro, and Yen. This makes Bitcoin extremely risky to use because it is tethered to any other currencies so its value would change constantly. This shows how terrible of a store of value Bitcoin is and why it cannot be a legit currency.\n Tons of people are jumping on the Bitcoin Bandwagon without doing their own research on it, and theyre going to lose a lot of time and money because of this. They need to realize that Bitcoin is not a legit currency because it fails to be a unit of account, medium of exchange, and a store of value.\nLegality of bitcoin\nThe lack of legal regulations for bitcoin does not mean that it is the currency of the black market. On the contrary, analyzing the growing opportunities to conduct transactions using cryptocurrencies (payment for purchases and services), you can be sure that both its purchase, sale and payment prove its full legality. In practical terms, there is no country where bitcoin would be prohibited by law. Another issue is the cryptocurrency markets themselves, which go under the microscope of public officials, but this fact in itself does not mean the closure or the de-legalization of the currency, bitcoin. In practical terms, it would be simply impossible because the currency works in the network and its system is completely dispersed. In addition, the stock market is only an instrument that will enable the circulation of cryptocurrency, and thus has no effect on the currency itself.\nIt is true that there are countries that make the claim that bitcoin was illegal, but on the opposite side there is a technologically and industrially developed Japan, which officially recognizes the cryptocurrency as a fully legal means of payment. On the other hand, the native European Commission gives bitcoin time, recognizing it as too young a currency to be regulated, but in most European countries the number of institutions accepting transactions using cryptocurrency is growing.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations":

7nm Chip Date: in: Bitcoin 0 Views\nGMO Internet Group plans to launch GMO miner B2 on June 6, 2018, which will be followed by an information session in Tokyo, Japan. During the launch, details on the GMO miner B2’s performance and the price will become available to potential buyers.\nOnce launched, the GMO miner B2 will become the first bitcoin mining machine in the world to feature a 7 nanometer (7nm) processor. The high-performance computer features a semiconductor chip known as ‘GMO 72b’ and will start shipping by the end of October 2018. Sponsored Links From Wallets to Mining\nAfter announcing interest in creating bitcoin wallets during January 2017, GMO began researching leading mining technology in September 2017.\nGMO’s statement regarding mining technology, they made it clear that they thought bitcoin – and perhaps other cryptocurrencies – could create a “borderless economic zone,” as reported by BTCManager in September 2017. The company proceeded to invest close to 10 billion yen ($90 million) in researching on semiconductors and establishing their data centers.\nDiego Guiterrez, the chief executive of the mining software company RSK Labs, commented at the time, “The ones at risk are the ones still trying to recover their investment because they will be four times less productive. The other mining chip developers will surely follow and create their own 7 nm chips if they are not already doing it.” The Journey to GMO’s Miner B2 Miner B2. Source: GMO\nBy developing a high performing mining computer in less than a year, GMO has demonstrated its commitment to growing its mining business. In December 2017, GMO Internet Group made public its plans to expand its mining business through the establishment of new facilities in North Europe.\nIn the same month, the company announced that it would be remunerating its employees in bitcoin. This was done to strengthen its approach to the virtual currencies. The announcement said that it is essential to improve their virtual currency literacy by actively using virtual currency.\nGMO 72b version chip powers GMO miner B2. According to the company, two versions of the 72b chip are under development. While version one is the first prototype of 7nm mining chip, mass production of version two chips is set to begin in Q4 of 2018.\nThe company plans to use this version in its mining operations and cloud mining, as well as sell the mining chip to the public. The Race to 7nm Chips\nConsidering that cryptocurrency mining activities require high performing machines with the capability to perform highly intensive and sophisticated computations, there are expectations that GMO miner B2 will be low in energy demands yet high in hashing power.\nAccording to the company’s website, the power efficiency of GMO miner B2 will boost profits for miners. GMO Internet Group has had its mining facilities running since December 2017. According to a report available on its website at the beginning of May 2018, the company mined 537 bitcoin cash and 906 bitcoins in April 2018.\nEven so, GMO Internet Group is not the only tech company that is carving a niche in the cryptocurrency industry by integrating 7nm chip technology in its miners.\nSamsung, TSMC, and Intel are also participating in the 7nm chip race. Driven by economic incentives, these multinational businesses entering a new market brings more competition; in turn, this should lead to greater innovation and efficiency in bitcoin mining, helping to address to often-cited concerns over centralization.
