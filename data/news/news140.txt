cryptocurrency scam that defrauded investors of 1 billion rand ($80 million). FILE PHOTO | NMG Summary The fraud investigation involves a company named BTC Global, which told clients they would earn 2 per cent per day, 14 per cent a week and 50 per cent in a month. Local technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than $50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global. The investigation follows a case this week where kidnappers demanded a ransom in bitcoin of nearly $120,000 to release a South African teenage boy. Johannesburg South African authorities are investigating an alleged cryptocurrency scam that defrauded investors of 1 billion rand ($80 million) with promises of huge returns that never materialised, police said on Friday. The fraud investigation involves a company named BTC Global, which told clients they would earn 2 per cent per day, 14 per cent a week and 50 per cent in a month, the police said. A search for the company on the internet showed its services had been suspended. 'Primary trader' The website lists Steven Twain as the “primary trader”. A request for comment by Reuters sent to an email address listed on the website as belonging to Twain received no response. “Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by agents of BTC Global,” the police said in a statement. “Some of the investors got paid in terms of the agreement. However, the payments suddenly stopped.” Tip of the iceberg Local technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than $50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global. “This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they’ve lost money,” police investigator Yolisa Matakata said. The investigation follows a case this week where kidnappers demanded a ransom in bitcoin of nearly $120,000 to release a South African teenage boy. On Thursday South Africa’s central bank said it was in the process of determining whether cryptocurrencies complied with its financial surveillance and exchange control regulations.

You might be able to discover the amount by getting lists of companies that accept Btc and then looking it up in their annual (10-K) and quarterly (8-Q) reports on EDGAR ( https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html ). answered Feb 7 at 1:06 RonJohn 1 accepting bitcoin would be different than owning bitcoin as a capital investment or as use in inventory in a project where the bitcoin is fuel for a computational process, and so would likely be in different places on the sheet if recorded at all. – CQM Feb 7 at 2:06 @CQM correct. Given it's price volatility, I'm dubious that in Jan 2018 many companies own Btc as a capital investment or as use in inventory in a project. But they do accept it as payment, acting as Cash in a volatile foreign currency. – RonJohn Feb 7 at 2:09 3 \"If a public company accepts bitcoin, it would be recorded on it's balance sheet as Cash.\" Can you give a reference to verify that this is an accepted accounting practice? For instance, a business could accept chickens in payment, but surely would not list chickens as \"cash\". – Nate Eldredge Feb 7 at 2:49 1 @RonJohn I would definitely like a source on that claim that Bitcoin would be used as cash.

I found the wallet-id but the private key does not seem to match that wallet. A new question... given the Wallet-ID and password is there a way to access the Wallet if I don't remember which company/site has issued it and I have no matching private key? – Yakove Dec 31 '17 at 19:48 huh, the private key doesn't match the wallet-id? The private key is \"the root\" of all logic in bitcoin. So if you have it, there is a way to get to your funds. But wallet-id? I think I can't help here. Need some help from other experts. Maybe you can state, which wallet you used, and if the private key matches any of the data, I mentioned before (don't post the provoke though - you will (!) get robbed. Keep it for you - only for you). Otherwise it will be difficult to help. – pebwindkraft Dec 31 '17 at 23:58 I am trying to dig more into the data. I think I have the wallet-id and password. I tried different sites like blockchain.info on login to set the wallet-id and password and it didn't help. From the reading I did, it seems that the wallet is not part of the block-chain of the transactions but I wander if there is any central management for wallet that I can access to get access to my wallet. I know that the wallet is nothing but a folder of private keys so I expect that there is a secured way to recover it. Maybe I am wrong.

The sell-off has been gradual and constant on low market volume with prices homing in on their 2018 lows. Unconfirmed news that the US Justice Department was looking at illegal market practices in the crypto-space - including spoofing and wash trades - sent the market lower with little in the way of technical support to cushion the falls. The report followed a statement by the US SEC applauding police efforts to police fraud in the ICO market.\nTo see how retail traders are currently positioned in cryp tocurrencies and what it means for the market looking forward, download the IG Client Sentiment page. Bitcoin Heading for Range Lows\nThe ch art below shows how BTC has been stuck in a range over the last two-and-a-half months and has more room to the downside. The late March low at $6,438 is the first target ahead of the February 6 and the 2018 low of $5,932. The 20-day/50-day cloud above the around $8,200 to $8,600 should prove stiff resistance to any upside move. Bitcoin (BTC) Daily Price Chart in US Dollars (August 4, 2017 - May 25, 2018) Ripple Stuck Around $0.60\nXRP is having difficulty moving back of its recent low with any rally met with further selling pressure. The $0.60 price is produced by a gap on the April 12 candle on the four-hour chart. With the gap filled and no retracement, Ripple is likely to fall further with the April double low at $0.459 the first meaningful target. On the upside $0.63 followed by $0.705. Ripple (XRP) Four Hour Price Chart in US Dollars (March 22, 2017 – May 25, 2018) Ethereum Capped by 200-day Moving Average\nThe second largest digital currency is struggling to break back above the 200-day moving average, currently at $634, and has traded back below $600 this week. On the downside, $567 is the first level of support ahead of the December 22 low at $497. On the upside $637 ahead of $670 and $700. Ethereum (ETH)Daily Price Chart in US Dollars (2018) Litecoin Downtrend Remains\nLitecoin continues to probe lower with the cluster of lows between $109.6 and $111.5 the next support/target level. This level has proved resilient in the past and may provide a spring bboard for a short-term rally back to $136 ahead of $153.

As long as you buy and sell at the right time, every dollar brings you big profits. ETH is much lower than bitcoin. There are many people who invest in ETH because it is less risky than bitcoin.\nBitcoin is better thanEthereum, I think so. I admire Ethereum a lot but that does not mean to not speak the truth. Ethereum returns profit but if we compare it with the ones earned by holding bitcoin, it looks like a new born baby. Due to the most volatile nature that bitcoin holds, it is best at yielding profit over small duration of time. Ethereum has not produced millionaire like bitcoin has.\nBetter or not is depending people how they see this conversen. Bitcoin is off course better than etherium of we talk about price.\nBut in other side, i prefer etherium as my asset in portofolio. Why?

Since digital coins can't be easily regulated, some question the investigation- but regulators insist the long-term benefits of the added surveillance will be worth it.\nGet the full story from Barrons .\n---\nIf you have lost money in a bitcoin or any other investment, give the attorneys at Sallah Astarita & Cox a call for a confidential review of your investment.

Working from data collected from a survey of 1,490 farmers in January 2018, a new report estimates the US market for farm management software could grow to $1.62 billion.According to the report from Alpha Brown , the Israeli agtech market research company, the farm management software (FMS) market holds enormous potential, especially for farms under 50 acres. Current Trends Despite the first farm management software platforms’ introduction to the market more than a decade ago, not to mention Microsoft’s debut of Excel in 1985, most farmers, according to the study, still rely on pen, paper, and non-computerized tools (69%). Many add standard software like Excel or general accounting software to the mix as well (56%). Just 16.5% of the farmers surveyed currently use any kind of FMS. Taken as representative of the US farming population, that means about 350,000 farmers currently use FMS systems, spending about $420 million annually. Small farms predominate those who use FMS systems. Farmers managing 50 acres and under account for more than 25% of farmers using tailored software. Additionally, operations focused on field vegetables, field fruits, and beef currently take most advantage of FMS systems. FMS systems, however, don’t come cheap, and many farmers don’t spend big on technology. The report cites an average annual cost of $1200 – a significant number for farmers who tend to spend less than $5000 annually on technology. Moreover, in much of America rural broadband connectivity lags , posing a potential challenge to FMS systems. Future Possibilities Despite a tendency towards low-tech or non-specific tools, the potential for farm management software is high. Most farmers are interested in the potential for software to increase profitability, provide decision-making tools and metrics, and decrease their costs of business, though many expressed interest in more specific functions like herd and animal management. Despite interest among farmers, there also appears to be a lack of awareness that farm management software exists, according to the report. Roughly 70% of the farmers surveyed were not familiar with existing FMS systems, which tend to offer farm operation services, financial support, weather data, analytics, and consulting services. A lack of education and awareness of what FMS systems do in effect limits the reach of the platforms. Without enough knowledge to make informed decisions about whether or not to use FMS systems, not to mention which one to pick, many farmers have yet to explore the possibility. Nevertheless, interest remains high. Alpha Brown estimates potential growth in the market at an additional one million farms in the United States alone. And farmers are more excited about the prospect of investing in FMS and the associated data analytics than in either farm robotics , IoT, or ag biotechnology. With effective, targeted marketing, the opportunity for growth remains substantial, concludes the report.

She is also a grain grower in Australia. Here, Weston, and co-author Sarah Nolet, founder of food and ag consultancy AgThentic , explain how the agriculture industry is using blockchain, and the challenges ahead for this segment of the industry. Update: Full Profile recently pitched at Finovate in New York City. Watch their pitch here. We have all seen the use of (and hype about) blockchain in the context of bitcoin, the digital currency that first brought blockchain to mainstream media and investors. While bitcoin remains in the news, the applications and potential of blockchain are spreading well beyond cryptocurrency. Before we take a look at how the agriculture industry is using blockchain, let’s do a quick blockchain 101. What is Blockchain? One way to think of blockchain is as a technology that allows users to transfer value, or assets, between each other without the need for a trusted intermediary. The exchange is recorded in a ledger that is shared by all users of that blockchain. Users rely on this shared, or “distributed,” ledger to provide a transparent view into the details of the assets, including who owns the asset, as well as descriptive information such as quality or location. The running history of the transaction is called the blockchain, and each transaction is called a block. Today, when you hear about blockchain, what most really mean is ‘ blockchains . ’ There exist multiple different forms of this distributed ledger technology, each suited to distinct use cases. One popular blockchain technology is Ethereum , which its founders launched around the idea that blockchains can do more than simply record information. This concept, called ‘smart contracts,’ is central to Ethereum and allows users to codify significant parts of a workflow process, agreement, or task. So, when a transaction occurs, the software automatically executes an action, or set of actions, according to the specifications in the smart contract. One example is smart locks ; locks that automatically open after receiving the correct fee. Recently a few other potential use cases for blockchain have emerged, such as tracking goods throughout supply chains (e.g., SkuChain ) and IoT-enabled “smart farms” (e.g., Filament ). Though we haven’t yet seen the large-scale commercial adoption of blockchain, investors like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and various venture capitalists are paying attention to this space. The R3 consortium has also been in the news for its Corda platform, which enables trade finance and the exchange of letters of credit between its members. But what about agriculture? Though agriculture technology is gaining popularity — and capital — there has been very little talk of blockchain applications within core agricultural areas. There should be, though. Blockchain has huge potential in three key areas of the agriculture industry: Provenance and radical transparency 2. Mobile payments, credits, and decreased transaction fees 3. Real-time management of supply chain transactions and financing Enabling Provenance and Radical Transparency in the Food Chain Consumer demand for “clean” food, including organic , is skyrocketing, but producers and manufacturers are often struggling to verify the accuracy of data from farm to table. Blockchain can help. Currently, there’s no easy, accurate and efficient way for manufacturers to know about issues like slave labor and pollution, or to identify the exact origin of a commodity. Yet consumers, especially within niche markets like organic food, are increasingly willing to pay for products that provide this information. To date, solutions have revolved around certifications and regulations, both of which add costs, are hard to enforce, and can be confusing to consumers. How do free-range and cage-free chickens differ, and what do the labels actually mean for animal welfare? Startups liked Provenance and FarmShare are using blockchains to solve this problem for businesses and consumers. The value of blockchain here is its ability to make the supply chain entirely transparent and rich with immutable provenance data from farm to table. In other words, blockchain tracks information about your food and participants along the supply chain cannot tamper with this information. Ultimately, this technology enables farmers, manufacturers, and retailers to justify premiums for certain products, and gives consumers confidence about where their food comes from and how it was produced. Better Finance for the Developing World Blockchains also have huge potential to create and improve access to finance in the developing world. Agriculture employs over a billion people worldwide, many of whom are smallholder farmers in developing countries. For many of these farmers, affordable access to capital remains a huge challenge. As cell phones have largely become ubiquitous, mobile banking creates novel financing opportunities such as micro-financing. Yet, because of a lack of transparency and therefore high risk, the current paradigm is tons of small transactions with extremely high fees (e.g., 10%). Blockchain can — and already is — solving this problem for financiers and farmers. Examples include agri-ledger out of the UK, BitPesa in East Africa, and Rebit in the Philippines. Trustworthy, Efficient Supply Chains in Developed Economies Possibly the highest potential but least realized opportunity for blockchain in agriculture is in the developed world. Each year, trillions of dollars flow between farmers and buyers alone, yet currently, these transactions are hugely inefficient. Blockchain can improve the settlement process for farmers, buyers, and financiers like banks. Right now, the exchange of the physical commodity decouples from the exchange of payment. In other words, farmers often deliver their harvest but then have to wait weeks or months to be paid. Farmers lack the ability to conduct due diligence on their buyer, so buyers can compete on payment terms, and therefore offer lower prices. This lessens market competition and further lowers prices, as growers go to larger multinationals and incumbents who have less risk of default. Simultaneously, levy collectors and research organizations have no access to data provenance information: they receive their payments, but cannot connect the money to the farmer who has paid. And finally, financing options are both costly and limited because the industry is perceived as risky — and for good reason, as there are many insolvencies. Blockchain can change all of this by enabling real-time payment on delivery. As a result, farmers get paid immediately, industry competition increases and keeps prices higher, and buyers save time and money. Also, adding transparency, trust, and efficiency to settlements can decrease risk and unlock new financing mechanisms for banks. Full Profile is addressing this use case, starting with an in-market blockchain pilot for the 2016-2017 grains harvest in Australia. The Future of Agriculture is Blockchain Some claim that in a few years’ time blockchain will no longer be a buzzword; it will be as ubiquitous as the internet. Others believe that blockchain is all hype; that it is an untested technology with huge risks and little upside. Farmers have always been eager adopters of technologies that make sense and deliver real value. It’s clear that blockchain has big potential to solve significant problems in agriculture. The challenge for blockchain, and agtech at large, is connecting the technology to viable business models and compelling use cases. All the startups mentioned above are working hard to do just this. Put simply; blockchain needs to save time and money as well as take agriculture forward to create new pockets of value. If we can move beyond the hype and simply do better business, the future of agriculture will indeed be blockchain. Have news or tips?

Some of the most significant losses over the past week have come from bitcoin cash, which saw its price fall from $1,300 to below $1,000 – and by almost a half since 6 May.\n“The bitcoin cash network has been displaying some erratic behaviour over the past few weeks, which has contributed to the downwards pressure on prices,” Iqbal Gandham, the UK managing director of trading platform eToro, told The Independent .\nBitcoin cash has yet to reassure the crypto community that it can provide a more stable framework for transactions and that it really is ‘bitcoin’... This lack of clarity has repeatedly called into question the authenticity of bitcoin cash, and until that is resolved the direction of price movement will always carry an air of uncertainty.”\nThe latest investigation comes two months after the US Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) launched its own probe into firms raising funds through initial coin offerings (ICO) – a crowdfunding process that raises money by selling tokens of a cryptocurrency ahead of its launch.\nMore than $6 billion was raised through ICOs in 2017 but a lack of rules and understanding has made them a magnet for criminals.

In short, we separate the private key from the actual wallet and store it in a separate app that we call the COINiD Vault that handles the signing.\nSince most people have an extra spare phone laying around, we believe it is easier for them to use our solution instead of buying extra hardware (Ledger or Trezor).\nA video might do it more justice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3iuELMSW1w\nAnyhow, we would love to get some help testing it and are announcing public early access today.

might be time for the downfall to re-up. We’re looking for flags, likelihood of reversals, and the larger upward trend. Looking at any one of these elements might lead you to believe that Bitcoin’s price in USDT isn’t about to jump – not right this moment, anyway.\nIf we take a peek at Bitcoin price in parabolic stop and reversal, it’s getting far more likely that something major is about to change. These downward slopes keep getting more level. This tells us that when Bitcoin starts to head back up, it won’t just be a minor, momentary situation. This is going to have some real legs to it. The chart you see below comes from NYSE dot com.\nLooking at the weekly chart for Bitcoin vs USDT, it’s apparent the price remains within the bounds of the more grand uptrend, but only just. We’ve got to go all the way back to the year 2015 to make this uptrend appear. Considering the last time a major uptrend happened, it wouldn’t be a shock to see this sideways movement last quite a while longer.\nMeanwhile, in very related news – but not directly related to the overall price – is the appearance of a Bitcoin puzzle on Reddit . Inside the image shown below this paragraph is 1 BTC. The bitcoin is hidden, and the bitcoin will be delivered to whomever solves the puzzle. Thus far there are some VERY strange theories as to how this puzzle will be solved or can be solved.\n“This work is comprised of Satoshi Nakamoto’s famous whitepaper words, scaled by Log N. Disparate ideas inspired Satoshi to create a solution to revolutionize modern socio-economics and industry,” said the Reddit user cryptogreetings. “The work reflects on the elements that brought this technology to life, and challenges the underlying security model. Hidden in plain sight lies something more: a treasure hunt. 1 BTC is concealed within the work.”\nThe image above is compressed. You’ll probably need to go over to the original at Redd.it to see its true file full-ness. Also, the original file’s name is “g4rbvtbiwry01.png”– if that matters.\nThe address of the prize in this puzzle is right over at Blockchain . The balance is 1.00185587 BTC, that including an amount capable of sending itself without moving below a single Bitcoin. The address is 37XTVuaWt1zyUPRgDDpsnoo5ioHk2Da6Fs, Hash160 4001f1b814050eaabf34b22d354053698e512b26, and it’s been sent by 17A16QmavnUfCW11DAApiJxp7ARnxN5pGX.

While the bitcoin price has seen two mid-term recoveries and corrective rallies, both failed to test two major support levels at $12,000 and $10,000. Market Manipulation Theory\nRecently, a group of cryptocurrency researchers and traders suggested that the bitcoin price has began to fall from its all-time high at around $20,000, on the same day the bitcoin futures market of CME and CBOE launched.\nThe group of traders claimed that through the futures market, institutional investors and large-scale retail traders manipulated the market to cash out short contracts by purchasing and selling massive amounts of bitcoin in a correlated manner.\n“Bitcoin reached its all time high (ATH) on December 17th of 2017, the exact date that CME futures trading began. In retrospect, it is now obvious that smart/institutional money was stocking up before that date. Hindsight is 20/20. Since 12/17/17, Bitcoin has been in a bear market. The remainder of this analysis will focus on patterns observed during this market downturn, as well as signals for when it might come to an end,” the group said.\nIt added that every time the cryptocurrency market experienced a correction, the magnitude of the drop declined, proposing that the large-scale investors had less amounts of bitcoin after driving major corrections. The group emphasized that the cryptocurrency market experienced three major corrections since December 2017 and the two subsequent corrections recorded lower sell volumes.\n“Not only is selling volume lower, but the drops have been less severe. Each component of each leg down is less steep than the previous leg down. RSI, a momentum indicator, also shows selling has been less extreme. The trend is ‘flattening out.’” Source: BitcoinWisdom\nAs seen in the chart above, the initial correction of bitcoin in December led the price of BTC to fall from $19,900 to $6,000, by more than 69 percent. The second correction that occured on March 5 resulted in a drop from $11,800 to $6,500, by around 44.9 percent, and the third correction pushed the price of bitcoin to fall from $10,000 to $7,300, by 27 percent. Validity of the Theory\nIn 2008, CNBC Mad Money host and fund manager Jim Cramer emphasized that it is relatively easy for large-scale investors to manipulate the stock market, which has significantly deeper liquidity than bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market.\n“It’s a fun game and it’s a lucrative game. You could move it up and fade it, that often creates a very negative feel so let’s say you take a longer-term view into your day and I’m going to boost the futures and then when the real sellers come in, they’re going to knock it down and that’s going to create a negative view,” said Cramer.\nCNBC Fast Money host Melissa Lee raised a similar point on May 25 show, as she noted that banks and institutions have colluded to manipulate Libor among other assets, interest rates, and commodities.\nIt is entirely possible that the premise established by the group of cryptocurrency traders is correct and that large-scale investors have in fact manipulated the cryptocurrency market. But, if it has been the futures market that affected the price of bitcoin over the past five months, it is completely legal to do so and it remains unclear whether similar manipulation strategies can be prevented in the long-term.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TheCryptoFam/status/999407808041930752"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T23:31:49.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2274b6be0738cdbcbf1473f6886257833d7c9ba3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSaMU5e985FKloqYuGazzexM6XEMoqVA3e4XZwu58XiLomw0Y.WVtUhgY.TcQ5Fib4GVXK4mo9oYupOtrk7ZkOfgdcb_aEEsLKYBiutsrp09hV.89_GRxv8rR42QqxQuQJ", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "r/CryptoMarkets", "title": "Small Banks in America Making Money with Bitcoin", "title_full": "Small Banks in America Making Money with Bitcoin : CryptoMarkets", "published": "2018-05-25T19:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.445, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2274b6be0738cdbcbf1473f6886257833d7c9ba3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSaMU5e985FKloqYuGazzexM6XEMoqVA3e4XZwu58XiLomw0Y.WVtUhgY.TcQ5Fib4GVXK4mo9oYupOtrk7ZkOfgdcb_aEEsLKYBiutsrp09hV.89_GRxv8rR42QqxQuQJ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "puricrypto", "published": "2018-05-25T19:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Small Banks in America Making Money with Bitcoin", "text": "submitted by /u/puricrypto\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cryptoflash.io/posts/886304"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T14:49:35.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "69747e23ff14bf8f57fae9a75914915134aad0ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaKkVkg2uZ.Z.I_gPYIozu.7kC8iPwApTNycM2BIsXTZ0fpWUNrih6RqZsFvMnYR4g58tNYIHplaOnp9uolGyocFegywyoTv_L", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Bitcoin Faces First Close Below This Key Long-Term Support in 2.5 Years : CryptoCurrency", "title_full": "Bitcoin Faces First Close Below This Key Long-Term Support in 2.5 Years : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-25T19:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "69747e23ff14bf8f57fae9a75914915134aad0ab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqaKkVkg2uZ.Z.I_gPYIozu.7kC8iPwApTNycM2BIsXTZ0fpWUNrih6RqZsFvMnYR4g58tNYIHplaOnp9uolGyocFegywyoTv_L", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Fallenkeith75", "published": "2018-05-25T19:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Faces First Close Below This Key Long-Term Support in 2.5 Years : CryptoCurrency", "text": "submitted by /u/Fallenkeith75\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-faces-first-close-below-this-key-long-term-support-in-2-5-years/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T14:48:24.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a1bf78834260c42992643869702057a1b5b1beb1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_f.vrR0lnROWjYmaxKpXA_QZsjs29VACiGHO_vDni541gr8Je5NJ0sjNRTQ5lpi3nKsa6bOZdi197yLqEa73Lgqs7nWyqCR0d.trtL_Q2KTvHnzhyJlylY7VsaIlRjFbk-", "site_full": "www.telegram.com", "site": "telegram.com", "site_section": "http://www.telegram.com/business?template=rss&mime=xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Business -

In short, we separate the private key from the actual wallet and store it in a separate app that we call the COINiD Vault that handles the signing.\nSince most people have an extra spare phone laying around, we believe it is easier for them to use our solution instead of buying extra hardware (Ledger or Trezor).\nA video might do it more justice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3iuELMSW1w\nAnyhow, we would love to get some help testing it and are announcing public early access today. So if you are interested in trying it out, please sign up on https://coinid.org , and you’ll get an invite to our iOS TestFlight, you will then be able to install either the Testnet Wallet or the Bitcoin Wallet.\nOh yeah, currently we have the iOS version ready for testing.

One of its largest energy suppliers, Pražská Plynárenská, has announced that it will start accepting payments from customers in the form of cryptocurrencies. The first to be rolled out, will be Bitcoin (BTC) payments that will be available as soon as early June. This move brings the energy sector closer to the cryptocurrencies that use the valuable resource for mining. Pražská Plynárenská is one of the largest Natural Gas suppliers in the Czech Republic with a customer base of over 420,000. The company is also actively engaged in solar P.V installations, electricity and home heating systems. The company further provides automated data processing, software delivery and IT training and consultancy services. The Czech company also has a hand in the telecommunications industry, real estate maintenance, motor vehicle maintenance and road passenger transport. It is with this background of Pražská Plynárenská diversifying its business that it is no surprise that the company intends on embracing cryptocurrency payments. The CEO of the company, Pavel Janeček, was very emphatic about the new service and had this to say: In June, we are opening a payment gateway, which will automatically transfer our bitcoin payments into regular currency, so that we don’t have to speculate with cryptocurrency. But if anyone wants to pay in an alternative way, we want to allow them to do that. This new service will make the company more appealing to the younger generation in the country who are used to mobile devices, fintech apps and now cryptocurrencies. The Czech Republic has seen an increase of Cryptocurrency adoption with many Czechs willing to use Bitcoin (BTC) rather than the Euro . Most of the Czechs actually prefer to store their hard earned earnings in BTC rather than the local Koruna. With regards to the market performance of the King of Crypto, BTC is holding steady at $7,508 and down less than a percentage point in 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) on the other hand has risen 1.85% in 24 hours and is currently trading at $598. Hopefully as the weekend comes to a close, and also the end of the month, we shall see more funds moving into the crypto-market to build the much needed volumes.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://news.bitcoin.com/poll-bitcoin-more-popular-with-czechs-than-the-euro/", "http://www.ppas.cz/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=883304", "https://news.bitcoin.com/czech-utility-company-introduces-crypto-payments/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pražská plynárenská", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "czech republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T21:19:02.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c66e0befecd9334514aff3caf72e470fb8a56107", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9cAvseD0_za88fiUccb8imCR4rEPiwJF1WoP_5nT3bjdRrEwrf0avE1p_I2qjNmw._Duj9cnC.J26JrFkTN24JPVFqx_2ERM-", "site_full": "btcmanager.com", "site": "btcmanager.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoinschannel.com/feed", "site_categories": ["tech", "business"], "section_title": "Bitcoins Channel", "title": "Revolut Adds Bitcoin Cash, Ripple to its Payments App", "title_full": "Revolut Adds Bitcoin Cash, Ripple to its Payments App", "published": "2018-05-25T19:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitcoinschannel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Revolut-Adds-Bitcoin-Cash-Ripple-To-Its-Payments-App-300x179.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c66e0befecd9334514aff3caf72e470fb8a56107", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9cAvseD0_za88fiUccb8imCR4rEPiwJF1WoP_5nT3bjdRrEwrf0avE1p_I2qjNmw._Duj9cnC.J26JrFkTN24JPVFqx_2ERM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "writer", "published": "2018-05-25T19:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "Revolut Adds Bitcoin Cash, Ripple to its Payments App", "text": "by Shaurya Malwa\nRevolut , the French digital payments app which introduced services for bitcoin , litecoin , and ether in 2017, announced the addition of ripple ( XRP ) and bitcoin cash ( BCH ) on May 24, 2018. The company states that ever since adding support for cryptocurrencies, a significant increase in their valuation, customer base, and profit has been observed. BCH, XRP Find New Market\nThe firm’s core business revolves around providing digital banking services, such as debit cards, payment gateways, and insurances. However, if numbers are to be considered, a reported 20 percent of Revolut’s 1.95 million customer base has diversified their portfolio into cryptocurrencies since their introduction on the platform. Additionally, the company claims that their systems handle over 100,000 cryptocurrency transactions on a daily basis.\nRevolut has taken specific measures to avoid company losses due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies. It usually does not charge for major transactions via fiat money, however, does levy a 1.5 percent fee for every cryptocurrency transaction.\nThe same reasons make the digital asset class is infamous in larger financial institutions, alongside the lack of regulations. Centtrip CEO Brian Jamieson elaborated :\n“We are seeing a reluctance from the banks and card schemes to offer services or support to crypto-related companies. We receive requests for accounts from crypto-based companies almost daily that we turn away.” Advertisement advertisement\nJamieson’s firm is similar to Revolut’s business, as it provides international payments and foreign-exchange for corporate clients and high-net-worth customers. However, the cryptocurrency market remains a grey area for Centtrip. Firms Tread Cautiously on Cryptocurrency Route\nIn 2018, several financial institutions have expressed an interest in cryptocurrency trading, with Goldman Sachs launching a bitcoin futures trading desk on May 3, 2018.\nHowever, cryptocurrency adoption largely remains a feature of financial firms with younger people at the helm, such as Robinhood or TradingView , who are apparently more conversant with the asset class and open to taking higher risks.\nNotwithstanding the profits made by firms which introduce cryptocurrency services, the primary question remains of long-term business sustainability. Some of the Crypto Community Largely Unimpressed with Revolut\nDespite the Revolut’s success, a handful of cryptocurrency enthusiasts maintain a skeptical outlook towards the firm, due to several reasons that go against the decentralization ethos.\nThe application is largely centralized, and cryptocurrencies can only be purchased via the in-app platform. It does not allow users to receive cryptocurrency, in addition to practically discouraging the use of cold wallets , as the Revolut wallet is the only place where a user can store cryptos purchased through the app.\nOf course, adding greater functionality would be a welcome move and is likely to be on the cards for Revolut in the near future.\nComplete anonymity is mitigated if one uses the platform, as cryptocurrencies can be purchased only after an elaborate Know Your Customer (KYC) procedure, with the information supposedly provided to banks.\nAt the time of writing, XRP and BCH trade at $0.61 and $1,037 respectively.

The cryptocurrency’s price stood at $7,545 at mid-day Thursday.\nThe probe “will help the market,” said Darryll DiPietro, CEO of Concierge Club .\n“Once everyone gets put under a microscope, it will be difficult for some of those sh*tty companies launching dicey IPOs,” he told the E-Commerce Times. “I’m not for regulation per se — I believe in a decentralized market — but I’m for controlling those sh*tty companies. Legitimate projects will benefit from this.”\nBoth DoJ spokesperson Nicole Navas Oxman and CFTC spokesperson Donna Faulk-White declined to comment for this story. Market Manipulation Murmurs\nBack in 2017, Hackernoon ran a story alleging A single entity dubbed “Spoofy” was responsible for dominating the price of bitcoin , according to a story Hackernoon ran last year.\nSpoofy was spoofing and engaging in wash trading, according to the report, and had come up with a scheme it named “Tether.”\nThat article sparked considerable comment .\nAn academic paper on price manipulation in the bitcoin system back in 2013, which focused on the Mt. Gox exchange in Japan, drew media attention earlier this year. .\nThe CFTC earlier this month issued guidance for listing virtual currency derivative products. Also, two CFTC officials mentioned the possibility of regulating cryptocurrencies, suggesting cooperation between the CFTC and the SEC.\nThe CFTC has issued an advisory warning of virtual currency pump-and-dump schemes.\n“We’re facing a speculative bubble in which the market hasn’t firmly determined the balance of all the upside and the risk associated with cryptocurrencies,” noted Andreas Scherer, managing partner at Salto Partners .\nCryptocurrencies are “still a relatively small fraction of the global financial transaction volume,” he told the E-Commerce Times, and trading platforms have not yet implemented all the common safeguards in place at established stock exchanges. “So, known manipulation strategies such as spoofing occur unmitigated.” Cryptocurrency Scams\nTwitter, Google and Facebook have banned cryptocurrency ads due to the high level of scams in the field.\nOf nearly 1,500 cryptocurrency offerings examined, 271 — or about 20 percent — were dubious, a Wall Street Journal investigation found. Among the suspicious findings were missing or fake executive teams, the use of plagiarized investor documents, and promises of guaranteed returns.\nBanks generally have downplayed bitcoin, and JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon last year took several shots at the currency, whose share prices fell each time he launched an attack.\nSeveral countries, including China, have banned bitcoin.\n“The governments and major banks are trying to manipulate the market,” DiPietro remarked.\nThe banks likely will be targeted by the DoJ because “its big score will be taking down one of these big companies,” he said, adding that Facebook reportedly has been working on its own cryptocurrency, and thus has an ulterior motive.

After three consecutive sell-offs within a 24-hour period, the price of bitcoin dropped from $7,900 to $7,250, eventually stabilizing at $7,400. Bear Market The cryptocurrency sector is in a short-term bear cycle. In a highly volatile period like this, positive developments and events that would otherwise lead to a significant surge in the valuation of the cryptocurrency market often do not affect the market in a major way. As such, in spite of the entrance of financial institutions like the New York Stock Exchange, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan, the cryptocurrency market has continued to decline. Based on the price trend of BTC over the past two months, it is possible that the correction continues to the higher end of the $6,000 region, considering the overly strong downward trend of BTC and other major cryptocurrencies in the global market. Throughout its recent history, over the past 12 months, bitcoin recorded three major drops. As seen in the 1-day price chart of BTC below, all three correction bounced back on a similar support level at $6,600. When the bitcoin price dropped from $20,000 to the $6,000 region, the bitcoin price rebounded to $12,000 after securing the $6,600 support level. A similar trend occurred when the price of BTCdropped from $11,000 to $6,400 and so on. It is possible that the BTC price bottoms out in the mid $6,000 region once again and immediately initiate a strong rally back to the $10,000 to $12,000 region. Why Chinese Billionaire Bought 10,000 Bitcoin in Q1 In the first quarter of 2018, when the BTC price dropped to the $6,000 for the first time in 2018, Chinese billionaire angel investor Wang Feng purchased 10,000 BTC in the $6,600 region. Along with bitcoin, Feng bought Theta, Ontology (ONT), Cortex (CTXC), ArcBlock (ABT), Zipper (ZIP), YeeCall (YEE), Dxchain (DXC), Charter (CAF). 10,000 BTC, which is worth around $76,000,000, is an amount of bitcoin that is difficult to purchase on cryptocurrency exchanges without significantly driving the price up in the short-term. Feng most likely had purchased $76 million worth of bitcoin in the over-the-counter (OTC) market or directly from miners. A bulk purchase of bitcoin of over $50 million requires significant confidence in both the short-term and long-term price trend of BTC. Feng likely assumed that $6,600, the major support level for bitcoin, would remain as the bottom even for future corrections and bear cycles. “When asked about the market crash in March, he dismissed it as no big deal. He called it a short-term setback and in fact, said Cryptocurrencies rose very well in the long term,” CCN reported. If the bitcoin price drops below $7,000 and to the higher end of $6,000, the market will likely experience a strong bounce and record a major rally throughout the third quarter of 2018, potentially back to the $10,000 and $12,000 region, as it did in March.

But on the other hand, it is reaping the dark side of the digital currency.\nI think Bitcoin is very useful for criminals who want to hide money from their crimes. Because if they save money in the bank, the money from the crime can be easily traced. Bitcoin can also be abused by people who want to hide their income from government, and avoid paying taxes. Then, the state revenue from the tax will be lost because of the money that is not tracked. Not only in the criminal acts alone, the most basic lack of Bitcoin also occurs because of its unreal form.\nNot to mention the instability of the value of Bitcoin currency if converted to other conventional currencies are very volatile. Today, maybe the owner can be very rich by having Bitcoin worth 1,000 US dollars. However, who knows if in the future the value of money is only left 50 US dollars.\nsome minor events that cause huge losses for Bitcoin owners. A man once lost about 600 US dollars for doing a reset on his smart phone and in fact, he accidentally permanently remove the Bitcoin digital wallet.\nA number of online platforms are testing the payment with Bitcoin currency, among others WordPress, Reddit, Namecheap, Mega, and Zynga.

Those means do not include phoning people and advising them of their pending arrest. Nor will the CRA ever contact people over the phone and advise them to pay fees/fines owing using Bitcoin or any other crypto currency.

But, it has been observed time and again that the security measures used to safeguard cryptocurrency are lackluster and benefit cybercriminals greatly.\nSo far, quite a few incidents have been associated with cryptocurrencies . Despite the low number of hacking sprees involving cryptocurrencies, it is a fact that hacking of virtual coins is a reality – The latest victim of one such incident is Bitcoin Gold.\nRecently, an attack was successfully deployed against Bitcoin Gold currency in which a miner executed a double spend attack on Bitcoin Gold token network. Due to the attack, millions of dollars were lost and several exchanges that traded the coin were affected.\nReportedly, an unknown party having access to massive amounts of hashpower is attempting to use 51% attacks. BTG or Bitcoin Gold forum tracked the hack until the previous week to monitor the controversial hashrate and concluded that a 51% attack was indeed underway. The information was posted by BTG poster Mental Nomad about a week back.\nSee: Coincheck cryptocurrency exchange hacked; $534 Million stolen\nThe purpose identified for this attack was to perform “double spend” attack, which involves stealing money from Exchanges. On May 18, Director of Communications Edward Iskra released a warning to caution users.\n“We have been advising all exchanges to increase confirmations and carefully review large deposits,” read the message from Iskra.\nIn the said case, the miner acquired control of the entire blockchain by obtaining over half (that is, 51%) of the network’s hash power. Although Bitcoin Gold is a tiny coin in the virtual currency market, it is currently rated as the number 26th therefore, acquiring over half of the hash power of a network requires a considerably high amount of money, which in this attack probably was created while deploying a double spend attack.\nThe hacker immediately started to deposit funds on various exchanges after gaining majoritarian control of the network. Coins that were previously transferred to a wallet controlled by the exchanges were also simultaneously transferred. Blockchain could have resolved the issue of double spend but given that the hacker had acquired control of the network, it became possible to transact and reverse the operations later on.\nApproximately 18 million dollars got stolen during the attack. The sum was collected from different exchanges. One of the accounts was found to be involved in the attack and it received 388,200 BTG tokens on Monday, 16th May. Wallet keeping the stolen Bitcoin Gold funds (Credit: BTG team)\nThe attacks stopped on May 18th but there is still a chance for the hacker to launch another attack provided that he manages to control the majority of the network’s hash power once again. It is worth noting that BTG is the third altcoin to be attacked in the last week. Previously Monacoin and Verge (XVG) cryptocurrencies were also attacked.\nMental Nomad states that such attacks are quite interesting because: “There is no risk to typical users or to existing funds being held. The only parties at risk are those currently accepting large payments directly from the attacker. Exchanges are the primary targets.”\nSee : Hackers steal $30 million worth of cryptocurrency in Tether hack\nHe further noted that apparently the attacker is deterred for now due to the actions taken by exchanges. Bitcoin Gold team members are communicating with exchanges because according to BTG it is important to improve safety.\n“Until now, some Exchanges were operating with less than five confirmations required. We have been urging higher limits to prevent such an attack, and urging manual review of large deposits of BTG before clearing the funds for trading,” states BTG.\nAll we can say is that cryptocurrencies are here to stay and have substantially transformed the mechanisms of the financial industry. However, it is important to develop safer and stronger platforms that support the crypto’s claim of security comprehensively. Exchanges are specifically vulnerable because of coveting large deposits that further enhance the problems in such cases.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://btgexplorer.com/address/GTNjvCGssb2rbLnDV1xxsHmunQdvXnY2Ft", "http://twitter.com/hackread", "https://forum.bitcoingold.org/t/double-spend-attack-on-exchanges/1362", "http://rdf.data-vocabulary.org/#"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T20:30:43.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "29d2bfe0882c6e883c30af494c3ae3b0f0fe76ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStazHI00VAAaXbG3XTJ8qM9qYjzU96wjnTL0joEWNuswjM7SnNs4iAe8nGDteUTUh8BlhIpNSXgfO6yM1gnChv0tDg0yQLA8QKPRZw660ezqsq9RUFzCPURzFw4ZulISAAlg60dkG7_LVEV5cPLwoO", "site_full": "forum.bits.media", "site": "bits.media", "site_section": "https://forum.bits.media/index.php?/forum/115-%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D1%8B-%D0%B3%D1%8D%D0%BC%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B3-%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BE/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Игры, гэмблинг, казино - Bitcoin Forum", "title": "XENCOIN-[SCRYPT POW/POS 365% APR][NO ICO/PRESALE][LOW PREMINE][AIRDROP][BOUNTY] - Форки Bitcoin, альткоины", "title_full": "XENCOIN-[SCRYPT POW/POS 365% APR][NO ICO/PRESALE][LOW PREMINE][AIRDROP][BOUNTY] - Форки Bitcoin, альткоины - Bitcoin Forum", "published": "2018-05-25T19:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forum.bits.media/uploads/monthly_2017_10/logo_bits.media_s.png.63c66d89ed24f0087a5dc1a84a44af7d.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 18487, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "29d2bfe0882c6e883c30af494c3ae3b0f0fe76ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStazHI00VAAaXbG3XTJ8qM9qYjzU96wjnTL0joEWNuswjM7SnNs4iAe8nGDteUTUh8BlhIpNSXgfO6yM1gnChv0tDg0yQLA8QKPRZw660ezqsq9RUFzCPURzFw4ZulISAAlg60dkG7_LVEV5cPLwoO", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "StalBOX777", "published": "2018-05-25T19:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "XENCOIN-[SCRYPT POW/POS 365% APR][NO ICO/PRESALE][LOW PREMINE][AIRDROP][BOUNTY] - Форки Bitcoin, альткоины", "text": "XENCOIN\nTelegram: https://t.me/joinchat/JGFBCxE6h6jGXap4CCeFbg\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Xen_Coin\nGithub: https://github.com/xenrinkashime/xencoin\nBitcointalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4243427\nWebsite: -\nBlock Explorer:\nhttps://cvmpool.pw/explorer/XEN\nExchange: -\n-ALGORITHM: SCRYPT\n-TYPE: POW/POS\n-LAST BLOCK POW: 10,000\n-BLOCK REWARD: 5,000\n-ANNOUNCED BLOCK: 22\n-COIN NAME: XenCoin\n-COIN ABBREVIATION: XEN\n-COIN SUPPLY: 21,000,000,000 B\n-PREMINE AMOUNT: 100,000,000 M (0.475%)\n-POS PERCENTAGE: 365% PER YEAR\n-MIN.

With Thursday’s decline, the digital asset is barely clinging to the $7,500 level and its market capitalization has dipped below $130 billion.\nBitcoin does not lack for supporters as there have been plenty of bullish calls on the cryptocurrency in recent weeks. Some crypto market observers have opined bitcoin could reach new highs this year, but those are just projections. In financial markets, price matters and bitcoin’s price has rapidly eroded since the start of May. More on the Bitcoin Investigation\n“The investigation is focused on illegal practices that can influence prices — such as spoofing, or flooding the market with fake orders to trick other traders into buying or selling, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the review is private. Federal prosecutors are working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a financial regulator that oversees derivatives tied to Bitcoin, the people said,” reports Bloomberg .\nBitcoin and other digital currencies have faced an array of regulatory challenges in the U.S. and abroad. Earlier this month, South Korean prosecutors raided the offices of Upbit, a major digital currency exchange operator. Other countries have moved to limit or outright ban transactions in digital currencies.\n“Authorities worry that virtual currencies are susceptible to fraud for multiple reasons: skepticism that all exchanges are actively pursuing cheaters, wild price swings that could make it easy to push valuations around and a lack of regulations like the ones that govern stocks and other assets,” according to Bloomberg.\nPreviously, many crypto market observers have argued that increased regulation of digital assets is a positive factor and one that would facilitate more adoption and use of the decentralized asset class.\nFor more information on the cryptocurrency market, visit our Bitcoin category .

Sgt. Ian Nichol with the Toronto Police Service’s Financial Crimes Unit told CTVNews.ca. “People would take the number off the card and then send it to the person involved, and it would find its way onto a website where it would be sold for profit.”\nNow, scammers are asking victims to make their payments in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.\nBitcoin is an almost perfect instrument of crime, Nichol said.\n“One of the advantages of using Bitcoin is that once you pass it along to another e-wallet, it is very difficult—if not impossible—to trace,” Nichol said. “There are some possibilities that we can exploit, but if the wallet happens to be located outside of the country, our chances of identifying the person who is receiving the funds is next to none.”\nToronto police do not have statistics on the number of victims of such crimes, but say that there has been “an uptick” in reports from victims.\nIn Edmonton, police say that 111 people reported falling victim to the CRA scam from January 2017 to February 2018, and said that fraudsters took more than $300,000 from them. More than 75 per cent of the cash that went to the perpetrators during that time was sent using Bitcoin.\nPart of what makes these crimes so difficult to track, Nichol said, is that the vast majority of them go unreported.\n“The people who are victimized by it actually believe that they are in some kind of difficulty and don’t question it,” Nichol said. “When they do figure it out, they are less inclined to report it out of embarrassment. Many of them don’t even know that they have been victimized.”\nToronto police stressed that the CRA does not send payment notices or ask for personal information through phone calls, text messages or emails, and added that it will never ask for payment of a fee or fine in Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.\n“The CRA will never, ever phone you up and threaten to throw you in jail,” Nichol said. “It will never happen.”\nToronto police is asking anyone who may have been a victim of such schemes to contact the police and is advising shop owners with Bitcoin ATM machines to display messages on their machines warning users about the existence of these schemes.

It finally broke the uptrend early this year, dropped significantly and has traded mostly sideways-to-down since then with lows placed in February and April.

Will there be a next blast?\nOn the daily chart, the New York Stock Exchange Bitcoin Index would have to take out that 18500 high before it could be said that a new uptrend is unfolding.\nstockcharts.com NYSE Bitcoin Index chart, daily\nYou can see how the price can't quite make it back above the Ichimoku cloud -- that's the technical analysis indicator derived from a comparison of the 9-day highs and lows and the 26-day highs and lows. It's one way chart readers analyze moving average dynamics. Above is thought to indicate bullishness, below bearishness.\nThe weekly chart takes us back to 2015. From there to here, the uptrend on this time frame continues intact. So far, the bitcoin price remains above the cloud, although it's only just above it for now.\nstockcharts.com NYSE Bitcoin index chart, weekly\nThe April low near 6500 is the next level of support -- where significant buying showed up. Can it hold that level on the next test? That's the question. Many algorithms will be watching closely.\nOn the monthly chart, the selling that began late last year has barely dinged the overall uptrend. I've connected the lows from 2015 and 2016 to indicate the uptrend -- it's that red dotted line below the prices.\nA close below that line might suggest that the long-term uptrend has ended. But, that's a long way from here. Note that the \"relative strength\" indicator above the chart has come out of its \"overbought\" level for the first time since the index was created. Here's the last chart -- it's old-school point and figure work designed to give us a close-up view of the price action. The x's are for upward periods and the o's are for downward periods.\nstockcharts.com NYSE Bitcoin index, point and figure chart.\nThe knowledge we gain here is the potential support level indicated by 2 places on the chart where the previous downward movement stopped: that's the 6600 index level. A close below that would suggest that the downtrend remains in place, according to the point and figure school.\nIt's worthwhile to consider charts like these because it's one way of removing the influence of just reading the news about bitcoin -- or attempting to analyze it from a fundamental standpoint. The only thing that matters here is price which gives us trend and support and resistance levels to watch.\nIf you're looking for fundamental research on bitcoin, crypto currencies and block chain, you might want to read the recent work of Forbes contributor Roger Aitkin right here or go to the Forbes \"topic\" page on the subject right here.\nI take a similar look at oil price charts right here .\nI do not have positions in these investments.

Then to bitcoin gold, plundered in an $18m double spend attack. Then to verge again, this time to the tune of $1.7 million. Along the way, monacoin is also believed to have been hit. Someone is methodically working their way through Proof of Work coins, controlling their hashrate, and then launching 51% attacks. Other PoW teams are now on high alert for signs that their coin could be next.\nAlso read: Caspian Partners With Bitmex to Offer All-In-One Portfolio Services Following a Spate of Attacks, PoW Teams Batten Down the Hatches\n51% attacks, in which a malevolent miner controls the majority of the network hashrate and then uses it to force through fraudulent transactions, are commonly discussed but rarely encountered. That all changed on April 4 when verge was hit by a 51% attack. At the time, the incident was put down to the general fog of incompetence that surrounds verge; the exploit was quickly patched and everyone moved on. Then, just over a month later, verge was hit again along with bitcoin gold and possibly monacoin too. The spate of attacks has caused a crisis of confidence in Proof of Work coins and forced their development teams on the defensive.\nAlthough called a 51% attack, in reality it’s often possible to control the network with a much lower hashrate. Because verge uses five different hashing algorithms, for example, the attacker was able to reduce the mining difficulty for just one algorithm and focus all their firepower on that, armed with just one fifth of the hashpower they would otherwise have needed. The second time around, they modified their attack slightly and targeted verge with a dual blast using two different algorithms. Bitcoin gold, meanwhile, was targeted due to its equihash algorithm , the same one used by such coins as zcash and komodo. The Cost of Staging a 51% Attack\nFollowing the run of 51% attacks, teams have rushed out updates to reassure the community that their coin is safe, and to deter would-be attackers. The cost of attacking ethereum classic has been estimated at $70m, for example, and estimates have been made for doing the same with the top 10 PoW coins. BTC is priced at $2.2 billion to attack, whereas zcash comes in at $87m. In his blog post, Husam Abboud claims that “If a zCash miner with +8% of Nethash [switches] to mine Bitcoin Gold, he is +51% BTG nethash, that brings the cost of 51% attack on BTG to 580 ZEC/day ~$200k”.\nBecause bitcoin gold has a much lower hashrate than coins such as zcash, it is a far easier target to pick off. Now that the feasibility of double spending a recognized PoW coin has been proven, aspiring attackers are calculating the costs of renting hashing power from a provider such as Nicehash and using it to take over a target of their choosing. This is one of the dangers with an altcoin using an existing algorithm: it’s easy for an attacker to switch from mining one to another at the flick of a switch, leaving low hashrate PoW coins vulnerable to hostile takeover without warning. There’s a Storm Brewing\nPoW teams are hitting back, and have enacted various measures to thwart future attacks. On request, Binance has upped the number of confirmations required to deposit equihash-based coins onto the exchange. The more confirmations that are required, in theory, the more likelihood there is of detecting and thwarting a 51% attack. Maidsafe, meanwhile, has proposed a new consensus mechanism called PARSEC, though some believe it may be vulnerable to other threats such as Sybil attacks, which are a recurring theme with staking algorithms.\nFor the coins that are committed to remaining with Proof of Work, most of which descended from Bitcoin at some point in time, it’s a case of remaining on high alert for possible signs of foul play. One PoW altcoin team has set up a script to constantly monitor their hashrate. In the event of a spike of over 10%, they will be automatically notified. Should the newly added hashrate emanate from an unknown pool, or be in danger of tipping an existing pool over 50%, they have a large quantity BTC on standby with Nicehash ready to purchase their own firepower to counter the attack. It’s a high stakes game and PoW teams can’t leave anything to chance. No one wants to be the next bitcoin gold.\nDo you think the spate of 51% attacks is over for now, or is there more trouble ahead?

Much like the Roger Ver-ified \"Bitcoin Cash\" Forkcoin, \"Bitcoin Gold\" was split from the Bitcoin Blockchain via hardfork by a marginal crew with odd politics and like \"Bitcoin Cash\" failed to attract sufficient serious interest to matter .\nThe hill on which the \"Bitcoin Gold\" crew chose to die was changing the mining algorithm to a GPU mining friendly memory hard algorith of recent publication dubbed \"equihash\" leaving their blockchain's security to the mercy of altcoin miners with GPU farms and no particular loyalty to any of the non-Bitcoin blockchains they mine. The meteorological risk of circumstances aligning to make these attacks the natural, economically rational choice for miners looms over every purported \"cryptocurrency\" blockchain that fails to attract sufficient value to actually be Bitcoin.
