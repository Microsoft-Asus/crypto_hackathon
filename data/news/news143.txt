REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\nThe fraud investigation involves a company named BTC Global, which told clients they would earn 2 percent per day, 14 percent a week and 50 percent in a month, the police said.\nA search for the company on the internet showed its services had been suspended.\nThe website lists Steven Twain as the “primary trader”. A request for comment by Reuters sent to an email address listed on the website as belonging to Twain received no response.\n“Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by agents of BTC Global,” the police said in a statement.\n“Some of the investors got paid in terms of the agreement. However, the payments suddenly stopped.”\nLocal technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than $50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global.\n“This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they’ve lost money,” police investigator Yolisa Matakata said.\nOn Thursday South Africa’s central bank said it was in the process of determining whether cryptocurrencies complied with its financial surveillance and exchange control regulations.\n($1 = 12.4837 rand)\n(Reporting by Mfuneko Toyana; Editing by Joe Brock/Keith Weir) Share", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "twain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven twain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "btc global", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa investigates billion rand bitcoin scam south africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:42:58.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a99126418a25ebb3d16f0a090d464fbda0dd2807", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQnsPITM7FX679YcwEHGuts-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Bitcoin has dropped so invest more", "title_full": "Bitcoin has dropped so invest more", "published": "2018-05-25T15:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.018, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a99126418a25ebb3d16f0a090d464fbda0dd2807", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQnsPITM7FX679YcwEHGuts-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "wuvdoll", "published": "2018-05-25T15:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin has dropped so invest more", "text": "Quote: from: btcrising on May 25, 2018, 06:31:58 AM From one point, it's good, many users = strong support.\nBut at the same time if people buy and just to hold, that won't help much.

We all became complacent,” BTC Global said on its website.\n“Until Steven Twain resurfaces or is found there is nothing the admin team can do.”\nSouth African police said they were investigating the alleged fraud, with more than 28,000 investors affected.\nPolice said the company had targeted potential investors with promises of two per cent interest per day, 14 per cent a week and 50 per cent per month.\nPayments to investors were reportedly made every Monday until they suddenly dried up.\nRegulators worldwide are grappling with the boom in crypto-currencies like bitcoin, which lure investors with the promise of high returns but are not backed by any central banks.\nYesterday, a South African teenager was found four days after he was kidnapped by a gang who demanded a ransom in 15 bitcoins, worth about US$123,000.\nPolice gave no details about any ransom payment. — AFP Related Articles ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yolisa matakata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven twain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hawks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc global", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:51:34.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c2c6a89acf5212828f0bd1406d7935738e532825", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVCz5x3iRo.W.LGMJK.TrB7S_IAPPRCeQI0Vw40fuQRzepxh.9gMb1iyVAaraR0IInBjXZOlkO0Q8ojP5zWhtqnWSsXFVYpr0gYvhw98kI4ApmiqXlR9eCqA--", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoinschannel.com/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Bitcoins Channel", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Friday: Luxury Jets, Cheap Air Tickets Now Offered for Bitcoin Cash", "title_full": "Bitcoin in Brief Friday: Luxury Jets, Cheap Air Tickets Now Offered for Bitcoin Cash", "published": "2018-05-25T15:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitcoinschannel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_70346908_1600-1068x1068-300x300.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c2c6a89acf5212828f0bd1406d7935738e532825", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVCz5x3iRo.W.LGMJK.TrB7S_IAPPRCeQI0Vw40fuQRzepxh.9gMb1iyVAaraR0IInBjXZOlkO0Q8ojP5zWhtqnWSsXFVYpr0gYvhw98kI4ApmiqXlR9eCqA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "writer", "published": "2018-05-25T15:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Friday: Luxury Jets, Cheap Air Tickets Now Offered for Bitcoin Cash", "text": "2704 Bitcoin in Brief Friday: Luxury Jets, Cheap Air Tickets Now Offered for Bitcoin Cash\nBitcoin in Brief today features a couple of announcements adding to the growing number of bitcoin cash adoptions. A luxury cryptocurrency concierge now accepts BCH for the items it offers to the crypto rich – a logical step, according to its founder. An online travel agency is introducing three new coins to its payment options, including bitcoin cash, after “a huge uptick in the number of customers requesting alternative currencies”. Also, a cold wallet for institutions hits the market soon.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: Main Street Adopts Bitcoin Ahead of Wall Street Luxury Purveyor White Now Accepts Bitcoin Cash\nA US-based luxury crypto concierge service is now accepting bitcoin cash (BCH). The White Company, founded by former executive at Formula 1 and LVMH, Elizabeth White, offers high-end products and luxury brands, including fine watches and sports cars. It has become the latest business to take advantage of the benefits of BCH payments, which include substantially lower transaction fees.\nThis business is trying to fill the market niche for services to those rich customers who want to acquire luxurious items, like private jets, Lamborghinis, and famous artworks, in a more discreet way. That’s why the White Company accepts only cryptocurrency.\nIt all started with payments in bitcoin core (BTC), litecoin (LTC) and ethereum (ETH). However, the exponential growth of the business, of crypto wealth, in general, and the growing popularity of bitcoin cash, in particular, have led to the introduction of BCH payments. It comes as a recognition of the lower transaction fees and faster processing times of the bitcoin cash network, in comparison to legacy cryptocurrencies. The New York headquartered company has also decided to discontinue the LTC option.\nNoting that “trust is vital in this space,” Elizabeth White was quoted as saying: “I have watched with interest both the growth and the early-adopters of bitcoin cash and I can see that the White Company and BCH are natural partners.” And, according to a corporate press release, the partnership represents a logical next step for the development of the business. Cheapair Introduces Payments in Three Cryptos, including BCH\nOnline travel agency Cheapair.com has also announced it is now accepting bitcoin cash for booking flights and hotels. “It’s official!” the California-based company said in a post on Twitter, confirming it has added BCH to the available payment options, along with two other cryptocurrencies – litecoin (LTC) and dash (DASH). “Help us spread the word #cryptocurrency fans!” tweeted the agency, which also accepts bitcoin core (BTC).\nAccording to Cheapair , the list of the supported cryptocurrencies has been expanded in response to customer demand. The company noted the development of a number of new cryptocurrencies aimed at avoiding some of the challenges that have emerged with BTC, whose network has previously been stressed by higher transaction volumes. In different ways, bitcoin cash, litecoin and dash all promise improved transaction potential over their predecessor, being either faster or with lower fees attached, Cheapair explained.\n“Our cryptocurrency customers tend to be very vocal about what they want, something we appreciate very much. Over the last six months, we’ve seen a huge uptick in the number of customers requesting alternative currencies, so we’ve worked hard to integrate the three that were most requested,” Cheapair CEO Jeff Klee commented.\nKlee added that the company has already streamlined the process of converting the accepted cryptocurrency to fiat money, which is then paid to airline and hotel suppliers. “That made adding litecoin, bitcoin cash, and dash a relatively minor endeavor for our development team, but a huge benefit for our crypto customers,” he said. Bitun Releases Cold Wallet for Institutions\nAn enterprise-level cryptocurrency cold wallet hardware has been displayed at the 2018 Global Summit in Japan this week. Developers at Bitun, a private bank of blockchain assets, claim that their product is different from any traditional cold wallet. It is completely isolated from the internet and employs a military anti-corrosion technique. The hardware CPU adopts the Secure Boot and Efuse mechanisms, combined with data encryption chips, they said.\nThe security level is recognized by licensed exchanges, according to a PRnewswire report, quoting Bitun representatives. The cold wallet also incorporates technologies such as NFC , face and iris recognition, and it’s verified simultaneously with the smart authorized device for signature. The user can also complete the multi-level approval in the signature process on the mobile hotspot APP. The official release of Bitun’s cryptocurrency cold wallet is scheduled for July this year.\nWhat are your thoughts on the stories in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief?

The digital currency has taken the world by storm in early 2000’s in hopes of decentralizing global banks . Bitcoin has been coined (no put intended) as the next big thing in the monetary race.\nHowever, recent shifts in trends have shown that people simply don’t care about bitcoin as much as they did several years ago. Why have people suddenly become so oblivious to the bitcoin currency if it aimed to solve so many global issues in regards to money as a whole? Attention skyrockets the value\nThe popularity of bitcoin couldn’t be controlled once the word got out. Everyone jumped on the bitcoin wagon in hopes of buying a coin or two without thinking of the consequences. Bitcoin transactions, purchases and trade were very hard to track before the official ledger was introduced in 2009.\nThe increased attention from both users and the public made it very difficult to get a hold of new coins at one point. This is why bitcoin mining became a trend that is somewhat dying down in recent months.\nToo much attention caused a sudden shift in overall value of bitcoins which are now ludicrously expensive. In order to get a single bitcoin, an individual should be prepared to hand over around $10,000 – for a virtual currency coin. Blockchain took the spotlight\nIn order to combat the increasing difficulty of tracking bitcoin, a new cloud technology was introduced. Blockchain effectively made it harder to trade bitcoin without anyone knowing. Every single coin on the market is tracked via a public ledger and everyone can get access to it fairly easily.\nWhile this ledger did make it harder to trade unsolicited and illegal goods for bitcoin, the corporate niche found another use of it entirely. Blockchain represents a groundbreaking system for financial tracking in whatever sphere someone might operate.\nThis technology made it possible to keep records and financial trails on a cloud server without any chance of them getting lost. As blockchain became more popular in the corporate sphere, the purpose of its inception became more and more irrelevant – and so the attention to bitcoin fell yet again. Instability equals insecurity\nBitcoin is a severely instable currency. Depending on the success of miners and traders, the currency can fluctuate from $100 to $10,000 in a matter of days. This instability is the cause of the limited number of coins on the market as well as their public tracking. While miners do create new coins, their output isn’t effective enough to warrant stability.\nThis is why so many people decided to give bitcoin a rest and move on with their lives. Even online services such as translation reviews sites haven’t implemented bitcoin as an official payment form. This means that not only are individuals wary of investing into bitcoin, but so is the corporate sector.\nNot to mention that international banks don’t even consider bitcoin a legitimate payment method, often referring to it as a fleeting trend. An insecure currency means that anyone that invests in it might be left broke and on the street in a matter of days or weeks – no one wants that kind of pressure in their lives. Deep web reputation\nNietzsche once said: “If you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back at you.” The popularity and wide-spread appeal of bitcoin meant that anyone could get their hands on them. The most notable example of this practice is the deep web implementation of bitcoin as an official form of payment .\nAnything you might want to get from the deep web can be bought via bitcoin. There is no need to emphasize that the deep web represents the seemingly invisible side of the internet where moral codes don’t apply. This kind of reputation doesn’t make bitcoin any more appealing to the public eye, and the results can be seen even today.\nThe implementations of bitcoin on the deep web and the fact that every coin is closely monitored by blockchain mean that investing into this currency is a bad idea. This reputation is one of the important reasons why people have started turning their heads in mass away from bitcoin as a viable solution to their monetary needs. It remains in the cloud\nBitcoin doesn’t exist outside of the cloud. While you can find dozens of photos that showcase bitcoin “coins”, these coins don’t actually exist. Bitcoins are clusters of code that are traded between different owners on the internet. While we are all used to having credit cards on us and not actual cash, bitcoin is even more elusive than that.\nNo material form to speak of means that the majority of people are naturally skeptical about the subject. As time went on, bitcoin became a phrase that is tossed around forums and social gatherings but very few people can define what it is even today. Bitcoin was and will remain a strictly cloud-based currency conjured up by miners and traders. This makes it a very hard sell for people with actual monetary issues, bills to pay and families to feed. Too many variants\nBitcoin gave birth to a term we now refer to as “cryptocurrency”. There are dozens of cryptocurrencies on the web, all claiming to be “the one”. This caused a mass confusion among unlearned observers which caused an additional barrier to be formed. How could anyone invest into bitcoin when there are as many variants of it as there are international monetary currencies?\nWhile most were apprehensive of investing into different coin variants, some have found relative success in obtaining hefty sums of money. However, the value of said money depends solely on the trendiness it received on that day. With many fake currencies popping up, people simply brushed aside the notion of ever investing into cryptocurrencies themselves.\nThe future of –coin\nWith dwindling public support and a lack of progress, cryptocurrencies have effectively lost their charm. The explosion of bitcoin mining in the past several months represents a last effort to breathe life into a trend that is fading away. People have stopped paying attention to bitcoin and have already started looking forward to the next big thing – utilizing blockchain technologies.\nDon’t invest into unstable and insecure venues if you are unsure of your return on investment. Sometimes it’s best to count to ten and think objectively about how good something really is. If bitcoin was as good as it was advertised, we wouldn’t be thinking about the fading attention it receives today.\nRelated posts:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T15:50:34.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c60b02eccf364861e1dccc72befc3a1d3a7fb3cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYib7EjSz.tccN4U67VJ5Ko-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Saving Bitcoins for your Children", "title_full": "Saving Bitcoins for your Children", "published": "2018-05-25T15:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c60b02eccf364861e1dccc72befc3a1d3a7fb3cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYib7EjSz.tccN4U67VJ5Ko-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "coinriver", "published": "2018-05-25T15:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Saving Bitcoins for your Children", "text": "Saving bitcoin for your children is a great idea but it depends on the level of maturity and the area of interest of your children.

Grant West was responsible for attacks on more than 100 companies worldwide. He predominately used ‘phishing’ email scams to obtain the financial data of tens of thousands of customers. Operating under the pseudonym \"Courvoisier\", West would then sell this personal data in different market places on the dark web. West would convert the profit made from selling financial details online into Bitcoins, and store these in multiple accounts. West was sentenced on Friday, 25 May at Southwark Crown Court to ten years and eight months’ imprisonment. Officers from the Met’s Police Cyber Crime Unit (MPCCU) arrested and charged West in September 2017 following a two-year investigation. He was identified as the head of an Organised Crime Network (OCN) which predominantly targeted London-based organisations. Throughout the course of the investigation detectives discovered evidence of West conducting cyber attacks on the websites of 17 major firms including Sainsbury’s, Nectar, Groupon, AO.com, Ladbrokes, Coral Betting, Uber, Vitality, RS Feva Class Association 2017, Asda, the British Cardiovascular Society, Mighty Deals Limited, Truly Experiences Ltd, T Mobile, M R Porter, the Finnish Bitcoin exchange, and Argos. Following West’s arrest, approximately £500,000 worth of Bitcoin was seized from a number of his accounts. This is the first time the Met has seized a form of cryptocurrency, with only one other seizure of virtual currency recorded in the UK. West started trading on the dark web in March 2015 and completed more than 47,000 sales from an online \"store\". As well as financial data, he also sold cannabis which he shipped to customers, and ‘how to’ guides instructing others how to carry out cyber attacks. Between July and December 2015, West perpetrated a phishing scam masquerading as online takeaway service Just Eat, in an attempt to obtain the personal details of 165,000 people. Although no financial information was obtained, his actions cost the firm approximately £200,000. West carried out the attacks from a laptop belonging to his girlfriend, Rachael Brookes. He also stored personal financial information, also known as \"fullz\", belonging to more than 100,000 people on the device. Officers also recovered an SD card from West’s home address in Kent and discovered approximately 78 million individual usernames and passwords as well as 63,000 credit and debit card details stored on it. As well as selling information online, West also regularly used stolen credit card details to pay for items for himself, including holidays, food, shopping and household goods. Throughout the course of the investigation £25,000 cash and half a kilogram of cannabis was seized from storage units rented by West across Kent. Grant West, 26 (15.02.92) of Ashcroft Caravan Park, Sheerness, Kent, pleaded guilty to the following offences at Southwark Crown Court on 14 December 2017. 2 x conspiracy to defraud; 2 x possession of criminal property; 1 x unauthorised modification of computer material; 1 x possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply; 1 x possession of Class B drug 1 x attempting to supply a controlled drug; 1 x offering to supply a Class B drug, and; 1 x concealing/removing criminal property from England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. Rachael Brookes, 26 (22.02.92) of Denbigh, North Wales pleaded guilty to unauthorised use of computer material at Southwark Crown Court on 7 March. Brookes was sentenced on Wednesday, 2 May at Southwark Crown Court to a two year community order. Detective Chief Superintendent Mick Gallagher, Head of the Met’s Organised Crime Command, said: \"This case illustrates the lengths that our detectives will go to in order to pursue offenders on the dark web. We will use many different measures to ensure such offenders are identified, prosecuted and their assets are seized. This is the first time we have seized a cryptocurrency and we are determined to remain one step ahead of cyber criminals who believe they can act with impunity. \"I wish to thank our partners within the MPS and in both public and private industry who have all assisted with this investigation which was incredibly complex and lengthy. I am very proud of my team for bringing this offender to justice. \"To reduce your chances of being a victim of cybercrime, it is important to use strong passwords, preferably three different words and numbers and symbols.

As a second area of interest, his book also provides a snapshot of what it was like to be a player in the early days of Bitcoin, a completely unsecured currency that could collapse at any moment (before you say you don’t take risks, that’s the same as the Euro, Dollar and the Swiss Franc. The only difference is, no government controls the ledger). Symbiosis or parasite? I’m referring to the bug, not those governments, but may as well be sometimes. The bug’s nature is kept uncertain until nearer the end and certainly the human subject, I won’t use the word hero, sees it differently to the readers until the end. He’s got nothing to lose, so this is just another way to chase the dragon. Like an HG Wells short story or Peter Cook’s Bedazzled , the character always gets a disappointing or cynical version of his wishes but that deepens the atmosphere of excruciating, creepy brilliance that pervades the middle to closing stages. There’s no poetry to this novel, just the imagery of creeping, low-life humanity going squirmingly, cinematically dribbling into the play-pit of madness. The bug loves being with you and blocks your pain receptors, then causes acquaintances to fetch what you need, no matter at what cost to themselves. Then there’s a sense that the whole splitting biomass could move into exponential growth, through Bitcoin and the regular postal service. There’s a sense of repulsion and then the surprising realisation that the main character feels no repulsion at all at what is happening in his life. What is this life form doing to him? It’s got a drug dealer and some low-brow racists in it, which is ugly, but they do get their come uppance and I can see every knight needs his monsters. The low life is needed though because who else goes shopping on the dark net? This is written at the interface between known and unknown, or more accurately world and underworld in the Greek sense, so of course the author chose a character who circles on the bottom level boundary between world/underworld and has then eased apart the veil separating them to let something through. So, now there’s a creature in Eden that shouldn’t be there, or maybe it should and the celestial designer knows about it because there’s a bigger scheme that we are not aware of. The worm in the bud feeds on the damask cheek, yin in the yang, always and everywhere. I liked this book very much, even if it was closer to a dot of yang in the yang – painful experiences happen to the kind of people who invite the pain in. It was creepy cool, tarnished purity, bitterly dark with no salvation in places and pet-care friendly in others but it was original and represented an uncharming approach to the fantasy of buying some unique, fey thing, letting it into your home, your life and watching it build a nest, incrementally changing both of you. If you only like to read stories that stay under control, this isn’t one of those. If you want something unusual, shocking, yet also colourful and stimulating in its blatant and fascinating weirdness, you’ve found it. I recommend the book but please don’t post any prosperity bugs to me.

Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]\nAs for what fueled these sharp declines, analysts have provided mixed views.\nBitcoin Cash’s Ongoing Struggle\nIqbal Gandham, UK Managing Director at eToro , voiced his concerns about Bitcoin Cash, emphasizing the digital currency’s continued struggle to effectively be the “default” version of Bitcoin.\n“Though it recently upgraded its blockchain protocol, it seems that Bitcoin Cash has yet to reassure the crypto community that it can provide a more stable framework for transactions and that it really is ‘Bitcoin,'” said Gandham.\n“This lack of clarity, has repeatedly called into question the authenticity of Bitcoin Cash, and until that is resolved the direction of price movement will always carry an air of uncertainty,” he stated.\n‘A Dangerous Game’\nMarshall Swatt, founder & president of Swatt Exchange , offered a similar point of view.\n“I think that Roger Ver is playing a dangerous game trying to manipulate people to back Bitcoin Cash rather than Bitcoin,” he stated.\n“I don’t have a problem with a Bitcoin Cash per se and I think it has a valid use in the market, but it isn’t helping things to fight a brand battle between BTC and BCH. The antagonism doesn’t play to BCH’s long-term adoption.”\nBroader Market Movements\nSome analysts focused more on the broader digital currency market, emphasizing that it has been encountering some headwinds lately.\nThe total value of this market fell to as little as $324.7 billion today, down 12.7% over the last 24 hours and 17% since roughly the same time that Bitcoin Cash reached an intraday high on Sunday.\nDavid Johnson, CEO of tasking platform Latium , weighed in on these trends, emphasizing that Bitcoin Cash was certainly not the only digital currency to lose value in the last few days.\n“I am less inclined to blame this move on any kind of certainty that Bitcoin Cash is losing its following due to network issues,” he stated.\n“I am more inclined to say there are normal market correlations between Bitcoin and all other coins.”\nThe broader market has been experiencing a “small pull back,” which has helped push Bitcoin Cash lower, said Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of digital currency data platform CryptoCompare .\nDisclosure: I own some Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ether.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://latium.org/", "https://www.cryptocompare.com/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/cbovaird/2018/05/22/bitcoin-cash-tumbles-as-it-faces-multiple-headwinds/#3d2597d9de59", "http://www.swatt.com/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/cbovaird/2018/05/23/bitcoin-cash-drops-to-lowest-in-more-than-a-month/?utm_source=FBPAGE&utm_medium=social&utm_content=1555690573&utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesMainFB", "https://coinmarketcap.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "iqbal gandham", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin cash", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T15:55:39.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6e09a14e46fdc92fcbb5599abdd17b04007859f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf31IpfYk89XoUU55XutxLDam_c1k8ftB3Yu3oC2_.ZWD3tZU6RD8AUuC8dYbLPzX599Q4ZB3l5ZhMvopryW6R7qYio2Olo86VZg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "As messy as SegWit activation was, it is actually one of most decentralized ways to activate something.

A luxury cryptocurrency concierge now accepts BCH for the items it offers to the crypto rich – a logical step, according to its founder. An online travel agency is introducing three new coins to its payment options, including bitcoin cash, after \"a huge uptick in the number of customers requesting alternative currencies\". Also, a cold wallet for institutions hits the market soon.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: Main Street Adopts Bitcoin Ahead of Wall Street\nLuxury Purveyor White Now Accepts Bitcoin Cash A US-based luxury crypto concierge service is now accepting bitcoin cash (BCH). The White Company, founded by former executive at Formula 1 and LVMH, Elizabeth White, offers high-end products and luxury brands, including fine watches and sports cars. It has become the latest business to take advantage of the benefits of BCH payments, which include substantially lower transaction fees.\nThis business is trying to fill the market niche for services to those rich customers who want to acquire luxurious items, like private jets, Lamborghinis, and famous artworks, in a more discreet way. That's why the White Company accepts only cryptocurrency.\nIt all started with payments in bitcoin core (BTC), litecoin (LTC) and ethereum (ETH). However, the exponential growth of the business, of crypto wealth, in general, and the growing popularity of bitcoin cash, in particular, have led to the introduction of BCH payments. It comes as a recognition of the lower transaction fees and faster processing times of the bitcoin cash network, in comparison to legacy cryptocurrencies. The New York headquartered company has also decided to discontinue the LTC option.\nNoting that \"trust is vital in this space,\" Elizabeth White was quoted as saying: \"I have watched with interest both the growth and the early-adopters of bitcoin cash and I can see that the White Company and BCH are natural partners.\" And, according to a corporate press release, the partnership represents a logical next step for the development of the business.\nCheapair Introduces Payments in Three Cryptos, including BCH Online travel agency Cheapair.com has also announced it is now accepting bitcoin cash for booking flights and hotels. \"It's official!\" the California-based company said in a post on Twitter, confirming it has added BCH to the available payment options, along with two other cryptocurrencies – litecoin (LTC) and dash (DASH). \"Help us spread the word #cryptocurrency fans!\" tweeted the agency, which also accepts bitcoin core (BTC).\nAccording to Cheapair , the list of the supported cryptocurrencies has been expanded in response to customer demand. The company noted the development of a number of new cryptocurrencies aimed at avoiding some of the challenges that have emerged with BTC, whose network has previously been stressed by higher transaction volumes. In different ways, bitcoin cash, litecoin and dash all promise improved transaction potential over their predecessor, being either faster or with lower fees attached, Cheapair explained.\n\"Our cryptocurrency customers tend to be very vocal about what they want, something we appreciate very much. Over the last six months, we've seen a huge uptick in the number of customers requesting alternative currencies, so we've worked hard to integrate the three that were most requested,\" Cheapair CEO Jeff Klee commented.\nKlee added that the company has already streamlined the process of converting the accepted cryptocurrency to fiat money, which is then paid to airline and hotel suppliers. \"That made adding litecoin, bitcoin cash, and dash a relatively minor endeavor for our development team, but a huge benefit for our crypto customers,\" he said.\nBitun Releases Cold Wallet for Institutions An enterprise-level cryptocurrency cold wallet hardware has been displayed at the 2018 Global Summit in Japan this week. Developers at Bitun, a private bank of blockchain assets, claim that their product is different from any traditional cold wallet. It is completely isolated from the internet and employs a military anti-corrosion technique. The hardware CPU adopts the Secure Boot and Efuse mechanisms, combined with data encryption chips, they said.\nThe security level is recognized by licensed exchanges, according to a PRnewswire report, quoting Bitun representatives. The cold wallet also incorporates technologies such as NFC , face and iris recognition, and it's verified simultaneously with the smart authorized device for signature. The user can also complete the multi-level approval in the signature process on the mobile hotspot APP. The official release of Bitun's cryptocurrency cold wallet is scheduled for July this year.\nWhat are your thoughts on the stories in today's edition of Bitcoin in Brief?

To this effect, the introduction of OpenNode satisfies that need and being the first of it's kind, and it indeed looks like a promising innovation.\nOpenNode's Features A platform suitable for businesses of all sizes, the tools and features are designed to ensure that using bitcoin is more accessible for both customers and merchants. This advent also eliminates the barriers that are usually faced while making bitcoin transactions such as high transaction fees and technical integrations.\nTransacting with bitcoin along the famed Lightning Network will be instant and will incur almost zero fees. Things like the OpenNode payment processor will return bitcoin to a convenience medium of exchange. There's even hope of bitcoin payments becoming easier than credit card transactions.\nWith the Bitcoin network growing quickly and mass-adoption following closely in the mainstream market, a group of bitcoin designers and lightning network explorers are working on a product to simplify the current suite of crypto tools. The developers believe a genuine user experience will be the stepping stone in this process.\nUser-Friendly Interface\n( Source : OpenNode )\nOpenNode boasts the following features:\nMultiple payment options: Lightning & on-chain No frauds or chargebacks Competitive pricing In-house dashboard Automatic and manual withdrawals Customizable plugins & convenient APIs The Roadmap To edge an inch closer to perfection, the people at OpenNode are testing it with their own community and working on feedbacks in real-time. Furthermore, to better scale their services, multiple new merchants will be called on-board.\nShopify and other e-commerce platforms will be getting plugins to make OpenNode available at various webstores. The firm is also in talks with PoS businesses and other resources to introduce Lightning Network-enabled devices. As stated on the blog:\n\"There is a lot of work ahead, but we couldn't be more excited to pave the way for this revolutionary technology with all of you.\"\nPreviously, the team worked on similar products, with the end-goal of augmenting bitcoin's adoption rate.

It wasn’t until the world woke up to losing all their savings in a currency no one even heard of or understood at the time that people started paying attention to the term Bitcoin, or digital currency. But make no mistake; Bitcoin is real money and it’s unlike anything you’ve ever seen or heard of. Before we jump into the discussion, let’s take a peek into the history and emergence of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash\nIn the early 2009, an unknown person or a group of person working under the alias Satoshi Nakamoto developed a mysterious digital payment system, Bitcoin that would allow you to make transactions without worrying about the middlemen – meaning no banks or no central authority. It was the world’s first decentralized digital currency, a cryptocurrency and can be used to buy almost anything online anonymously. As a result, international payments got a whole lot cheaper as bitcoins are not bound to any country or subject to regulation. Soon bitcoins became the second biggest thing to hit the global market after the invention of currency. Bitcoins have come a long way since its inception in 2009.\nBy 2013, the Bitcoin market crossed the billion dollar mark which pushed the cryptocurrency’s ecosystem into a whole new level. What started merely as a digital payment system soon became a global sensation and in the late 2014, bitcoins announced its partnership with the global leader in digital payment platform, PayPal. There were mixed responses regarding Bitcoin’s future following a slow start in the year 2015 and the community suffered a major setback as $5 million worth of bitcoins were reportedly stolen. Plus there have been question regarding how Bitcoin should scale its protocol effectively. As a result, the Bitcoin network released a new cryptocurrency in 2017 called Bitcoin Cash.\nThe new cryptocurrency was created as a result of the Bitcoin fork with almost same goal and to fulfill the original promise of Bitcoin but with a few upgrades. Both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash transaction are conducted on blockchains – a digital decentralized pubic ledger used to record transactions across the Bitcoin community. Think of a block as a vehicle which carries transactions from one place to another and once the block reaches its destination, the transaction is completed and chain concludes. Larger the block, more transactions it can hold and eventually faster the processing time. Bitcoin Cash increased the block size from 1 MB to 8 MB and also removed the concept of Segregated Witness.\nDifference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash Definition of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash\nBoth Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are an electronic peer-to-peer payment system, a cryptocurrency which can be used for performing transactions online anonymously. Bitcoin Cash is a new cryptocurrency emerged as a result of the Bitcoin’s hard fork to avoid the protocol updates that the Segregated Witness brought about. Both are stored in a virtual back account, a digital wallet that allows you to send or receive bitcoins, save money, or pay for merchandise. The main difference between the two is the Max Blocksize Limit. Bitcoin Cash increased the block size which allows more transactions to be processed at a time. Block Size\nThe maximum blocksize limit of 1 MB in Bitcoin has caused massive scalability issues which would make more difficult to manipulate the ledgers within the blockchain. While both serve same the purpose – to let the users sell or buy anything online anonymously meaning the transactions cannot be traced back to the users – Bitcoin can only process as much as seven transactions per second which contributes to longer waiting times. Bitcoin Cash solved the problem by increasing the size of blocks from 1 MB to 8 MB so that more transactions can be processed at a time which eventually results in faster payments. Segregated Witness\nSegregated Witness, or SegWit, is a scaling solution protocol designed to improve on the method of handling Bitcoin transactions. The idea of SegWit was presented by the Bitcoin developer Peter Wuille in the late 2015 aimed to change the way information is stored in Blockchain in order to solve the scalability problem of Bitcoin. The idea is to reduce the size of the Bitcoin transaction by removing the signature information from the Blockchain without affecting the transaction ID which allows for greater transaction volumes. Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, does not support SegWit. Security and Stability of Bitcoin Vs. Bitcoin Cash\nAlthough, Bitcoin Cash is fast emerging as a global peer-to-peer electronic payment system designed specifically to promote faster transaction processing times and lower fees, Bitcoin has a much larger and distributed network and more infrastructure behind it which accounts for better security and stability on the long run. Additionally, Bitcoin is more profitable to mine than Bitcoin Cash. Plus Bitcoin excels in strength of hashing power which accounts for greater network stability. Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash: Comparison Chart\nSummary of Bitcoin Vs. Bitcoin Cash\nBitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are two cryptocurrency borne out of the forks from the Bitcoin blockchain meaning anyone holding Bitcoins at the time of fork would now have an equivalent amount of Bitcoin Cash. Both are similar in many ways except with a few technical differences such as mining algorithm. The main difference between the two is the Max Blocksize Limit which is limited to 1 MB in Bitcoin, whereas the block size is increased from 1 MB to 8 MB in Bitcoin Cash which accounts for faster transaction processing times and lower fees. Bitcoin is still the legacy cryptocurrency we’ve known for years and considering its network is widely distributed throughout, the community is growing at an unprecedented rate with no signs of slowing down.

A strong group of miners who are willing to support the network creates the image that Bitcoin is very strong and well positioned going forward. As we move closer to the end of Q2 and into Q3 fundamentals will continue to improve and my bet is that price action will surely catch up to the strong fundamentals. Without a strong group of miners to support the network, Bitcoin would surely be headed for a grim future. That is not the case judging by the data. Miners are still bullish long term as are we.\nDisclaimer: I own Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in my wallet", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T10:25:29.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c52964196be722dc8b5b43944998fe6340731755", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYnYB6pWrRpKer.c4y5YTLg-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why so many Bitcoin users have fear of governments?", "title_full": "Why so many Bitcoin users have fear of governments?", "published": "2018-05-25T15:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.103, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c52964196be722dc8b5b43944998fe6340731755", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmYnYB6pWrRpKer.c4y5YTLg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sofiyah", "published": "2018-05-25T15:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why so many Bitcoin users have fear of governments?", "text": "more precisely to fear the government for fear if bitcoin will be banned in that country. because there are some countries that have banned bitcoin.\nI think there will be hope that the government will start accepting bitcoin in the economy, business or be legal anywhere. but don't know when. slowly government will receive bitcoin because bitcoin will really help us.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T11:00:22.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f85c5f8ee5202bb1a67e0002ed01ff02b5ec01e5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrrRORleMxMhZzq0jo.zMuJ2fDmftVfh4_vY6qWolu24zV7ABaHy0iiiNMNwyyjlUYRxp6ShR6KhbvOAbR.NsGs0w.Kc4LBGsr0mUifcNf13EKanLYjcKXb1wGPD1qZPGjpIei09XzKzzVvNEwmtXzoXdb8GfAJFXE-", "site_full": "southafrica.trendolizer.com", "site": "trendolizer.com", "site_section": "http://southafrica.trendolizer.com/atom.xml", "site_categories": ["travel", "africa"], "section_title": "South Africa", "title": "South African authorities investigates $80m bitcoin scam | IOL Business Report", "title_full": "South African authorities investigates $80m bitcoin scam | IOL Business Report", "published": "2018-05-25T15:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://southafrica.trendolizer.com/images/caption_8822851.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 63018, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f85c5f8ee5202bb1a67e0002ed01ff02b5ec01e5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOrrRORleMxMhZzq0jo.zMuJ2fDmftVfh4_vY6qWolu24zV7ABaHy0iiiNMNwyyjlUYRxp6ShR6KhbvOAbR.NsGs0w.Kc4LBGsr0mUifcNf13EKanLYjcKXb1wGPD1qZPGjpIei09XzKzzVvNEwmtXzoXdb8GfAJFXE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Maarten Schenk", "published": "2018-05-25T15:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "South African authorities investigates $80m bitcoin scam | IOL Business Report", "text": "South African authorities investigates $80m bitcoin scam | IOL Business Report The biggest internet trends, by email Be the first to see it...

A request for comment by Reuters sent to an email address listed on the website as belonging to Twain received no response.\n“Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by agents of BTC Global,” the police said in a statement.\n“Some of the investors got paid in terms of the agreement. However, the payments suddenly stopped.”\nLocal technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than $50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global.\n“This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they’ve lost money,” police investigator Yolisa Matakata said.\nThe investigation follows a case this week where kidnappers demanded a ransom in bitcoin of nearly $120,000 to release a South African teenage boy.\nOn Thursday South Africa’s central bank said it was in the process of determining whether cryptocurrencies complied with its financial surveillance and exchange control regulations.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "twain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven twain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc global", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T09:45:17.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f81233e93512fef0b2a02279a309962f7997c918", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmarUYE.VWzGLtMKcf7XNSBk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Is Bitcoin a good idea?", "title_full": "Is Bitcoin a good idea?", "published": "2018-05-25T15:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.036, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f81233e93512fef0b2a02279a309962f7997c918", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmarUYE.VWzGLtMKcf7XNSBk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Radio-Active", "published": "2018-05-25T15:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is Bitcoin a good idea?", "text": "Quote: from: maryjaysblog on May 22, 2018, 10:33:53 AM Bitcoin hit an intermediate-term bottom during the SEC and CFTC hearing.

This was the 13th decline of 30% or more in the last ﬁve years.\nNow is a great time to buy bitcoin. Its trading close to its 200-day moving average, which has historically been a good buy point.\nIndeed now is a good time to buy, the current market is falling now. bitcoin price is on the 7k

Register Now!\nThe United States Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have opened a joint criminal investigation into price manipulation of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, according to a Bloomberg report.\nThe illicit tactics reportedly being investigated include spoofing and wash trading.\nBitcoin's share prices have been fluctuating wildly over the past year, ranging from US$1,800 to almost $20,000, leading to rumors of price manipulation.\nNews of the joint DoJ-CFTC probe pushed bitcoin's share prices to a six-week low. The cryptocurrency's price stood at $7,545 at mid-day Thursday.\nThe probe \"will help the market,\" said Darryll DiPietro, CEO of Concierge Club .\n\"Once everyone gets put under a microscope, it will be difficult for some of those sh*tty companies launching dicey IPOs,\" he told the E-Commerce Times. \"I'm not for regulation per se -- I believe in a decentralized market -- but I'm for controlling those sh*tty companies. Legitimate projects will benefit from this.\"\nBoth DoJ spokesperson Nicole Navas Oxman and CFTC spokesperson Donna Faulk-White declined to comment for this story.\nMarket Manipulation Murmurs Back in 2017, Hackernoon ran a story alleging A single entity dubbed \"Spoofy\" was responsible for dominating the price of bitcoin , according to a story Hackernoon ran last year.\nSpoofy was spoofing and engaging in wash trading, according to the report, and had come up with a scheme it named \"Tether.\"\nThat article sparked considerable comment .\nAn academic paper on price manipulation in the bitcoin system back in 2013, which focused on the Mt. Gox exchange in Japan, drew media attention earlier this year. .\nThe CFTC earlier this month issued guidance for listing virtual currency derivative products. Also, two CFTC officials mentioned the possibility of regulating cryptocurrencies, suggesting cooperation between the CFTC and the SEC.\nThe CFTC has issued an advisory warning of virtual currency pump-and-dump schemes.\n\"We're facing a speculative bubble in which the market hasn't firmly determined the balance of all the upside and the risk associated with cryptocurrencies,\" noted Andreas Scherer, managing partner at Salto Partners .\nCryptocurrencies are \"still a relatively small fraction of the global financial transaction volume,\" he told the E-Commerce Times, and trading platforms have not yet implemented all the common safeguards in place at established stock exchanges. \"So, known manipulation strategies such as spoofing occur unmitigated.\"\nCryptocurrency Scams Twitter, Google and Facebook have banned cryptocurrency ads due to the high level of scams in the field.\nOf nearly 1,500 cryptocurrency offerings examined, 271 -- or about 20 percent -- were dubious, a Wall Street Journal investigation found. Among the suspicious findings were missing or fake executive teams, the use of plagiarized investor documents, and promises of guaranteed returns.\nBanks generally have downplayed bitcoin, and JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon last year took several shots at the currency, whose share prices fell each time he launched an attack.\nSeveral countries, including China, have banned bitcoin.\n\"The governments and major banks are trying to manipulate the market,\" DiPietro remarked.\nThe banks likely will be targeted by the DoJ because \"its big score will be taking down one of these big companies,\" he said, adding that Facebook reportedly has been working on its own cryptocurrency, and thus has an ulterior motive.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://weis2017.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/05/WEIS_2017_paper_21.pdf", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/buyer-beware-hundreds-of-bitcoin-wannabes-show-hallmarks-of-fraud-1526573115", "https://www.ectnews.com/", "https://coincierge.club/", "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14934874", "https://static.adzerk.net/ados.js", "http://www.ectnews.com/", "https://hackernoon.com/meet-spoofy-how-a-single-entity-dominates-the-price-of-bitcoin-39c711d28eb4", "https://go.liquidweb.com/managed-hosting-for-woocommerce/?utm_campaign=ma-mwch-q2may18-mwchbuiltforwoo&utm_source=ect&utm_medium=adv&utm_content=cita"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "richard adhikari", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "darryll dipietro", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "e-commerce times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "concierge club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T00:59:59.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b299e2ac83aad312eab367f05d3dcdd64a8854c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme70whDsfpXkp2wXF4bT75w-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=240.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Tokens (Altcoins)", "title": "[ANN] Bitcoin ONE - hard fork Bitcoin (525 000 block)", "title_full": "[ANN] Bitcoin ONE - hard fork Bitcoin (525 000 block)", "published": "2018-05-25T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b299e2ac83aad312eab367f05d3dcdd64a8854c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme70whDsfpXkp2wXF4bT75w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sorrelin", "published": "2018-05-25T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "[ANN] Bitcoin ONE - hard fork Bitcoin (525 000 block)", "text": "Quote: from: Dreadtrader on May 25, 2018, 06:37:20 AM Quote: from: sorrelin on May 25, 2018, 06:26:45 AM Quote: from: Dreadtrader on May 25, 2018, 06:15:12 AM Quote: from: sorrelin on May 25, 2018, 06:03:44 AM Quote: from: Dreadtrader on May 25, 2018, 05:51:32 AM i read the description of the B1.cash platform on their site, it seems that its gonna be a good project. but i didnt really understand what was meant by the phrase that Bitcoin ONE was gonna be a payment method on the platform?\nive paid attention to this, too, when i was getting acquainted with the exchange.\nas far as i understand, it means that all the transactions within the framework of the platform will be made with this cryptocurrency\nwhats the point? therere a lot other cryptocurrencies and fiat money, its easier to use them, and its more convenient to the users, IMHO\ni think they just want to launch smthng more significant than just a mobile app for working with any money, cryptocurrency and etc. so theyll have their own single processing available all over the world\ndoesnt it look like kinda bank?

During the past 50 bars, there have been 0 white candles and 0 black candles.\nA falling window occurred (where the bottom of the previous shadow is above the top of the current shadow). This usually implies a continuation of a bearish trend. There have been 24 falling windows in the last 50 candles–this makes the current falling window even more bearish.\nA gravestone doji occurred. This often signifies a top (the longer the upper shadow, the more bearish the signal).\nMomentum Indicators\nMomentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators.\nStochastic Oscillator\nOne method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 6.8867. This is an oversold reading. However, a signal is not generated until the Oscillator crosses above 20 The last signal was a buy 2 period(s) ago.\nRelative Strength Index (RSI)\nThe RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 36.27. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 38 period(s) ago.\nCommodity Channel Index (CCI)\nThe CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -145.This is an oversold reading. However, a signal isn’t generated until the indicator crosses above -100. The last signal was a buy 3 period(s) ago.\nMACD\nThe Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a sell 9 period(s) ago.\nRex Takasugi – TD Profile\nNYSE BitcoinIndx closed down -170.660 at 7,550.296.

The White Company, founded by former executive at Formula 1 and LVMH, Elizabeth White, offers high-end products and luxury brands, including fine watches and sports cars. It has become the latest business to take advantage of the benefits of BCH payments, which include substantially lower transaction fees.\nThis business is trying to fill the market niche for services to those rich customers who want to acquire luxurious items, like private jets, Lamborghinis, and famous artworks, in a more discreet way. That’s why the White Company accepts only cryptocurrency.\nIt all started with payments in bitcoin core (BTC), litecoin (LTC) and ethereum (ETH). However, the exponential growth of the business, of crypto wealth, in general, and the growing popularity of bitcoin cash, in particular, have led to the introduction of BCH payments. It comes as a recognition of the lower transaction fees and faster processing times of the bitcoin cash network, in comparison to legacy cryptocurrencies. The New York headquartered company has also decided to discontinue the LTC option.\nNoting that “trust is vital in this space,” Elizabeth White was quoted as saying: “I have watched with interest both the growth and the early-adopters of bitcoin cash and I can see that the White Company and BCH are natural partners.” And, according to a corporate press release, the partnership represents a logical next step for the development of the business. Cheapair Introduces Payments in Three Cryptos, including BCH\nOnline travel agency Cheapair.com has also announced it is now accepting bitcoin cash for booking flights and hotels. “It’s official!” the California-based company said in a post on Twitter, confirming it has added BCH to the available payment options, along with two other cryptocurrencies – litecoin (LTC) and dash (DASH). “Help us spread the word #cryptocurrency fans!” tweeted the agency, which also accepts bitcoin core (BTC).\nAccording to Cheapair , the list of the supported cryptocurrencies has been expanded in response to customer demand. The company noted the development of a number of new cryptocurrencies aimed at avoiding some of the challenges that have emerged with BTC, whose network has previously been stressed by higher transaction volumes. In different ways, bitcoin cash, litecoin and dash all promise improved transaction potential over their predecessor, being either faster or with lower fees attached, Cheapair explained.\n“Our cryptocurrency customers tend to be very vocal about what they want, something we appreciate very much. Over the last six months, we’ve seen a huge uptick in the number of customers requesting alternative currencies, so we’ve worked hard to integrate the three that were most requested,” Cheapair CEO Jeff Klee commented.\nKlee added that the company has already streamlined the process of converting the accepted cryptocurrency to fiat money, which is then paid to airline and hotel suppliers. “That made adding litecoin, bitcoin cash, and dash a relatively minor endeavor for our development team, but a huge benefit for our crypto customers,” he said. Bitun Releases Cold Wallet for Institutions\nAn enterprise-level cryptocurrency cold wallet hardware has been displayed at the 2018 Global Summit in Japan this week. Developers at Bitun, a private bank of blockchain assets, claim that their product is different from any traditional cold wallet. It is completely isolated from the internet and employs a military anti-corrosion technique. The hardware CPU adopts the Secure Boot and Efuse mechanisms, combined with data encryption chips, they said.\nThe security level is recognized by licensed exchanges, according to a PRnewswire report, quoting Bitun representatives. The cold wallet also incorporates technologies such as NFC , face and iris recognition, and it’s verified simultaneously with the smart authorized device for signature. The user can also complete the multi-level approval in the signature process on the mobile hotspot APP. The official release of Bitun’s cryptocurrency cold wallet is scheduled for July this year.\nWhat are your thoughts on the stories in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief?

Makes Total Sense", "text": "Artificial Intelligence Bitcoin Blockchain Cryptocurrency\nIf someone asked you to explain Bitcoin, you might say something silly like: “It’s magic money that comes from the interwebz!” You wouldn’t be wrong, but also – that’s not right. Maybe. We don’t know. Let artificial intelligence (A.I.) try to explain.\nA.I. is, like, really smart. It can even call and make you dinner reservations (and there’s no way Google’s Duplex demo was heavily edited or that the restaurant had forewarning). It safely drives cars, too . Some tests say it’s about as smart as a six-year-old . You can even get a job in Bitcoin and blockchain, which is far better than being enslaved by our machine overlords.\nSo now that we know A.I. is smarter than any human ever, let it explain Bitcoin! Did you know bitcoin is the most valuable form of electricity ever? Did you know you can “hash the code” to get bitcoin? Bitcoin is pizza calculus; did you know that, pretend-genius-with-a-tiny-human-brain?\nNo, you didn’t, because A.I. is smart and you’re just… not . Also, your weak human body is prone to getting digital money viruses that live on your DNA and allow the CIA’s chief of transactions into your brain. This is why we need tinfoil hats made from expensive silver keyboards, you know.\nBut the all-knowing A.I. brings up some interesting points, too. Is Bitcoin worth more than what your grandchildren might pay for chatlogs? If you forget you have a bitcoin wallet full of intangible currency, can it ever really be lost? Is Bob’s Pub really worth hashing for a good deal? If you visit the smallest mountain in China, will there be hills of cryptocurrency waiting for you? Can a murderer patent lives?\nGet your Wild Richards ready (easy, there) and check out the video below. It’s the most comprehensive, clear explanation of the randomly invented pretend-currency we’ve ever heard, and we’re ready to invest in whatever random coinage floats through r/CryptoCurrency next. Also, we’re inventing the term ‘machinesplaining.’ Please clap .

Last week the programmer managed to make “51% attack”, which means that he was able to seize control of most of the altcoin network.\nAccording to reports at the Bitcoin Gold forums, the attacks began on May 16, the last one was held on the 19th. The attacker was able to modify the details of transactions in the blockroom of the cryptocurrency, so he deposited funds on the exchange and immediately withdrew them, canceling the original transaction. Thanks to this, he accumulated coins on his own purse.\n“The cost of a long attack is high. Because of this, an attacker can only profit if he quickly receives something valuable from a counterfeit deposit. In turn, exchanges can automatically accept large deposits, allowing the user to quickly buy another crypto currency, and then automatically withdraw it, “representatives of Bitcoin Gold said.\nBy the time when the stock exchanges realized that the block was compromised and the transactions were invalid, the hacker had already managed to withdraw funds. The developers of altcoin advised the trading platforms to increase the number of confirmations necessary for crediting digital money to the client’s account.

For any answers to questions contact Clyde Thorburn at http://clyde-thorburn-seo-specialist-johannesburg.strikingly.com/#contact-clyde-thorburn .\nAuthor : Hugh Kimura 16 January 2018\nWatch exchanges like Coinbase at https://www.tradingheroes.com/coinbase, Bitfinex at https://www.bitfinex.com/, Poloniex at https://poloniex.com/ or CEX at https://www.tradingheroes.com/cexio. It could give it the boost you have been looking for. Software Upgrades. Over the past few years, there has been a lot of discussion in the Bitcoin community about upgrading the core software functions of Bitcoin. The primary discussion has been around the transaction speed of Bitcoin. If you have ever funded your trading account with Bitcoin or tried to buy anything with Bitcoin, you will understand what I mean. For a digital currency, the transaction time is a little slow. It can take about 30 minutes or more, to do a single transaction. Upgrading this speed has been hotly debated and finally led to the creation of Bitcoin Cash at https://www.bitcoincash.org/. After the split of Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin has taken off to new highs. There will be countless other software changes across all cryptocurrencies, so make sure that you understand the implications of those changes. Public Hype. Just like fake tweets at https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/06/21/fake-tweets-sink-stocks-what-happens-when-scammers.aspx can affect the price of a stock, any type of hype can affect the value of a cryptocurrency. Good or bad. So before you dismiss something as just hype, remember that hype moves markets too. But if you do trade hype, be sure to close your trade out long before the hype has a chance to cool off. Otherwise, it could be a very expensive lesson.\nWallet Improvements. Since you are reading this post, you probably want to start actively trading cryptocurrencies. But there are many other people who are investors and want to buy and hold for the next few years. This is where storage becomes an important part of the cryptocurrency valuation equation. Unlike traditional fiat currency that can be stored in a bank, your trading account, or your mattress at home, cryptocurrencies need to have a compatible wallet (or cold storage solution) to be stored safely. Remember that cryptocurrency is simply software. So the wallet software needs to be able to work with the cryptocurrency software. It’s like trying to use the Windows version of Microsoft Office on a Mac. That simply won’t work. Therefore, if a cryptocurrency doesn’t have a good wallet yet, that will prevent less technical investors from buying the currency. But as soon as one is available, then it makes the currency much more accessible to the masses. …and thus, more valuable. If you find that a cryptocurrency does not have a good wallet solution yet, that could be one signal that it is undervalued. Looking for opportunities to buy, immediately after the launch of the first high-quality wallet, could give you a nice short-term profit. Platform Applications. Some cryptocurrency platforms, like Ethereum, host other applications. These applications, in turn, can have their own currencies or tokens. If one of these DApps at https://www.coindesk.com/7-cool-decentralized-apps-built-ethereum/ or Decentralized Apps does very well, this can have a positive effect on the underlying platform currency.\nThe value of the tokens should theoretically be independent of the value of the platform. However, not everyone understands this and the success of one DApp can drive the price of Ether…at least in the short term. So if you are trading a platform cryptocurrency, watch promising apps on the platform closely. Government Regulation. Finally, government regulation can have a huge effect on the value of a cryptocurrency. One example is in Venezuela, where the police have been arresting Bitcoin miners at https://cointelegraph.com/news/venezuelan-bitcoin-miners-turning-to-ethereum-after-government-crackdown on made-up charges. This has forced miners to go underground or start mining Ether instead. But this could happen in any country. Any decision by the NFA at https://www.tradingheroes.com/nfa-bans-hedging-in-us-forex-accounts/ or SEC could affect the value of certain cryptocurrencies. The SEC has already banned at https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/ia_icorelatedclaims certain Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), due to the potential pump and dump situation that could happen with those coins. Be aware of current trends in government regulation and steer clear of currencies that could get red flagged by government agencies. Conclusion.

After three consecutive sell-offs within a 24-hour period, the price of bitcoin dropped from $7,900 to $7,250, eventually stabilizing at $7,400. Bear Market\nThe cryptocurrency sector is in a short-term bear cycle. In a highly volatile period like this, positive developments and events that would otherwise lead to a significant surge in the valuation of the cryptocurrency market often do not affect the market in a major way.\nAs such, in spite of the entrance of financial institutions like the New York Stock Exchange, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan, the cryptocurrency market has continued to decline.\nBased on the price trend of BTC over the past two months, it is possible that the correction continues to the higher end of the $6,000 region, considering the overly strong downward trend of BTC and other major cryptocurrencies in the global market.\nThroughout its recent history, over the past 12 months, bitcoin recorded three major drops. As seen in the 1-day price chart of BTC below, all three correction bounced back on a similar support level at $6,600. When the bitcoin price dropped from $20,000 to the $6,000 region, the bitcoin price rebounded to $12,000 after securing the $6,600 support level.\nA similar trend occurred when the price of BTCdropped from $11,000 to $6,400 and so on. It is possible that the BTC price bottoms out in the mid $6,000 region once again and immediately initiate a strong rally back to the $10,000 to $12,000 region. Why Chinese Billionaire Bought 10,000 Bitcoin in Q1\nIn the first quarter of 2018, when the BTC price dropped to the $6,000 for the first time in 2018, Chinese billionaire angel investor Wang Feng purchased 10,000 BTC in the $6,600 region. Along with bitcoin, Feng bought Theta, Ontology (ONT), Cortex (CTXC), ArcBlock (ABT), Zipper (ZIP), YeeCall (YEE), Dxchain (DXC), Charter (CAF).\n10,000 BTC, which is worth around $76,000,000, is an amount of bitcoin that is difficult to purchase on cryptocurrency exchanges without significantly driving the price up in the short-term. Feng most likely had purchased $76 million worth of bitcoin in the over-the-counter (OTC) market or directly from miners.\nA bulk purchase of bitcoin of over $50 million requires significant confidence in both the short-term and long-term price trend of BTC. Feng likely assumed that $6,600, the major support level for bitcoin, would remain as the bottom even for future corrections and bear cycles.\n“When asked about the market crash in March, he dismissed it as no big deal. He called it a short-term setback and in fact, said Cryptocurrencies rose very well in the long term,” CCN reported.\nIf the bitcoin price drops below $7,000 and to the higher end of $6,000, the market will likely experience a strong bounce and record a major rally throughout the third quarter of 2018, potentially back to the $10,000 and $12,000 region, as it did in March.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

end the day at $7,576.1, partially reversing Wednesday’s 5.94% slide.\nA positive start to the day saw Bitcoin move through to a morning high $7,729.8, falling short of the day’s first major resistance level at $7,881.3, before reversing to an intraday low and new swing lo $7,260 in the late morning, Bitcoin finding much needed support at the day’s first major support level at $7,264.\nBitcoin’s mid-day rally, off the back of the day’s low, saw Bitcoin recover to $7,500 levels by the day’s end, with the moves through the day leaving the day’s first major resistance level at $7,881.3 untested and some distance yet to travel to bring the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $7,906.4 into play.\nNegative news through the early hours was the ultimate cause to the price reversal to the day’s low, with reports of the U.S Justice Department investigating price manipulation in the cryptomarket doing the damage, recent cryptomarket news having done little to restore investor appetite ahead of an expected flurry of regulator activity this summer.\nFor the Bitcoin bulls and the broader, the afternoon recovery was good news, but with regulators and governments now looking more closely at the market and practices, more bad news is likely to be on the horizon.\nGet Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was up 0.62% to $7,624.0, with moves through the day relatively range bound, a morning $7,516.6 low and $7,654.1 high steering clear of the day’s first major support level at $7,314.13 and first major resistance level at $7,783.93.\nWith Bitcoin’s new swing lo $7,260 struck on Thursday and the afternoon recovery, which came in spite of concerns of investigations into possible price manipulation practices across the cryptomarket, the floor in the current bearish trend may have currently been struck, though sentiment is expected to deteriorate as governments and regulators roll out measures to increase oversight and control over the market.\nFor the day ahead, a break through the day’s first major resistance level at $7,783.93 would be needed to bring the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $7,906.4 and $8,000 levels into play, a move needed to affirm a near-term bottoming out of the bearish trend.\nFailure to move through to $7,700 levels could weigh on Bitcoin later in the day, with a lack of upward momentum likely to see Bitcoin pullback to the morning’s low $7,516.6 and bring the day’s first major support level at $7,314.13 into play.\nWe would expect support to hold Bitcoin off from striking a new swing lo, barring materially bad news hitting the wires through the day.\nElsewhere in the cryptomarket, Stellar’s Lumen was on the move, up 2.02% at the time of writing, with Ethereum up 1.72%, while NEM’s XEM, Cardano’s ADA and Bitcoin Cash lingered in the red to buck the broader market trend.\nBTC/USD 25/05/18 Hourly Chart More Buy & Sell Cryptocurrency Instantly\nThis article was originally posted on FX

risks closing beneath the 50-week moving average (MA) – an essential long-term support not breached for over 2.five years. With the bears already on the offensive following the latest sell-off, prices are likely to suffer if bitcoin closes on Sunday beneath the key support, currently seen at $7,611. More worryingly for the bulls, since the cryptocurrency hasn’t traded beneath the 50-week MA since October 2015, acceptance below that level would only add credence to the argument that the long-term bull run has ended. Weekly chart\nAs seen on the chart above, the long-term moving average had acted as a strong support in the first quarter. BTC found strong bids in mid Apr following the repeated failure (marked by a circle) on the portion of the bears to penetrate the 50-week MA. The rally from the 50-week MA to $9,990 (May 5 high) reinforced the moving average as a strong long-term support. Therefore, a downside break would raise the chances of a slide to fresh 2017 lows below $6,000. As of writing, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,400 on Bitfinex, and price chart analysis suggests that bitcoin is likely to end the week beneath the key $7,611 level. To start with, the weekly relative strength index (RSI) is below 50.00 (in the bearish territory) and trending south in favor of the bears. The RSI has also found acceptance beneath the key support zone of 53.55–55.00, which only fortifies the bear case. In the mean time, the daily chart below also shows scope for a drop below $7,000. Daily chart\nThe bears currently have the upper hand, as indicated by the lower highs and lower lows pattern, downside break of the channel, downward sloping (bearish) 5-day and 10-day MAs. The RSI is holding below 50.00 (in the bearish territory), but well above 30.00 (oversold region), indicating room for sell-off to $6,870 (triangle support). Hourly chart\nRegardless of the bullish price RSI divergence on the hourly chart, BTC failed to cross the falling trendline hurdle, underscoring the strong bearish sentiment in the market. View\nBTC looks set to close beneath the 50-week MA (at $7,611) for the very first time since October 2015, signaling a major bearish breakdown and opening the doors for a re-test of $6,000 (2018 low). A corrective rally might save the day for the bulls, however, the probability of a bearish weekly close beneath the 50-week MA will stay high so long as bitcoin is trading below $8,644 (May 21 high).\nBitcoin in water image via Shutterstock\n highest abides by ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T14:38:21.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "64c2c6f71ef1a0538d7322b4bcb7f53e4ac07da8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHLCKC01H_ftpAnDAXJ2YSV3qnJql2rYGcr421FIcsirJSFeTw4KVh.LuyDwG2DgxKDc1uuE3wk7cMRVT8dHa9rNBKFTSUOXRYMzM1T4TJI3bg--", "site_full": "wegobusiness.com", "site": "wegobusiness.com", "site_section": "http://wegobusiness.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "WeGoBusiness – Top business stories from around the internet", "title": "Bitcoin – Blockchain-based Crypto Game Bitpet Announce their Impending Airdrop Event", "title_full": "Bitcoin – Blockchain-based Crypto Game Bitpet Announce their Impending Airdrop Event", "published": "2018-05-25T14:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i1.wp.com/abitco.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitpet-Press-Release.png?resize=1000%2C800", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "64c2c6f71ef1a0538d7322b4bcb7f53e4ac07da8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHLCKC01H_ftpAnDAXJ2YSV3qnJql2rYGcr421FIcsirJSFeTw4KVh.LuyDwG2DgxKDc1uuE3wk7cMRVT8dHa9rNBKFTSUOXRYMzM1T4TJI3bg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "WeGoBusiness - Digital Business Academy", "published": "2018-05-25T14:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin – Blockchain-based Crypto Game Bitpet Announce their Impending Airdrop Event", "text": "Bitcoin – Blockchain-based Crypto Game Bitpet Announce their Impending Airdrop Event 25 May 2018 8544\nBitcoin Press Release: Bitpet, a blockchain-based crypto game dubbed the Asian CryptoKitties, has announced their platforms second round of their Airdrop campaign is to commence on May 25, 2018.\nMay 25, 2018.

Ripple", "text": "Print\nMore than $1.2 billion in crypto has been stolen by criminals since the start of last year, according to the non-profit Anti-Phishing Working Group, Reuters reported. The figure, which was released on Thursday (May 24), includes both unreported and reported thefts. And it comes to show that cryptocurrencies aren’t just being used for crimes: They are stolen through criminal activity as well.\n“One problem that we’re seeing in addition to the criminal activity, like drug trafficking and money laundering, using cryptocurrencies is the theft of these tokens by bad guys,” CipherTrace CEO Dave Jevans told Reuters. In addition, he believes that 20 percent – or less – of that $1.2 billion of the stolen crypto has been found.\nAnd Revolut is now allowing users to buy and hold bitcoin cash and Ripple, TechCrunch reported. With the new functionality, Revolut users can now buy and hold those cryptocurrencies in addition to bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum. To process the transactions, Revolut teamed up with Bitstamp . Currently, Revolut reportedly processed 100,000 crypto transactions each day. The company charges 1.5 percent on each transaction.\nIn other news, clients of Uphold now have XRP addresses directly through the company’s app, CoinDesk reported. With this functionality, users of Uphold can deposit, withdraw and send XRP coins using the app. The integration was first announced by Uphold in March. “Uphold has now satisfied an increasing need to provide its members with full access to Ripple’s fast-growing ecosystem,” the company said in a press release .\n“This is an important milestone for Uphold and our members,” Uphold’s chief revenue officer, Robin O’Connell, said in a statement. “We were the first to make XRP easily available in the U.S.; expanding our offering to include full connectivity to the XRP ledger was the clear next step.”\nUphold has powered more than $3 billion in 184 countries through 30 supported currencies. In addition, the company’s application programming interface (API) is the backbone of cryptocurrency payroll and gold trading, among other services.\n-", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/23/revolut-adds-ripple-and-bitcoin-cash-support/", "https://ciphertrace.com/", "https://www.revolut.com/?lang=en", "https://www.bitstamp.net/", "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/uphold-now-offers-full-functionality-with-xrp-ledger-300654542.html", "https://uphold.com/", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-crime/about-1-2-billion-in-cryptocurrency-stolen-since-2017-cybercrime-group-idUSKCN1IP2LU", "https://www.coindesk.com/payments-platform-uphold-completes-xrp-ledger-integration/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dave jevans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitstamp", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "anti-phishing working group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:12:02.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6eb1afedc0985fde103e21492068f06fe73c3717", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQKzw8VAaqw2hOknt123IL8-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why I would rather have paper money then Bitcoin???", "title_full": "Why I would rather have paper money then Bitcoin???", "published": "2018-05-25T14:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 10, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.027, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6eb1afedc0985fde103e21492068f06fe73c3717", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQKzw8VAaqw2hOknt123IL8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Roni116", "published": "2018-05-25T14:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why I would rather have paper money then Bitcoin???", "text": "Quote: from: Ferguson980 on May 24, 2018, 08:07:34 PM This is going to come to a surprise to many on here, but at the moment I'd rather have paper (US FIAT) money.

Even as it is doing better than many others in the top 10, being only the 2nd smallest loser after Bitcoin, the price is speculated to be suppressed by whales.\nThe 3 biggest losers in the top 10 are Bitcoin Cash [BCH], Cardano [ADA], and IOTA [MIOTA], with losses of 23.59%, 22.75%, and 23.74% respectively.\nThe bears continue to drag Ripple down into quicksand as it finds it difficult to even hold on to the $0.70 limit. It is currently trading at $0.61, a far cry from the highs of the last two weeks of April and the first few weeks of May, where it traded around the $0.90 mark.\nIt never fully recovered from the huge drop on May 12th, where it dropped from around the $0.80 mark to the low $0.70s.\nOver the last week, the bearish market trend has reflected in XRP’s graphs, where it saw a gradual decline over the second part of the week. The first part of the week did see an uptick in price from lows of sub $0.70 but the gains plateaued at the $0.70 resistance and slowly decline from May 22nd.\nIt went down to a low of $0.59, a low not seen since the bearish market of March earlier this year. The high point this week was on May 22nd, where the coin hit $0.70 after a steady uprise the days before.\nThe biggest drop of the coin this week was on May 23rd, where it dropped from $0.62 to $0.58. This is almost a 7% drop in the price over just a few hours.\nEven as new partnerships and ventures are being announced, the price of the token keeps plummeting. This has led to an inside joke among the Ripple community, where the members joke about the price going down after every new announcement. Here are some Reddit comments conforming to the joke:\nUser thelost2010 says:\n“Any good news tanks XRP. I only want to see bad news going forward.”\nUser mhollywood1 said:\n“Not sure how it is still funny after 5 months of the same joke I suppose…”\nUser rockumsockumrobots responded to Uphold adding support for exchange-to-wallet transactions by saying:\n“This is amazing news. The market is responding. . .by XRP losing another 16%.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cardano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T19:19:50.012+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 17908, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=14300", "requestsLeft": 519}
