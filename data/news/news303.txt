This will lead to what analysts refer to as “The Flippening”. This marks a time when Bitcoin will no longer be the leading cryptocurrency with the highest market capitalization.\nDuring an interview with The Independent, Ver said:\n“The Flippening is imminent, and I see it happening. Before the end of 2020, I see Bitcoin Cash overtaking Bitcoin, and before the end of this year, Ethereum will do the same.”\nVer talked about the obvious issues with the Bitcoin technology citing that it was unable to scale through the problem of slow transaction speed and high transaction fees that came along with increased popularity.\nIs a Take Over Possible?\nOver 1,500 cryptocurrencies have been created since Bitcoin was launched in 2009. Each one was created in a bid to improve on Bitcoin’s flaws.\nWithin the last 12 months, the price of Bitcoin has gone up from $1,700 to about $9,360 which reflects a 450% increase in price. Ether had a 1,000% increase in price with its current value at $764. Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, hiked from $500 in August last year to $1,655.\nEven if the price of Ether is still far from the price of Bitcoin, Ether is in circulation five-times more than Bitcoin. The market capitalization of Ethereum is just about half of the market cap for Bitcoin.\nDespite Ver’s opinion, some other experts in the market believe that Bitcoin cannot lose its position because it is already well established in the industry.\nAlthough Ver said that there is a chance that Bitcoin will continue to dominate the market, he doesn’t believe it is likely.

The company benefited in particular from strong demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The Group has a clear USP within the industry thanks to Bitcoin.de, Germany's only regulated marketplace for digital currencies, which is operated by its wholly-owned subsidiary Bitcoin Deutschland AG. Demand for cryptocurrencies was reflected also in the high level of popularity of the innovative trading services offered by Bitcoin.de. The trading platform had 667,000 customers (currently over 745,000) at the end of December 2017 compared with just 356,000 in the previous year. With an average of 26,000 customers joining Bitcoin.de every month, the target of 480,000 customers by year-end was exceeded by some distance. In an encouraging development, the growth in user numbers was accompanied by an equally dynamic upturn in the trading volume, which was well in excess of the forecast of EUR 1 billion at EUR 1.2 billion - for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin alone. Trading volume for the new cryptocurrencies Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ethereum (ETH), which commenced trading in the third quarter of 2017, amounted to around EUR 250 million. The strong rise in the price of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin and the inclusion of further cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash proved to be beneficial. Based on the developments described above, Bitcoin Group SE generated record revenue of EUR 12,481 thousand in fiscal 2017 compared with EUR 1,044 thousand in the previous year. As a result, earnings before taxes jumped to EUR 10,888 thousand (previous year: EUR 208 thousand). Earnings after taxes multiplied to EUR 7,452 thousand (previous year: EUR 114 thousand). \"We are delighted by the dynamic business development in the past year. With sustained high customer interest and the continued expansion of the available infrastructure, the liquidity of cryptocurrencies will increase and prices will become less susceptible to fluctuation. The victory march of Bitcoin & Co. will be unstoppable. We are already making a fundamental contribution to this evolution with Bitcoin.de, offering our customers an innovative trading system with the very highest security standards and an interface with the traditional banking system. In the current fiscal year, we will continue to focus on permanently improving Bitcoin.de while expanding our market-leading position at the same time. We intend to pursue these objectives with passion and pleasure, just like we managed with great success in the past year,\" commented Michael Nowak, Managing Director of Bitcoin Group SE. Bitcoin Group SE enjoys a strong statement of financial position. Total current assets increased by 1,594% year-on-year to EUR 49,027 thousand as of December 31, 2017 (previous year: EUR 2,893 thousand). This significant increase was achieved on the back of the higher number of bitcoins held by the company and the general rise in the Bitcoin price. Equity increased by EUR 32,107 thousand to EUR 38,190 thousand in the reporting period as a result of retained earnings (EUR 7,452 thousand) and other comprehensive income (EUR 24,659 thousand).Outlook for 2018 For the current 2018 financial year, the company expects further growth in the number of customers and sales. Assuming only moderate cost-side increases, the management is also anticipating a strong increase in earnings. Costs relate in particular to investments in research and development activities for the expansion of Bitcoin.de. In addition to the existing cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin Gold (BCG) and Ethereum (ETH), a large number of other cryptocurrencies are to be included in trading on Bitcoin.de in the current fiscal year. The expansion focuses on Ripple, Litecoin, IOTA, DASH and Monero. The usability of the platform will also be improved continuously in 2018 and Bitcoin.de will receive a new, contemporary design. Based on these measures, the Group expects a further increase in the number of registered Bitcoin.de users to over 1 million by the end of 2018 Furthermore, Bitcoin Group SE plans to acquire a majority stake in a regulated bank based in Germany in the current 2018 financial year. \"This would be a major milestone for the operation of a Bitcoin exchange and also the regulatory basis for the planned installation of the first Bitcoin ATMs in Germany. The successful partnership with Fidor Bank AG, whose 5th anniversary this year will be celebrated by both companies at the Tech Open Air (TOA) in Berlin from June 19 to 22, is not at disposal,\" adds Michael Nowak.

His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.\nIn the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: how much digital cash does it really hold?\nTwo Xapo clients said it houses roughly $10 billion of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoins price, after all, is hardly steady.\nEven in the colorful world of crypto the cache is remarkable -- amounting to about 7 percent of the global Bitcoin supply. It would mean Xapo, just 4 years old, has more deposits than 98 percent of the roughly 5,670 banks in the U.S. But as a custodian its regulated differently. The Swiss subsidiary is overseen by the self-regulating Financial Services Standards Association, which audits members to ensure they comply with anti-money-laundering rules. Xapo serves U.S. customers through a Delaware corporation thats registered with the U.S. Treasury Departments Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and is licensed in several states.\nThe outsize holdings underscore the faith that Casares -- a serial entrepreneur nicknamed Patient Zero for stirring Silicon Valleys interest in Bitcoin -- has garnered among his acolytes and at major crypto investment firms, such as Grayscale and CoinShares.\nEveryone who isnt keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo, said Ryan Radloff of CoinShares, which has more than $500 million of Bitcoin stored at Xapo. You couldnt pay me to keep it with a bank.\nXapos billionaire backers include LinkedIn Corp. co-founder Reid Hoffman and former Wall Street trader Mike Novogratz, whos in the process of setting up his own cryptocurrency merchant bank. Their bet is that Bitcoin is here to stay, and so is its biggest scourge, theft.\nThe first rule of owning Bitcoin is to securely keep your private key -- the code that lets you spend your coins. If thieves get it, they can loot your holdings in an instant, with no hope of recovery. Putting keys on a device connected to the Internet is both convenient and perilous: Hackers have proven adept at obtaining them from afar.\nThe most popular alternative is called cold storage, keeping the key in an offline device such as a thumb drive. But risks remain: Hackers have also proven adept at setting traps on computers to access cold-storage devices the moment theyre online. More traditional criminals have committed home invasions and kidnappings. Some Bitcoin tycoons have resorted to hiding their identities, fortifying their homes and studying self-defense.\nXapos solution is to bury a cold-storage device in a mountainside and layer on electronic safeguards.\nTheyre the first folks who recognized custodial and security functions would be key, said Hoffman, whose venture capital firm Greylock Partners led a $20 million investment in Xapo in 2014, a couple of years after Casares persuaded him to buy his first Bitcoin. He made the pitch in the morning and in the afternoon I called him with an offer.\nAt Xapo, retrieving Bitcoin from the vault takes about two days. The company verifies a clients identity and authenticates the request before manually signing the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations. Approval from three separate vaults is required for any transactions to be authorized. The company also offers customers a trading desk to buy and sell Bitcoin and created the first Bitcoin debit card to spend it.\nCasares, 44, declined to comment for this story. After a flurry of publicity at Xapos launch, he has drawn big audiences at crypto conferences but largely shunned media interviews.\nYet his persuasiveness is legendary. His evangelizing of Bitcoin is so pervasive in Silicon Valley that when Hoffman asked his family office to buy some, his banker asked when hed spoken to Casares. Xapos advisers now include former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, ex-Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Officer John Reed and Visa International founder Dee Hock.\nSuch salesmanship has been critical to Xapos success. First Block Capital, Canadas first fully registered crypto firm, picked Xapo as its custodian after months of due diligence, including touring the Swiss vault.\nEvery part of their DNA is geared to security, said Sean Clark, First Blocks founder, who noted the vaults fingerprint scanners were equipped with a pulse reader to prevent amputated hands from being used. Whenever we make big transfers they FaceTime us, we have duress words, if its big enough theyll fly out to see us.\nXapo is doubling down on its pursuit of institutional clients, with President Ted Rogers enlisting Peter Najarian, a veteran of emerging-market trading at UBS Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, to oversee outreach to investors including pension funds, private banks, assets managers, family offices and hedge funds.\nTidal Wave\nThe perceived lack of an institutional-grade custodial solution for Bitcoin has been one of the sticking points for many money managers looking to try the asset class. Xapo says its already offering precisely that solution. If it persuades them of its merits, the implications for Bitcoin would be profound.\nA fraction of that kind of institutional money flowing into the space would be a tidal wave, Najarian said.\nCasares has made acceptance of Bitcoin his lifes mission. Born to sheep ranchers in Argentinas remote Patagonia region, he experienced the impact of inflation throughout his youth.\nThat drove him to build a series of fintech startups that made him millions before he encountered Bitcoin. He sold 75 percent of Patagon, a Latin American financial-services website, for $529 million in 2000 and digital wallet startup Lemon for $43 million 13 years later to focus on crypto. By then, he was already a big holder of Bitcoin.\nI am personally allocating a percentage of my net worth to this that is borderline irresponsible because I believe in it so much, Casares told Lemon board member Eric OBrien, according to Digital Gold, a book by Nathaniel Popper. Two years ago, he joined the board of PayPal Holdings Inc.\nHigh Hurdle\nBitcoins meteoric rise in recent years has spurred the proliferation of rival currencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple that also have multibillion-dollar valuations. Yet Xapo only safeguards Bitcoin because of Casaress belief that it alone will succeed. Such dogmatism has seen Xapo turn away customers looking to store rival currencies.\nOther purists say ventures such as Xapo have no place in the Bitcoin ecosystem, slowing down whats supposed to be a seamless transfer.\nXapos top brass wrestle with that paradox, too.\nIts a subject we discuss a lot, and we believe Bitcoin wont reach the mainstream if people have to hold their own private keys, Rogers said. Its a pretty high hurdle technically to be your own bank with lots of security.\nSOURCE: https://www.bloomberg.com/crypto", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/crypto"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T06:51:03.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "26880da97284c8a71439f348eea2bea7417352c9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYM.OJ3Ir8Yks7iADAghw91FkVJ.pECzPhEih47QDvAGkMSxDABtfjn3MyLC_1yk7BZZCWEN1mhwqP4YcLhVi6_", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "I Want to Start Bitcoin Mining program", "title_full": "I Want to Start Bitcoin Mining program : btc", "published": "2018-05-11T15:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "26880da97284c8a71439f348eea2bea7417352c9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYM.OJ3Ir8Yks7iADAghw91FkVJ.pECzPhEih47QDvAGkMSxDABtfjn3MyLC_1yk7BZZCWEN1mhwqP4YcLhVi6_", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ashaan24", "published": "2018-05-11T15:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "I Want to Start Bitcoin Mining program", "text": "Guys, Can you please suggest me complete steps to start mining program.

This is likely to changing after a startup called Xapo developed vaults to be used in storing bitcoin.\nThe company was launched by Argentine entrepreneur Wences Casares has spent a lot of time persuading Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires that digital currency is world currency for the future. He has built underground vaults, behind blast doors, guards and corridors of reinforced concrete.\nHow the idea was developed\nIn 2014, Greylock Partners, a venture capital company, invested $20 million in Xapo. According to reports by Bloomberg, the vaults are able to accommodate around $10 of bitcoin.\nXapo hit the headlines when it announced that it had started keeping bitcoin in secure vaults located in the mountainside in Switzerland a few months after relocating from California.\nThe facility has since grown and span five continents. The vaults handle bitcoins from both institutional and private clients as well as other crypto offerings.\nHow it works\nThe vaults were built underground in what Xapo termed as “geographically dispersed locations on three continents.” The confidential information regarding the vaults is kept on offline servers which have never had access to the internet or any other form of network.\nTo securely store the coins, the vaults have several layers built with cryptographic security. Some of the processes used are private key segmentation and multi-factor authentication.\nThe servers are guarded and secured by people plus automated security measures. The vaults are guarded 24/7. The vaults are placed in a location designed to protect user money from loss in the event of a catastrophic event. In the event that on vault is compromised, there is always another vault on standby.\nRecovering the cryptos from the vault\nIt takes about two days to retrieve the bitcoins from the vaults. In the two days, the company undertakes an advanced and highly sophisticated security process of verifying the owner’s identity.\nThe company then uses authentication measures to make sure that the identity of the owner, which must go through a series of steps before getting the requested bitcoins moved from the vaults to the Xapo Wallet.

Based on the increase in user numbers and the resulting increase in trading volume for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin alone to approximately EUR 1.2 billion (forecast 2017: approximately EUR 1 billion), Bitcoin Group SE generated record revenues of EUR 12,481 thousand in fiscal year 2017 (previous year: EUR 1,044 thousand). As a result, earnings before taxes jumped to EUR 10,888 thousand (previous year: EUR 208 thousand). Earnings after taxes multiplied to EUR 7,452 thousand (previous year: EUR 114 thousand). Total current assets increased by 1,594% year-on-year to EUR 49,027 thousand as of December 31, 2017 (previous year: EUR 2,893 thousand). This significant increase was achieved on the back of the higher number of bitcoins held by the company and the general rise in the Bitcoin price. Equity increased by EUR 32,107 thousand to EUR 38,190 thousand in the reporting period as a result of retained earnings (EUR 7,452 thousand) and other comprehensive income (EUR 24,659 thousand). For the current 2018 financial year, the company expects the number of registered users to reach 1 million by the end of 2018 due to the steady growth at the end of 2018. With only moderate increases on the cost side, the management also expects a strong increase in earnings. Costs relate in particular to investments in research and development activities for the expansion of Bitcoin.de. In addition, Bitcoin Group SE plans to acquire a majority stake in a regulated bank based in Germany in the current 2018 financial year.

This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 28 period(s) ago.\nCommodity Channel Index (CCI)\nThe CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is 51. This is not a topping or bottoming area. The last signal was a sell 3 period(s) ago.\nMACD\nThe Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line.

Wednesday’s rise had provided the Bitcoin bulls with hopes of a late in the week rally to bring $10,000 levels back into play going into the weekend, but a range bound first half of the day ultimately weighed, with Bitcoin taking a late in the day fall. Bitcoin slid from $9,361.4 in the late afternoon to an intraday low $9,003, falling through the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $9,173.3 and the day’s first major support level at $9,074.93, with support at $9,000 needed to avoid a pullback to sub-$9,000 levels for a 2 nd consecutive day. In spite of the extended bullish trend that had been formed at 6 th April’s swing lo $6,500.2, moves since 5 th May’s swing hi $9,999 have been testing the bullish trend and Thursday’s slide affirmed the formation of a near-term bearish trend with Tuesday’s swing lo $8,980 replaced by this morning’s low $8,870, Bitcoin’s failure to break through to $10,000 levels at the start of the month doing the damage. Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down 1.32% to $8,899.2, with Thursday’s late in the day sell-off spilling into the early hours of this morning. A start of the day high $9,018.1 was all that the Bitcoin bulls had to hold on to, with the day’s first major resistance level at $9,268.8 and seller appetite at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $9,221 left untested. An early slide through to a morning low $8,870 tested the day’s first major support level at $8,877.9, the early move reaffirming the near-term bearish trend formation. For the day ahead, Bitcoin will need to break back through to $9,000 levels and make a run at the day’s first major resistance level at $9,268.8 to shift the negative sentiment that has plagued Bitcoin and the broader market through the week, though with the bears in control, selling pressure at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $9,221 will need to be overcome. Bitcoin managed to avoid tumbling back to sub-$6,000 levels in the last bearish trend that supported a run through to the swing hi $9,999. This time around, support will be called upon once more and with the regulatory chatter beginning to build ahead of an expected classification of the respective cryptocurrencies and roll out of regulations, things could turn quite bearish before recovering. Failing to move through to $9,100 levels later this morning will likely place further downside pressure on Bitcoin, which will likely bring the day’s second major support level at $8,745 into play, a hold at $9,000 levels by the day’s end a must for the Bitcoin Bulls.

the most famous cryptocurrency", "text": "In the beginning Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin and the blockchain. And the blockchain was without rival and bitcoin was without worth and only a fringe group known as cypher punks saw the technology and said that it was good. When the Genesis Block of bitcoin appeared in January 2009, two months after a paper describing the “peer-to-peer electronic cash system”, its small group of followers realised the cryptocurrency held the potential to rip a hole right through the traditional financial system.\nAt the time, the world was still reeling from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, a historical moment noted by bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator in a message embedded in the first block of bitcoins: “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” Bitcoin’s promise lay in the fact that as the world’s first decentralized digital currency, it was a payment outside the scope of banks and governments and therefore immune to the pressures and whims of such institutions.\nBut almost 10 years on, while its potential to disrupt the established financial order is still being realised, the only thing that has actually torn apart is bitcoin itself.\nYou do not have access to view this Atom. On 1 August 2017, the blockchain of bitcoin – an online ledger that documents every transaction – was split in two, spawning a brand new rival to the original cryptocurrency called bitcoin cash. The process, known as a hard fork, meant both versions of bitcoin shared the same blockchain history up until that date but from that point on would be two entirely separate entities.\nThere has since been more hard forks splitting the cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin gold and bitcoin private, however none were as truly divisive as that of bitcoin cash. Its purpose was to solve the two main issues that had arisen with bitcoin as its popularity grew: slow transaction times and high fees.\nThe scalability problem, as it is known, has served to split not just the cryptocurrency itself, but the entire community that has helped develop it over the last nine years.\nThe new cryptocurrency is currently only worth around 15 per cent of the original bitcoin – or bitcoin core – yet its improved functionality means some of the original cypher punks believe it is “the one true bitcoin”. Its most prominent advocate is Roger Ver, whose involvement with bitcoin since its early days earned him the moniker ‘Bitcoin Jesus’.\n“Bitcoin cash has more of the characteristics that make bitcoin bitcoin, than bitcoin core,” Mr Ver tells The Independent . “What matters is if it works as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system – and bitcoin cash simply works better.”\nThe disillusionment Mr Ver felt with the original bitcoin began in 2015 when he realised that some bitcoin core supporters were in favour of high fees. Increased fees meant increased profits for some cryptocurrency companies, despite it going against the founding principles of bitcoin. The average fee for a single transaction last year was $28, making it entirely impractical for use as digital cash.\nDucatus cafe, a cashless cafe that accepts cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, on their opening day in Singapore December 21, 2017 (Reuters) Another vocal supporter of bitcoin cash is James Howells. The IT specialist from Newport, Wales, made headlines in 2013 after it emerged he had accidentally thrown away a computer hard drive containing 7,500 bitcoins, worth around £4 million at the time. At today’s prices, the value of the hard drive is worth more than £50 million – it sits buried beneath trash in a landfill site near his home in south Wales for anyone who fancies a treasure hunt.\n“At the time of the split in August 2017, as an early bitcoin adopter I felt I had to step up and defend the original goals and vision of bitcoin,” Mr Howells tells The Independent .\n“Bitcoin core has leaned towards catering to investors and financial companies and is no longer interested in being a usable day-to-day cryptocurrency, but wants to stay as a store of value. Unfortunately, it is the use-case as digital cash that gives it the store of value in the first place. If you cannot easily transact with bitcoin due to high fees, then how can it be a good store of value? Bitcoin cash is both.”\nMr Howell describes an online battle between the two sides, with each side trying to discredit the other and claim the bitcoin brand.\nThe most prominent battlegrounds have been the forums of Reddit, the social news site that has helped foster cryptocurrency communities since bitcoin's beginnings.\nAlong with the gripes about bitcoin core's technology, the bitcoin cash side has claimed it is the victim of censorship through posts being deleted in the main bitcoin forum.\nOn the other side, the bitcoin core community claims bitcoin cash advocates are partaking in a campaign of misinformation in an attempt to steal bitcoin's brand.\n\"They're trying to rewrite history and make use of the Bitcoin.com domain name, the r/btc Reddit section, and the @Bitcoin Twitter [account] to create a sense of ambiguation between the two coins,\" says cryptocurrency blogger Vlad Kostea in a detailed post on the feud.\n\"The entire scenario is very much like the propaganda you'd read from the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four : Repetition creates intellectual consent, history must be rewritten after every minor change according to the will of those in power, and words change their meaning for the sake of imposing an agenda.\"\nThe bitcoin core side also claims that any issues with slow transactions and high fees can be solved by building new technology on top of it, such as the Lightning Network – a 'second layer' payment protocol that operates on top of a blockchain to enable instant transactions.\n\"The issues with bitcoin that bitcoin cash claims to solve are actually already being solved by bitcoin developers,\" Michael Jackson, a cryptocurrency expert and the former COO of Skype, tells The Independent . \"Bitcoin is still by far the best known and there is so much talent in the crypto space that any issues arising with bitcoin will be solved because they have to be.\"\nThe casualties of the Bitcoin brand battle will be the uninformed noobs. Savvy investors do due diligence and won't be bamboozled by marketing.\n— Jameson Lopp (@lopp) 14 February 2018 Ultimately, by sticking to Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision, bitcoin cash supporters believe the new cryptocurrency will overtake bitcoin as the world’s most valuable digital currency, an event referred to as “the flippening”.\nAmong those offering bold predictions for bitcoin cash is Mr Ver, AKA Bitcoin Jesus, who believes bitcoin cash will overtake bitcoin core’s market cap by 2020 .\n“When we’re talking about upper limits, hundreds of thousands of dollars are well within the realm of possibility,” he says, citing big investors getting involved in the new cryptocurrency. “People love to chase a rising star.”\nBeyond investors, bitcoin cash already shares some of the same characteristics as bitcoin in its early years. It has many of the same developers, together with the same kind of grassroots movement pushing for greater merchant acceptance and wider adoption. Enthusiasts have even set up a bitcoin cash ‘faucet’ offering free units of the cryptocurrency to encourage new users. With all this, the price of bitcoin cash is already catching up with the original and a flippening is not beyond the realm of possibility.\nI wonder what BTC miners will do when BCH takes over and they are left holding digital beanie babies nobody will buy...\nSuch short term thought in some...\nOh well... why I love capitalism\n— Dr Craig S Wright (@ProfFaustus) 18 April 2018 But bitcoin cash is just one of more than 1,500 other cryptocurrencies that have emerged since bitcoin’s inception in 2009, according to Coinmarketcap . It was not the first and will likely not be the last to attempt to overcome bitcoin’s perceived limitations. Cryptocurrencies like ethereum and dash offer similar functionality, but without widespread adoption none will be able to fully realise bitcoin’s promise of being the dominant electronic cash system.\n“The limitations of bitcoin core has seen a lot of developers jump ship and move onto these newer cryptocurrencies,” Mr Ver says, referring to a “brain drain” that means many of the best developers have moved away from bitcoin core.\n“Ultimately, not even bitcoin cash is the one and only true version of bitcoin – People will have to read Satoshi’s original white paper and decide for themselves what really defines it.”\nThe Independent's bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker. Wences Casares Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg—In the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: how much digital cash does it really hold?\nTwo Xapo clients said it houses roughly $10 billion of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoin’s price, after all, is hardly steady. ‘Patient Zero’\nEven in the colorful world of crypto the cache is remarkable — amounting to about 7 percent of the global Bitcoin supply. It would mean Xapo, just 4 years old, has more “deposits” than 98 percent of the roughly 5,670 banks in the U.S. But as a custodian it’s regulated differently. The Swiss subsidiary is overseen by the self-regulating Financial Services Standards Association, which audits members to ensure they comply with anti-money-laundering rules. Xapo serves U.S. customers through a Delaware corporation that’s registered with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and is licensed in several states.\nThe outsize holdings underscore the faith that Casares — a serial entrepreneur nicknamed “Patient Zero” for stirring Silicon Valley’s interest in Bitcoin — has garnered among his acolytes and at major crypto investment firms, such as Grayscale and CoinShares.\nXapo has a network of underground vaults on five continents.\nPhotographer: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images\n“Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,” said Ryan Radloff of CoinShares, which has more than $500 million of Bitcoin stored at Xapo. “You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.”\nXapo’s vault in Switzerland\nSource: Xapo\nSee also: Buffett, Gates are latest Bitcoin critics, halting $10,000 Push\nXapo’s billionaire backers include LinkedIn Corp. co-founder Reid Hoffman and former Wall Street trader Mike Novogratz, who’s in the process of setting up his own cryptocurrency merchant bank. Their bet is that Bitcoin is here to stay, and so is its biggest scourge, theft.\nThe first rule of owning Bitcoin is to securely keep your private key — the code that lets you spend your coins. If thieves get it, they can loot your holdings in an instant, with no hope of recovery. Putting keys on a device connected to the Internet is both convenient and perilous: Hackers have proven adept at obtaining them from afar.\nThe most popular alternative is called cold storage, keeping the key in an offline device such as a thumb drive. But risks remain: Hackers have also proven adept at setting traps on computers to access cold-storage devices the moment they’re online. More traditional criminals have committed home invasions and kidnappings. Some Bitcoin tycoons have resorted to hiding their identities, fortifying their homes and studying self-defense. Trading Desk\nXapo’s solution is to bury a cold-storage device in a mountainside and layer on electronic safeguards.\n“They’re the first folks who recognized custodial and security functions would be key,” said Hoffman, whose venture capital firm Greylock Partners led a $20 million investment in Xapo in 2014, a couple of years after Casares persuaded him to buy his first Bitcoin. “He made the pitch in the morning and in the afternoon I called him with an offer.”\nAt Xapo, retrieving Bitcoin from the vault takes about two days. The company verifies a client’s identity and authenticates the request before manually signing the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations. Approval from three separate vaults is required for any transactions to be authorized. The company also offers customers a trading desk to buy and sell Bitcoin and created the first Bitcoin debit card to spend it.\nCasares, 44, declined to comment for this story. After a flurry of publicity at Xapo’s launch, he has drawn big audiences at crypto conferences but largely shunned media interviews.\nRead more: ‘Cryptolandia’ blockchain pioneers take root in hipster Brooklyn\nYet his persuasiveness is legendary. His evangelizing of Bitcoin is so pervasive in Silicon Valley that when Hoffman asked his family office to buy some, his banker asked when he’d spoken to Casares. Xapo’s advisers now include former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, ex-Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Officer John Reed and Visa International founder Dee Hock.\nSuch salesmanship has been critical to Xapo’s success. First Block Capital, Canada’s first fully registered crypto firm, picked Xapo as its custodian after months of due diligence, including touring the Swiss vault.\n“Every part of their DNA is geared to security,” said Sean Clark, First Block’s founder, who noted the vault’s fingerprint scanners were equipped with a pulse reader to prevent amputated hands from being used. “Whenever we make big transfers they FaceTime us, we have duress words, if it’s big enough they’ll fly out to see us.”\nXapo is doubling down on its pursuit of institutional clients, with President Ted Rogers enlisting Peter Najarian, a veteran of emerging-market trading at UBS Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, to oversee outreach to investors including pension funds, private banks, assets managers, family offices and hedge funds. ‘Tidal Wave’\nThe perceived lack of an institutional-grade custodial solution for Bitcoin has been one of the sticking points for many money managers looking to try the asset class. Xapo says its already offering precisely that solution. If it persuades them of its merits, the implications for Bitcoin would be profound.\n“A fraction of that kind of institutional money flowing into the space would be a tidal wave,” Najarian said.\nRead more: Tracking the Crypto Bulls and Bears\nCasares has made acceptance of Bitcoin his life’s mission. Born to sheep ranchers in Argentina’s remote Patagonia region, he experienced the impact of inflation throughout his youth.\nThat drove him to build a series of fintech startups that made him millions before he encountered Bitcoin. He sold 75 percent of Patagon, a Latin American financial-services website, for $529 million in 2000 and digital wallet startup Lemon for $43 million 13 years later to focus on crypto. By then, he was already a big holder of Bitcoin.\n“I am personally allocating a percentage of my net worth to this that is borderline irresponsible because I believe in it so much,” Casares told Lemon board member Eric O’Brien, according to “Digital Gold,” a book by Nathaniel Popper. Two years ago, he joined the board of PayPal Holdings Inc. ‘High Hurdle’\nBitcoin’s meteoric rise in recent years has spurred the proliferation of rival currencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple that also have multibillion-dollar valuations. Yet Xapo only safeguards Bitcoin because of Casares’s belief that it alone will succeed. Such dogmatism has seen Xapo turn away customers looking to store rival currencies.\nOther purists say ventures such as Xapo have no place in the Bitcoin ecosystem, slowing down what’s supposed to be a seamless transfer.\nXapo’s top brass wrestle with that paradox, too.\n“It’s a subject we discuss a lot, and we believe Bitcoin won’t reach the mainstream if people have to hold their own private keys,” Rogers said. “It’s a pretty high hurdle technically to be your own bank with lots of security.”\n— With assistance by Yalman Onaran This entry was posted in Updates .

Bitcoin Money believers say that there was an organised try to create a unfavorable sentiment in the direction of Bitcoin Money and label it a rip-off.\nPerson regecide2025 describes his expertise discussing Bitcoin on-line as “annoying”.\nHe stated: “I haven’t got an issue with Bitcoin Money.

The prediction that Bitcoin would reach around $36,000 by 2019-end is based on the historical average 1.8x P/BE multiple.\nThe only risk is that a major shift in the trajectory of hash power could change the P/BE support level of Bitcoin's price, Fundstrat said.\nElectricity cost escalation is slowing as the network becomes more efficient with new rigs coming to market, thus giving higher hash power per watt, Fundstrat said.\nThe firm noted that mining is increasingly concentrated in large scale operations and small miners must join mining \"pools\" to stay competitive.\nEarlier this year, Fundstrat co-founder Thomas Lee had estimated that Bitcoin would reach $20,000 by the middle of this year and a hit a record $25,000 by the end of this year.\nby Jyotsna V RTTNews Staff Writer\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\nEconomic News\nWhat parts of the world are seeing the best (and worst) economic performances lately?

"by Shaurya Malwa\nWhile cryptocurrency traders around the world debate over the best hardware coin-storage wallets , the world’s elite-class choose military-grade cold vaults to protect their digital assets.\nCompared to a wallet the size of a pen-drive, these cold-vaults are located in caves in mountainous locations, protected by iron gates, reinforced concrete, and satellite monitored security, in order to store billions of dollars worth of bitcoin. Highly Protected Wallets\nXapo , a Hong Kong based bitcoin storage startup founded in 2014, is behind this elaborate display of bitcoin storage-vaults. The CEO of Xapo, Wences Casares, has reportedly marketed the service to tech and finance billionaires, educating them on the “global currency of the future” and the importance of safeguarding the digital investment.\nAs per the website, Xapo’s vaults are built over five continents, in locations such as underground dugouts, caves, and a Swiss decommissioned military bunker. Source: Quartz\nJoon Wong, a journalist with Quartz , holds the distinction of being amongst the few to have been allowed to visit the vault. Speaking about his experience, Wong said:\n“It’s inside a decommissioned Swiss military bunker dug into a granite mountain. Its precise location is secret, and access is limited by security measures that would put a Bond villain to shame.”\nXapo’s client list consists of billionaire family offices, who said that the vault houses $10 billion worth of bitcoin, although the dollar figure may vary due to the asset’s infamous price volatility.\nAccording to Bloomberg , the 4 year old Xapo stores 7 percent of the world’s bitcoin, which equates to an amount greater than “ 98 percent of the 5,670 banks in the U.S,” in terms of dollars.\nThe company enjoys different regulations than banks, and has registered each vault as a different subsidiary to account for each location’s different regulations. For example, the Swiss location is regulated by the Financial Services Standards Association ( VQF ), and is subject to third party Anti Money Laundering (AML) audits. In contrast, the U.S. customers are served through a Delaware registered entity, and is regulated by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and is licensed in several states. Advertisement advertisement Two Day Bitcoin Withdrawal Process\nUnsurprisingly, the elaborate security measures don’t exactly make withdrawals a breeze, and Xapo’s specifies its clients to allow for a period of two days to process withdrawals.\nThe procedure involves verification of a client’s identity via FaceTime or Skype, alongside manually confirming transactions with private keys from a minimum of three vault locations. However, clients can purchase bitcoin via Xapo’s private trading desks, and are also offered a bitcoin debit card, which contains a fraction of their total funds, in order to make everyday payments possible.Source: Bloomberg\nCasares’ salesmen skills are nothing short of extraordinary, as the entrepreneur has won the confidence of several hedge funds and industry personalities. Elaborating on the security measures taken by Xapo for large transfers, is Sean Clark, founder of Canadian cryptocurrency hedge fund First Block :\n“The vault’s fingerprint scanners were equipped with a pulse reader to prevent amputated hands from being used. Whenever we make big transfers they FaceTime us, we have duress words, if it’s big enough they’ll fly out to see us.” Capitalizing on Security Need\nOne of bitcoin’s, and the cryptocurrency market’s, biggest barriers to entry remains that of custodial services and fund security. Although the currency in itself is immutable, the wallets used to store BTC remain susceptible to hacks, with the mainstream media widely reporting on bitcoin’s purported security issues.\nThus, buyers with deep-pockets remain wary of purchasing bitcoin, but the evidence of billions of dollars being brought by institutional buyers shows undeniable interest in the asset class, given extremely reputable security measures.\nAccording to Ryan Radloff of CoinShares:\n“Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo. You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.”\nAn investor-turned-customer, Reid Hoffman, who led a $20 million investment round in 2014, said:\n“They’re the first folks who recognized custodial and security functions would be key. He made the pitch in the morning and in the afternoon I called him with an offer.” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://xapo.com/", "https://www.vqf.ch/en/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/bunkers-for-the-wealthy-are-said-to-hoard-10-billion-of-bitcoin", "https://qz.com/1103310/photos-the-secret-swiss-mountain-bunker-where-millionaires-stash-their-bitcoins/", "http://firstblock.capital/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "quartz joon wong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wallets xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wences casares", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "billion worth of bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T20:50:41.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "691b76f6297fbe6e4ba886df0bd0cb10011ba453", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJVMqaXpKqchNWJjnIDz6gJ7xkprrk3BSzjqF7VZwAqlvLuGC6NJPRl13UXr0rUUcL_LmRqGcRsDcvNxjeMl_L561_Pb1g7EpeBSJhtpE9nef_7THbcWgzM2bQiso7oPsUpSULIs5w8Xpg--", "site_full": "netkompakt.de", "site": "netkompakt.de", "site_section": "http://netkompakt.de/index.php?format=feed&type=rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Home", "title": "Bitcoin Group 2017 annual report: Record revenue and earnings / Will list IOTA", "title_full": "Bitcoin Group 2017 annual report: Record revenue and earnings / Will list IOTA", "published": "2018-05-11T14:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "691b76f6297fbe6e4ba886df0bd0cb10011ba453", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJVMqaXpKqchNWJjnIDz6gJ7xkprrk3BSzjqF7VZwAqlvLuGC6NJPRl13UXr0rUUcL_LmRqGcRsDcvNxjeMl_L561_Pb1g7EpeBSJhtpE9nef_7THbcWgzM2bQiso7oPsUpSULIs5w8Xpg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-11T14:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Group 2017 annual report: Record revenue and earnings / Will list IOTA", "text": "Aktuell sind 71 Bitcoin Group 2017 annual report: Record revenue and earnings / Will list IOTA Bewertung: 0 / 5 Bitte bewerten\nGermany based Bitcoin Group SE publishes 2017 annual report: Revenue growth to EUR 12,481 thousand (previous year: EUR 1,044 thousand).

You need to understand that this is a new technology that changes the world, this makes the world more honest and fair. Do you really like the current banking system, when some simply print money, while others work tirelessly on food and clothing?\nLook at the specific coin from its utility to society, the uniqueness of its technologies, what problem it will solve. And supply and demand are short-term phenomena that can be very deceptive in a certain period of time and do not reflect the real value of a particular currency. Think about the improvement of the world in the future and what bitcoin and its technology can do for it, and not about how to buy cheaper and sell more. This as a result will make you financially independent.\nI wait for criticism on my thoughts!\nit can't be helped, peoples want to make incomes from bitcoin price. They buy at low, and sell at high.\nYou are right about it, existing banking system could be replaced in the future by bitcoin and cryptocurrency.\ncryptocurrency and blockchain will used globally in the future i believe.\nPeople involved with bitcoin investment usually do their monitoring on the price first where they wanted to know the actual situation of the current value either be uptrend or downtrend. People with simple knowledge about bitcoin don't really check about supply and demand however, their concern is just to check if bitcoin is progressing or not and if they feel the increase can make a profit, then they will have to sell it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T06:49:05.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "becd8825e2a3ff8fbf37137943410baca27e8291", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4nKbDUJCUNA.gF3kq7FmVkxZjJXkfraP6FTPZDPo_YS2xNEMiTODNjK8nm6.hQc3o9t4yRgALYEpFmFF32Jea56M5xqs0lBs-", "site_full": "www.techradar.com", "site": "techradar.com", "site_section": "https://www.techradar.com/how-to", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "Technology how to guides, tips and tricks | TechRadar", "title": "How to safely buy bitcoin and cryptocurrencies", "title_full": "How to safely buy bitcoin and cryptocurrencies | TechRadar", "published": "2018-05-11T14:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.047, "main_image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8JYVkTdxG7nHkJa4pCkji4-1200-80.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1093, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 35, "comments": 0, "shares": 35}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "becd8825e2a3ff8fbf37137943410baca27e8291", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4nKbDUJCUNA.gF3kq7FmVkxZjJXkfraP6FTPZDPo_YS2xNEMiTODNjK8nm6.hQc3o9t4yRgALYEpFmFF32Jea56M5xqs0lBs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lexie M", "published": "2018-05-11T14:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to safely buy bitcoin and cryptocurrencies", "text": " safely buy bitcoin and cryptocurrencies How to safely buy bitcoin and cryptocurrencies By Lexie M How To\n5 methods of acquiring bitcoin and cryptocurrencies securely Shares There are lots of ways to acquire Bitcoin ; each method comes with different risks and benefits. Regardless, security concerns should be taken into account even during the buying phase.\nIn this article, we’ll cover the following methods for getting Bitcoin:\nIn-person transactions Dedicated Bitcoin ATMs Online exchanges Decentralized exchanges Accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment Warning: There generally is no consumer protection when dealing with cryptocurrencies, and police and courts have difficulty assessing different situations properly. That makes it easier for fraudsters to get away with your Bitcoin. This shouldn’t dissuade you from Bitcoin, but rather encourage you to take extra precautionary measures. Some of these measures may seem extreme, but our goal is to help you understand the diversity of threats that pop up in the Bitcoin world.\nIn person When trading Bitcoin in person, large amounts of cash may be involved, so your physical safety is most important. ￼It’s important to put some thought into where you physically meet to carry out the transaction. Meeting during the day at a busy but uncrowded, public location is ideal.\nThis may be a coffee shop, a library, or a museum, but unless your local government takes a strong anti-Bitcoin stance, the reporting room of a police station may be the place least likely for a mugging. Yes, you can still be mugged with virtual currency.\nAs soon as somebody knows you have access to Bitcoin on your phone or laptop, they may threaten you with violence unless you transfer the coins to them. If the thieves know where you keep your backup seed phrase, they might also steal this seed and transfer the coins to their own wallet immediately.\nIn places where the government does not have a strong anti-Bitcoin stance, meeting in the report room of a police station might be a great idea.\nYou can assume that somebody who intends to harm or defraud you will be hesitant to meet at a police station, and you will be able to freely count your money and wait for confirmation of your Bitcoin transaction.\nFurthermore, police officers are often concerned about your security and that of the community. They’ll probably even appreciate if a risky transaction is carried out under their eye.\nOther unusual and safe places include the lobbies of post offices, banks, or government buildings. In general, you’re much less likely to become the victim of theft or robbery in a well lit building with security and a proper entrance and exit.\nBefore meeting, have your Bitcoin wallet set up (that’s how you’ll hold your Bitcoin). Avoid setting anything up on the spot. When buying Bitcoin, always wait for at least one confirmation. For large amounts, you may even want to wait for more (two to six confirmations).\nWhen selling Bitcoin, verifying the integrity of the fiat currency you’re receiving can be difficult. Be prepared to test their authenticity if counterfeit money is common in your country. When in doubt, meet at a bank and ask your counterparty to be present while you deposit the notes into your account.\nFinally, take notice of your surroundings when leaving. Stay inconspicuous and avoid being followed—again, you don’t want to be mugged.\nDedicated Bitcoin ATMs Bitcoin ATMs are a generally safe and convenient option for buying Bitcoin. Inform yourself about the rates beforehand. As with any other sort of ATM, practice caution. Be careful of people observing you too closely!\nOnline exchanges Bitcoin Exchanges often offer the best rates (often at 0.3% fees) to buy and sell Bitcoin, but they also require the most personal information and take more time.\nWhen signing up for an exchange, make sure it is reputable. Check out reviews from your community and friends. Even small bugs and inconsistencies in a website should send up a red flag, marking them as possibly untrustworthy or incompetent.\nNever leave Bitcoin or fiat currency with a Bitcoin exchange. Always withdraw your cryptocurrency as quickly as possible to a wallet that you control.\nAlso check out our guide to the best bitcoin exchanges Decentralized exchanges There are different definitions of decentralized exchanges. In this case, a decentralized exchange is any exchange, website, or platform that does not have its own bank account, but rather maintains some kind of order book.\nLocalBitcoins and CoinCola, for example, are websites operated by companies. People can post their offers and interact with each other through the site. Other platforms, like Bisq, are decentralized software systems that no company controls. Unlike a website, they cannot be taken down.\nDecentralized exchanges usually offer some kind of escrow service in which the Bitcoin are held. It is important to always make use of this escrow service to avoid becoming victim of a scam.\nThe fiat currency payments are usually handled directly between the two trading parties. It is important that you familiarize yourself with each payment method that you accept or make in order to understand what your risk of being defrauded is.\nFor example, some wire transfers and online payment systems like Paypal are reversible, meaning that even after you think you have received a payment, it can be “taken back” by the buyer of the Bitcoin. Never release the funds from escrow until you are certain that you have received the funds.\nAccept Bitcoin as a form of payment Often, the most secure and convenient way to acquire Bitcoin is to accept them for your goods or services. In the Bitcoin blockchain, transactions are packaged into blocks, which are chained on top of each other. Each block has to abide by the rules of the Bitcoin protocol to be accepted by the network.\nThe network is made up of individuals and organizations, each running the Bitcoin software. If a large number of Bitcoin users were to change the rules of the network, for example by allowing more Bitcoin to be created, the network would likely split, or fork.\nWhen the first miner creates a block according to the new rules, the block will get accepted by some participants in the network, while being rejected by others. Some miners will chain their new blocks on top of fork A, while others will follow fork B.\nIn some circumstances, both forks will survive continuously. All balances held before the fork are present in both sides of the chain, while all coins moved or created after the fork will only exist in one chain.

And even what can happen when a country doesn’t have it.\nTake Iran. In February, just after Donald Trump’s administration had announced another round of sanctions aimed at companies and individuals with suspected links to Iran, Tehran said it was going to develop its own state-run crypto-currency. The daily Report Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox\n“In a meeting with the board of directors of [state-run] Post Bank, on digital currencies based on the blockchain, I am prescribing measures to implement the country’s first cloud-based digital currency,” said Minister of Information and Communications Technology, Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi.\nThis was, as analysts pointed out, only to allow the country to keep trading whilst avoiding Washington’s punitive reach. There were even rumors last year that the Islamic republic was going to set up an official bitcoin trading network in an attempt to circumvent the international sanctions that were, step-by-step, draining the juice out of Iran’s finance, energy and shipping industries.\n“The Ministry of Information and Communications Technology has already conducted a number of research studies as part of efforts to prepare the infrastructure to use Bitcoin inside the country,” the Caspian News reported last October.\nThis announcement came as President Trump’s “worst deal ever” rhetoric became louder and Iran’s central bank, in retaliation, tried to ban the use of the US dollar. But what other currency could they use in foreign trades? Bitcoin, it seems, was the answer. Briefly.\nIran’s economy has suffered more since then. The rial has lost around a quarter of its value in the past six months and, something like $30 billion has gushed from the country since January, via an ever-flowing network of black-market money and gold exchanges, via suitcases and, yes, through Bitcoin.\nSomething like $2.5 billion may have been smuggled using crypto-currencies and, in an attempt to “control and prevent” this, last month Tehran banned all domestically registered banks from trading crypto.\nSo what next? Venezuela, North Korea\nTehran might still follow President Maduro in Venezuela, who says his state-backed Petro coin, launched in 2017 to also sidestep US trade restrictions and ease Venezuela’s rampant inflation, has raised a much needed $5 billion via a public sale.\nCritics, domestically and internationally, say his oil-backed coin is a Ponzi-type scam, but Maduro appears to be so flushed with its supposed success that he now says he will launch a gold-backed state-backed digital currency too.\nAnother so-called ‘rogue leader” supposed to have turned to crypto, to ward off President Trump’s economic threats, is Kim Jong-un.\nPyongyang was, according to various Washington and Seoul government agencies, allegedly behind various crypto-related crimes . These supposedly include the May 2017 WannaCry ransomware cyber-attack in which victims were asked to pay Bitcoin to have their frozen computers unlocked; the hacking of numerous South Korean crypto exchanges; the mining of Bitcoin using hacked personal computers around the world; and the $530-million Coincheck exchange hack in Tokyo in January.\nNorth Korea is economically starved, it needs dollars and it can’t get them – well, unless it prints its own . So, the theory goes, it steals Bitcoins, which it then trades for greenbacks on Asian crypto exchanges.\nTen Bitcoin bet anyone, that says this won’t be discussed around the table at the Singapore summit on June 12th?\nPlease contact us with feedback, news or stories:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/11/quality-fake-supernotes-found-seoul-fan-suspicions-north-korea/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2018/05/10/iran-sanctions-people-are-turning-to-bitcoin-to-get-money-out/", "http://bitcoinist.com/iranian-government-plans-implement-infrastructure-bitcoin-usage/", "https://caspiannews.com/news-detail/iran-prepares-its-infrastructure-for-using-bitcoin-2017-10-31-50/", "https://qz.com/1199400/north-korea-is-suspected-in-the-530-million-coincheck-cryptocurrency-heist/", "https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/04/iran-capital-flight-hawala-foreign-exchange-jcpoa-nuclear.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoi", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard cook", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "utc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "post bank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tehran", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T09:17:04.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "22d5030a533b6d1c7b1586141b5045c1dda2db70", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywY9zezyRnP1aj3dKqGrkzA6Ll6lzewS_AJuwS4HrIn9w-", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Bitcoin Dips Below $9000 As Upbit Investigation Worries Korean Traders", "title_full": "Bitcoin Dips Below $9000 As Upbit Investigation Worries Korean Traders", "published": "2018-05-11T14:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "22d5030a533b6d1c7b1586141b5045c1dda2db70", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywY9zezyRnP1aj3dKqGrkzA6Ll6lzewS_AJuwS4HrIn9w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-11T14:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Dips Below $9000 As Upbit Investigation Worries Korean Traders", "text": "Bitcoin prices dropped May 11th after regulators investigated South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, panicking users.\nUpbit 'Deceiving Customers': Reports According to local news media outlet Chosun , authorities suspect Upbit of faking data about its balance sheet and \"deceiving customers.\"\nUsers holding funds on the exchange then withdraw en masse, as shown by data uploaded to social media, causing volatility across Bitcoin markets and prices to sink below $9000.\nUPbit got BOGGED. pic.twitter.com/16cUBsoOIP\n— Korean Cryptocurrency & Blockchain News (@CryptoOfKorea) May 11, 2018\nAs Chosun reports, a group of ten investigators from South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service arrived at Upbit's head office in Seoul Friday.\nThe move follows revelations last month involving fellow cryptocurrency exchange CoinNest , whose owner Kim Ik-hwan the FSS claims embezzled \"billions\" of won alongside executives from another operator.\nAn Overreaction?

It keeps dropping and increasing between this range.\nBitcoin, which recently was very close to crossing the $10000 mark is now seeing a very neutral growth rate. It surges at 0.77% in the last 24 hours at the time of writing.\nThe price has been more or less the same throughout the day, it has surged and declined with a difference of 100 odd dollars. Ranging between, $9250 and $9350, the price has taken a hit since May 6th and since that day has declined by around $600.\nThe current 7-day average hangs in a balance because of the surge Bitcoin experienced in the first 3 days of the week and the decline it experienced in the last 4 days. Both the surge and the decline are complementing each other really well to keep the 7-day average close to 0. Even in the last 1 hour, Bitcoin has surged only by 0.12% but it is the first time in the day that Bitcoin witnessed green numbers next to its name on the 1 hour scale, 24 hour scale and 7 day scale at the same time.\nAs far as today is concerned, Bitcoin seems like a very stable cryptocurrency. It has not seen breathtaking surges or declines. Many Bitcoin followers have come compared today’s performance to that of a traditional market security.\nGeorge Kennedy tweeted:\n“Oh my God! The future is here, Bitcoin is stable, this stability allows it to enter the mainstream so Fuck the people who said its instability will never allow it to be a mainstream currency.”\nMany experts believe that a fall back to $9000 or below is highly possible despite the neutral performance given the bearish market. Other cryptocurrencies have suffered quite a bit from this bearish market but the biggest hit was taken by optimists who believed that Bitcoin would cross $10000 and now a likelihood of the speculation of it falling back to $9000 coming true will leave these optimists flabbergasted.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T19:48:47.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4f73e52d4f3cac0f21dafbe8345837c4e12df553", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmVgiI0rqKJgyyJyLUHeLXSU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Huawei Releases Bitcoin Wallet In their store, Pre-Installed On All New Android", "title_full": "Huawei Releases Bitcoin Wallet In their store, Pre-Installed On All New Android", "published": "2018-05-11T14:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4f73e52d4f3cac0f21dafbe8345837c4e12df553", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmVgiI0rqKJgyyJyLUHeLXSU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Olaxbolax", "published": "2018-05-11T14:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Huawei Releases Bitcoin Wallet In their store, Pre-Installed On All New Android", "text": "What is your take about this topic?\nDo you think this will help increase the amount of Bitcoin users or it would be of no major importance?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T15:30:43.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2bfff503dbec5b9279fe4d804b638a87039f74ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSRDhplRNIt74BLpkfOFiXh7Knokx4IQTNbeHmnF8_ddiM0xd1Bq7CKY0AyiJzIxyOA--", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "8,200 BTC Moved From Mt.

An Overreaction?\nThe stakes are high for Upbit, being owned by a subsidiary of Korean messenger giant Kakao.\nIn March, Bitcoinist reported the exchange launched Korea’s first cryptocurrency index, UBCI, to aid market insight for investors.\nDespite some commentators considering the user flight in light of the inspections as an “overreaction,” the episode appears to underscore the sway South Korean traders still exert over the market.\nSeoul has sought to cement the legitimacy and transparency of the cryptocurrency exchange sector this year, obliging operators to square their tax bills retrospectively for 2017 and adhere to a strict ban on anonymous trading.\nThe latter directive has proven especially troubling for smaller operators, which have complained of banking difficulties delaying their vetting of users and accidentally placing them in a legal red zone.\nAs of press time, BTC/USD was circling $8740 across major exchanges, down 6.5% from $9350 over a period of around 20 hours.\nThe move has had a knock-on effect on altcoins, with Ether (ETH) dropping 8.4% to lose $700 support while Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) both fell around 15%.\nWhat do you think about Upbit’s investigation?

As such, investors expect the market to rebound soon.\nBy Joseph Young for CCN, May 11, 2018\nThe cryptocurrency market has declined by more than $50 billion over the past 24 hours, as the bitcoin price declined by more than 8 percent and other major cryptocurrencies along with tokens experienced an intensified movement on the downside.\nBitcoin Price at $8,500\nOver the past 24 hours, the bitcoin price has dropped by more than 8 percent mainly due to two major factors: police raid into the headquarters of major South Korean exchange UPbit and the selloff of 8,000 bitcoin by the Mt. Gox trustee.\nAs CCN reported , the Seoul police along with the Korean Financial Intelligence Unit (KIU) and Financial Services Commission (FSC) have initiated an investigation into South Korea’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange UPbit with allegations of fraud and illicit movement of client funds to the accounts of the exchange’s executives.\nThe local police has yet to release its final report on the case and is expected to confirm its findings on Monday next week.\n“We have secured hard disks and accounting books through confiscation. Analysis is expected to take days,” the authorities said, adding that the final report on the UPbit case will be released next week,” said local financial authorities.\nThe sell off of cryptocurrencies by South Korean traders on UPbit along with the possible sale of 8,000 bitcoins by the Mt. Gox trustee led bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency market to fall.\nThe Mt. Gox trustee previously stated that it is not in its plans to sell off parts of its 200,000 bitcoin holdings until late September. But, it moved more than 8,000 bitcoins to external wallets, triggering a domino effect across major cryptocurrency exchanges.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ccn.com/south-koreas-biggest-cryptocurrency-exchange-investigated-by-local-police-market-drops/", "https://www.ccn.com/8200-btc-moved-from-mt-gox-wallet-possible-sell-off-affects-bitcoin-price/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ran neuner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph young", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korean financial intelligenc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mt. gox", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T23:49:06.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1c06ae25d37b835f681bff7179ed6beb74e82b8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQUN4btB2hcYWX9KmJ11IAW8x_Qq0oBXY3XdF1Q8gkrmp657VfLFrvcB5ZOzfRyQOysbXudtWlTK.hwr3LbNQOrRFKryjVKIFFPIg7oxjghxcdo4JwwU5.WvZfQ06UZy7qJIj1BT9CN1DrSctuU7yoMjeQMdxoQbss-", "site_full": "abokifx.com", "site": "abokifx.com", "site_section": "https://abokifx.com//feed.rss", "site_categories": ["finance", "business"], "section_title": "Abokifx News", "title": "Bitcoin could soar as high as $64,000 next year, investment research firm Fundstrat predicts - CNBC", "title_full": "Bitcoin could soar as high as $64,000 next year, investment research firm Fundstrat predicts - CNBC", "published": "2018-05-11T14:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://abokifx.com/assets/logo-6281e82fbc00e5c5465c059c170db60fe0989252aa4d7db5620cd5836217888f.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 15746, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1c06ae25d37b835f681bff7179ed6beb74e82b8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQUN4btB2hcYWX9KmJ11IAW8x_Qq0oBXY3XdF1Q8gkrmp657VfLFrvcB5ZOzfRyQOysbXudtWlTK.hwr3LbNQOrRFKryjVKIFFPIg7oxjghxcdo4JwwU5.WvZfQ06UZy7qJIj1BT9CN1DrSctuU7yoMjeQMdxoQbss-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-11T14:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin could soar as high as $64,000 next year, investment research firm Fundstrat predicts - CNBC", "text": "Bitcoin could soar as high as $64,000 next year, investment research firm Fundstrat predicts - CNBC MAY 11, 2018 \"We believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range,\" Sam Doctor, head of data science research at Fundstrat, said in a report. Hash power refers to the processing power computers need to generate bitcoins. That's roughly four times or more from bitcoin's price Thursday of near $9,300. The economics of bitcoin mining also likely create a support level for the cryptocurrency, Doctor said.\nBitcoin could soar as high as $64,000 in 2019 13 Hours Ago | 00:41\nThe growth of bitcoin \"mining\" activity could send the cryptocurrency's price as high as $64,000, investment research firm Fundstrat said Thursday.\nBitcoin is created through an energy-intensive process known as mining, in which computers receive the cryptocurrency as reward for solving complex mathematical equations. Processing power to guess the solution is known as \"hash power,\" which Fundstrat predicts will grow 350 percent through 2019.\n\"We believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range,\" Sam Doctor, head of data science research at Fundstrat, said in a report.\nPerformance of bitcoin over the last 12 months\nSource: Coinbase\nBitcoin traded near $9,300 midday Thursday. Last year, the cryptocurrency surged from less than $1,000 to above $19,000, helped by a flood of investor interest. Concerns about a regulatory crackdown have helped send prices lower so far this year.\nHowever, the economics of bitcoin mining likely create a support level for the cryptocurrency, Doctor said. He said bitcoin miners are more likely to hold bitcoin as its price falls to breakeven for operating costs, and sell as its price rises, leading to greater profits.\n\"The primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors,\" Doctor said during a conference call Thursday.\nMining depends on factors such as the cost of electricity, cooling equipment and specialized hardware, known as rigs.\nAs of May 6, Fundstrat estimates the cash break-even price for the older Antminer S7 model is $6,003 per bitcoin, and $2,368 for the newer Antminer S9. Both are made by Beijing-based Bitmain, which Bernstein analysts estimate had $3 billion to $4 billion in operating profits last year.\n\"The release of the next generation of rig hardware should trigger a new round of capex as well as hash power growth, which could accelerate if BTC price appreciates,\" Doctor said.\nFundstrat co-founder Tom Lee is the only major Wall Street strategist to cover bitcoin. He issued his first formal report on the cryptocurrency last July, when bitcoin traded near $2,540. At the time, Lee predicted bitcoin could become a substitute for gold and reach $20,000 to $55,000 by 2022.

All the cryptos have CRASHED. Good call!”\nI didn’t address the crypto situation much as it unfolded because I didn’t want readers mistakenly buying into the bubble. Now that the air has come out of the crypto-mania, I hope it’s safe to talk about the real opportunity.\nI’m not talking about Bitcoin. I’m talking about the blockchain – and the dividend growth opportunities that will unfold as this “megatrend” plays out in the coming years and decades.\nThe blockchain is the nascent technology that serves as the backbone for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Today, I’m going to introduce you to five pioneering income plays that boast a “blockchain kicker.”\nFirst, a quick primer on blockchain.\nThe simplest way to describe the technology is to call it a digital ledger of sorts. It’s essentially just a group of encrypted records (“blocks”) that can be used to record transactions and other interactions.\nThe utilization of blockchain that people are most familiar with are cryptocurrencies – products such as Bitcoin that are meant to serve as digital currencies, but have quickly become extremely speculative investments as they’ve gained thousands of percent in just a few years. But companies are increasingly learning that blockchain can be used for so much more, from tracing medical histories to keeping voting records.\nAs a result, companies from Amazon (AMZN) and International Business Machines (IBM) to Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) are becoming increasingly involved in trying to exploit this technology. That has given rise to a few exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on this space, including one that’s surprisingly rife with dividend growth names.\nThe Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF (BLCN) is a portfolio of companies expected to benefit from blockchain in some way, with the stocks actually graded by their “potential for increased economic profit, operational efficiencies, and transformational business practices.” In short, it holds “companies working to utilize and incorporate blockchain technologies into their businesses.”\nWhat fascinates me about this fund, however, is the dividend growth potential in some of its component stocks.\nReality Shares’ BLCN is a deviation from its main focus: income. The ETF provider boasts another quartet of funds, all of which hold dividend stocks, and three of which are centered around the company’s proprietary “DIVCON” system.\nThe DIVCON system essentially measures a stock’s dividend health, assigning a score of 1 to 5, “where DIVCON 5 indicates the highest probability for a dividend increase and DIVCON 1 the highest probability for a dividend cut.”\nAnd right now, this system is flashing a ringing endorsement for five blockchain-linked stocks, which are all at “DIVCON 5.” In other words, they’re in the best position for dividend growth going forward:\nVisa (V) Dividend Yield: 0.6% BLCN Weight: 1.39%\nA stock like Visa (V) that yields just 0.6% hardly screams “income opportunity,” but it is. Visa has juiced its payout by 154% in five years. But it’s not just a prolific dividend grower – it’s a perfect example of the share-price growth you should expect when a company puts its shareholders first via increasingly generous cash payments.\nAs Visa’s Dividend Goes, So Does Its Price\nVisa already is elbow-deep in blockchain. The company launched a pilot phase of a blockchain-based B2B payments service called B2B Connect last year in partnership with banks in the U.S., South Korea, Singapore and the Philippines. The service will allow institutions to make payments to one another directly, and the second phase of the project is expected to go live later this year.\nMasterCard (MA) Dividend Yield: 0.5% BLCN Weight: 1.40%\nVisa rival MasterCard (MA) also has its hands in blockchain, making its moves through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In early April, the credit-card processing company filed a patent to help verify and store identity data on a blockchain system. Later in the month, it filed another patent, this time to create “fast track flags” within the blockchain that would allow nodes (any electronic device that performs a task within the blockchain network) to more quickly verify data, making the system work more efficiently.\nMasterCard (MA) Has Some Catching Up to Do – in a Good Way\nMasterCard might be an even more intriguing opportunity. While Visa’s share price and dividend growth have been roughly in line, MA shares – despite more than tripling over the past year – still haven’t caught up with the pace of the dividend, which has quadrupled and then some over the same time frame.\nTexas Instruments (TXN) Dividend Yield: 2.2% BLCN Weight: 2.04%\nTexas Instruments (TXN) isn’t exactly known for being the flashiest of chip stocks. Its analog chips and embedded processors, which make up 80%-plus of revenues, are found in some of the simplest of devices, from calculators to alarm clocks. But they have a wide array of uses, from appliances to displays to motors drives and even avionics.\nThe company is increasingly delving into more cutting-edge technologies, however, such as the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. And its position as a chipmaker also puts it square in the world of enabling the devices that make the blockchain possible.\nThat said, TXN’s positioning in the less glamorous world of analog chips makes it a cash cow with the few companies that even want to compete with it. And Texas Instruments makes good use of that cash, more than doubling its dividend over the past five years.\nIntuit (INTU) Dividend Yield: 0.8% BLCN Weight: 1.31%\nIf the blockchain acts as a ledger of sorts, what better company to research its applications than Intuit (INTU) – the well-known purveyor of accounting software such as TurboTax and QuickBooks.\nIntuit clearly spells out the blockchain opportunity in a post about the technology’s potential:\n“Some accounting and auditing firms already embrace blockchain technology. Blockchain transactions are simpler, more visible, and more transparent. Improvements in operational efficiency mean that much of the work accountants do, such as collecting and inputting data, sampling, and proving provenance, takes place automatically. This leaves accountants more time to provide valuable services to their clients.”\nAgain, this is another prolific dividend grower that has more than doubled its quarterly dole in five years. And its DIVCON rating of 5 implies that INTU is well-armed enough to continue the upward march.\nIntuit (INTU): Self-Service Taxes, Full-Service Dividends Nvidia (NVDA) Dividend Yield: 0.3% BLCN Weight: 2.06%\nOne of BLCN’s most exciting holdings is also one of the “healthiest” from a dividend perspective.\nNvidia (NVDA) , maker of high-performance chips, is among the stocks most commonly connected with the booming blockchain technology. That’s because its GPUs are widely used by cryptocurrency “miners,” who need extremely powerful computers to do the processing necessary to generate new digital tokens.\nIn fact, demand is so intense that Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang recently said the company needs to crank out more of the GPUs to catch up, as video gamers (Nvidia’s bread-and-butter market) are finding it difficult to procure the graphics chips their advanced games require.\nThe sky seems the limit, then, for its blockchain potential, and the same goes for NVDA’s income opportunity. Because despite the fact Nvidia has powered up its dividend by 76% since 2014, it currently boasts a mere 11% payout ratio. That’s a large reason why Nvidia boasts DIVCON’s top score of dividend health, and why investors should be licking their chops over this dual-threat stock going forward.\nHow to Earn 12% Annual Returns For Life!\nRobust dividend growth separates the winners from the losers.\nAnd I’m not just talking about the stocks.\nLow dividend growth goes hand-in-hand with slow and no growth – and even eventual decay. Hitch your wagon to the supposedly “safe” blue chips that most financial pundits shill for, and you’ll quickly be looking for part-time work a few years into your retirement.\nIf you want to retire fully funded and worry-free, it’ll take more – a lot more. In fact, it’ll take 12% in safe, annual returns.\nThat sounds impossible, but it’s not. It takes a special kind of portfolio that offers high current yield, and dividend growth, and the potential for double-digit capital gains in some years. But after months of research and weeding out numerous “ticking yield bombs,” I’ve identified a handful of stocks and funds that check all those boxes.\nThese stock picks will each reap at least 12% in annual returns – the magic number you need to meet to ensure the worry-free retirement you’ve labored so hard for decades to reach.\nMy “12% for Life” portfolio ditches pundit favorites such as Exxon Mobil, Coca-Cola or General Mills – yes, the same General Mills that has lost a quarter of its value this year! – and relies on these kind of picks instead: One stock that has juiced its dividend 800%-plus in just four years, and has at least another decade of double-digit growth ahead of it! A high-growth, high-yield “double threat” stock that threw off 252% gains the last time it was this cheap. A 9%-plus payer that hikes its payout multiple times a year, and is on track to double its payout by 2021!\nIncome. Dividend growth. Capital gains. Even nest egg protection. This all-weather portfolio is a diversified powerhouse that provides three times more income than most retirement experts say you need , while being built to be more durable against retirement-shattering downturns like in 2007-09.\nI don’t want you to ever have to worry about how you’ll pay next month’s bills in retirement. With this portfolio, you won’t have to. In fact, you’ll be able to pay all your monthly expenses from dividend income alone, with enough left over for the convertible, the new master bedroom or the island vacation – all those extras you should be enjoying in retirement.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://contrarianoutlook.com/the-bitcoin-bubble-created-these-5-dividend-growth-buys/", "https://contrarianoutlook.com/new-12-for-life/NM-CTA051118KW"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T15:19:23.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5e4faf1ac71d416a88cd94098fd93a17b096900e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jNjYEZ.W3oa.trEOOU6kVLXPputuTpiwXW32a1AZ5TBjd6a1E51niZoeVcp4DcMos0ixuM3GL2zaA1IiodnbBWQzVwntZt2jO1SLArb6XBfA-", "site_full": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "http://TheBitcoinNews.com/rss/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "The Bitcoin News – Leading Bitcoin News and Cryptocurrency News", "title": "Bitcoin Dips Below $9000 As Upbit Investigation Worries Korean Traders", "title_full": "Bitcoin Dips Below $9000 As Upbit Investigation Worries Korean Traders", "published": "2018-05-11T14:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/seoul-south-korea.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5e4faf1ac71d416a88cd94098fd93a17b096900e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jNjYEZ.W3oa.trEOOU6kVLXPputuTpiwXW32a1AZ5TBjd6a1E51niZoeVcp4DcMos0ixuM3GL2zaA1IiodnbBWQzVwntZt2jO1SLArb6XBfA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoinist", "published": "2018-05-11T14:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Dips Below $9000 As Upbit Investigation Worries Korean Traders", "text": "Bitcoin Dips Below $9000 As Upbit Investigation Worries Korean Traders May 11, 2018 133\nBitcoin prices dropped May 11th after regulators investigated South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, panicking users.

An Overreaction?\nThe stakes are high for Upbit, being owned by a subsidiary of Korean messenger giant Kakao.\nIn March, Bitcoinist reported the exchange launched Korea’s first cryptocurrency index, UBCI, to aid market insight for investors.\nDespite some commentators considering the user flight in light of the inspections as an “overreaction,” the episode appears to underscore the sway South Korean traders still exert over the market.\nSeoul has sought to cement the legitimacy and transparency of the cryptocurrency exchange sector this year, obliging operators to square their tax bills retrospectively for 2017 and adhere to a strict ban on anonymous trading.\nThe latter directive has proven especially troubling for smaller operators, which have complained of banking difficulties delaying their vetting of users and accidentally placing them in a legal red zone.\nAs of press time, BTC/USD was circling $8740 across major exchanges, down 6.5% from $9350 over a period of around 20 hours.\nThe move has had a knock-on effect on altcoins, with Ether (ETH) dropping 8.4% to lose $700 support while Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) both fell around 15%.\nWhat do you think about Upbit’s investigation?

But the currency is in a very important place. Actually, Bitcoin is simmering slowly. Will it boil? Will this increase the profits on our hypothetical positions?\nThe Bitcoin market has its undeniable quirks. From the wild volatility of the currency, to a community of developers supporting it, to the fact that Bitcoin can be put in vaults. Putting Bitcoin in \"cold vaults\" usually means transferring the currency to a storage device without any access to the Internet or any outside networks. But sometimes Bitcoin is put in actual vaults. In an article on Bloomberg, we read :\nBehind the guards, the blast doors and down corridors of reinforced concrete, sit the encrypted computer servers -- connected to nothing -- that hold keys to a vast digital fortune.\nArgentine entrepreneur Wences Casares has spent the past several years persuading Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires that Bitcoin is the global currency of the future, that they need to buy some, and that he's the man to safeguard it. His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.\nIn the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: how much digital cash does it really hold?\nTwo Xapo clients said it houses roughly $10 billion of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoin's price, after all, is hardly steady.\nIf this seems crazy, then maybe it is. A bit. On the other hand, if you have a sizable position in Bitcoin, then cold storage and, more specifically, an actual vault might be the way to go. This is mostly important for the insurance part of your portfolio . Even if don't have access to services like Xapo, it might be a good idea to hold part of your coins in cold storage. A simplest idea would be an external USB stick or hard drive without connection to the Internet. The problem with this, of course, is that you have to keep track of where the drive is, unless you can put it in a safe location (e.g. an actual safe) and you have all the same problems you would normally have keeping large amounts of cash at home (risk of robbery, etc.) This is why other kinds of storage services might enjoy some interest in the future.\nEven if it's not apparent at first sight, this has implications for Bitcoin traders and investors beyond the insurance part of one's portfolio. For instance, the fact that 7% of the global Bitcoin supply is held at Xapo, and possibly more in other cold storage services, makes Bitcoin a bit more similar to gold, which has a similar curious characteristic that it's mostly dug up from the ground only to be stored in vaults. Another implication which can be drawn from this is that it is the investment or speculative trading that determines the price of Bitcoin. In other words, for the time being, the fact that Bitcoin is used as a channel of payments or the fact that the supply of Bitcoin is fixed might not have a direct impact on the price of Bitcoin but rather an indirect impact of honing speculative moods.\nBitcoin Tests Retracement and Fails\nOn BitStamp, we're seeing the rally from around $7,000 to $9,000. It seems that the move lost momentum around $9,500 and the currency moved to $10,000 on relatively small volume. This is a bearish sign, albeit not a particularly strong one.\nBut we have a stronger one in the form of the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. This level is not a deal breaker, but it currently is the closest level which might have implications for the short-term. First of all, a move above this retracement could result in a short-term rally. This is not what we're seeing now, though.\nWhat we have seen so far is a move above the 38.2% retracement on April 24, 2018, denied one day later, a repeat of the move up on May 3, 2018, and a repeat of the invalidation on May 7, 2018. If you count the move on April 29, 2018, then we have three tests of the 38.2% retracement, all of which failed. The fact that Bitcoin is testing this level relatively frequently suggests that it might be an important one and the failed moves up hint at a possible decline in the weeks to come.\nOne More Factor Comes into Play\nOn the Bitfinex chart, we see that the recent rally brought Bitcoin around $10,000 but the currency stopped at that level. $10,000 is a psychologically important level, a resistance level at this time. The fact that $10,000 stopped the recent move is a bearish indication. But there is more than just $10,000 to the rally.\nGenerally, the rally from $7,000 to $10,000 is seen in proper perspective on the above chart. Bitcoin is above the 78.6% retracement level, which is a slightly bullish indication since this level is not a particularly important one. Perhaps more importantly, the 61.8% retracement level has not been touched and it still acts as a ceiling for the recent move. This is a bearish indication as not much has changed in the last couple of days.\nThere is one more factor that comes into play at the moment. It's the support line based on the February and March lows. Bitcoin is now quite close to this level. If we see a move below, we might actually get an acceleration of the decline which has been simmering slowly for the last couple of days.\nSumming up, even thought we're not seeing much volatility, a small move lower might trigger substantial declines, making the profits on our hypothetical grow even further.\nIf you have enjoyed the above analysis and would like to receive free follow-ups, we encourage you to sign up for our daily newsletter - it's free and if you don't like it, you can unsubscribe with just 2 clicks.

Wash. - Conflict has been brewing over cryptocurrency mining in Central Washington, and it also has one Washington utility stepping up security. The Chelan PUD said a recent moratorium from mid-March on new bitcoin mining operations has angered some would be miners. There have been incidents and while it hasn’t lead to calls to the police, the PUD’s Customer service director and spokesperson did admit that tensions have run high.\nThey said part of the tension is coming from the fact that bitcoin miners want to set up their operations fast, they can do it nearly overnight. Andrew Windell, Chelan PUD’s customer service director, said it’s caused problems. “They want it (power & electricity) as fast as they can get it,” Windell said.\nLarge Scale Bitcoin mining, with shipping containers, giant cooling fans, and self-built substations are changing the landscape near Wenatchee.\nScroll down to continue reading\nMore news from KIRO 7\nLindsey Baum found: Missing McCleary girl's remains found in Eastern Washington Tacoma police arrest suspect in 1986 child murder case Police: 11-year-old girl attacked in mall restroom, father tackles suspect in food court How Seattle spent $54 million on homelessness in 2017 Police: Pit bull attacks Jehovah's Witnesses at front door DOWNLOAD OUR FREE NEWS APP\nWindell said Chelan County’s moratorium on new operations, angering miners who’ve wanted to set up shop.\n“There are applications on hold and people are frustrated with that,” he said.\nThe Chelan PUD said it was going to put ballistic paneling in its lobby, get more security cameras and start other security measures, there haven’t been fistfights with angry miners, and some of the changes were planned, but Windell said the measures are welcome.\n“Some of the applicants have increased the sense of urgency of getting those security measures taken care of,” he said.\nCentral Washington is the gold rush region for bitcoin mining. Miners set up computer banks to do complex equations to obtain bitcoin online, spending an immense amount of power and time.\nHydroelectric power gives them cheap power and ideal location.\nLauren Miehe has been in the area since 2012 when the bitcoin mining rush began and said the last few months have shifted urgency for some miners trying to stake a claim in the area.\n“Ever since the spike in Bitcoin price in mid-December you’ve had an inundation of bitcoin applications,” Miehe said.\nMiehe is a former miner himself, who helps others set up, but is also working with a larger firm. He said the bitcoin industry could pave the way to other high-tech industries for the region which could also rely on inexpensive electricity. He stressed that confrontations between miners and utilities serve no one.\n“If anything those are our partners and we want to have a good relationship with them,” he said.\nWindell said another security issue for Chelan PUD; unauthorized bitcoin mining, maybe 100-to-200 illegal ops. He said some of them are in residential areas with unsanctioned wiring that pose fire hazards, could cause electrocutions or damage transformers.\n“When a cryptocurrency miner does not understand that safety risk but understands that we’re going to disconnect power that can lead to a contentious situation,” Windell said.\nChelan County may lift its mining moratorium, allowing for new operations. The security concerns could subside as noisy anger is replaced by noisy new facilities. Windell said managing the revolution will take time and will have to happen on the utility’s timetable not the miners.\n“We are in uncharted territory with this entire crypto currency development,” he said.\nChelan County’s meeting on the bitcoin mining operation moratorium is coming up Monday. It’s expected that they could hear testimony from both sides on ending or extending the moratorium.\nLauren Miehe believes the moratorium will not be lifted. The Chelan PUD has said that it is working to bring unauthorized mining operations into compliance, or shut them down if they prove to be a hazard.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://kironewsapp.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "windell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew windell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mccleary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lindsey baum", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "chelan co pud", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kiro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelan pud", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "central washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wash.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eastern washington tacoma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wenatchee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelan pud", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T21:42:27.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "77e8fcb4ebdf2c4ae678c266402e53face5d4ee8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Mfflqw1yH8waMDgVMQPRQmLqJnEQiZTeM4xDtTrX718Xcif61NtgrOpEjbBXNUeP6nOue5v19drJxKFKBn6ZlFx2rl7AAKfo-", "site_full": "www.selfgrowth.com", "site": "selfgrowth.com", "site_section": "http://www.selfgrowth.com/articles/rss/505511", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "SelfGrowth.com articles for Business Development", "title": "Advantages of Making Payments with Bitcoin", "title_full": "Advantages of Making Payments with Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-11T13:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.selfgrowth.com/files/imagecache/author-thumb/images/experts/18268625_546482982406650_7204080353173309063_n.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 18696, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "77e8fcb4ebdf2c4ae678c266402e53face5d4ee8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Mfflqw1yH8waMDgVMQPRQmLqJnEQiZTeM4xDtTrX718Xcif61NtgrOpEjbBXNUeP6nOue5v19drJxKFKBn6ZlFx2rl7AAKfo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "nabil01684@gmail.com", "published": "2018-05-11T13:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "Advantages of Making Payments with Bitcoin", "text": "Advantages of Making Payments with Bitcoin By Nabil Ahsan Tweet\nBitcoin was first introduced in 2009, as a peer-to-peer network and digital currency. Since then, it has seen significant jumps in its value and has been a popular option for investors, yielding significant returns. Although, those returns might have halted a bit in the last few months, it remains a popular and convenient way to make payments for a lot of people around the world. Bitcoin is based on the block-chain technology which provides for a decentralized structure, where no government or bank is involved. This has resulted in minimal transaction fees, saving users a significant amount of money. It has also been lauded for being more secure, as for Bitcoin to be validated, it needs the consensus of multiple users within the network. This means that hackers have found it nearly impossible to carry out any attacks or alter the records of any transaction. There are other uses to Bitcoin such as its utilization in the digital trading of securities, or trading lands and other properties, sometimes for insurance claims, as well as settlements between finance companies.\nAs far as the production side is concerned, Bitcoins are created by ‘mining’, which is accomplished through complex mathematical algorithms. However, many people buy Bitcoins as well, by exchanging it for paper currency and storing them in Bitcoin wallets. They have thus become, a convenient way to make payments online owing to the advantages it provides. Some of these advantages are mentioned below:\nThe benefit of anonymity\nOne of the great advantages of Bitcoin is the ability to make payments anonymously. A payment is not associated with your personal identity, unless you want to of course, then you can disclose it. However, if a user wishes to keep his identity secret, a transaction cannot be traced back to him.\nNo tax on purchases Owing to the secret nature of these transactions in Bitcoin, there is not much a third party can do to track the identity of the user. This means that any purchases a user makes using Bitcoin, will not result in any additional sales taxes. This is something a lot of people do not agree with, when making purchases with the more conventional means and thus, Bitcoin provides this added advantage.\nSignificantly reduced transaction fees Another huge advantage to payments made through Bitcoin, is the significantly lower transaction fees that users have deducted. Since Bitcoin is decentralized and an intermediary party, such as a bank, is not involved, it results in no additional charges are required. This has been a huge advantage to travelers as well, who have a lot of amount of their money deducted because of transaction fees in currency exchanges.\nThe ability to make payments from anywhere Similar to online payment systems, Bitcoin transactions can be made from any place that has internet access. Like credit cards, you do not need to go to a store or a bank to make a payment. However, what credit cards do not offer is the prevention of personal information being disclosed, which the Bitcoin does provide. It also saves the user a lot of time.

Brief we are covering a number of stories related to China. According to statements by Chinese officials, the People's Republic is developing a national standard for blockchain technologies, which should be introduced next year. Also, the Zcash Foundation is taking steps to protect the network of the privacy coin from ASIC-based mining. Chinese giant Bitmain has recently launched its Antminer Z9 Mini designed to process transactions for cryptos like Zcash, which use the Equihash algorithm.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: Bitcoin Supporter Might Be Next NY Attorney General\nChina Preparing National Blockchain Standard Chinese authorities are working to develop a national standard for blockchain technologies and applications. The new system should be completed and introduced by the end of 2019, according to reports by state-controlled media in the People's Republic.\nA national standard plan for blockchain is under preparation and respective departments will set up a national blockchain and distributed Accounting Technology Standardization Committee said Li Ming, director of the Blockchain Research Office at the Electronic Industry Standards Research Institute of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Li Ming told the Economic Information Daily that the national blockchain standard will include basic standards, business and application standards, process and method standards, credible and interoperable standards, and information security standards. He also added that the scope of its applicability will be expanded in the future.\nAccording to a recent statement by Yu Kequn, director of the National Center for Information Technology Security Research, \"The development of blockchain technology may become an important step for China to grasp the global technological competition.\" Yu Kequn also noted that blockchain technology is a new integrated application of distributed data storage, peer-to-peer transmission, consensus mechanisms, and encryption algorithms. \"It has the characteristics of decentralization, openness, tamper resistance, and anonymity,\" the official pointed out and added: \"It can be applied in the production, management, and transaction chains, and it will bring the entire life cycle of restructuring to different areas, so that it can be managed and traceable.\"\nIceland's Missing Mining Rigs May Have Been Found in China The mining equipment which was stolen from data centers in Iceland several months ago might have reached China, according to media reports from the Nordic nation, which has attracted crypto miners with cheap energy and favorable conditions. At least 600 computers, graphics cards, motherboards, processors, and other hardware, worth an estimated $2 million, disappeared in a series of burglaries in December and January. Last month, Chinese authorities conducted a raid on a crypto mining farm in the city of Tianjin. According to local media, police have confiscated 600 computers used to mine cryptocurrency in the illegal facility.\nThe suspected organizer of the heist in Iceland, Sindri Thor Stefansson, fled to Sweden after escaping from a low security prison in his country. He was recently arrested in Amsterdam and is now awaiting extradition to Iceland, where he is going to face trial. The ongoing investigation and the court proceedings are expected to establish the facts and circumstances surrounding one of the biggest burglaries in Iceland's history. Tracing the stolen mining equipment is a priority for authorities trying to get to the bottom of this case. Their findings should prove or dismiss the media speculation around the possible connection between the two incidents.\nZcash Opposes ASIC-Based Mining after Chinese Giant Launches Equihash Miner Developers of Zcash have stated that the struggle against ASIC-supported mining is a priority. They have indicated their opposition after the launch of a new application specific circuit designed to process transactions for the privacy coin. Zencash, a Zcash fork, has also announced plans to potentially change its algorithm for the same reason. Earlier in May, the Chinese mining giant Bitmain revealed the upcoming release of a new device that will be capable of working with the Equihash algorithm, which was itself introduced to prevent ASIC mining and is used by Zcash and other cryptos. ASICs were initially developed to mine mainly bitcoin. The highly specialized hardware is capable of handling the enormous number of calculations involved in the processing of its transactions.\nBitmain has a track record of successfully overcoming ASIC-resistant algorithms. The mining equipment producer has already developed powerful miners for many cryptocurrencies whose developers have tried to stop the centralization of hashing power. These include miners for the algorithms Ethash, used by the Ethereum network, and Cryptonight, used by Monero. The new Antminer Z9 Mini, developed to mine Zcash, Zencash, and others, offers a hashrate of 10k Sol/s. It was expected to hit the market in June, but according to the manufacturer, it can be ordered now. \"To prevent hoarding and to let more individuals worldwide get one, we've set a limit of one miner per user,\" Bitmain said in a tweet .\nThe management of the Zcash Foundation has decided to allocate resources to study the influence of ASIC mining on the network. An advisory council will be convened to provide a \"scientifically grounded answer\" to the problem. The team behind Zcash, however, may be forced to fight a war on two fronts, after researchers from the University College London recently found a vulnerability in the crypto's algorithms. They believe that certain patterns in Zcash transactions significantly weaken its anonymity. The claim is that when the cryptocurrency is transferred from unprotected to protected addresses and then back again, the overall level of anonymity decreases significantly.\nStudent Leaves China after Losing on Crypto Investments A Chinese college student has reportedly lost a small fortune by local standards due to unwise crypto investments and has already left the country in search of better opportunities to compensate the losses. Liu Ke, a sophomore in his twenties, used all his money to buy cryptocurrency, mostly aircoins, when markets were going up towards the end of last year. When cryptos were hitting their all-time highs, he spent a total of 140,000 yuan (~$23,000), including amounts he borrowed from online micro loan platforms like Alipay and Baidu. He even \"invested\" the money for his tuition fees. Liu Ke told the local outlet 8btc that he now lives and works in the Cambodian coastal resort Sihanoukville, where he hopes to earn more money to cover his debts.\nWhat are your thoughts on today's stories in Bitcoin in Brief?

Within just days of the lawsuit gaining popularity, Bitcoin.com reversed many of the controversial changes on the site, once again referring to Bitcoin as Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin Cash.\n'We Were Able to At Least Make an Impact' Earlier today, MoneyTrigz announced in the Telegram group chat that he was considering shutting down the lawsuit after only receiving under $4,000 in donations to fund it. With tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars needed to fund a controversial legal battle, MoneyTrigz has decided to refund the 33 transactions he'd received so far. When asked about the decision, MoneyTrigz responded:\nDue to lack of donations we decided to cancel the initiative and refund the 33 transactions received a total of 0.39btc, we are happy at least we were able to make an impact with bitcoincom changing 90% of its dis-information campaign which was accomplished on our own dime and awareness with help from the media.\nA few users in the Telegram were unhappy with the decision, but MoneyTrigz emphasized that without additional funds, nothing could be done. However, the majority were still very happy with the effects the lawsuit had already caused. One user looked at the cup as being half full, saying:\nMate, you've done a fantastic job. Bitcoin.com changed [their] website, so even if it doesn't go further at least you've put the fear in them.\nWhat do you think about the closing of the Bitcoin.com lawsuit? Would you have contributed to the fund?

Mowglio, Reddit user\nReddit threads have emerged exploring the hatred between the two communities. Bitcoin Cash believers say that there was an organised attempt to create a negative sentiment towards Bitcoin Cash and label it a scam.\nUser regecide2025 describes his experience discussing Bitcoin online as “annoying”.\nHe said: “I don't have a problem with Bitcoin Cash. I have a problem with the community since they decided attacking people and if you try to have any conversation with them it turns into ‘you're a paid core shill’ or ‘you're just afraid of BCH’.”\nUser Uncle-Badtouch agrees, lamenting the “cult-like behaviour” of bitcoin believers, and comparing online discussion over the two coins to, “being attacked by scientologists”.\nThomas Bertani, Director of Eidoo told Express.co.uk that the Bitcoin community as a whole does not appreciate Ethereum as it is built on different assumptions.\nHe said: “People say Bitcoin is simple while Ethereum is easy - there is a substantial difference there. On one side you have the simplicity of the building blocks of Bitcoin, which make it easy to analyse and to make strong, on the other side you have a more complex environment - the Ethereum one - which looks simple to developers and which makes it very easy to build other things on the top.\nHowever, the debate rages on. Hitting back against criticism of Ethereum’s protocol online, Reddit user Mowglio described Bitcoin Cash as “literally the cheap Chinese knock-off of Bitcoin”.\nOn the controversial Bitcoin (BTC) to Bitcoin Cash BCH ‘fork’, he said: “It would be like if I copied a computer games code and then spent huge amount of money on marketing saying that my version was the real game.\n“All I did was change a couple of things and the name and boom.”\nMr Mowglio adds, “In the real world this would be illegal, but in crypto world it makes you filthy rich.”\nThis idea of 'forked' coins is, according to Jacob Papageorgiou, Head of Education at London Block Exchange (LBX), likeable to how popular films are 'rebooted'.\nLike the recent Ghostbusters reboot, he said: “The new film aims to retain enough of the original while using the best available technology to improve it. However, just like movie reboots, they can anger purists who feel the original shouldn't be meddled with.”\nBut why the anger? Isn’t there another, more centralised enemy?\nMr Papageorgiou adds “we're talking about people who will have spent years working together on developing software, and so when a disagreement causes such a schism, it divides the community in an extreme manner.”\nHe said: “Debate can become heated and supporters of new and old protocol alike can be extremely passionate about their cause's side.” Related articles", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jamie dimon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mowglio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas bertani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eidoo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jpmorgan chase", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T14:02:45.003+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32210, "moreResultsAvailable": 1910, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=30300", "requestsLeft": 359}
