Most virtual currencies plunged in May after the U.S. Department of Justice opened a criminal investigation into the possibility that traders are manipulating the Bitcoin market. Other digital coins were mixed on Tuesday, with , the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, falling 0.63% to $589.34 on the Bitfinex exchange.The coin market cap was also lower, with total market capitalization at $335 billion at the time of writing compared to $354 billion on Monday. While prices are struggling, interest has also declined, with Google (NASDAQ:) searches for the term Bitcoin dropping 75% since January. Meanwhile U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange giant Coinbase announced it was expanding into Japan, which is considered one of the biggest markets for digital coins.“As in other markets, we plan to take a deliberate approach to our rollout in Japan, which means working hand-in-hand with the Japanese FSA to ensure compliance with local laws at every stage,” Coinbase said in its announcement. The move is a huge milestone for the firms expansion into the Asia market.

The cryptocurrency faced its “most recent death” in the latest “obituary” provided by Forbes . Bitcoin celebrates its 300th death anniversary following an article from Forbes published May 30. The article claims that Bitcoin’s “Achilles Heel” is the huge amount of electricity required by crypto mining operations. According to Forbes, Bitcoin miners underestimate the risks associated with energy consumption on the global scale. The report also stresses such issues as power theft and the cost of mining equipment that is becoming more and more expensive: “Predictably, Bitcoin miners downplay both their energy usage and the threat it poses to ordinary people, ordinary businesses and the planet that they occupy.” At the time of the latest “death” recorded by 99Bitcoins, BTC was trading at $7,312. In December, when Bitcoin died it’s 200th death, the BTC price hit the $11,000 mark. According to 99Bitcoins stats, the major cryptocurrency “died” 62 times this year. This year, various pundits and public figures proffered their own suggestions as to why Bitcoin is doomed to fail, including the notorious Warren Buffet statement that Bitcoin is “probably rat poison squared,” and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney’s claim that BTC has “failed” as a currency . While Bitcoin has recently faced its 300th death and dropped in value by around 20 percent last month, several prominent figures in the tech and business worlds have made bullish statements on its future. Recently, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak said that “only Bitcoin is pure digital gold,” reiterating the statement of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey that in a decade BTC will be the “single currency” of the world and the Internet .\nAccording to Cointelegraph’s price index , BTC is trading at $7,407 at press time, having gained around 4 percent over the past week.

More choices for miners creates more options for users, and will spark faster adoption of Bitcoin Cash. (CoinGeek is the Calvin Ayre-owned media site and bitcoin mining firm, and nChain is the global leader in research and development of blockchain technologies. nChain’s mining business is BMG Operations).\nCoinGeek and nChain’s mining firms plan to adjust settings in the software running on their BCH mining units to make two changes:\n(1) Remove the current minimum “dust limit” of 546 Satoshi . This will makes it is possible for users to send as little as 1 Satoshi (one hundred millionth of a single Bitcoin Cash coin) via a BCH transaction. Any miner can accept a 1 Satoshi transaction amount, and it should be included in a valid block that all other miners will accept.\n(2) Accept some free (zero mining fee) transactions in each block they mine. CoinGeek and nChain believe that miners should be able to accept free transactions, rather than requiring users to pay a minimum of 1 Satoshi per byte. Their mining firms will each designate a number of free transactions they will accept in each mined block.\nRemoving the “dust limit” will ignite growth of Bitcoin Cash usage. If as little as 1 Satoshi can be sent in a transaction, the BCH blockchain can be used for many more purposes and create more options for users. Micro-payments can become even more micro, down to a 1 Satoshi payment amount, with a zero (or very tiny) fee. In addition, it becomes easier to quickly implement colored coin solutions and tokens on Bitcoin Cash. In fact, the Color Kernel concept (EPOBC) from 2013 foresaw use of 1 Satoshi amounts as a way of encoding colored coin transfers within Bitcoin transactions. If miners choose to remove the dust limit, the existing Color Kernel code can be easily used and tokens can be quickly done on Bitcoin Cash (rather than using the ERC-20 protocol on Ethereum). As more token solutions are designed for BCH, the number of token transactions and other use cases on the Bitcoin Cash network should explode.\nIn addition, if miners choose to accept some transactions with zero mining fee, this further encourages more Bitcoin Cash transaction usage. If free transactions are possible, miners will have freedom to set more fee level ranges, from zero to small amounts. Users will have more choice about how much (if anything) they wish to pay for sending a BCH transaction, depending on the speed they want. If a user wants an instant transaction, the user can choose from a range of small fees made offered by miners. But if a user is willing to wait perhaps 30-40 minutes for a transaction to be added to a block, the user can elect zero fee. This fosters a healthy competitive fee marketplace among miners, which will keep fees low for users and support Bitcoin Cash growth.\nCoinGeek and nChain believe in miner choice, and a healthy competitive marketplace for miners. They invite other miners to join them in this “Miner’s Choice” initiative to ignite growth of Bitcoin Cash usage. CoinGeek will announce more plans for “Miner’s Choice” in the coming weeks and months. Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (segwit) Chain are Referred to as BTC coins. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is today the only Bitcoin implementation that follows Satoshi Nakamoto’s original whitepaper for Peer to Peer Electronic Cash. Bitcoin BCH is the only major public blockchain that maintains the original vision for Bitcoin as fast, frictionless, electronic cash.

The Twitter and Square CEO said last month that the internet is “going to have a native currency” and he hoped Bitcoin would be it. “I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking,” Woz told CNBC on Monday. If the engineer’s choice of wording seems familiar, that’s because he has previously praised Bitcoin’s nature saying “it is mathematical, it is pure, it can’t be altered.” That said, Woz said earlier this year that he has sold all but one of his bitcoins, as “I don’t want to become one of those people that watches it, watches it and cares about the number. I don’t want that kind of care in my life.” Wozniak had an unfortunate experience with Bitcoin when he tried selling seven of the virtual coins to someone who cancelled the credit card transaction before it cleared, defrauding Wozniak. The credit card number turned out to be stolen. Dorsey’s case for an internet-native currency rests on the inconvenience of the currently fragmented state of online payments. Square, his digital payments firm, allows for Bitcoin transactions.

The District Court’s judgement was handed down in July 2016 in compliance with a ban on crypto-related information sources, as digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) were not legal in country. As TASS reports, the new decision was enacted after the Supreme Court of Russia referred the case for consideration to the St. Petersburg City Court, following a complaint action from the owner of Bitcoininfo. “The St. Petersburg City Court overturned the District Court’s decision that recognized the information placed on the website Bitcoininfo.ru as prohibited for viewing.” The press service of the Court also reported that in July 2016 the St. Petersburg Vyborg District Court banned the website per the application of local prosecutors. The case was considered by the court without the website owners present. According to Bitcoininfo’s representative, the application process was unilaterally initiated by prosecutors without involving the website owners and without requesting the removal of content that was considered illegal. He also noted that the City Court refused to accept a request for appeal after the ban was enacted. Per the case file, local prosecutors requested a ban on the website because it contained information about cryptocurrencies, which are “outside of government control,” “facilitate growth of the shadow economy,” and “do not have specific consumer properties.” Earlier this year the City Court of St. Petersburg, annulled a trial court’s previous decision to ban 40 Bitcoin-related websites in the Russian Federation. The ban was initiated because the sites were “spreading information” about digital currency that “is not backed by any real asset and does not provide information about its owners.” The court’s decision precedes an upcoming crypto regulatory framework that is scheduled for July 1 by decree of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The framework is supported by the Russian State Duma’s Committee for Legislative Work and includes a bill “On Digital Financial Assets” which was released in March of this year.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://tass.ru/ekonomika/5261085"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "st. petersburg vyborg district court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "district court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. petersburg city court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoininfo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. petersburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T10:55:24.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2dd073a263bedeef3ed1c417911bea31d0d0c199", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRe4DGh4oFxA5X8GonOziVBGiHBpaKzMa2mvqAKy09dVcFKTjeaSvg1", "site_full": "plus.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "https://plus.google.com/s/Apple", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Search Results - Google+", "title": "Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak hopes bitcoin will become a single global curr...", "title_full": "Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak hopes bitcoin will become a single global curr...", "published": "2018-06-05T02:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.155, "main_image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/mOFIzRdcd71ynQ93oRbr2QcIyV7Lwb3Uq0VLx5q_qsTXakz7fMguwxLTMYQygGtfNHom9xovfTU0ckgOwaY_3WiRGgHfpT9el0ejxqhSTIytKVnrqmLzy0QL3pQYyflddwNfLHRiq0wmoQCV8MooEHO7-UDjTC19Ml1aMqW0bREwRA=w530-h277-p", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2dd073a263bedeef3ed1c417911bea31d0d0c199", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRe4DGh4oFxA5X8GonOziVBGiHBpaKzMa2mvqAKy09dVcFKTjeaSvg1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "plus.google.com", "published": "2018-06-05T02:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak hopes bitcoin will become a single global curr...", "text": "Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak hopes bitcoin will become a single global currency", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T19:18:21.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3e928b12b3bd9a7497f18a5c22f497deea85b478", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWEsBSwHveWIB4XqDQEvF_E-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Which is more risky?

Although problematic in its own right, the attack highlights one of the biggest weaknesses of blockchain platforms like Bitcoin — computing power.\nBlockchain backed cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin,and ZenCash , are built on a “proof-of-work” system. That means that the network goes along with what a majority of ‘nodes’ ( or miners ) say is true. It’s a secure system because to trick it, you need to control more than half of those nodes, or an equivalent amount of computing power.\nWhile that might be difficult for a platform like Bitcoin where there are thousands upon thousands of high-powered mining rigs, it’s much easier to trick smaller cryptocurrency networks. That is exactly what happened with ZenCash, where over a period of four hours, attackers used masses of computing power to take control of the blockchain and create alternate histories, thereby letting them spend their ZenCash twice.\nBecause the attackers covered their tracks, no one quite knows what they did with it, but no doubt it was profitable. Crypto51 looks at the hash rate, or global computing power currently mining different cryptocurrencies, and how much a 51 percent attack would technically cost to perform if rented from existing networks. In the case of ZenCash, the attacker would theoretically only have had to spend around $30,000 to complete the double-spendhack.\nBlockchain networks like Bitcoin, which are far larger, would require a much greater expenditure to complete a 51 percent attack — $717,000 for just one hour, according to Crypto51. Fortunately, there isn’t enough rental power in the world to conduct such an attack, but if an organization was to get a hold of enough hashing power, those currencies are just as vulnerable and could be attacked in much the same way.\nZenCash isn’t the only cryptocurrency that has been hit with a 51 percent attack. As Bitcoinist reports , both Bitcoin Gold and Verge have both been hit in a similar manner in recent months. They required less hashing power than ZenCash, so it’s possible that this latest attack is just another example ifa trend of upward trajectory attacks that target much more vulnerable cryptocurrencies and blockchain platforms.\nFifty-one percent attacks aren’t the only problems faced by Bitcoin and public blockchain platforms, though, these developers are trying to solve them .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.crypto51.app/", "https://bitcoinist.com/zencash-target-51-attack-loses-500k-double-spend-transactions/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "killeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jon martindale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "temple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T04:04:53.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f82447c1bc17a3fb475ed465201933e80593fa5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcE6WyEUs2sKr80bsMHkCd4-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=71.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Games and rounds", "title": "[DAILY FREE RAFFLE]JUST BECAUSE I AM STILL IN A GOOD MOOD 32.0 BITCOIN COIN", "title_full": "[DAILY FREE RAFFLE]JUST BECAUSE I AM STILL IN A GOOD MOOD 32.0 BITCOIN COIN", "published": "2018-06-05T02:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f82447c1bc17a3fb475ed465201933e80593fa5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcE6WyEUs2sKr80bsMHkCd4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "krogothmanhattan", "published": "2018-06-05T02:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "[DAILY FREE RAFFLE]JUST BECAUSE I AM STILL IN A GOOD MOOD 32.0 BITCOIN COIN", "text": "Ok...lets roll!

Now, even the US captures. New York State plans to establish a task to study the effects of digital currencies in the financial markets of New York City. Some countries like Norway and Switzerland play with the idea to launch their own digital currency. Estonia planned to establish a national crunch condo, Estcoin, but had to put its bid against an object from the European Central Bank. During the launch of an ETF Crypto based on the United States remains a remote dream, Huobi's third largest encryption exchange in the world of sales volume, launched an ETF based on its market index. The largest exchange of encryption of the world, Binance, has also announced plans to launch $ 1 billion to invest in mutilated startups. We believe the world is moving towards a larger adoption of crimes that should boost the next stage of the grated. We want to take advantage of the current decline in mutilated markets to set up positions, however we are waiting for the right time to invest. See if we can find buyers today. BTC / USD Bitcoin approached the 20-day EMA but could not handle. If it does not stop at current levels, it can fall up to $ 7,300 and it will collect $ 7,100 below it.\n The 20-day EMA acts as a declining resistance and acts as a support in the uptrend. Therefore, until the BTC / USD pair escapes the 20-day EMA, it will be negative and able to sell pressure on such a market.\nRetailers must wait for a $ 7,000 pickup or a 20-day EMA break to establish long positions. We do not find purchase purchases at the current level; We therefore suggest that retailers stay on their side.\nETH / USD\nEthereum is trading inside the lower channel, lowering the low and low levels. The trend will change when the digital piece breaks this band and makes more and more loss.\nFrom the chain's support line on May 28, the digital currency rallied on the chain's resistance line on June 3 but the bulls could not get out of the channel; so prices have fallen again today. If the following below does not fall under the agreement of May 28, it will be a positive sign. We suggest retailers expect the ETH / USD pair to break and close (UTC period) over the lower channel before starting long positions.\nOtherwise, if the digital currency goes through the mark of $ 492.5, it will turn back to the support of the chain, close to $ 464. We did not find any purchase options at current levels.\nXRP / USD\nRepeated repeated on critical support at $ 0.56270 and moved over the 20-day EMA, but could not get out of the 50-day SMA. It continues trading between a sequential triangle, which is a bear sign. Breakdown below the $ 0.54 level can drop the drop to $ 0.45. The first sign of strength will be when the pair of XRP / USD breaks the levels of $ 0.83. The two flat moving averages, which punctuate the action of the range, rather than a tendency to move.\nWe will wait a few days before suggesting business.\nBCH / USD\nWe were waiting for Bitcoin Cash to trade in a small range, but we were proved incorrectly, as it was the case in the last two days and we approached the SMA at 50 days.\nLe couple BCH / USD diminue plus que les niveaux de 1 200 $. Il peut rester à 20 jours EMA ou au 1000ème niveau.\nSi l'un des supports est pris en charge, les taureaux essaieront à nouveau de sortir de la SMA de 50 jours et reviendront à des niveaux de 1 400 $.\nNous attendrons les pièces virtuelles pour trouver du soutien avant de suggérer des entreprises.\nEOS / USD\nEOS a atteint un objectif après le lancement d'EOSIO 1.0 et est proche de son objectif principal de 15 635 $, précisé dans notre analyse précédente. Cependant, nous n'avons pas recommandé certaines positions parce que nous ne négocions pas lors d'événements importants en raison du haut niveau d'incertitude.\nThe EOS / USD couple is experiencing benefits at higher levels and will likely reimburse the extraordinary levels at $ 12.9870. The 20-day EMA is also just above this level.\nIf the level is maintained, the bulls will try to climb back to levels of $ 18.67, but if the support is broken, the digital currency will return to the range and may return to levels of $ 10.3384.\nWe expect more clarity before recommending a company.\nLTC / USD\nLitecoin dropped levels of $ 127, which is a significant resistance. His hostile support is $ 115,447, which is the bid below on May 30th. If this level is broken, a slide at $ 107.102 is possible.\nHowever, if the level is maintained, the bulls will try again to break out of the higher resistance.\nIf the LTC / USD feeds on $ 127, it can rally to the lower trend of the lower triangle, about $ 150. Therefore, we recommend a long position on a close (UTC) greater than $ 127 with a close stop.\nWe recommend keeping the attributable size less than 50 percent of the custom for this business because digital currency always deals in a bassist style. The negative configuration will be canceled if the bulls are $ 160.\nADA / USD\nIn the last two days, Cardano has exceeded the levels of $ 0.23 intimately, but could not close (UTC) above. As a result, our compensation recommended in the previous analysis has not been triggered.\nAt present, the pair of ADA / USD has fallen. He has strong support at the levels of $ 0.17. If this level is broken, it can slide down the big range to $ 0.13.\nHowever, if the bulls kill the current weakness and cause a tournament, a breakdown of the levels of $ 0.23 should be positive. The 50-day SMA may be a slight resistance, but we expect this level to be exceeded.\nAs a result, we retain our purchase recommendations provided in the previous analysis.\nXLM / USD\nStellar closed (UTC time frame) on the 20-day EMA with a small margin on June 3, preventing our purchase of suggestions provided in the previous analysis.\nThe bulls did not profit from the 20-day EMA, which resulted in a decrease below the moving average and the horizontal line today.\nThe 20-day EMA is flat and the 50-day SMA is also flat. This increases the likelihood of distance training soon.\nWe will monitor for a few days and close the position if the XLM / USD pair does not exceed $ 0.32.\nIn case of deactivation, the support is $ 0.242 and less than $ 0.184.\nIOTA / USD\nThe IOTA left the SMA for 50 days on June 3 but could not sustain higher levels. It has only fallen above the $ 2 levels and currently supports the 20-day EMA. Offsetting this can extend the reduction to $ 1.63, which is a big support.\n If bulls protect levels of $ 1.63 for a few days, retailers can see this as a possible opportunity with interruptions under $ 1.3.\nLong positions must be avoided if the IOTA / USD depreciates $ 1.63, because the following failure is $ 1.33 and lower than the $ 0.9150 lower.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cardano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huobi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "estcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european central bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york state", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "estonia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T02:32:34.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "955fba3f8106126f6a8589a4251469285262595a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8XqOntjcFnQMtVk0j.KiFN8N5TfflugQMscVwziRp1QN.64w9_aC1pCkU9Sx5V8jAtsiiquMj9BLLnJBeqWMiJ151scX26Cy_uVn_bhxQIgwTGojdHsIpfzQmt11RG2HoDI0jkmStAGw--", "site_full": "www.feedurbrain.com", "site": "feedurbrain.com", "site_section": "http://www.feedurbrain.com/forum/external.php?type=RSS2", "site_categories": ["bodybuilding", "non_standard_content", "adult", "sports"], "section_title": "Your Source For Free Knowledge", "title": "[GET] Udemy - Bitcoin Investing - The Complete Buy + Hold Strategy", "title_full": "[GET] Udemy - Bitcoin Investing - The Complete Buy + Hold Strategy", "published": "2018-06-05T02:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "RO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 94881, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "955fba3f8106126f6a8589a4251469285262595a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8XqOntjcFnQMtVk0j.KiFN8N5TfflugQMscVwziRp1QN.64w9_aC1pCkU9Sx5V8jAtsiiquMj9BLLnJBeqWMiJ151scX26Cy_uVn_bhxQIgwTGojdHsIpfzQmt11RG2HoDI0jkmStAGw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "csaby", "published": "2018-06-05T02:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "[GET] Udemy - Bitcoin Investing - The Complete Buy + Hold Strategy", "text": "Offline and Internet Marketing Download Area [GET] Udemy - Bitcoin Investing - The Complete Buy + Hold Strategy before you can post: click the register link above to proceed.

Wozniak\nWider adoption remains a problem for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, with the majority of people using them to buy illicit substances on the dark web and many others holding Bitcoin in the hope the price will rise.\nThe number of Bitcoin transactions has now fallen to around 200,000 per day, down from some 400,000 in December last year .\nSpeaking to CNBC at the Money20/20 conference Wozniak said he believes Bitcoin will become the single global currency.\nHe said: \"I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it's going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking.\"\nTwitter founder and chief executive Dorsey said he expects to see Bitcoin adopted as global means of payment speaking at the Consensus conference in New York last month .\nWozniak added:\nBitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of Bitcoin, there's a way it's distributed… and it's pure and there's no human running, there's no company running and it's just… growing and growing… and surviving, that to me says something that is natural and nature is more important than all our human conventions.\nWozniak admitted in February he cashed out all but one of his Bitcoin, saying he didn't want to be an investor and glued to the price swings but only experiment with the technology.\nHe also owns a couple of Ether, the payment token of the the Ethereum network.\nIt's not the first time Wozniak has said he supports Bitcoin. At the Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas in October last year Wozniak said he thinks Bitcoin is better than both gold and the U.S. dollar thanks to its limited and decentralised nature.\nAccording to Wozniak, the blockchain and cryptocurrencies will achieve their full potential in a decade.\nSpeaking on wider fintech regulation at Money20/20 Wozniak said: \"Regulation is an essential element to the fintech transformation happening today. Fairness, equality and truth is the foundation for good regulation and that will lay the groundwork for good development.\"\nMeanwhile, non-executive chairman of Goldman Sachs José Barroso told Money20/20 attendees: \"I myself won't invest in cryptocurrencies. But this is a question of generations: young people invest so much time and effort that we will soon see global acceptance rise for a leading cryptocurrency.\"\nLast month Goldman revealed it plans to buy and sell cryptocurrency, setting it apart from many of its Wall Street competitors at a time when the U.S. regulator is taking a greater interest in Bitcoin's wild price swings.\nGoldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein said back in December last year that Bitcoin “is not for him” as the cryptocurrency hit record price highs of almost $20,000 before falling back sharply in 2018.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "steve jobs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "important apple", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amsterdam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T22:31:37.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "96d433b025fcef1f61b32ccba889a0553f9e495a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS6L7nbyxruQWhi6rtHWl0E-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "title_full": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "published": "2018-06-05T02:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.02, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "96d433b025fcef1f61b32ccba889a0553f9e495a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS6L7nbyxruQWhi6rtHWl0E-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "gentlemand", "published": "2018-06-05T02:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "text": "Quote: from: Ibian on Today at 06:21:19 PM It's weird to think of myself as young in the post-mid-30s bracket, but I have noticed the same thing.\nA very interesting stat and I've no idea why.

I can just see my father typing them in to some scam site or asking for help from someone unscrupulous. My solution was to write up a simple but comprehensive guide on how to use mnemonic seeds to access my crypto while making sure it was simple enough for a reasonably intelligent layman to understand.\nI'm also concerned about theft, so rather than store my entire seed at one location I've split it up 3 ways. I've used the ColdTi to stamp my seeds into titanium plates (surprisingly affordable!), then I've used plasti-dip to coat the plates so that if someone wants to read the seed they'll need to peel the rubber off, making it plain that it's been tampered with.\nEach plate includes 16 words so only 2 of 3 plates are needed to complete a single 24 word mnemonic key. A potential attacker would need to gain access to two different homes and find the plates, and they would need to do so without being noticed at the first home, as the peeling of the rubber coating would be a sure sign that the seed was compromised.\nHere's the booklet I've written up. The mnemonic seed plate will be attached to this booklet. It will be printed double sided on thick-ish A6 paper, which is 1/4 the size of a standard A4 page. Small, but not so small that it's hard to read. Essentially it will be a 50-odd page instruction book (mostly the BIP39 word list) on how to use a mnemonic seed to gain access to funds.\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1R-idRKjY-jxitWqcWo2Bvw41j4Ux-3hz\nWhat do you guys think?\nEDIT: This version of the booklet (tentatively named \"The Inheritor's Guide to Cryptocurrency\") is specifically targeted to my family and seed backup system. Due to public interest I'm considering writing up a more comprehensive guide to cryptocurrency recovery, one which covers saved mnemonics, private keys in a few common currencies (and general instructions for others), OPSEC and so on.\nThe idea is that the inheriting parent, spouse or otherwise crypto-illiterate heir will be able to recover the crypto left to them without having to rely on help from others (which dramatically increases the odds of scams, etc).\nThe guide won't be walkthrough, as software changes over time so screenshots are likely to be fairly useless. I want to create something that can be given to family or that family will be able to find online easily if needed. Too many people come online looking for help recovering their deceased family members' crypto - there should be a place to refer them that is specifically written with them in mind.\nWhat do y'all

product of the long-running bull market, which is pushing investors to take more risk and “believe things.” Chanos agreed that bitcoin is a “libertarian fantasy” and said its main utility is avoiding tax. “This is simply a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough in monetary policy.”\nLONDON – Renowned short seller Jim Chanos thinks cryptocurrencies are a product of the run-away global bull market and have little use beyond avoiding tax.\nChanos, known for predicting the collapse of Enron, addressed the topic of cryptocurrencies in an interview with the Institute for New Economic Thinking.\nChanos, who runs New York-based Kynikos Associates, said investors are getting “a little bit jiggy with their capital” and are more “willing to take risks, willing to believe things” the longer the current bull market goes on.\n“So today we’ve got bitcoin and ICOs [initial coin offerings], which went ballistic in 2017,” Chanos said. “I suspect going forward we’re going to see more and more evidence of questionable companies as this bull market keeps advancing and ageing.”\n“We’re now nine years into this bull market, same as the ’90s, so I suspect that now things are starting to percolate. I think bitcoin and the ICOs are just one manifestation of that,” he said.\nChanos expressed scepticism about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally. Huge amounts of capital flowed into the sector last year, which peaked at over $US800 billion in value in December.\nBitcoin’s original enthusiasts were drawn to the fact that the cryptocurrency was independent of any nation state or central bank, making it theoretically immune from things like quantitative easing. They also argued that its independence made it a more viable long-term currency.\nChanos said: “For those who believe it’s a store of value in the coming apocalypse, the idea is that you’re going to have to safeguard your key under a mountain with fingerprint and eye scan security while the hordes are outside your bunker trying to get in to use it – for what, I have no idea. Because for those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that’s exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least. Food would work the best!”\nThe interviewer then suggested bitcoin is a “libertarian fantasy,” to which Chanos replied: “That’s exactly what it is. And if you say, well, fiat currency is going to bring the world down, which could, of course, happen, then I say the last thing I’d want to own is bitcoin if the grid goes down.”\nHe added: “Bitcoin is still the area for people who are trying to avoid taxation or other examinations of their transactions. That’s one thing where I think it probably still has utility, but the governments have figured that out.\n“This is simply a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough in monetary policy. Someone at Grant’s interest rate conference recently said that it was as if we had intentionally created a ‘monetary Somalia’.”\nYou can read the full interview here.

In general, many people doesn't believe in xrp they buy and hold it for profit and not like bitcoins ripple can't stand alone it is the King and of all cryptocurrency.\nAgree. Many people only invest in Ripple to make profit in the long term, but not with the intention to use it as a serious \"cryptocurrency\" whatsoever. Over time, it has been shown that Ripple is extremely centralized and manipulated by its internal company. Since the Ripple company owns most of the XRP tokens, they can do whatever they desire to manipulate its price. On the other hand, Bitcoin is decentralized and was the first cryptocurrency which have started it all. Due to its resilience, and inmutability properties, people use it more for their everyday transactions since no single entity has control over it.\nBitcoin as we know it, removes the middleman and brings freedom to the people (something that Ripple cannot achieve to this date). In this sense, anyone can join or leave the network at will, making it the perfect money for the people by the people. In the end, Bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies will win, while Ripple might fail in the future.

Co-founder of Datatrek Research and Wall Street Bitcoin analyst Nicholas Colas, cited by CNBC, links the decline in web searches to the coin’s price rates that have similarly dropped by approximately 50 percent this year. In an email to his clients, Colas adds that “[ Bitcoin ] needs a new narrative in order to reestablish global attention”. Google Trends analyzes different periods of popularity of certain web searches. A value of 100 is taken as a peak popularity for a specific search term. In the beginning of January Bitcoin’s popularity was 37, dropping to as low as 9 by the beginning of June. Colas also mentions the decreasing number of newly created Bitcoin wallets, comparing the current period with the last quarter of 2017, when Bitcoin prices neared $20,000 . The growth in the number of new wallets in 2018 so far was only 3.7 percent, while in late 2017 it compounded 7.6 percent monthly. “Bitcoin wallet growth needs to be +5 percent/month to see meaningful price appreciation”, Colas concluded. Google searches for other cryptocurrencies are also in decline, according to CNBC. Ethereum – the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization – has dropped by 70 percent since early 2018, Bitcoin Cash has lost 82 percent and XRP fell 87 percent.\nStill, the fifth largest cryptocurrency EOS ’ searches have jumped 97 percent in 2018.

Moreover, more and more analysts are pointing to some financial crisis after another as each day goes by. Whether it is because of the cessation of QE, or because of the issues in Italy, or trade wars, etc., we are clearly not lacking for any reasons as to why this market should crash. The problem is that most bubble-callers have no objective perspective through which they can determine that any market is in a bubble. As an example, one article I recently read suggests we are in a bubble in the Nasdaq because we have exceeded the 2000 bubble high in the market. Well, along those lines, maybe the Dow should not have exceeded the “bubble high” it struck in 1929!? Now, I want to highlight the ultimate intellectual dishonesty and inconsistency in most of their thinking regarding bubbles. You see, many of these same analysts are looking for a massive rally in gold. Yet, one has to wonder why they can logically see gold rally well past its “bubble high” struck in 2011, but they are unable to accept any other market rallying beyond their “bubble highs” struck in recent history? I think one has to start viewing much of the analysis being published today as more emotionally-based rather than analytically-based. For those that have followed my analysis through the years, you know that I use Elliott Wave analysis to provide me with an objective context through which I am able to analyze markets. This methodology allowed me to identify the high in gold in 2011 within $6 of the high struck, as well as buy back into the market right at the lows almost 2 years ago. This same methodology allowed us to catch the lows in the US Dollar in 2011, and called for a multi-year rally in the DXY to the 103.50 region when most everyone else at the time was looking for a dollar crash, especially when you consider all of the QE thrown at the market (another fundamental analysis failure). And, this methodology has kept us on the correct side of the equity market, as we have been looking to exceed 2600SPX for years, when most others were quite certain this bull market was going to end years ago. You see, Elliott Wave analysis provides the context for viewing markets objectively, and in a non-linear fashion. So, just because one views a market as having struck a “bubble high” years ago does not mean that the market will not well exceed those highs in the future. And, the perfect example we are seeing set up like that is in the crypto-world as well. While many have told me that the fundamentals suggest that crypto’s should be closer to zero than they are today, the structure of the market suggests that we could be setting up for a major rally in 2018. And, anyone who really wants to understand the crypto market’s should be following Ryan Wilday , as he is the most accurate crypto-analyst I have seen. In fact, he nailed the bottom we struck in ETH last week , and is now providing guidelines to determine when that bottom is confirmed. So, based upon Ryan’s analysis, it does not look like it is highly likely that the crypto-bubble-callers will be correct in their assessments. And, I don’t think the bubble-callers for the stock market will fare any better. You see, the action we have seen over the last several months have been corrective, and support our expectation that the S&P500 is still pointing to 3000. Last weekend, I noted that once we break below 2700SPX, it will have us looking down to the 2600-2650SPX region. While I had initially thought we could see one more micro rally towards my ideal target at 2758SPX, the market only reached a high of 2742SPX, so we came up about 16 points short of my ideal target. It certainly reminds me that there is no way one can be 100% accurate when dealing with our non-linear markets. But, the break down below 2700SPX still came up short of our target below as well. This now places the market in a position wherein it will likely tell us in the coming week whether the drop below 2700 has completed all the pullback we are going to see before we rally to 3000, or if we are still setting up to drop to the 2600-2650SPX region. As long as we remain below the 2742/53SPX resistance, the market still retains the potential to drop down to those lower targets. However, if we rally through 2753SPX, then it certainly increases the probabilities we have begun our trek to 3000SPX in 2018.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://seekingalpha.com/author/ryan-wilday/articles#regular_articles", "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4178947-weekly-opportunities-cryptocurrency-bottom-held-can-go", "https://www.sprottmoney.com/Blog/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "avi gilb", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sprott money bubbles", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T02:13:43.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "94f621db24eb1b5eded1d2ec5b6e905a88603e0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jKBnUvkna12xCnu2QcpywI9v.lZBGzcYF5ACKBnfyTragtnX4LBJYPy2XCtfQ589cdipP6vtFb29J33fsiEXsqkndwRZ_71hu", "site_full": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site": "thebitcoinnews.com", "site_section": "http://TheBitcoinNews.com/rss/", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "The Bitcoin News – Leading Bitcoin News and Cryptocurrency News", "title": "Is Cloud Mining More Profitable than Bitcoin Mining Hardware?", "title_full": "Is Cloud Mining More Profitable than Bitcoin Mining Hardware?", "published": "2018-06-05T02:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://thebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hardware-mining.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "94f621db24eb1b5eded1d2ec5b6e905a88603e0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKIZZ49mq.rRx190bpjs2jKBnUvkna12xCnu2QcpywI9v.lZBGzcYF5ACKBnfyTragtnX4LBJYPy2XCtfQ589cdipP6vtFb29J33fsiEXsqkndwRZ_71hu", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Coincentral", "published": "2018-06-05T02:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is Cloud Mining More Profitable than Bitcoin Mining Hardware?", "text": "Is Cloud Mining More Profitable than Bitcoin Mining Hardware? June 5, 2018 191\nGetting started with bitcoin mining can be a difficult process for many. For example, you must consider things like the specific algorithm used by the Proof-of-Work cryptocurrency you want to mine. Additionally, bitcoin mining hardware can cost thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars. With all of these challenges it might be a good idea to look at alternative ways to gain cryptocurrency profits, but is cloud mining a legit, more profitable option in the long-run? In this article, we’ll compare these two possible options so you can make a more informed decision. Costs of Bitcoin Mining Hardware\nAs discussed in this post , bitcoin mining hardware generally requires a substantial upfront financial commitment on the part of miners. First, it’s important to consider how much mining rigs cost. This not only depends on the cryptocurrency which you are aiming to mine but also how expansive and powerful your mining operation needs to be.\nFirst, let’s consider hardware costs. If you want to mine BTC, for example, you’ll most likely need an ASIC mining rig. These are typically much more expensive compared to GPU and CPU mining rigs . Despite their potential to mine at much faster hash rates, ASIC mining rigs often face scrutiny for the fact that they cannot be repurposed. This means that, if a cryptocurrency project makes changes to their hash algorithms, ASIC miners will have to buy new gear. This can lead to some significant costs that can easily negate revenues and even lead to net investment losses.\nIn contrast, GPU and CPU mining gear can generally be repurposed if algorithm changes occur. In addition, these rigs are usually much less than their ASIC counterparts. Additionally, more projects are continuing to trend towards ASIC-resistance rather than ASIC-acceptance. For most miners, this means an overall reduction in both upfront and ongoing costs.\nWhile having one mining rig might be a good first step to see if you can indeed become profitable, many people start out with more rigs to have a multiplier effect. However, even with rising prices, starting with multiple rigs should be done cautiously as each additional rig will likely add to the number of months it takes to make back your initial investment.\nOf course, other factors like electric bill costs have to be considered. These vary by geographic area, making it difficult to put a precise amount on how much money is needed for keeping hardware rigs operations. Costs of IT Cloud Mining\nIn comparison to hardware mining, costs for IT cloud mining are much simpler to calculate. Most companies run on a monthly subscription model that is determined by the cryptocurrency you want to mine and the hash rate speeds as seen on popular sites like Genesis Mining and HashFlare .\nPrices for 2-year contracts of ETH mining with Genesis Mining currently vary from $1,520 at 40 MH/s to $12,960 at 360 MH/s.\nHashFlare offers 1-year contracts of ETH mining for $1.80 per 100 KH/s.\nMake sure to read reviews and check out projected ROI on any cloud mining service. The fact is that there are many services with extremely low profitability and even some which are known scams. Luckily, there are a few guides available on the best ways to identify potential cloud mining scams . Hardware Mining ROI\nEven though there is no way to say for certain how long it will take to break even on investments in hardware mining equipment or cloud mining, it’s still crucial to do research on estimated time frames. According to most miners, it’s difficult to expect to become profitable within 3 to 6 months. 10-15 months is realistic for many, though. A lot depends on crypto prices, electric costs, and the type of mining rig you use. Nicehash provides a good calculator for determining this. IT Cloud Mining ROI\nBased on information from Reddit forums , reviews , and ROI calculators , it is clear to see that cloud mining isn’t all that popular or profitable. For example, as of May 30, 2018, HashFlare Scrypt and SHA-256 currently take 3,828 and 3,983 days (or a little over 10 years) to reach ROI on BTC respectively according to this calculator from Coinstaker . Genesis Mining for ETH has an even worse ROI, taking around 25,992 days (70+ years). In both cases, it’s difficult to justify cloud mining over hardware mining.\nThe problem with keeping a subscription for cloud mining is that it can be difficult to keep paying monthly even in bear markets. These stats could certainly improve if we see a massive bull run as seen in December 2017; however, it can be pretty difficult to predict when a bull market will begin and end.\nCompare this to using bitcoin mining hardware, and the choice is a bit more obvious. That’s because, even if the market is bear, most costs are upfront and not recurring. Sure, there are costs like electric bills to consider with hardware mining, but there are several locations throughout the world where energy consumption is very cheap and hardware mining is legal, making it a clearly more profitable option than cloud mining even in bear markets. Conclusion\nDespite the high upfront costs, the consensus is that bitcoin mining hardware remains much more profitable than cloud mining. Possibly the biggest benefit of cloud mining is its overall ease-of-use since it requires no difficult hardware installation and avoids potentially unpredictable electric costs. However, most in the cryptocurrency community would agree that if you can’t start a hardware mining operation, it’s probably best to make profits through trading rather than going the cloud mining route.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/guides/how-to-identify-a-bitcoin-or-ethereum-cloud-mining-scam/", "https://www.nicehash.com/profitability-calculator", "https://coincentral.com/bitcoin-mining-risks-and-rewards-for-entrepreneurs/", "https://www.coinstaker.com/bitcoin-cloud-mining", "https://www.genesis-mining.com/", "https://coincentral.com/bitcoin-mining-hardware-is-it-still-a-smart-investment/", "https://coincentral.com/making-sense-of-proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake/", "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-best-places-in-the-world-to-mine-bitcoin-669968853.html", "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/634kar/almost_a_year_of_cloud_mining_at_hashflare/", "https://coincentral.com/asic-gpu-cpu-mining/", "https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/hashcoins/mining-contract-sha-256-small/", "https://hashflare.io/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin mining hardware as", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T02:56:28.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c94e2e2d66518c26b560eb4b8d5b7a056dfa2d54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFdUjJ_gRyW5pM1kRkGbrujquvTv9KV54B4yngUhSwEeknHWeCW9CAEzt0aUBw_ZouKnVRdMMSUlvkzM1fx3FEK0knIj2hQScYMUxhJPBNUNn5gRGNwrNZKE-", "site_full": "www.youbrandinc.com", "site": "youbrandinc.com", "site_section": "http://www.youbrandinc.com/feed", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "You Brand, Inc.", "title": "Bitcoin price latest: Why is Bitcoin falling?

Escape will cancel and close the window.\nThe bitcoin price has struggled to turn around the one-month descending trend since the start of May. If the upward movement of bitcoin fades, experts predict there could be a decline in the currency to the $6,000 region. The corrective rally from $7,040 to $7,700 looked optimistic, particularly among short-term bulls who have predicted the price of bitcoin would hit back to the $10,000 region within June. A short-term break out to the $8,000 region supported by the corrective rally from $7,040 was conditional, as this required the volume of BTC to rise and the cryptocurrency to keep going at its weekly peak. Due to its low trading volume though, BTC has not met a major short-term support level at $8,000 and so has fallen to to $7,600. A drop to $7,500 could result in BTC experiencing yet another minor correction, potentially to the higher end of $6,000 or even lower. Writing for Daily FX, market analyst Paul Robinson said: “Keep an eye on the daily trend-line on weakness – a hold may give us the larger pattern at some point, while a break could lead down towards 6400.”\nWhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of BTC is 43.3, it is not showing an oversold condition for BTC. LiteCoin is going down with the market dip Despite the negative price trend of BTC, most multi-billion dollar hedge funds are still extremely optimistic in BTC and the entire cryptocurrency market. The expected decline in the price of BTC is a five to 10 percent drop maximum, which could extend to 15 percent at its worst.\nTokens enjoy a surge in volume and price when the price of BTC is increasing gradually and volume of the cryptocurrency market picks up.

In a latest interview with CNBC, the personal computer mogul admitted he expects bitcoin will become a single global currency and that he shares the sentiment of Twitter and Square Chief executive officer Jack Dorsey, who voiced his own belief last March that bitkoyn would become a unifying cryptocurrency for each and every nation inside the next 10 years.I buy in what Jack Dorsey says, he said, not really that I necessarily believe it is going to take place, but because I need it to be that way.\n, Wozniak first bought bitcoin when it was priced at $700, roughly $6, 700 less than where it currently stands. He’s since sold almost his entire stash, but for one coin, so admitting he never wanted to be an investor, but he was just intrigued by the way a cryptocurrency worked. In addition, he owns two ether, he’s been very complimentary toward. In a latest conference in Vienna, Wozniak commended Ethereum and stated it’d the capacity to become the new Apple. , Ethereum interests me because it can do things and because it is a platform, he confirmed. Wozniak now refers to bitcoin as pure, and says it is the genuine equivalent of electronic gold.\nBitcoin is mathematically defined, he explained, there is a particular amount of bitcoin, there is a way it is dispersed &hellip, and it is pure and there is no human conducting, there’s no firm running it, and it is just going, and growing, and surviving. That, to me, say something that’s natural, and temperament is more essential than our human conventions. ,” This isn’t the very first time Wozniak was vocally optimistic about bitcoin. In a Money 20/20 event in Las Vegas last October, the Apple co creator lauded the cryptocurrency and its own Blockchain technology is stronger and more economically sound than both gold and USD.\nHe said that traditional monies are kind of phony, as they are commonly susceptible to inflation, and thatthe issue with gold is that there’s no fixed supply. There’s a certain number of bitocans that may ever exist, he continued. Gold is extracted and mined and mined. Maybe there is a limited amount of gold from the world, but cryptocurrency is even more mathematical and controlled, and no one can change mathematics. , Wozniak also called for further regulation attempts, stating they were essential to bitcoin’s survival. Regulation is a vital component to the fintech transformation occurring today, he exclaimed.

In block 1237565, the coinbase transaction contains an additional output: OP_RETURN [5554583011007bc4426b03824ccca5912bb147bd9f6847b670a08f24b79a4b5ed0b36393] This metadata is a UTXO Commitment as it is currently being developed across Bitcoin Cash implementations. Let us see how it works. Fast Syncing Nodes Currently new full nodes download the entire historical blockchain. Not only does this cause an annoying delay in the initial setup, but this also results in a disproportionate burden on existing nodes that spend a large portion of their bandwidth providing these old blocks. Why do full nodes need this? They don’t actually validate these blocks. Most implementations contain a parameter called \"assumevalid\" which contains a hardcoded default: https://bitcrust.org/assets/screen_assumevalid.png This isn’t as trusting as it sounds. When you would validate these blocks, you would validate them according to the rules as written in the software. All that the assumevalid hardcoded value claims, is that the these blocks follow the rules as programmed in that very same software. It’s merely a “precompiled validation” that does not increase trust or decrease security. The only reason that these full nodes need the entire history is to initiate their bookkeeping: To validate incoming transactions and blocks they must know which outputs of which transactions are currently unspent. They must create an Unspent Transaction Output set, or UTXO set. Generating this set requires them to browse through all blocks gathering all outputs, and crossing off outputs that are spent by inputs. It would be a great improvement if full nodes would be able to just download the UTXO set (~2gb) instead of the entire history (~140gb). A UTXO Commitment: First attempt A commitment of a dataset is a value that is deterministically calculated for that dataset. A good example is how transactions are committed to blocks. When we colloquially say that a transaction is in a block, we actually mean that the transaction is committed to the transaction commitment (\"merkle root\") of the block header. This means the commitment can only be constructed using that transaction. This allows nodes to download the transactions and verify whether with them, the commitment can be constructed and thus whether the transactions are “in” the block. We can do the same with the UTXO set. If we create a commitment of the entire UTXO set somewhere in the block (in a coinbase output), new full nodes can download the UTXO set and verify it against this commitment. A simple way to construct the commitment is to order all UTXOs by some key and then hash them all together: https://bitcrust.org/assets/utxo1.svg Such a commitment ( 24d0 …) would work for syncing full nodes. It is uniquely determined by the set, so new full nodes can download the UTXO set and verify it against this commitment. It has a major flaw though: Nodes will need to completely reconstruct it from the entire UTXO set every block. This would take way to much time for it to be feasible. Making it iterative We need to construct a commitment that is iterative : implementations should be able to update a commitment from the transactions in a block, without completely reconstructing it. A simple change to make this possible, would be to hash each UTXO separately, treat these hashes as numbers and simply add them all together: https://bitcrust.org/assets/utxo2.svg Now new syncing nodes can verify this the same way as before, but the same commitment can also be updated per block . The implementation can simply subtract the hashes of outputs that are spent, and add the new outputs and the resulting commitment will be the same as when it is constructed from the current set. This also has a flaw however: It isn’t unique . It is possible for an attacker to construct a UTXO set that will result in the same commitment. Although the commitment is too large to try every combination, the attacker can abuse the fact that we’re using simple addition to apply clever algorithms to find such set easily. Making it secure Luckily to make it iterative doesn’t require us to use addition. We can also use something that behaves like addition. As long as we have an operation that is commutative and has some way to apply it in reverse it will work. We can use any group, and a good candidate for a group with better security properties than addition would be the secp256k1 elliptic curve and its group operation. Instead of adding the hashes together, we interpret each hash as x and then find y such that y² = x³ + 7 . Then (x,y) is a point on the curve, and we can combine these points using the Elliptic Curve group operation “⊕”. (Exceptions aside, A ⊕ B = C means finding C such that there exists a linear equation that matches A,B and C). Such a construction is called an Elliptic Curve Multiset Hash , or ECMH. https://bitcrust.org/assets/utxo3.svg There is one caveat to this approach: For many values of x , the curve equation has no solution. Only for approximately half of them. To solve this, we will simply add a number (a \"nonce\") to our hash, hash it again, and increment the number as long as the algorithm fails: https://bitcrust.org/assets/utxo4.svg Now we have a secure commitment that can be updated iteratively per block and that can be used for new full nodes to check the UTXO set they receive. This is the commitment as it is found in the block on Testnet. Next steps There is still some work to do before we have fast syncing nodes. We can distinguish 4 steps: Maintain and include an informational UTXO commitment in the coinbase. Implement utxo/getutxo P2P messages to allow transfer of UTXO sets Verify the UTXO commitment as part of the block validation rules. Implement a fast-syncing bootstrap method. What we are witnessing in block 1237565, is an initial test of the code for step 1 which is currently being reviewed and discussed by various implementations. Future versions This UTXO commitment would greatly help with full nodes initial syncing. It does not however enable UTXO inclusion or exclusion proofs. Although you can verify the entire set against the commitment, you cannot verify individual UTXOs this way. UTXO inclusion and exclusion proofs may be interesting to allow a new type of wallet that doesn’t rely on tracking back blocks to find transactions when it has been offline, but instead can just sync up current balances. Future version may make this possible. For instance, it may be possible to divide the UTXO set in buckets where each bucket maintains its own ECMH and the buckets are hashed in a tree. The first version of the commitment is focused on the primary goal: to make the initial sync of full nodes blazingly fast and to reduce the bandwidth burden of providing old blocks to new nodes.

Institutional investors are always searching for a method of generating alpha, a return in excess of the industry rate. They are excluded from Purchasing Bitcoin directly as the current market is not synchronized, but they are able to purchase futures contracts.\nSeveral have been leaning more towards investing in hedge funds regarding the cryptocurrency industry rather than the individual cryptocurrencies. The Winklevoss fund is trying to put money into bitcoin directly. While it’s tough to say how much money was generated through bitcoin and other digital currency donations in the usa, there’s evidence to imply that bitcoin giving is on the upswing. Withdrawing money from a new country is also likely to be very problematic as you must pay extra fees. In trading, profit is created by purchasing and selling at the opportune moment.\nThe U.S. dollar is referred to as a fiat currency. A currency should be stable in order for individuals to utilize it. It’s possible to instantaneously transfer currencies between both exchanges free of charge, which is truly great. Digital currency is simply another possible edge. If you decide on digital currencies, the matter is solved as you don’t need to use a bank anymore. At this time it’s not a really great currency, as it’s not a fantastic medium of exchange and it’s not a great store of value, as it’s too volatile, hetold CNBC. Existing stock exchanges will also compete to be able to fulfill the user’s configuration requirements.\nThe worth of Numeraire is joined to the stake payouts which will rise over time. The worth of the American dollar is additionally a consensual hallucination. Its value and extreme volatility don’t have any financial basis, and they’re nobody’s responsibility.\nTo safeguard investors who don’t take the bank’s advice, regulators are necessary,” Mr Weber explained. As you may work with a financial institution in your country, they aren’t necessarily everywhere on earth. Much like banks are likely to play securities trading, there’s almost no very good play. The banks just don’t want to have the risk. Another thing to consider here is that you’re going to require a partner bank.\nAfter you make an account on Coinbase (or a different exchange), you should confirm your identity by uploading a photo of your drivers license or passport. As soon as your account is funded, you can proceed and make your very first purchase. As soon as you establish a bitcoin account, there are lots of exchanges in Australia where you are able to purchase your bitcoins. On the flip side, others may be more useful for more compact payments. Finding another means to take care of payments can be an extremely good concept, and that’s where the demand for digital currency comes into play. In order to make certain that the financial transactions are performed in a smooth and hassle-free fashion, you want to make certain you have the most suitable support in the type of a partner bank. Moreover, Bitcoin transactions aren’t connected with a name. Bitcoin Features\nThere certainly is a great deal of volatility in the bitcoin industry. There’s uncertainty about the upcoming regulation of Bitcoin. Then you’re going to know the capacity for Bitcoin. So it has all of the benefits of cryptocurrency minus the volatility that’s prevented mainstream adoption up to now. 1 obvious benefit from the increase in crypto-philanthropy is the access to new revenue streams for charity.\nIn the past few years, there’s been a steady increase in the use of cryptocurrency across all platforms and industries as everybody is starting to embrace it. With respect to the potential for accepting admission, the industry expects a high amount of agreement. Futures markets allow it to be feasible to short in adequate size with lots of of liquidity, thus affecting the price discovery in the underlying asset industry. Several marketplaces called Bitcoin exchanges permit people to purchase or sell Bitcoins utilizing different currencies. The stock exchange presents a situation much like the prisoner’s dilemma. Nobody trading in an industry is attempting to make that market efficient.\nIf you wish to be certain the trend is in motion await the 40 day average to provide way and await the very first pull back to the 20 day to receive long. Trading trends is quite lucrative and the above tools will allow you to make bigger currency trading profits. The gain in the use of cryptocurrency wouldn’t have been possible if not for its benefits. The recent surge in the cost of Bitcoin has led many to wonder if it’s a bubble.\nNo related posts.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "purchasing bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T11:32:11.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d630bfb30801df6b2f850a5f637476f805bee1b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRa2sYWw_4DH.9xayr2Z0g0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Article: Bitcoin Could Hit $100,000 This Year.", "title_full": "Article: Bitcoin Could Hit $100,000 This Year.", "published": "2018-06-05T01:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5d630bfb30801df6b2f850a5f637476f805bee1b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRa2sYWw_4DH.9xayr2Z0g0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dudeperfect", "published": "2018-06-05T01:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Article: Bitcoin Could Hit $100,000 This Year.", "text": "Even though, I am optimistic about the growth potential of Bitcoin, I don't think that the figure Quote: d by OP is possible to hit in this year as we have almost crossed the first half of this year and the price is still below $10K and I don't see any reason for the price to rise exponentially in the second half.

But I don't see how this can be true. For each transaction giving to the wallet, for example, don't you ahve to verify that those people have the necessary funds in their wallet, which would cause a scan of all those wallets and so on? So aren't you essentially scanning all transactions in the blockchain every time? – Dave Dec 31 '17 at 20:18 The fundamental building block of a bitcoin transaction is a transaction output. Transaction outputs are indivisible chunks of bitcoin currency, recorded on the blockchain and recognised as valid by the entire network. Bitcoin full nodes track all available and spendable outputs known as unspent transactions or UTXO. When a users wallet receives bitcoin it means that the wallet has detected UTXO that can be spent with one of the keys controlled by the wallet. – John Singh Jan 1 at 8:52 A users bitcoin balance is the sum of all UTXO that a users wallet can spend which may be scattered amongst hundreds of transactions and blocks. The transaction output consists of the amount in Satoshis and a cryptographic puzzle that determines the conditions required to spend the output. This puzzle is also known as a locking script. This means that all the conditions required to prove ownership are contained in the transaction script and the wallet does not have to scan the blockchain to check if the person that sent the bitcoin actually has the funds. – John Singh Jan 1 at 8:53 up vote 0 down vote\nWith a naive implementation, yes, but in practice, no, it is not a problem.\nThis is because any developer that knows what they are doing is smart enough to create a database which, at the very least, records each transaction (or its position on disk) and its verification status. So when you receive a new transaction, instead of having to walk back through history, you just need to look back to the referenced previous transaction. As part of validating a transaction, you check if the previous transaction was valid. So if a transaction is marked as valid in your database, then you can be sure that the transactions that preceded it are also valid. Thus there is no need to actually look through history and re-validate those transactions.\nSince it ultimately just comes down to a simple database lookup, it does not become harder to validate new transactions.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john singh", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "john singh jan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "– dave dec", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T02:17:15.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4f52328eecb25f8f71fb896a2df3b1919b69c1fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5uVLlyanVHNt0gPYfB9TJKKBqUpaqRdzSJ6FS7ezypDQ0vsRebPsbD2o20UiCE.UxfuztToZZDes1sooYozMN28-", "site_full": "cryptogeeks.com", "site": "cryptogeeks.com", "site_section": "http://cryptogeeks.com/news/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin: Twitch App StreamLabs Allows for Bitcoin Tipping", "title_full": "Bitcoin: Twitch App StreamLabs Allows for Bitcoin Tipping", "published": "2018-06-05T01:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4f52328eecb25f8f71fb896a2df3b1919b69c1fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5uVLlyanVHNt0gPYfB9TJKKBqUpaqRdzSJ6FS7ezypDQ0vsRebPsbD2o20UiCE.UxfuztToZZDes1sooYozMN28-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsbot", "published": "2018-06-05T01:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin: Twitch App StreamLabs Allows for Bitcoin Tipping", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T02:28:41.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d75a3fd5c8cc0dfe2bf8eca1520d72f5b8dfaeee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5uVLlyanVHNtJPlTYmBcUUCMP92hyGqMMOpls7pu.wBkA.6I6rL_5SUhe8DbU6RapvX5Xhj2UgG_jyYw7A.XQzc-", "site_full": "cryptogeeks.com", "site": "cryptogeeks.com", "site_section": "http://cryptogeeks.com/news/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin: Earn Bitcoin By Surfing Ads Lots Of Satoshis Available!", "title_full": "Bitcoin: Earn Bitcoin By Surfing Ads Lots Of Satoshis Available!", "published": "2018-06-05T01:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d75a3fd5c8cc0dfe2bf8eca1520d72f5b8dfaeee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5uVLlyanVHNtJPlTYmBcUUCMP92hyGqMMOpls7pu.wBkA.6I6rL_5SUhe8DbU6RapvX5Xhj2UgG_jyYw7A.XQzc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsbot", "published": "2018-06-05T01:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin: Earn Bitcoin By Surfing Ads Lots Of Satoshis Available!", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T02:28:50.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f1c6730388646f4f7f3e4f24d4c77e279edd1ee1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5uVLlyanVHNt4sUvpuuWZz.zKO7BWg2w32Tk4SzBPlqPRlGpqD03wz9dWUcs5srZ6E4ICth17ocdARB4kAz6_3VS1Km0WxcAyKg3oap.Ydij77NjJphrm9j2hU0t4TvLrr7IUuB5gDj7KK.Px02lRe8-", "site_full": "cryptogeeks.com", "site": "cryptogeeks.com", "site_section": "http://cryptogeeks.com/news/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin: LN Eclair wallet (open-sourced) seems simple to use.

Mid-December searches for Bitcoin were recorded at 100 out of a scale of 100. However, fast-forward six months later and Google Trends show that number at 10, a drop of 90 percent. From January, when results were pegged at 44, the decline in interest is over 75 percent.\nNotably, the results highlight that this time last year low figures for Bitcoin searches were recorded in June as well.\nAccording to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, this drop in interest is not a good sign for crypto prices, reports CNBC .\n\"We use Google Trends to track search queries for 'bitcoin' as a proxy for potential new buyers,\" he added. \"Bitcoin needs a new narrative in order to reestablish global attention.\"\nSince the beginning of the year the number one digital currency has dropped in value by over 55 percent, and is currently trading at over $7,500, according to CoinMarketCap. Interestingly, while Colas admits that the company loves the idea of the cryptocurrency, he adds that his team are not fans of purchasing it at current levels.\nOthers, however, think that now is the perfect time to invest in the market.\nDan Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capital Management, a hedge fund company focused on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, was reported at the beginning of the month as saying that Bitcoin's value may have reached a bottom, and that now is the time to buy.\nThe founder of the San Francisco-based company said on CNBC's ' Fast Money ' that 'all cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now. It's much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally as it goes.' Back in April, Morehead also said that the worst could be over for the digital currency. He said then that was a good time to purchase Bitcoin, calling it a ' screaming buy ' when it was valued around $6,600.\nIt's not just Bitcoin, though, that is feeling the brunt of disinterestedness from potential new traders. Google searches for other major cryptocurrencies have also declined. Ethereum is down by 85 percent since the beginning of the year; Ripple has dropped by 91 percent; and Bitcoin Cash has experienced a decline of 80 percent.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post Bitcoin Interest Drops 90 Percent from December, Google Trends appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nicholas colas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google trends", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "datatrek research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T01:18:04.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d50186afef3e3da1c16fd55dbe28d965720ffde8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZxnJLHHfWfOCeglkOoi89zZkBPHdNCpwyNqhtyK3nCVNgkTbR_wevFs7u1oGDgFwxuD9943oWISE9Tmst0BH3jM8jkaAziArY-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "First bitcoin jeepney hits the roads of Metro Manila", "title_full": "First bitcoin jeepney hits the roads of Metro Manila : btc", "published": "2018-06-05T01:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.997, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d50186afef3e3da1c16fd55dbe28d965720ffde8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZxnJLHHfWfOCeglkOoi89zZkBPHdNCpwyNqhtyK3nCVNgkTbR_wevFs7u1oGDgFwxuD9943oWISE9Tmst0BH3jM8jkaAziArY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Amadeus_IOM", "published": "2018-06-05T01:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "First bitcoin jeepney hits the roads of Metro Manila", "text": "submitted by /u/Amadeus_IOM\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://visor.ph/traffic/first-bitcoin-jeepney-hits-the-roads-of-metro-manila/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T20:49:21.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee1dae254f30adbd93353fe0f0225ee7f799a257", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz1_gyjPYiYbmhL49ZkYbR9w-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-05T01:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ee1dae254f30adbd93353fe0f0225ee7f799a257", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz1_gyjPYiYbmhL49ZkYbR9w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-05T01:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ June 4, 2018 NEWS Bitcoin Today: Prices Trade Close to Flat as International Headlines Take Focus TheStreet.com Bitcoin Today: Prices Trade Close to Flat as International Headlines Take Focus ...

Maybe there's a finite amount of gold in the world, but cryptocurrency is even more mathematical and regulated, and nobody can change mathematics.\"\nWozniak also called for further regulation efforts , saying they were crucial to bitcoin's survival.\n\"Regulation is an essential element to the fintech transformation happening today,\" he exclaimed. \"Fairness, equality and truth is the foundation for good regulation and that will lay the groundwork for good development.\"\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\nBitcoin Magazine ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ste", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vienna", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T01:08:31.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "64824f425522533e8d47d96af6443a2536ba8bfd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfUSwKKWtJ6wLmIWYFxRRJk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin have more risks than benefits?", "title_full": "Bitcoin have more risks than benefits?", "published": "2018-06-05T01:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.072, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "64824f425522533e8d47d96af6443a2536ba8bfd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfUSwKKWtJ6wLmIWYFxRRJk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "somtandon2015", "published": "2018-06-05T01:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin have more risks than benefits?", "text": "As per my Opinion, bitcoin has more risks than benefits are as follows.\nBitcoins trade on multiple exchanges, and exchange rates vary.\nbitcoin prices have exhibited high volatility.\nDeposited bitcoins are prone to theft by hacking.\nHigh leverage is risky for newbie traders.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T23:34:02.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "11b854fa8d7b9ac346390717f08ac5c6f47ca079", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeozCoLCokAbBhANBvNabOA-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Bitcoin - a financial pyramid: true or myth?", "title_full": "Bitcoin - a financial pyramid: true or myth?", "published": "2018-06-05T01:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "11b854fa8d7b9ac346390717f08ac5c6f47ca079", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeozCoLCokAbBhANBvNabOA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "tee-rex", "published": "2018-06-05T01:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin - a financial pyramid: true or myth?", "text": "Quote: from: timerland on June 03, 2018, 08:07:04 PM I don't get why people think that bitcoin is a ponzi scheme/pyramid scheme.\nThere is simply no central entity, and that is the exact thing that bitcoin is based on. There isn't anyone that is collecting investments. When you use bitcoin, there isn't any single person that benefits from it. That's the plain truth.\nAlso, it's important to note that bitcoin doesn't even promise any returns. Its price fluctuates due to market supply and demand. How this can be classified as a ponzi scheme is really just beyond me.\nI'd say that most people would agree nowadays that bitcoin is a legitimate currency, though it was disputed in the past.\nThe short answer is because it is. It doesn't matter if there is no central entity to gain most profits (if we don't consider Satoshi as such, of course), but that doesn't take anything from what any pyramid scheme is all about. They are all about collecting money from newbies and distributing it among old members. When you buy coins, you have to buy them from someone else, and if you want to make money, you should sell them to someone else at a profit (and in most these will be two different someones).

Required fields are marked A lot of people including non-TRX investors were looking at TRON closely during their Main Net launch.\nThe anticipation and wait had multiple media channels frequently dishing out redundant click-baity articles to feed the content to news-hungry TRX folks. The Main Net launch which was live streamed on Youtube had only 250-400 viewers during the whole time.\nDuring the launch the palpable excitement was missing and Justin’s regular updates about “Reaching the Top 5” seemed overly ambitious. TRON [TRX] at press time was trading at $0.057 to a token witnessing a 6% drop in the past 24 hours and a 10% drop in the past week.\nTRX is the only token in Top 20 to be in the negative on a weekly price point comparison. Currently at the 10th position according to the market cap which is currently at $3.8 billion, TRX’s drop by another 6-7% would mean an imminent drop to the 11th position (considering NEO experiences a positive price movement) A look at the search traffic on Google shows the gradual drop in organic searches for TRON whereas EOS who also had a Main Net event not only showed a positive response in terms of price movement but also registered double the volume of organic searches on Google.

Interestingly, while Colas admits that the company loves the idea of the cryptocurrency, he adds that his team are not fans of purchasing it at current levels.\nOthers, however, think that now is the perfect time to invest in the market.\nDan Morehead, CEO of\\u00a0Pantera Capital Management, a hedge fund company focused on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, was reported at the beginning of the month as saying that Bitcoin’s value may have reached a bottom, and that now is the time to buy.\nThe founder of the San Francisco-based company said on CNBC’s ‘ Fast Money ‘ that ‘all cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now.\\u00a0It\\u2019s much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally as it goes.’ Back in April, Morehead also said that the worst could be over for the digital currency. He said then that was a good time to purchase Bitcoin, calling it a ‘ screaming buy ‘ when it was valued around $6,600.\nIt’s not just Bitcoin, though, that is feeling the brunt of disinterestedness from potential new traders. Google searches for other major cryptocurrencies have also declined. Ethereum is down by 85 percent since the beginning of the year; Ripple has dropped by 91 percent; and Bitcoin Cash has experienced a decline of 80 percent.

In a recent interview with CNBC , the computer mogul admitted that he hopes bitcoin will become a single global currency and that he shares the sentiment of Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, who expressed his belief last March that bitcoin will become a unifying cryptocurrency for every nation within the next 10 years.\n“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says,” he explained, “not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way.”\nWozniak first bought bitcoin when it was priced at $700, roughly $6,700 less than where it currently stands. He has since sold almost his entire stash but for one coin, admitting that he never wanted to be an investor but was only intrigued by how the cryptocurrency worked.\nHe also owns two ether (the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain platform), which he has been very complimentary toward. At a recent conference in Vienna, Wozniak praised Ethereum and said it had the potential to become “the new Apple.”\n“Ethereum interests me because it can do things and because it’s a platform,” he affirmed.\nWozniak now refers to bitcoin as “pure” and says it’s the true equivalent of digital gold.\n“Bitcoin is mathematically defined,” he explained, “there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed … and it’s pure and there’s no human running it, there’s no company running it, and it’s just going and going, and growing and growing, and surviving. That, to me, says something that is natural, and nature is more important than all our human conventions.”\nThis is not the first time Wozniak has been vocally positive about bitcoin. At a Money 20/20 event in Las Vegas last October, the Apple co-founder lauded the cryptocurrency and its blockchain technology as stronger and more financially sound than both gold and USD. He stated that traditional currencies are “kind of phony,” as they are widely vulnerable to inflation, and that the problem with gold is that there is no fixed supply.\n“There is a certain amount of bitcoin that can ever exist,” he continued. “Gold gets mined and mined and mined. Maybe there’s a finite amount of gold in the world, but cryptocurrency is even more mathematical and regulated, and nobody can change mathematics.”\nWozniak also called for further regulation efforts , saying they were crucial to bitcoin’s survival.\n“Regulation is an essential element to the fintech transformation happening today,” he exclaimed. “Fairness, equality and truth is the foundation for good regulation and that will lay the groundwork for good development.”\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\nBitcoinmagazine.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/04/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-hopes-bitcoin-will-become-global-currency.html", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2018/06/04/money2020-the-woz-reminds-the-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-community-whats-important/2/#2e8bb83a4b89", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/montymunford/2018/05/18/apples-steve-wozniak-dumps-facebook-and-thinks-ethereum-could-be-the-new-apple/#63c64c1f3de5", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-global-currency-apple-steve-wozniak-cryptocurrency-a8383036.html", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/twitter-and-squares-jack-dorsey-bitcoin-will-be-worlds-single-currency/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wozniak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "become the world’s single currency steve wozniak wants bitcoin to become the world", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vienna", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T01:27:22.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a63121fc52daf72c328b886ed3abb06fe645df95", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZxnJLHHfWfOBljcj6uhXXJSvkF1A4zMTuQE6AWAXNo19iklZqAYgrgvlsazPYStLhB4Fl2MJnUIkucQl1eUM_5yjeaotkxfZU-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin -

This is no easy task, as it is an asset which is known for wild volatility and constant, unpredictable price swings. Yet it can be of great import to you to know exactly where Bitcoin stands at any given time. After all, your business’ wealth will depend upon the price of the coins, which is rarely ever static.\nThis doesn’t mean that you have to keep up with Bitcoin for every moment of every day. After all, you should be concerned with running your business in an acceptable fashion and tending to all other elements of the operation. But if you ignore it completely, you might find that you have a poor estimate about how much cash flow your business has at its disposal. It’s a good idea to find some sort of resource for tracking the Bitcoin Price USD when you need to find it out. Here are some of the reasons why Bitcoin price should be on the radar of the business owners who implement it. Tracking the Momentum\nYou always must remember that Bitcoin behaves more like stock than it does like traditional money. That’s because its value rises and falls depending upon the demand for it from investors. What that means is that your stash of Bitcoin can be worth one thing one day, and worth far less or more the next. If you must make payments with it, you’d obviously like to time it when you think the value is about to go down, although that isn’t always a possibility. On the Rise\nBitcoin is a volatile instrument, as mentioned above, which means that you must protect against the price cratering at any moment. But that also means that it can suddenly rise. You might want to heavily advertise your Bitcoin involvement to customers now when you think the price is going to spike. If you time it well, you could be looking at a kind of double payment. Protecting Yourself Either Way\nIt’s a good idea to not leave yourself wholly indebted to Bitcoin for your small business’ fortune. You should try to find ways in which you can diversify the types of payments you might receive, in much the same way you would diversify the types of investments you have in your portfolio. That will mean that your business isn’t entirely beholden to the price of Bitcoin.\nTracking Bitcoin might not seem like one of your most crucial duties, but you need to find ways of getting it done. In that way, you can utilize Bitcoin and protect yourself against its quirks all at once.

And that fear, in terms of the digital currency known as Bitcoin, is often stoked by the very people who have the most reason to want it to fail.\nHearing their laundry list of concerns and warnings might dissuade you from even considering it as a possible enterprise for your small business. But that can lead to a mistake of omission instead of one of the commission, as you might end up losing ground to competitors who understand what a great benefit can be had from it.\nThere is a certain segment of the financial guard that wants nothing to do with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies of its ilk because these technologies have the potential to truly upset the status quo. As a matter of fact, these digital coins can disrupt the way that personal finance has been conducted for years upon years, so you can understand how those who prefer it the old way might not be too thrilled with its ascendance.\nIf you don’t believe it, use it yourself, or invest in it with the help of a trading robot like Bitcoin Trader and see the difference it can make. What you’ll find is that a lot of the fears are unfounded, and the old guard isn’t telling you the whole story. What’s in It for Them\nBitcoin is so useful because it allows people and businesses to conduct transactions without any third-party interceding. That means no bank or credit card fees to encroach upon the purity of the transaction. And many of the people who are speaking up the loudest, including some who are even trying to put up roadblocks in the way of Bitcoin, are the ones who are representatives of these old-guard institutions. The Investment Side\nAgain, there are ulterior motives in place when you hear people talking about Bitcoin as a marketing scheme or an empty investment with nothing substantial behind it. The institutional investors who raise these arguments have no way now of getting their hands-on Bitcoin other than to stand in line with average people and buy it off exchanges. They don’t get first dibs like they would with initial public offerings and the like. Weeding Out the Truth\nNone of this is to say that Bitcoin is without its flaws. It is certainly still a wildly fluctuating asset, which can endanger your profits if you use it in your business as a method by which consumers can pay you. It is also something that has great competition from within the realm of cryptocurrency, as other coins are rising every day to challenge its supremacy.\nThese are legitimate concerns which you should consider as you decide on the possible inclusion of cryptocurrency . But make sure you don’t fall victim to unreasonable warnings about these coins.

Gox has been known since September of 2017 through the sale of Bitcoin and Bitcoin to Cash from the insolvency mass of Mt. Gox over $ 400 million has been taken.\nMt. Gox, the world’s largest stock exchange for Bitcoins. In February 2014, the biggest Hack was done in the crypto currency history. About 850,000 Bitcoin were stolen from the exchange, and Mt. Gox ceased its operation a short time later. The aggrieved investors and business partners look since then in the tube. From the 850.000 Bitcoin only 200,000 showed up again. The rest of the Bitcoin, however, could not be found.\nThe value of the stolen Bitcoins is the current Bitcoin exchange rate (around 10,600 USD) to over 2.1 billion US dollars. This twenty-fold of the value in comparison to the time of the bankruptcy.\nThe same number of Coins, the Hard Forks of Bitcoin with Cash and Bitcoin, Gold is also among others. In sum, thus, all the investors could be compensated in the full amount at that price. The Injured party has been awarded in the framework of a judgment on a claim for damages in the amount of the Bitcoin rate at the time of the insolvency of the exchange. Understandably, not many plaintiffs with this sum satisfied. Finally, you could have now also the twenty times the value. A rapid payout and is therefore still not possible. Mt. Gox Trustee sold first Bitcoin and Bitcoin to Cash\nToday was now known as, among other things, also Bloomberg reports that the bankruptcy Trustee of Mt. Gox, Nobuaki Kobayashi, has sold the first units of Bitcoin and Bitcoin to Cash.\nIn the official statement, he has announced that he has taken since the end of September, more than 400 million USD through the sale of Bitcoin and Bitcoin to Cash. The document argues that he has since the last creditors ‘ meeting on may 27. September 2017 about 35,000 BTC and 34,000 BCH sold. The average sales price for a Bitcoin was around 10.100 dollars.\nKobayashi stated in the opinion, to sell that the decision of the currencies in the Crypto-by the competent court was approved. He had been trying to achieve for the sale of BTC and BCH as high as possible. Kobayashi is trying to sell all the BTC and BCC to pay the more than 25,000 accepted claims of creditors.\nThe majority of the Mt. Gox Bitcoin (around 165,000 BTC), Bitcoin to Cash, Bitcoin, Gold, etc. but are still in the possession of the bankruptcy Trustee Kobayashi. When talking about the topic “Bitcoin whales”, one should not forget this.
