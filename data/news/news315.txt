Palihapitiya has come to digital currency’s defence. Despite claiming to be a Buffet ‘disciple,’ he also states that Buffet is wrong about Bitcoin.\nSpeaking in an interview with CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box,’ the former Facebook employee-turned venture capitalist espoused the virtues of Bitcoin with refreshing insight. He also stated that Warren Buffet’s ‘circle of competence’ didn’t necessarily extend to knowledge of cutting-edge technology like cryptocurrencies.\nPalihapitiya spoke in reference to Buffet and Munger’s appearance on the same CNBC segment earlier this week alongside Microsoft founder Bill Gates. During the interview himself and fellow Berkshire Hathaway executive Charlie Munger slammed Bitcoin for being a poor investment choice and a ‘scum ball activity.’ Rather than take the anti-Bitcoin stance of the two, the self-proclaimed Buffet ‘disciple’ spoke of the necessity of the digital asset in a post-financial crash world: “Something like bitcoin is really important because it is not correlated to the rest of the market.” He went on to state that he’d been an investor in cryptocurrency since 2012 and, like many other Bitcoin proponents, he saw it as a hedge against the ‘traditional financial infrastructure.’ He added that it wasn’t yet clear if this was necessarily the case but this was how he and many others viewed it.\nPalihapitiya then went on to recall the financial crash of 2008 relating this directly to Bitcoin’s importance as an asset class. He stated that ‘everything broke down’ and ‘things we thought were hedges went away.’ Chamath Palihapitiya worked at Facebook over a four year stint that culminated in 2011.\nHe held many management roles whilst working at the social network. The Sri Lankan-born venture capitalist started his career as an investor during his time at Facebook and following his departure continued to back projects offering a platform to innovative technologies.

Today's edition of Bitcoin in Brief showcases two typical cases and one atypical response.\nAlso Read: Japanese Forex Giant GMO to Launch New UK Crypto Trading App\nRansomware Hacker Trolled Aaron Lammer, a cryptocurrency podcaster, got his website hijacked by a hacker demanding ransom. But instead of paying the requested 0.025 bitcoin or calling the police, he decided to have some fun with the criminal.\nThe hacker left a 'contact us' option, which is not as unusual as it might sound because often such schemers need to help victims with the process. The link directed Lammer to the facebook profile of one Barberousse Mohammed, and so he began trolling him. After Mohammed refused to accept a million pre-sale ICO tokens instead of bitcoin, Lammer tried to lure his hacker into the whole BTC vs. BCH debate by appearing to educate him about the advantages of bitcoin cash. See the entire amusing chat transcript here .\nAnd don't worry, eventually the website was restored by the hosting service. They said the hacker used a WordPress exploit on a different domain housed under the same user to gain control.\nVertcoin Twitter Hacked Fake cryptocurrency giveaway scams continue to plague Twitter, with the latest example coming from Vertcoin. Usually the scammers create a new account that looks as close as possible to the real one and reply to all tweets with promises to send back large amounts to anyone that sends them ether. This time they actually took over the official Vertcoin account to promote the scam. Luckily, it appears that only three people actually fell for it and sent BTC to the address before the tweet was taken down.\nCoinmarketcap Adds New Features Coinmarketcap marked its five year anniversary on May 1 by unveiling a new logo and site design, and releasing an iOS mobile app. The site also added some new features and updated its API. Users can finally now add selected cryptocurrencies to a watchlist for quick and easy future reference.\nWhat other developments in the cryptoshpere caught your attention today?

Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators.\nStochastic Oscillator\nOne method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 35.7713. This is not an overbought or oversold reading. The last signal was a sell 1 period(s) ago.\nRelative Strength Index (RSI)\nThe RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 57.70. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 27 period(s) ago.\nCommodity Channel Index (CCI)\nThe CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is 48. This is not a topping or bottoming area. The last signal was a sell 2 period(s) ago.\nMACD\nThe Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a buy 20 period(s) ago.\nRex Takasugi – TD Profile\nNYSE BitcoinIndx closed up 136.621 at 9,289.078.

Bitcoin Beats Gold\nIn the battle between Bitcoin and gold, the former certainly comes out the winner in a variety of categories.\nAs noted by Forbes , gold doesn’t function well as currency, is insecure, experiences price volatility not too far removed from digital assets, and cannot easily be digitized. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is steadily moving towards mainstream adoption as a viable currency, is highly secure, and allows for cross-border transfers of value in a matter of hours at most. Furthermore, mining real gold uses a tremendous amount of energy and has an environmental impact vastly more significant than Bitcoin mining .\nHowever, there’s one category in which Bitcoin trounces gold that has largely gone overlooked — it’s become the dominant form of flight capital. What Is Flight Capital?\nFlight capital, generally speaking, is money transferred abroad to either avoid taxes and/or inflation or provide for possible emigration — particularly in times of war.\nTo put it simply, if the brown stuff hits the fan and you’ve got to pack up and move, it’s a lot easier to take your Bitcoin with you than it is to lug around a bag of gold. As noted by Clem Chambers, CEO of ADVFN.com and author of Be Rich, The Game in Wall Street and Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner’s Guide :\nWhen Little Rocket Man was wrestling Big Rocket Man, gold didn’t react, but Bitcoin went off the dial every night. You can’t head for the airport with gold bars these days, and opening a foreign bank account is a thankless task that can take months or never get done. A normal person sweating a war isn’t a billionaire with a private office, but in the old days they might have stashed a few thousand or even hundreds of thousands in gold if they thought the balloon was going up.\nToday you’d stash it in Bitcoin and be safe in the knowledge that you could fly away on holiday somewhere safe for a few months and your stash would be as safe as the place your hid you private keys.\nOf course, nobody wants a war — but should one happen, cryptocurrency investors and early adopters will be the ones set to remain most secure in their wealth. Concludes Chambers:\nNow Etherium, Bitcoin, Ripple, Litecoin and a myriad of crypto will get the attention that gold once enjoyed.\nIts bad news for grumpy old men but good news for crypto-believers and a new trading opportunity for us.\nWhat do you think about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as the new form of flight capital? Do you think conflict and war only increase the demand for digital currencies and assets?

Good news for American bitcoin companies, someone who wants much lighter Bitlicense regulations is in the running to be the next New York attorney general. And in China, a bitcoin mining hardware producer is planning a $1 billion IPO. Technical picture on Bitcoin looks bearish. Trading recommendations: According to the H1 time-frame, I found potential end of bullish correction (rising wedge) in the backgorund, which is a sign that buying looks risky. My advice is to watch for potential selling opportunities if you see a valid breakout of rising wedge.

Bitcoin prices traded higher on Thursday after three days of losses.\nBitcoin was trading at $9,318.9 by 11:43AM ET (03:43 GMT) on the Bitfinex exchange, up 1.9% over the previous 24 hours.\nEthereum, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was up 2.8% at $754.10 on the Bitfinex exchange.\nRipple’s XRP token was 1.8% lower at $0.79176 on the Poloniex exchange.\nMeanwhile, Litecoin slipped 0.2% to $159.04.\nThe cryptocurrency markets were under pressured since the beginning of the week after Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett called Bitcoin “rat poison” and that the “asset itself is creating nothing”.\nCo-founder of Microsoft Bill Gates echoed Buffet’s comment and said he would bet against Bitcoin if he could.\nReports that Nasdaq chief executive Adena Friedman is bullish on cryptocurrency received some attention on Thursday.\nIn an interview with CNN, Friedman said that cryptocurrency feels like the “right next step in the space of currency” because a “globalized payment mechanism is a natural fit for the cross-border digital economy.”\n“How it evolves and which of the cryptocurrencies may or may not be the one that ultimately gets embraced, I think that really the jury is still out on that. But I do think the idea of a more globalized payment mechanism that is more efficient than what we have today allows for money to transfer across countries and certainly supports the Internet economy.”\nFriedman then noted that she believes blockchain technology will first take place gradually in markets with less regulation or high levels of inefficiency before being adopted in the global financial system.\n“The first uses of the blockchain will be in the less regulated markets, less efficient markets, more bespoke markets. Test it out, show that it works, demonstrate the efficiency in the Nasdaq private market or in the fund industry,” Friedman said. “It takes a village to make it work, but people are going to be highly motivated if we show that the use cases bring a lot of efficiency.” Related Articles\nUS: West Virginia Completes First Blockchain-Supported State Elections\nSurvey: 30% Of Financial Executives To Commit Resources To Blockchain\nNew Report On Crypto Ownership Shows ‘Majority Of Early Adopters Already On Board’", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/us-west-virginia-completes-first-blockchainsupported-state-elections-1440167?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=yahoo_finance", "https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/survey-30-of-financial-executives-to-commit-resources-to-blockchain-1440085?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=yahoo_finance", "https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/us-west-virginia-completes-first-blockchainsupported-state-elections-1440167?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=yahoo_finance&quot;", "https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/survey-30-of-financial-executives-to-commit-resources-to-blockchain-1440085?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=yahoo_finance&quot;", "https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/new-report-on-crypto-ownership-shows-majority-of-early-adopters-already-on-board-1439958?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=yahoo_finance&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NNcMXkm1niKviDuoxjAnlA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjUwO2g9NDEw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/investing_com_631/3af3b562b415837132338febf1fac025", "https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/new-report-on-crypto-ownership-shows-majority-of-early-adopters-already-on-board-1439958?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=yahoo_finance"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "buffet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adena friedman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill gates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "friedman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nasdaq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T15:18:46.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "12e2c53b450319510d4858355d9e0f4ae8f24f47", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8MhJEbIk6Hp4_GAaXVPzclJpH9XhzO13h_bNByQF1qUjPEZcpEWuv6Hat9TspItkaRVQPzCcSk2BiueKGggEUZ3umdDRGfzX0MqxpbVWiqJFDWAPq7SeL2M2wjWOIQt6A-", "site_full": "www.dnaindia.com", "site": "dnaindia.com", "site_section": "http://www.dnaindia.com/syndication/rss,catID-4.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Daily News & Analysis", "title": "Bitcoin case: Hunt for Kotadiya and Jatin Patel on", "title_full": "Bitcoin case: Hunt for Kotadiya and Jatin Patel on", "published": "2018-05-10T14:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/half/public/2018/05/10/680771-bitcoin-thinkstock-012418.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1715, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "12e2c53b450319510d4858355d9e0f4ae8f24f47", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8MhJEbIk6Hp4_GAaXVPzclJpH9XhzO13h_bNByQF1qUjPEZcpEWuv6Hat9TspItkaRVQPzCcSk2BiueKGggEUZ3umdDRGfzX0MqxpbVWiqJFDWAPq7SeL2M2wjWOIQt6A-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "dnaindia.com", "published": "2018-05-10T14:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin case: Hunt for Kotadiya and Jatin Patel on", "text": "In the investigation of the bitcoin extortion and kidnapping case, six accused have been nabbed till now and around Rs 7.4 crore has been recovered by the CID.

On Friday, Paladiya, who is the mastermind, was nabbed by CID.\nPaladiya refused to cooperate with the officers during the investigation, the officials said. He had refused to share his binance wallet password with the officials, who suspected that extorted bitcoins of Shailesh Bhatt were in it.\nWhen the officials didn't get any help from Paladiya, they reached out a third party cyber expert. With the help of the cyber expert, they were able to crack the password of Paladiya's wallet and recovered around 119 bitcoins worth Rs 7.20 crore. As per the investigation, Paladiya should have 142 bitcoins with him, but only 119 were recovered.\nDipankar Trivedi, DIG of CID (crime), said: \"We have begun investigation to recover the 23 missing bitcoins. We are yet to receive any information on the same. We will have to find out if he has transferred or sold the bitcoins to somebody.\"\nIt was also revealed during the investigation that Kirit had three different cryptocurrency wallets on his name. The wallets were identified as Dawanda, Blockchain and Binance. Out of which, two of them were empty, while the 119 bitcoins were in the Binance wallet.\nKirit Paladiya had converted the bitcoins to 60 different cryptocurrencies During investigation, officials found that Kirit didn't have Bitcoins anymore. He had converted his bitcoins to 60 different cryptocurrencies, which were worth the value of 119 bitcoins. He used the Binance wallet as it was one of those wallets through which different cryptocurrencies could be bought through a single medium. Bitcoin is the parent currency in the entire cryptocurrencies universe, if a buyer or investor wants to buy any other cryptocurrency like Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), Zcash (ZEC), Dash, Ripple (XRP), Monero, etc., he should have bitcoins, otherwise it is not possible.\nTHE CON NET As per officials, 176 bitcoins were extorted from Bhatt’s bitcoin wallet. Paladiya had made a deal with Amreli SP Jagdish Patel, Inspector of LCB Anant Patel, other policemen, lawyer Ketan Patel, Ketan’s brother Jatin Patel and Nalin Kotadiya. The conspirators were promised a percentage of the bitcoins money worth around Rs 9.45 crore — 15 % for Nalin Kotadiya, the lawyer and his brother and 15% for the police.\nBinance Wallet Binance has a wallet to store all listed cryptocurrencies. It is a popular Chinese cryptocurrency exchange, which is known for its crypto to crypto exchange services. Through this you can exchange trading fees/limits, security aspects, and customer support, etc, all under one roof.\nPatel moves court Naresh Patel, whose vehicle was allegedly used to kidnap 2 people in the Bitcoin case, has moved a petition in the Sessions Court seeking return of his assets.\nAllegations Nalin Kotadiya claimed that Shailesh Bhatt and two of his associates kidnapped two investors identified as Piyush Savaliya and Dhaval Malvani, members of an investment firm and extorted 2300 cryptocurrencies from their wallet on February 1. This is how Bhatt got the bitcoins in his wallet. As per official sources, Malvani is believed to have held large quantities of cryptocurrencies. Bhatt and his associates pretended to be income tax officers to extort the currencies from him and Savaliya.\nCID officials working on 1st phase now As per official sources, the 176 bitcoin extortion and kidnapping case is just the first phase of the case, there are two more levels, which will unravel in the course of the investigation. To ascertain the source of bitcoin, the allegation of 2300 bitcoin scam and other several aspects of the case will be investigated. Right now, however, they are working on solving the extortion of 176 bitcoin case. Later, they will look into how Shailesh Bhatt got the cryptocurrencies.\nCID Bitcoins Jagdish Patel Shailesh Bhatt Dipankar Trivedi Anant Patel Jatin Patel Kirit Paladiya binance wallet", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kirit paladiya", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "paladiya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shailesh bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dipankar trivedi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kirit paladiya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paladiya", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T04:23:19.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "38ef177a27273a9ce65e43416b55a2c9e278ab08", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS5v5l0cBLDsOMvoFeJ6i8Q0MrClNtKO.C4x2q4SytQng0I8JruoLNbkYIew8LxLwW3kiFCnILoiqUlBy_nUzW1tJO0F3HTAE3ttlQzSuv3GENaIPKwWJw00TQ0Xw4wLc4-", "site_full": "freedomdreamer-freedomdreamer.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://freedomdreamer-freedomdreamer.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "FreedomDreamer", "title": "Chemtrails|CERN|Bitcoin|A.I|5G|Internet| The are all connected!", "title_full": "Chemtrails|CERN|Bitcoin|A.I|5G|Internet| The are all connected!", "published": "2018-05-10T14:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "38ef177a27273a9ce65e43416b55a2c9e278ab08", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS5v5l0cBLDsOMvoFeJ6i8Q0MrClNtKO.C4x2q4SytQng0I8JruoLNbkYIew8LxLwW3kiFCnILoiqUlBy_nUzW1tJO0F3HTAE3ttlQzSuv3GENaIPKwWJw00TQ0Xw4wLc4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FreedomDreamer (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-10T14:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Chemtrails|CERN|Bitcoin|A.I|5G|Internet| The are all connected!", "text": "", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cern", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T14:34:22.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "641897a7a651660e24fec48ff6078aa553b61ab5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSbFuHbjzQIQKX4ROzdzhj4UcgQxuEcP6WD7D2QaWtAyuZtJNuO81jtxsXPSQ4LZrLQ--", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Is Bitcoin Money? - My Dissertation", "title_full": "Is Bitcoin Money? - My Dissertation", "published": "2018-05-10T14:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "641897a7a651660e24fec48ff6078aa553b61ab5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSbFuHbjzQIQKX4ROzdzhj4UcgQxuEcP6WD7D2QaWtAyuZtJNuO81jtxsXPSQ4LZrLQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-10T14:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is Bitcoin Money? - My Dissertation", "text": "Is Bitcoin Money? - My Dissertation\n/u/TonyBrod123\nI have just finished my dissertation on Bitcoin and would like to get some feedback from other Bitcoin Believers or even skeptics.

mainstream media that he has become inspired to \"use Bitcoin,\" suggesting dollar bills are too \"reminiscent\" of slavery.\nWest: US Dollar 'Like Slave Movies' Speaking in an interview for TMZ May 1, West hit out at the past four hundred years of US history with regard to slavery, calling the period a \"choice.\"\nDuring the episode, which sources now describe as \"confrontational,\" the star directly mentioned Bitcoin, saying the image of political activist Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill had made him \"want to use it,\" likely due to the apolitical and neutral attributes of the world's first and most popular cryptocurrency.\n\"When I saw Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill, that's when I wanted to use bitcoin,\" he said.\nIt's like all the slave movies. Why you gotta keep reminding us about slavery? Why don't you put Michael Jordan on the $20 bill?\nWest has courted controversy in recent weeks following repeated endorsements of president Donald Trump on social media. After his piece on slavery, TMZ host Van Lathan retaliated , telling West he \"actually didn't think he was thinking anything.\"\nMeanwhile, some in the space have predicted Kanye would soon address Bitcoin or cryptocurrency directly when the rapper tweeted the following on April 25th, alluding to him getting involved in the venture capital industry.\ndecentralize\n— KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) April 25, 2018\nGhost Of CoinYe Lingers In The Shadows In terms of cryptocurrency, the rapper's journey has indeed lasted several years, but has not always appeared wholly liberal in character.\nIn 2014, West won a lawsuit against the creators of spoof altcoin Coinye, forcing them to \"disperse\" their operations. Most of the parties named in the lawsuit did not respond to the initial summons, thereby losing the case by default.\nNonetheless, Coinye returned to popular culture over the weekend, investor Alan Silbert providing a tongue-in-cheek response to a new tweet by West which consisted of only one word: \"decentralize.\"\nOnline commentator Mr.Hodl added an image of Coinye's logo, which featured West's face and was the premise for the original lawsuit.\nKanyeCoin rebirth incoming\n— Alan Silbert (@alansilbert) April 25, 2018\npic.twitter.com/mOPP0mrPP6\n— Mr.Hodl (@MrHodl) April 25, 2018\nWest has so far kept silent on the meaning of tweet, and has not addressed the responses mentioning Bitcoin or cryptocurrency.\nWhat do you think about Kanye West's comments on Bitcoin?

When called out as scammers, those managing Electrum Pro responded on Reddit by saying their website is a fork of the Electrum project. They went on to state that their work aims to help “improve the user experience.” The creators of Electrum Pro are using Google Ads to promote “electrum dot com,” as shown in Google’s search results for “electrum.” (Source: Imgur)\nElectrum’s developers have long suspected that these copycats were up to no good, but they had no “formal evidence” of any wrongdoing, so all they could do was warn users to be careful.\nThat changed when they decided to do a public security audit of one of Electrum Pro’s Windows binaries.\nThe developers downloaded the binary from Electrum Pro’s website, uncompressed the zip, unpacked the binary, decompiled it and had a look at the output. Something immediately stood out for them. As they wrote on GitHub:\nIn this binary, a few extra lines have been added by the scammers: A thread is started that sends an HTTP POST request to their website, and its payload is the user’s seed . This demonstrates that “Electrum Pro” is bitcoin-stealing malware.\nFor their analysis, Electrum’s developers looked at just one of Electrum Pro’s Windows binaries. They confirmed that the .dmg file for Mac users contains the same modifications as the file they examined and believes the other binaries available for PC could be dangerous. As for the Linux packages, they found them to be relatively harmless “presumably because the scammers did not want to have these changes in plain sight.”\nElectrum’s developers concluded by recommending that users download their software only from official sources and check the GPG signatures.\nNews of this discovery follows several months after a cybercrime gang based in Ukraine made as much as $50 million after tricking Bitcoin investors into handing over the login credentials for their online wallets.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.addthis.com/help/api-spec", "https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum-docs/blob/master/decompiling_guide.md", "https://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "https://archive.fo/Yuvjn"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "imgur", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "electrum pro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "electrum", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T00:45:18.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "23ed1ad1aeee15dbdee41459ce3784903a519098", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZHWav1axiczB05VmoaEVRs-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "What makes Bitcoin valuable?", "title_full": "What makes Bitcoin valuable?", "published": "2018-05-10T14:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "23ed1ad1aeee15dbdee41459ce3784903a519098", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZHWav1axiczB05VmoaEVRs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Boknoyz", "published": "2018-05-10T14:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "What makes Bitcoin valuable?", "text": "Bitcoin is the first successful application of block chain technology.

In particular, the Altcoins Zilliqa, 0x and Vechain seen large price gains. Within the Top 10 Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash can be recorded, with the largest increases.\nLooking first at the overall market capitalization, then that falls on the week’s best value of 472 billion US-dollars but still a whole piece. Currently the crypto-currency market may have a capitalisation of around 436 billion USD and is thus roughly at the level of exactly seven days.

The largest stock exchange in the world, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is planning a suitable trading platform to enable investors to buy Bitcoin directly. The development of the platform is already well advanced. Already a few days and weeks previously, the American investment Bank Goldman Sachs and is the second-largest U.S. stock exchange NASDAQ, announced to enter the Bitcoin market.\nIn addition, Lee said that Bitcoin could rise as a result of the upcoming consensus conference. Compared with Marketwatch, he said (freely translated):\nThe participation to this year, is already one of the largest crypto conferences in the world. The participation is dramatic and comes at a time in the Bitcoin / crypto at a low level. Therefore, we expect that the Consensus-rally will be even greater than in years past.\nOutside the Top 10, in particular, Zilliqa, 0x and Vechain were able to win with (nearly) double digit rates stand out.

The mural painter known by the moniker ‘PBOY’ is incorporating bitcoin QR codes in his artworks. This allows him to receive donations from the public in crypto. Bitcoin Meets Art\nThe term “struggling artist” is an age-long trope. Not every artist is fortunate enough to have a wealthy patron financing their talents. Even with crowdfunded platforms like Ulule and Patreon, it is still difficult for many artists to eke out a living. For Boyart, the solution to the problem has been Bitcoin, the world’s most famous cryptocurrency.\nThe French street artist recently rose to prominence when one of his murals became a trending topic on the Bitcoin subreddit . Many Redditors were impressed not just with his talent but with the melding of art and bitcoin.\nApart from adding bitcoin QR codes to his paintings, Boyart also explores themes related to cryptos and decentralization in his work. The artwork that made Boyart popular on Reddit was a mural painting of Rembrandt, the famous Dutch painter.\nDespite his incredible talent, Rembrandt had severe financial troubles during his lifetime. He even had to sell his house due to mounting debt. There is an anachronistic component to the mural, Rembrandt lived in the 17th century but is depicted reading a newspaper.\nWhile this is the piece that shot Boyart to prominence, the artist says he has incorporated crypto themes in previous works. According to PBOY:\nI first included a Bitcoin QR code in my work in November 2017. I painted a street art piece of a child asking his father ‘Dad, what is money?’ And I placed a QR code at the side of my signature. I wasn’t sure if someone had done this already, but I wanted to see if people could support street artists with donations. I did it as an homage to Andreas Antonopoulos’ book The Internet of Money.\nSo far, Boyart has received more about 0.11 bitcoin (approximately $1,000) in donations. The artist describes himself as a crypto enthusiast saying that the creative industry has a lot to benefit from decentralization. According to Boyart, artists can take advantage of the new economic paradigm made possible by Bitcoin technology.\nWhat do you think about Boyart’s art pieces? Should other artists incorporate crypto QR codes in their work?

And in China, a bitcoin mining hardware producer is planning a $1 billion IPO. These stories and much more in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief.\nAlso Read: Stripper Explains Bitcoin to Adult Industry, Facebook Explores Blockchain Bitcoin Supporter for NY AG\nA bitcoin supporter wants to replace New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who recently resigned after four women complained about non-consensual physical violence by him. Manny Alicandro has announced his candidacy on the Republican ticket. He is a stock market lawyer, former stand-up comedian, and a bitcoin enthusiast as the Wall Street Journal reports.\nAlicandro expects his campaign to highlight the current harsh regulation of bitcoin. He said he’d like to see lighter rules for cryptocurrency businesses, arguing that the Bitlicense is hurting jobs and stifling innovation. He serves as an adviser to several blockchain startups and is a small investor in bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies himself. The report adds that the AG candidate is currently checking if it is permissible for his campaign to accept donations in bitcoin . Canaan Seeks $1 Billion IPO in Hong Kong\nCanaan Creative Co. Ltd, the Chinese company behind the Avalon lineup of hardware equipment which produces ASIC mining chips and rigs, is now reportedly planning to launch an IPO in Kong Kong and raise up to a billion USD. As we previously reported , the company was also eyeing the US for a possible IPO market but has now ditched that option according to people familiar with the matter cited by the South China Morning Post . Warren Buffett Produces Bitcoin Mining Hardware?\nWarren Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has recently attacked bitcoin by saying among other things that the cryptocurrency is “probably rat poison squared.” Therefore he would probably be very surprised to find out that he is involved with it in some way. According to reports from Canada, Climate Solutions TMI, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, has begun producing “portable cryptocurrency mines” for Montreal-headquartered data-centers firm Kelvin Emtech .\nThese “portable mines” are containers with specialized ventilation systems needed to keep 1,200 rigs cool inside a metal box. They are said to be deployable anywhere in the world in two days, each consumes 2 MW of electricity, and can generate around $1 million in cryptocurrency revenue each month. “We wanted it to be easily transported by truck, boat or train. The goal is not to move them all the time, but rather to eliminate the problem of access to electricity. We want to bring these cryptocurrency mines as close as possible to the hydroelectric plants and the remote areas where Hydro-Québec has excess electricity to sell,” explained Fooad Nejad of Kelvin Emtech. “We get to recover between 80 and 97% of the heat produced. Containers could be placed near marijuana greenhouses or community centers, for example, and provided free of charge to partners. It’s like saying, ‘I’m scratching your back, you’re scratching my back’,” he added. The company also believes that this order will create about 200 jobs in the area. Amana Capital Adds Cryptocurrency CFDs\nAmana Capital, a Middle Eastern financial services group, is the latest online trading brokerage to add cryptocurrency-based contracts for difference (CFDs). The company explains it took the move due to “the increased demand for cryptocurrencies.” As a first phase, Amana will offer its clients the option to trade BTC, ETH, LTC, and XRP on its MetaTrader 5 platform, with additional cryptocurrencies promised to be added in the future.\nAhmad Khatib, CEO of Amana Capital, said: “Making cryptocurrencies available for CFDs traders across the world, falls in line with our strategic mission to further diversify our financial offerings and services, according to the latest financial innovations. Hence, we believe that entering the cryptocurrency market is a strategic move that propels our efforts on that end.” Blox Releases “Quickbooks for Crypto”\nBlox.io, a Tel Aviv-based startup formerly known as Coindash, has announced it launched Blox Business – an enterprise solution for managing, tracking and reporting crypto assets. The new platform is already being used by several ventures such as eToro, Wings, CIVIC, Coinsilium, Aeternity, Chainlinker capital, Startup Token and others. It features integrations with multiple exchanges and wallet accounts so that companies will be able to have a single dashboard with all their cryptocurrency holdings in one place. This solution is meant to help executives manage their books and finances by keeping an eye on stuff like cash flows, payments and salaries. Dash CEO Hacked\nHackers continue to target victims in the cryptocurrency space, and the latest one revealed to be hit is CEO of Dash Core, Ryan Taylor. According to an announcement by the group, his Twitter account, LinkedIn account, and personal cell phone SIM card have all been compromised. After a few hours of it posting nonsense, Taylor has now regained control of his Twitter account. Last week we reported that hackers had taken over the official Vertcoin Twitter account. Bitcoin on the Late Show\nWith the cryptocurrency now routinely featuring in hit shows like HBO’s Silicon Valley , its not that exciting to see bitcoin on TV but it’s still a good opportunity to reach a wider audience. The Late Show with Stephen Colbert recently hosted Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian who spoke about the promise of bitcoin for protecting wealth from government misuse.

If it continues its poor form, it could fall below $7,000 in the coming days. The volatile cryptocurrency’s price has shifted wildly ever since mid-December - when it hit a record high of more than $19,850 (£14,214) - with frequent heavy drops and speedy recoveries. Its price plummet back to earth in January and February, as governments and central banks around the world raised the spectre of future regulation. Bitcoin’s value plummeted again shortly before Christmas, dropping by almost $2,000 (£1,449) in just an hour at one point, and almost slipping below the $11,000 mark (£7,970). It then bounced back, before tumbling again in mid-January, recovering again, and plummeting at the start of February before levelling out for the rest of the month. March saw bitcoin's price drop below $10,000, reaching a low of $6,500 before rebounding above $7,000. Aside from the looming prospect of regulation, a series of high-profile thefts have also had a hand in the sudden rapid dips in value bitcoin and its rivals have experienced - the most recent of which was a failed raid on the Binance cryptocurrency exchange . Google's announcement that it would ban cryptocurrency advertising from its pages from June on the grounds that it considers it \"deceptive content\" was also a major blow to the sector. Recent goings-on have demonstrated just how quickly things can change for investors. It is worth $7,699 as of Thursday morning, up from around $6,500 in early April, according to the Coinbase exchange. Its value is up by 1 per cent per cent since this time yesterday and up by about 2 per cent week-on-week. Bitcoin's value is down by around 17 per cent from what it was one month ago. Bitcoin's rise last year meanwhile led to increasing amounts of interest in other digital currencies, such as ethereum, litecoin and ripple XRP - all of which have performed well recently - and more and more people are now looking to invest in digital currencies.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-latest-rival-cryptocurrencies-growth-ethereum-litecoin-ripple-market-capitalisation-price-a8243551.html", "https://www.coinbase.com/charts?locale=en", "http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/litecoin-ethereum-bitcoin-price-latest-update-rise-alternative-value-cryptocurrency-digital-currency-a8107191.html", "https://www.tumblr.com/widgets/share/tool?posttype=photo&content=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fuu%2Fapi%2Fres%2F1.2%2FdL2hs50TIoP1ZI3opAedPw--~B%2FaD0xNTM2O3c9MjA0ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fmedia.zenfs.com%2Fen-GB%2Fhomerun%2Fthe_independent_577%2F226c37a5989e5e32bac3fa770fa97e77&url=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.news.yahoo.com%2Fbitcoin-price-latest-updates-cryptocurrency-103328235.html%3Fsoc_src%3Dsocial-sh%26soc_trk%3Dtu&clickthroughUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.news.yahoo.com%2Fbitcoin-price-latest-updates-cry", "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/bitcoin-latest-value-ripple-xrp-best-performing-cryptocurrency-38-fold-increase-2017-a8138546.html&quot;", "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/bitcoin-latest-value-ripple-xrp-best-performing-cryptocurrency-38-fold-increase-2017-a8138546.html", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/binance-cryptocurrency-exchange-hack-thwarted-viacoin-bitcoin-cybercrime-fraud-a8246961.html", "https://www.coinbase.com/charts?locale=en&quot;", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/binance-cryptocurrency-exchange-hack-thwarted-viacoin-bitcoin-cybercrime-fraud-a8246961.html&quot;", "http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/litecoin-ethereum-bitcoin-price-latest-update-rise-alternative-value-cryptocurrency-digital-currency-a8107191.html&quot;", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-price-latest-google-cryptocurrency-advertising-ban-initial-coin-offerings-exchanges-a8255346.html", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-price-latest-google-cryptocurrency-advertising-ban-initial-coin-offerings-exchanges-a8255346.html&quot;", "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-latest-rival-cryptocurrencies-growth-ethereum-litecoin-ripple-market-capitalisation-price-a8243551.html&quot;", "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/bitcoin-price-live-updates-drop-value-latest-news-exchange-coinbase-digital-currency-cryptocurrency-a8119801.html", "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/bitcoin-price-live-updates-drop-value-latest-news-exchange-coinbase-digital-currency-cryptocurrency-a8119801.html&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anthony cuthber", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "andrew griffin", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T14:24:40.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "403b1ce65041c5de9468dab7233390b54136abf7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBYM.OJ3Ir8Ykqdv382NXL_.MKg7S15mz6cBNUWIDBtmBkaWAEV_s.UJygK6pr913MQdsHLsadHvuM__GLaezJWarwNvZTjBe.AcuvcPzD.tBA--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin -

But then it began tumbling, and the Federal Reserve of San Fransico has a reason to offer behind the fall. By: Pragya Srivastava | Updated: May 10, 2018 10:44 AM Between October and December, every day was a new day for Bitcoin.\nBetween October and December, every day was a new day for Bitcoin. Each day it surged to a new lifetime high and became one the most sensational things that got the world talking — some for tapping its potential; some to discredit it. But a day came when it fell from its life-time high of $19,000 in mid-December, and continued tumbling for next five months, easing over 50% of its gains. The biggest reason for Bitcoin’s fall could be Bitcoin itself — Bitcoin Futures.\nYes, behind the fall of Bitcoin could be Bitcoin Futures, a report by Federal Reserve of San Fransico has said. “The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence,” the report ‘How Futures Trading Changed Bitcoin Prices’ said.\n“The advent of blockchain introduced a new financial instrument, bitcoin, which optimistic investors bid up, until the launch of bitcoin futures allowed pessimists to enter the market, which contributed to the reversal of the bitcoin price dynamics,” the report added.\nFounded by an unknown person or a group of persons Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, Bitcoin remained within $4000 until mid-2017, when it increased exponentially for about 10 months. “This explosive growth ended on December 17, 2017, when bitcoin reached its peak price of $19,511. Notably, these dynamics aren’t driven by overall market fluctuations,” the report said.\nWith the introduction of bitcoin futures, pessimists could bet on a bitcoin price decline, buying and selling contracts with a lower delivery price in the future than the spot price, which may have led to the fall in Bitcoin price. This was consistent with the rise and collapse of the home financing market in the 2000s, which also allowed pessimistic investors to bet against it later.\nGet live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds , calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator , know market’s Top Gainers , Top Losers & Best Equity Funds .

It seems that U.S. regulators do have a plan and are using the “sandbox” approach to see how the tech and innovation plays out.\nAlso, she states, “Then there are utility tokens that are designed to function much differently, at least at some point in their lifecycle. These tokens may function as a means of executing a transaction, as a way to get access to a product or service or participate in a community, or in any number of ways that have yet to be dreamed up.”\n”And then there are tokens or coins used in initial coin offerings, or ICOs. These look the most like securities. Their creator sells them as a means of raising funds. In one potential example, the issuer may want to build an environment in which the coins can be used—potentially as a medium of exchange, potentially as a means of executing or tracking exchanges—and sells the coins before the environment is built.”\nIt appears that the SEC and other regulators are taking a wait and see approach but are constantly developing and updating their guidelines as progress is made by the various Fintech companies.\nBased upon her views, it would appear that this is the best evidence XRP will not be considered a security.\nSorry for the Bitcoin article title but feel this is very important info to share!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-peirce-050218"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T06:21:49.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9003b0d31e0bef5a75f5606c0a4842c09280568e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRaIUXgw3HU4o6Ee8jwwhBQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=197.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Service Announcements (Altcoins)", "title": "margin - Bitcoin Trading Bot: Binance, Bittrex, HitBTC, Poloniex, Bitfinex...", "title_full": "margin - Bitcoin Trading Bot: Binance, Bittrex, HitBTC, Poloniex, Bitfinex...", "published": "2018-05-10T13:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9003b0d31e0bef5a75f5606c0a4842c09280568e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRaIUXgw3HU4o6Ee8jwwhBQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "anuuva", "published": "2018-05-10T13:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "margin - Bitcoin Trading Bot: Binance, Bittrex, HitBTC, Poloniex, Bitfinex...", "text": "Quote: from: dbolivar on May 09, 2018, 04:33:25 PM\nThe app is stable for me on Linux, no crashes and constant memory usage, although I'm not heavily using bots at this time.

But while galleries and art dealers have mostly replaced this ancient system, a new breed of crowdfunded services like Patreon and Ulule are now lending even more fiscal independence to cash-strapped artists.\nDespite this liberating disruption in the artist-patron dynamic, such services pose the same risk to the financial security of creatives as the old patronage system, the revised art dealership model capitalism brought, and the crowdsourced funding alternative facilitated by the recent technological boom. Namely, that the artists are in a chronic threat of having their streams of income severed – at the drop of a hat.\nBut thanks to blockchain tech and cryptocurrencies, creatives might have a new viable option to make ends meet without leaving their fiscal stability in the hands of profit-oriented dealers and corporations. Meet French street artist Pascal ‘PBOY’ Boyart .\nBoyart recently attracted the attention of the cryptocurrency community after one of his pieces made its way to the top of the Bitcoin discussion board on Reddit .\nIndeed, numerous Redditors flocked to salute him for his witty use of QR codes as a way of funding his work with Bitcoin donations from inspired passers-by.\nInfluenced by the the vision of Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin, Boyart has made cryptocurrencies and decentralization a central theme in his work. In his paintings, Bitcoin becomes not only an integral part of the piece itself, but also the very method by which Boyart can profit from his creation.\nThe QR codes are both his statement against the dangers of central censorship and his weapon of liberation.\nIn this sense, his artistic fascination with the technology is two-fold: it explores how cryptocurrencies are gradually challenging the status quo of central authorities and simultaneously puts this playful exploration to the test.\nThis, precisely, is the conundrum Boyart addresses in his mural of esteemed Dutch painter Rembrandt (whose life was marked by severe financial hardships despite his undeniable talent).\nBut while it was the Rembrandt piece that brought the recognition of Reddit to Boyart, it wasn’t the first time the artist had experimented with incorporating Bitcoin donation addresses in his work.\n“I first included a Bitcoin QR code in my work in November 2017,” Boyart told Hard Fork. “I painted a street art piece of a child asking his father ‘Dad, what is money?’ and I placed a QR code at the side of my signature.”\n“I wasn’t sure if someone had done this already, but I wanted to see if people could support street artists with donations,” the artists added. “I did it as an homage to Andreas Antonopoulos’ book The Internet of Money .”\nSince then, Boyart has received over $1,000 (approximately 0.11 BTC) in donations so far, according to stats from the Bitcoin blockchain explorer. Boyart first got acquainted with Bitcoin in early 2014, but it took him four years to grasp the promise the technology behind it.\n“I didn’t understand it,” the artist told Hard Fork. “I thought it was a new PayPal.”\n“It was last May when I became really passionate about this new paradigm of money… I was thinking about all the best use cases artists can do with it,” Boyart continued. “It can free us from institutions and galleries.”\n“The most interesting aspect is decentralization – a peer-to-peer horizontal system,” he added. “Art and creation need that, I believe.”\n“My street art costs me a lot of money in materials and painting,” Boyart said. “But instead of funding alternatives like [crowdfunding platform] Ulule, I wanted a solution that offers direct financial relation with the people.”\n“Bitcoin is perfect for this,” he added.\nAnyone keen on supporting Boyart and his art can find his donation address at his personal website here : in addition to Bitcoin, he also welcomes donations in Litecoin and Ethereum.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.pboy-art.com/", "https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8g1vwh/street_art_piece_in_paris_with_a_qr_code_for/?st=JGVGLK75&sh=6875a717", "https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9kqye3/patreon-porn-adult-content-guidelines-open-letter", "https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2017/11/01/ultimate-3500-word-plain-english-guide-blockchain/", "https://blockchain.info/address/1KKFT9Q9BWWMFtrDnfKuaDp32CZQ9Jd7Fg", "https://www.pboy-art.com/biographie", "https://thenextweb.com/topic/bitcoin/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "boyart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patreon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pascal", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T00:14:44.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4afbb50e0dbe06e8e082a4b647952d65c226165a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY_2aKksgzptIagRnUB0imaaiNDd9.q1l0el.eYiA1wst1aaTCujhI7aViVvitQpYBw--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Street Artist Nets $1000 From Bitcoin QR Codes in His Murals", "title_full": "Street Artist Nets $1000 From Bitcoin QR Codes in His Murals", "published": "2018-05-10T13:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4afbb50e0dbe06e8e082a4b647952d65c226165a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY_2aKksgzptIagRnUB0imaaiNDd9.q1l0el.eYiA1wst1aaTCujhI7aViVvitQpYBw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-10T13:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "Street Artist Nets $1000 From Bitcoin QR Codes in His Murals", "text": "French street artist, Pascal Boyart is taking bitcoin to the art world . The mural painter known by the moniker 'PBOY' is incorporating bitcoin QR codes in his artworks. This allows him to receive donations from the public in crypto.\nBitcoin Meets Art The term \"struggling artist\" is an age-long trope. Not every artist is fortunate enough to have a wealthy patron financing their talents. Even with crowdfunded platforms like Ulule and Patreon, it is still difficult for many artists to eke out a living. For Boyart, the solution to the problem has been Bitcoin, the world's most famous cryptocurrency.\nThe French street artist recently rose to prominence when one of his murals became a trending topic on the Bitcoin subreddit . Many Redditors were impressed not just with his talent but with the melding of art and bitcoin.\nApart from adding bitcoin QR codes to his paintings, Boyart also explores themes related to cryptos and decentralization in his work. The artwork that made Boyart popular on Reddit was a mural painting of Rembrandt, the famous Dutch painter.\nDespite his incredible talent, Rembrandt had severe financial troubles during his lifetime. He even had to sell his house due to mounting debt. There is an anachronistic component to the mural, Rembrandt lived in the 17th century but is depicted reading a newspaper.\nWhile this is the piece that shot Boyart to prominence, the artist says he has incorporated crypto themes in previous works. According to PBOY:\nI first included a Bitcoin QR code in my work in November 2017. I painted a street art piece of a child asking his father 'Dad, what is money?' And I placed a QR code at the side of my signature. I wasn't sure if someone had done this already, but I wanted to see if people could support street artists with donations. I did it as an homage to Andreas Antonopoulos' book The Internet of Money.\nSo far, Boyart has received more about 0.11 bitcoin (approximately $1,000) in donations. The artist describes himself as a crypto enthusiast saying that the creative industry has a lot to benefit from decentralization. According to Boyart, artists can take advantage of the new economic paradigm made possible by Bitcoin technology.\nWhat do you think about Boyart's art pieces? Should other artists incorporate crypto QR codes in their work?

Send me a copy: In 'Brotopia,' Silicon Valley disrupts everything but the boys' club\nBehind the guards, the blast doors and down corridors of reinforced concrete, sit the encrypted computer servers -- connected to nothing -- that hold keys to a vast digital fortune.\nArgentine entrepreneur Wences Casares has spent the past several years persuading Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires that Bitcoin is the global currency of the future, that they need to buy some, and that he’s the man to safeguard it. His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.\nIn the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: how much digital cash does it really hold?\nTwo Xapo clients said it houses roughly $10 billion of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoin’s price, after all, is hardly steady.\n‘Patient Zero’\nEven in the colorful world of crypto the cache is remarkable -- amounting to about 7 percent of the global Bitcoin supply. It would mean Xapo, just 4 years old, has more “deposits” than 98 percent of the roughly 5,670 banks in the U.S. But as a custodian it’s regulated differently. The Swiss subsidiary is overseen by the self-regulating Financial Services Standards Association, which audits members to ensure they comply with anti-money-laundering rules. Xapo serves U.S. customers through a Delaware corporation that’s registered with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and is licensed in several states.\nThe outsize holdings underscore the faith that Casares -- a serial entrepreneur nicknamed “Patient Zero” for stirring Silicon Valley’s interest in Bitcoin -- has garnered among his acolytes and at major crypto investment firms, such as Grayscale and CoinShares.\n“Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,” said Ryan Radloff of CoinShares, which has more than $500 million of Bitcoin stored at Xapo. “You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.”\nXapo’s billionaire backers include LinkedIn Corp. co-founder and former Wall Street trader Mike Novogratz, who’s in the process of setting up his own cryptocurrency merchant bank. Their bet is that Bitcoin is here to stay, and so is its biggest scourge, theft.\nThe first rule of owning Bitcoin is to securely keep your private key -- the code that lets you spend your coins. If thieves get it, they can loot your holdings in an instant, with no hope of recovery. Putting keys on a device connected to the Internet is both convenient and perilous: Hackers have proven adept at obtaining them from afar.\nTrading Desk\nXapo’s solution is to bury a cold-storage device in a mountainside and layer on electronic safeguards.\n“They’re the first folks who recognized custodial and security functions would be key,” said Hoffman, whose venture capital firm Greylock Partners led a $20 million investment in Xapo in 2014, a couple of years after Casares persuaded him to buy his first Bitcoin. “He made the pitch in the morning and in the afternoon I called him with an offer.”\nAt Xapo, retrieving Bitcoin from the vault takes about two days. The company verifies a client’s identity and authenticates the request before manually signing the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations. Approval from three separate vaults is required for any transactions to be authorized. The company also offers customers a trading desk to buy and sell Bitcoin and created the first Bitcoin debit card to spend it.\nCasares, 44, declined to comment for this story. After a flurry of publicity at Xapo’s launch, he has drawn big audiences at crypto conferences but largely shunned media interviews.\nRead more: ‘Cryptolandia’ blockchain pioneers take root in hipster Brooklyn\nYet his persuasiveness is legendary. His evangelizing of Bitcoin is so pervasive in Silicon Valley that when Hoffman asked his family office to buy some, his banker asked when he’d spoken to Casares. Xapo’s advisers now include former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, ex-Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Officer John Reed and Visa International founder Dee Hock.\nSuch salesmanship has been critical to Xapo’s success. First Block Capital, Canada’s first fully registered crypto firm, picked Xapo as its custodian after months of due diligence, including touring the Swiss vault.\n“Every part of their DNA is geared to security,” said Sean Clark, First Block’s founder, who noted the vault’s fingerprint scanners were equipped with a pulse reader to prevent amputated hands from being used. “Whenever we make big transfers they FaceTime us, we have duress words, if it’s big enough they’ll fly out to see us.”\nXapo is doubling down on its pursuit of institutional clients, with President Ted Rogers enlisting Peter Najarian, a veteran of emerging-market trading at UBS Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, to oversee outreach to investors including pension funds, private banks, assets managers, family offices and hedge funds. ‘Tidal Wave’\nThe perceived lack of an institutional-grade custodial solution for Bitcoin has been one of the sticking points for many money managers looking to try the asset class. Xapo says its already offering precisely that solution. If it persuades them of its merits, the implications for Bitcoin would be profound.\n“A fraction of that kind of institutional money flowing into the space would be a tidal wave,” Najarian said.\nRead more: Tracking the Crypto Bulls and Bears\nCasares has made acceptance of Bitcoin his life’s mission. Born to sheep ranchers in Argentina’s remote Patagonia region, he experienced the impact of inflation throughout his youth.\nThat drove him to build a series of fintech startups that made him millions before he encountered Bitcoin. He sold 75 percent of Patagon, a Latin American financial-services website, for $529 million in 2000 and digital wallet startup Lemon for $43 million 13 years later to focus on crypto. By then, he was already a big holder of Bitcoin.\n“I am personally allocating a percentage of my net worth to this that is borderline irresponsible because I believe in it so much,” Casares told Lemon board member Eric O’Brien, according to “Digital Gold,” a book by Nathaniel Popper. Two years ago, he joined the board of PayPal Holdings Inc.\n‘High Hurdle’\nBitcoin’s meteoric rise in recent years has spurred the proliferation of rival currencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple that also have multibillion-dollar valuations. Yet Xapo only safeguards Bitcoin because of Casares’s belief that it alone will succeed. Such dogmatism has seen Xapo turn away customers looking to store rival currencies.\nOther purists say ventures such as Xapo have no place in the Bitcoin ecosystem, slowing down what’s supposed to be a seamless transfer.\nXapo’s top brass wrestle with that paradox, too.\n“It’s a subject we discuss a lot, and we believe Bitcoin won’t reach the mainstream if people have to hold their own private keys,” Rogers said. “It’s a pretty high hurdle technically to be your own bank with lots of security.”\n— With assistance by Yalman Onaran", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/105513640026823338822?rel=author"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wences casares", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T14:20:14.039+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e67cd1f7f4b92ada958d90062b27d287377f35dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcb3yX.C9O4oNCpwjVcE5pY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Bitcoin will never reach 20,000 again", "title_full": "Bitcoin will never reach 20,000 again", "published": "2018-05-10T13:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e67cd1f7f4b92ada958d90062b27d287377f35dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcb3yX.C9O4oNCpwjVcE5pY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Powerpuff", "published": "2018-05-10T13:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin will never reach 20,000 again", "text": "Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian has predicted that Bitcoin could reach its all-time high price of $20,000 again before the year ends.

The company plans to raise as much as $1 billion in its IPO. The IPO, if successful, would be the first from a blockchain-related company on the city's market.\nHangzhou-based Canaan reportedly had said earlier that it was considering both Hong Kong and the US for a share sale. A final decision is yet to be made.\nCanaan, founded in 2013, designs and sells high-performance integrated circuits. It is behind the Avalon series of bitcoin mining machines. In 2017, the company is said to generate net income of 410 million yuan or $64 million, a growth of 600 percent from the previous year. Canaan's majority of clients are from China, which has long been a crypto mining superpower with cheap electricity supply.\nIn 2016, Canaan tried to gain a listing in China through the purchase of electric equipment maker Luyitong, but the plan was canceled after regulators opposed the deal for being overvalued.\nIn 2017 too, Canaan tried to apply for a listing in China's New Third Board market amid the country's ban on trading cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings or ICOs, but fell through, the report said.\nIn China, crypto miners are facing strict restrictions with toughened regulatory crackdown by Chinese authorities, even as the country is reported to have filed for the most patent filings for blockchain technology globally in 2017. The country reportedly accounted for 50 to 70 percent of BTC mining last year.\nCryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, are mined by solving complex mathematical problems, and the owners of the computers involved in mining are rewarded with new digital tokens or coins. The mining can be done with any processor, but application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs are used by serious miners for its speed benefits.\nCanaan Creative and Bitmain buy specially built ASIC chips from Taiwanese chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company or TSMC.\nCanaan Creative co-chairman Kong Jianping said recently that the company pans to expand into the software business besides producing chips.\nby RTTNews Staff Writer", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bln hong kong ipo chinese bitcoin miner canaan creative plans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canaan creative", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south china morning post", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T19:58:09.030+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f430e557f571e08893ce777a9243e50d8f3ac9bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWlAO5eXvV0jd2Unsnu9Oc5R2u9pMpDcojCwSliTnddQbu_l9X3_YbS_yO9Vlgd5OQGnjGxAMZzjdpl2DfNXcdM0jdqwlHdZqa2Hq3VjbZTDvqsDEDfjD4o", "site_full": "news.bitcoin-babe.com", "site": "bitcoin-babe.com", "site_section": "http://news.bitcoin-babe.com/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Drop to $9K Still in Play Despite Brief Bitcoin Rally", "title_full": "Drop to $9K Still in Play Despite Brief Bitcoin Rally", "published": "2018-05-10T13:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f430e557f571e08893ce777a9243e50d8f3ac9bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWlAO5eXvV0jd2Unsnu9Oc5R2u9pMpDcojCwSliTnddQbu_l9X3_YbS_yO9Vlgd5OQGnjGxAMZzjdpl2DfNXcdM0jdqwlHdZqa2Hq3VjbZTDvqsDEDfjD4o", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoinbabeau", "published": "2018-05-10T13:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Drop to $9K Still in Play Despite Brief Bitcoin Rally", "text": "\nDespite a brief rally yesterday, bitcoin (BTC) remains in corrective manner and risks falling back below $9,000, chart analysis suggests. The cryptocurrency broke out of the bearish falling station setup yesterday, courtesy of a bullish relative strength index (RSI) divergence – signaling the pullback from the latest high of $9,990 had stopped at $8,980 (yesterday’s low). The breakout also raised the prospects of a stronger move towards $9,767 (Apr 25 high) and maybe even the $10,000 mark. Nevertheless, the ascent has been cut short around $9,380 in the last 15 hours, as seen in the chart below. Hourly chart\nAs of writing, bitcoin is trying a break above $9,380 on Bitfinex, above which a significant resistance is seen at $9,442 – the 200-hour moving average (MA). At the mean time, a strong support is seen at $9,228 (marked by a circle). The momentum studies are biased bearish. For example, the 100-hour MA is trending south in favour of the bears as well as the 50-hour MA remains increasingly descending (yet to bottom out or shed bearish bias). Consequently, a convincing move above $9,442 might be a tough task. Further, the short-term moving averages in the daily chart below have rolled over in favor of the bears. Daily chart\nThe bearish crossover between the 5-day MA and the 10-day MA suggests a short-term (5 times) bullish-to-bearish trend shift. It also suggests the pullback from the latest high of $9,990 hasn’t run its course. View\nA break below $9,228 (support on the hourly chart) would add credence to the bearish 5-day MA and 10-day MA crossover and open the doors for a fall to $8,980 and $8,868 (100-day moving average). A daily close (as per UTC) below $8,652 (Apr 26 low) would confirm that a bearish reversal. On the higher side, a daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA (currently located at $9,452) would signal the conclusion of the pullback from the latest high of $9,990.\nArrows picture via Shutterstock\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest abides by a strict ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T15:41:55.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "30d24b321fd6ac9f70a64aa0c866f44fedca2eed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54OE5KqDhbglMxE8wYNKrBIOkghH53vpzhoNzYaLafBOW8MKfs._wkHTICYJR2ePFE0Lbt348PTFjQpdVQWEnw6o-", "site_full": "bitcoinist.com", "site": "bitcoinist.com", "site_section": "http://bits.aihosting.com/rss", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "BTC News Aggregator", "title": "Street Artist Nets $1000 From Bitcoin QR Codes In His Murals", "title_full": "Street Artist Nets $1000 From Bitcoin QR Codes In His Murals", "published": "2018-05-10T13:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_264735848.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "30d24b321fd6ac9f70a64aa0c866f44fedca2eed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54OE5KqDhbglMxE8wYNKrBIOkghH53vpzhoNzYaLafBOW8MKfs._wkHTICYJR2ePFE0Lbt348PTFjQpdVQWEnw6o-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-10T13:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Street Artist Nets $1000 From Bitcoin QR Codes In His Murals", "text": "Street Artist Nets $1000 From Bitcoin QR Codes in His Murals Osato Avan-Nomayo · May 10, 2018 · 6:00 am · Views: 1,623\nFrench street artist, Pascal Boyart is taking bitcoin to the art world . The mural painter known by the moniker ‘PBOY’ is incorporating bitcoin QR codes in his artworks. This allows him to receive donations from the public in crypto. Bitcoin Meets Art\nThe term “struggling artist” is an age-long trope. Not every artist is fortunate enough to have a wealthy patron financing their talents. Even with crowdfunded platforms like Ulule and Patreon, it is still difficult for many artists to eke out a living. For Boyart, the solution to the problem has been Bitcoin, the world’s most famous cryptocurrency.\nThe French street artist recently rose to prominence when one of his murals became a trending topic on the Bitcoin subreddit . Many Redditors were impressed not just with his talent but with the melding of art and bitcoin.\nApart from adding bitcoin QR codes to his paintings, Boyart also explores themes related to cryptos and decentralization in his work. The artwork that made Boyart popular on Reddit was a mural painting of Rembrandt, the famous Dutch painter.\nDespite his incredible talent, Rembrandt had severe financial troubles during his lifetime. He even had to sell his house due to mounting debt. There is an anachronistic component to the mural, Rembrandt lived in the 17th century but is depicted reading a newspaper.\nWhile this is the piece that shot Boyart to prominence, the artist says he has incorporated crypto themes in previous works. According to PBOY:\nI first included a Bitcoin QR code in my work in November 2017. I painted a street art piece of a child asking his father ‘Dad, what is money?’ And I placed a QR code at the side of my signature. I wasn’t sure if someone had done this already, but I wanted to see if people could support street artists with donations. I did it as an homage to Andreas Antonopoulos’ book The Internet of Money.\nSo far, Boyart has received more about 0.11 bitcoin (approximately $1,000) in donations. The artist describes himself as a crypto enthusiast saying that the creative industry has a lot to benefit from decentralization. According to Boyart, artists can take advantage of the new economic paradigm made possible by Bitcoin technology.\nWhat do you think about Boyart’s art pieces? Should other artists incorporate crypto QR codes in their work?

These stories and much more in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief.\nAlso Read: Stripper Explains Bitcoin to Adult Industry, Facebook Explores Blockchain Bitcoin Supporter for NY AG\nA bitcoin supporter wants to replace New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who recently resigned after four women complained about non-consensual physical violence by him. Manny Alicandro has announced his candidacy on the Republican ticket. He is a stock market lawyer, former stand-up comedian, and a bitcoin enthusiast as the Wall Street Journal reports.\nAlicandro expects his campaign to highlight the current harsh regulation of bitcoin. He said he’d like to see lighter rules for cryptocurrency businesses, arguing that the Bitlicense is hurting jobs and stifling innovation. He serves as an adviser to several blockchain startups and is a small investor in bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies himself. The report adds that the AG candidate is currently checking if it is permissible for his campaign to accept donations in bitcoin . Canaan Seeks $1 Billion IPO in Hong Kong\nCanaan Creative Co. Ltd, the Chinese company behind the Avalon lineup of hardware equipment which produces ASIC mining chips and rigs, is now reportedly planning to launch an IPO in Kong Kong and raise up to a billion USD. As we previously reported , the company was also eyeing the US for a possible IPO market but has now ditched that option according to people familiar with the matter cited by the South China Morning Post . Warren Buffett Produces Bitcoin Mining Hardware?\nWarren Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has recently attacked bitcoin by saying among other things that the cryptocurrency is “probably rat poison squared.” Therefore he would probably be very surprised to find out that he is involved with it in some way. According to reports from Canada, Climate Solutions TMI, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, has begun producing “portable cryptocurrency mines” for Montreal-headquartered data-centers firm Kelvin Emtech .\nThese “portable mines” are containers with specialized ventilation systems needed to keep 1,200 rigs cool inside a metal box. They are said to be deployable anywhere in the world in two days, each consumes 2 MW of electricity, and can generate around $1 million in cryptocurrency revenue each month. “We wanted it to be easily transported by truck, boat or train. The goal is not to move them all the time, but rather to eliminate the problem of access to electricity. We want to bring these cryptocurrency mines as close as possible to the hydroelectric plants and the remote areas where Hydro-Québec has excess electricity to sell,” explained Fooad Nejad of Kelvin Emtech. “We get to recover between 80 and 97% of the heat produced. Containers could be placed near marijuana greenhouses or community centers, for example, and provided free of charge to partners. It’s like saying, ‘I’m scratching your back, you’re scratching my back’,” he added. The company also believes that this order will create about 200 jobs in the area. Amana Capital Adds Cryptocurrency CFDs\nAmana Capital, a Middle Eastern financial services group, is the latest online trading brokerage to add cryptocurrency-based contracts for difference (CFDs). The company explains it took the move due to “the increased demand for cryptocurrencies.” As a first phase, Amana will offer its clients the option to trade BTC, ETH, LTC, and XRP on its MetaTrader 5 platform, with additional cryptocurrencies promised to be added in the future.\nAhmad Khatib, CEO of Amana Capital, said: “Making cryptocurrencies available for CFDs traders across the world, falls in line with our strategic mission to further diversify our financial offerings and services, according to the latest financial innovations. Hence, we believe that entering the cryptocurrency market is a strategic move that propels our efforts on that end.” Blox Releases “Quickbooks for Crypto”\nBlox.io, a Tel Aviv-based startup formerly known as Coindash, has announced it launched Blox Business – an enterprise solution for managing, tracking and reporting crypto assets. The new platform is already being used by several ventures such as eToro, Wings, CIVIC, Coinsilium, Aeternity, Chainlinker capital, Startup Token and others. It features integrations with multiple exchanges and wallet accounts so that companies will be able to have a single dashboard with all their cryptocurrency holdings in one place. This solution is meant to help executives manage their books and finances by keeping an eye on stuff like cash flows, payments and salaries. Dash CEO Hacked\nHackers continue to target victims in the cryptocurrency space, and the latest one revealed to be hit is CEO of Dash Core, Ryan Taylor. According to an announcement by the group, his Twitter account, LinkedIn account, and personal cell phone SIM card have all been compromised. After a few hours of it posting nonsense, Taylor has now regained control of his Twitter account. Last week we reported that hackers had taken over the official Vertcoin Twitter account. Bitcoin on the Late Show\nWith the cryptocurrency now routinely featuring in hit shows like HBO’s Silicon Valley , its not that exciting to see bitcoin on TV but it’s still a good opportunity to reach a wider audience.

Prison Planet.com » The Wealthy Are Hoarding $10 Billion of Bitcoin in Bunkers By\nBloomberg May 9, 2018\nBehind the guards, the blast doors and down corridors of reinforced concrete, sit the encrypted computer servers — connected to nothing — that hold keys to a vast digital fortune.\nArgentine entrepreneur Wences Casares has spent the past several years persuading Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires that Bitcoin is the global currency of the future, that they need to buy some, and that he’s the man to safeguard it. His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.\nIn the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: how much digital cash does it really hold?\nTwo Xapo clients said it houses roughly $10 billion of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoin’s price, after all, is hardly steady.

The mural painter known by the moniker ‘PBOY’ is incorporating bitcoin QR codes in his artworks. This allows him to receive donations from the public in crypto. Bitcoin Meets Art\nThe term “struggling artist” is an age-long trope. Not every artist is fortunate enough to have a wealthy patron financing their talents. Even with crowdfunded platforms like Ulule and Patreon, it is still difficult for many artists to eke out a living. For Boyart, the solution to the problem has been Bitcoin, the world’s most famous cryptocurrency.\nThe French street artist recently rose to prominence when one of his murals became a trending topic on the Bitcoin subreddit . Many Redditors were impressed not just with his talent but with the melding of art and bitcoin.\nApart from adding bitcoin QR codes to his paintings, Boyart also explores themes related to cryptos and decentralization in his work. The artwork that made Boyart popular on Reddit was a mural painting of Rembrandt, the famous Dutch painter.\nDespite his incredible talent, Rembrandt had severe financial troubles during his lifetime. He even had to sell his house due to mounting debt. There is an anachronistic component to the mural, Rembrandt lived in the 17th century but is depicted reading a newspaper.\nWhile this is the piece that shot Boyart to prominence, the artist says he has incorporated crypto themes in previous works. According to PBOY:\nI first included a Bitcoin QR code in my work in November 2017. I painted a street art piece of a child asking his father ‘Dad, what is money?’ And I placed a QR code at the side of my signature. I wasn’t sure if someone had done this already, but I wanted to see if people could support street artists with donations. I did it as an homage to Andreas Antonopoulos’ book The Internet of Money.\nSo far, Boyart has received more about 0.11 bitcoin (approximately $1,000) in donations. The artist describes himself as a crypto enthusiast saying that the creative industry has a lot to benefit from decentralization. According to Boyart, artists can take advantage of the new economic paradigm made possible by Bitcoin technology.\nWhat do you think about Boyart’s art pieces? Should other artists incorporate crypto QR codes in their work?
