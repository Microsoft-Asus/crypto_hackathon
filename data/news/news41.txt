Written by: Published on: Jun/04/2018\nYou will be able to bet on this year's FIFA World Cup from New York State using one of a few dozen internationally-licensed online betting sites. The best way to place bets online from New York will be with bitcoin using a cryptocurrency wallet that can be linked to one's banking account. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in May that individual states can offer legalized sports betting.\n*Bookmaker Welcomes Players From Around the World - Most Crypto-Currencies Welcome\nWILL NEW YORK WELCOME SPORTS BETTING?\nThe Empire State will embrace sports betting but has put it on the back burner for the moment, so don't expect to start placing bets at the start of the new Football season.\nA 2013 law created the framework for offering sports betting in the state but not everyone is on board with the structure as it stands now.\nThat law does not address sports betting at Indian nation casinos nor does it advise on how to hand out licenses.\nMore importantly, the state legislature session ends on June 20. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has suggested there may not be time to do it this year.\nNeedless-to-say, Florida gamblers will need to rely on international websites to place all their World Cup bets .\nHOW TO USE BITCOIN AND OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES FOR BETTING THE FIFA WORLD CUP\nThe online betting site will simply have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nSome exchanges allow customers to link directly with their bank accounts or PayPal. The Bitcoin can be converted into the currency of your choice then transferred into your account in as little as 24 hours.\nYou will want to verify all your information (including personal identification) with the exchange prior to sending and receiving funds. Typically they will suggest setting up an authenticator on your mobile device for added security.\n- Aaron Goldstein, Gambling911.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.bookmaker.eu/?cmpid=17253_9714", "http://bit.ly/2qvYzxr"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "fifa world cup online from new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "empire state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fifa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T06:20:45.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3ea8e13bb73a9a108d63d1029ce7d9230670a541", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg91DSo3LSNjdBfGW2afHNCaRusyfsHdRxizP2hGwc6bKWL8lDBwzHjFjnJhFxkNQPB07zc4kLwo8NtoZHvwHLw6jwoxvecXOM.FnL2XNmfeEVdDDwjkN.6N", "site_full": "www.sunmag.net", "site": "sunmag.net", "site_section": "http://www.sunmag.net/category/news", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Category : News", "title": "CHANOS: 'The last thing I’d want to own is bitcoin if the grid goes down'", "title_full": "CHANOS: 'The last thing I’d want to own is bitcoin if the grid goes down'", "published": "2018-06-05T05:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "BG", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/5b1651c81ae66218008b4857/chanos-the-last-thing-id-want-to-own-is-bitcoin-if-the-grid-goes-down.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3ea8e13bb73a9a108d63d1029ce7d9230670a541", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg91DSo3LSNjdBfGW2afHNCaRusyfsHdRxizP2hGwc6bKWL8lDBwzHjFjnJhFxkNQPB07zc4kLwo8NtoZHvwHLw6jwoxvecXOM.FnL2XNmfeEVdDDwjkN.6N", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sunmag.net", "published": "2018-06-05T05:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "CHANOS: 'The last thing I’d want to own is bitcoin if the grid goes down'", "text": "Short seller Jim Chanos says bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are a product of the long-running bull market, which is pushing investors to take more risk and \"believe things.\" Chanos agreed that bitcoin is a \"libertarian fantasy\" and said its main utility is avoiding tax. \"This is simply a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough in monetary policy.\"\nLONDON — Renowned short seller Jim Chanos thinks cryptocurrencies are a product of the run-away global bull market and have little use beyond avoiding tax.\nChanos, known for predicting the collapse of Enron, addressed the topic of cryptocurrencies in an interview with the Institute for New Economic Thinking.\nChanos, who runs New York-based Kynikos Associates, said investors are getting \"a little bit jiggy with their capital\" and are more \"willing to take risks, willing to believe things\" the longer the current bull market goes on.\n\"So today we’ve got bitcoin and ICOs [initial coin offerings], which went ballistic in 2017,\" Chanos said. \"I suspect going forward we’re going to see more and more evidence of questionable companies as this bull market keeps advancing and aging.\"\n\"We’re now nine years into this bull market, same as the ‘90s, so I suspect that now things are starting to percolate. I think bitcoin and the ICOs are just one manifestation of that,\" he said.\nChanos expressed scepticism about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally. Huge amounts of capital flowed into the sector last year, which peaked at over $800 billion in value in December.\nBitcoin's original enthusiasts were drawn to the fact that the cryptocurrency was independent of any nation state or central bank, making it theoretically immune from things like quantitative easing. They also argued that its independence made it a more viable long-term currency.\nChanos said: \"For those who believe it’s a store of value in the coming apocalypse, the idea is that you’re going to have to safeguard your key under a mountain with fingerprint and eye scan security while the hordes are outside your bunker trying to get in to use it — for what, I have no idea. Because for those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that’s exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least. Food would work the best!\"\nThe interviewer then suggested bitcoin is a \"libertarian fantasy,\" to which Chanos replied: \"That’s exactly what it is. And if you say, well, fiat currency is going to bring the world down, which could, of course, happen, then I say the last thing I’d want to own is bitcoin if the grid goes down.\"\nHe added: \"Bitcoin is still the area for people who are trying to avoid taxation or other examinations of their transactions. That’s one thing where I think it probably still has utility, but the governments have figured that out.\n\"This is simply a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough in monetary policy. Someone at Grant’s interest rate conference recently said that it was as if we had intentionally created a 'monetary Somalia'.\"\nYou can read the full interview here.\nSEE ALSO:& A startup just

Written by: Published on: Jun/04/2018\nFor this year's FIFA World Cup, the best way to place bets online from Pennsylvania will be with bitcoin using a cryptocurrency wallet that can be linked to one's banking account. In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that individual states can offer legalized sports betting but must first develop regulatory instruments before doing so. For now, a few dozen of internationally licensed sportsbooks will accept wagers on this year's World Cup .\n*Bookmaker Welcomes Players From Around the World - Most Crypto-Currencies Welcome\nWILL PA WELCOME SPORTS BETTING?\nThe Keystone State is anxious to get into the sports betting arena but won't be ready in time for the World Cup, and they are having a tough time enticing companies it seems.\nAs of June 4 though, none of the PA casinos have applied for a sports betting license, this despite the state opening the process to allow existing casinos to file for the right to establish sports books.\nThis might explain: From the Inquirer :\nThe head of William Hill US, which just partnered with the Ocean Resort (formerly Revel) in Atlantic City to run its book, says the company is not making any similar deals in the Keystone State because the law calls for a 36 percent tax on operators’ revenue plus a one-time fee of $10 million. Sounds like the deal Michael Corleone offered Moe Greene in The Godfather\n“Pennsylvania is in a different bucket because of the tax rate,” said Joe Asher, William Hill’s chief executive officer, who is from Wilmington and worked as a kid at the old Brandywine racetrack. “We can’t figure it out. Because of it, we haven’t spent the time or effort in Pennsylvania that we have in New Jersey. The tax rate is such a big challenge.”\nNeedless-to-say, Pennsylvania gamblers will need to rely on international websites to place all their World Cup bets .\nHOW TO USE BITCOIN AND OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES FOR BETTING THE FIFA WORLD CUP\nThe online betting site will simply have you send them the special address/token obtained from the Bitcoin wallet or exchange.\nYou would select either SEND (to deposit funds) or RECEIVE (to withdraw funds).\nSome exchanges allow customers to link directly with their bank accounts or PayPal. The Bitcoin can be converted into the currency of your choice then transferred into your account in as little as 24 hours.\nYou will want to verify all your information (including personal identification) with the exchange prior to sending and receiving funds.

It is the theory that long-term holders have the biggest impact on the Bitcoin price and transactional demand is not nearly as important.&l;/span&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;There was a whole &l;/span&g;&l;a href=&q;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2394024&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;paper&l;/span&g;&l;/a&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g; published on this topic in early 2014, although the concept was laid out in a theoretical manner rather than proven with empirical evidence. The basic idea is that the bitcoin price in terms of U.S. dollars or any other fiat currency will be determined by the willingness of holders to pull bitcoin out of circulation more than anything else.&l;/span&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;To gain a&a;nbsp;better understanding of this theory, one must look deep into the mind of the hodler.&l;/span&g;\n&l;b&g;What is a Hodler?&l;/b&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;No, &a;ldquo;hodler&a;rdquo; is not a typo, and it doesn&a;rsquo;t stand for &a;ldquo;holding on for dear life.&a;rdquo;&l;/span&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;Hodl is a meme that originated in &l;/span&g;&l;a href=&q;https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;a drunken post on the Bitcointalk.org forum&l;/span&g;&l;/a&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g; back in late 2013 as the bitcoin price was collapsing amid regulation-related concerns in China.&l;/span&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;The original post indicated a preference for long-term holding of the bitcoin asset as opposed to day trading, but the meme has grown into a rallying cry for bitcoin holders who are willing to hold on to their bitcoin in pretty much any market environment.&l;/span&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;The hodlers are here to stay, and &l;/span&g;&l;a href=&q;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF7M0FISH5Y&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;they&a;rsquo;re not leaving&l;/span&g;&l;/a&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;. They&a;rsquo;re the strong hands that do not sell when the price collapses by 25% in a single day or 50% over the course of a month. In fact, they buy the dips.&l;!–nextpage–&g;&l;/span&g;\n&l;b&g;Why Do Holders Hodl?&l;/b&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;Hodlers take their belief in the use of Bitcoin as a store of value to religious levels. Some of them hodl for political reasons (they would prefer to see the world use Bitcoin as money rather than the U.S. dollar or any other fiat currency), others just want to speculate on the future usefulness of bitcoin as a widely-used form of money.&l;/span&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;In short, hodlers hodl because they believe in the meme of bitcoin as digital gold. They understand the value of a permissionless, censorship-resistant form of electronic money in an increasingly digital world.&l;/span&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;In other words, hodlers are the floor on the bitcoin price. Once enough people sell their bitcoin, only the hodlers are left, and they&a;rsquo;re ready to buy more, which increases the percentage of the total supply of bitcoin that is held by the hodlers.&l;/span&g;\nA true hodler will never sell their bitcoin. Instead, the hodler waits patiently for the day when the use of Bitcoin is ubiquitous around the world and their everyday transactions can be made via the permissionless digital cash system. &l;a href=&q;https://99bitcoins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MatrixBitcoin.jpg&q; target=&q;_blank&q; rel=&q;noopener noreferrer&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;As the infamous meme based on a scene from &l;em&g;The Matrix&l;/em&g; says&l;/a&g;, hodlers won&s;t have to sell by the time they&s;re ready to cash out.\n&l;a href=&q;https://www.forbes.com/sites/ktorpey/2018/01/15/paypals-wences-casares-i-can-imagine-a-world-in-which-bitcoin-becomes-a-global-standard-of-value/&q;&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;As longtime hodler and PayPal Board Member Wences Casares recently indicated&l;/span&g;&l;/a&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;, the idea here is that Bitcoin will eventually become a global, apolitical standard for value and settlement.&l;/span&g;\n&l;b&g;Can Hodling Be Measured?&l;/b&g;\nBitcoin hodlers have the strongest effect on the long-term bitcoin price, but is there any way to measure their collective impact? Not really.\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;The key&a;nbsp;issue here is hodlers can be hard to detect on the blockchain. It&a;rsquo;s not clear if someone is a real hodler until they&a;rsquo;ve gone through a price panic or two.&l;/span&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;FundStrat co-founder Tom Lee uses a combination of the total number of Bitcoin addresses and the average dollar-value transaction volume between those addresses as a way of tracking the overall Bitcoin userbase. But again, not all Bitcoin users are hodlers.&l;/span&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;Sure, &l;/span&g;&l;a href=&q;https://lendedu.com/blog/investing-in-bitcoin&q; target=&q;_blank&q;&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;there was a LendEDU survey released last year&l;/span&g;&l;/a&g;&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g; that indicated the average price holders would sell at was nearly $200,000 per Bitcoin, but these were holders, not necessarily hodlers. It&a;rsquo;s possible that many of the individuals who participated in the survey sold their bitcoin during one of the sharp price drops over the past month. Price crashes tend to separate the holders from the hodlers.&l;/span&g;\n&l;span style=&q;font-weight: 400;&q;&g;Every short-term Bitcoin price bubble brings new attention to the bitcoin asset, with some of those new users having the potential to turn into hodlers. Instead of looking for data points that can be used to predict daily movements in the bitcoin price, perhaps those who are interested in the future potential here should take the advice of a drunken bitcoin believer from 2013 and simply hodl.&l;/span&g; ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.forbes.com/sites/ktorpey/2018/01/15/paypals-wences-casares-i-can-imagine-a-world-in-which-bitcoin-becomes-a-global-standard-of-value/&q;&g;&l;span", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/ktorpey/2017/12/29/comparing-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-by-market-cap-can-be-very-misleading/#430233c32509&q;&g;Comparing", "https://twitter.com/kyletorpey/status/938133493292437509?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&q;", "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0&q;", "https://lendedu.com/blog/investing-in-bitcoin&q;", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Rekt?src=hash&a;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&q;", "https://t.co/wmsOOhNdNu&q;", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF7M0FISH5Y", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ProfessorBitcorn?src=hash&a;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&q;", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/ktorpey/2017/10/27/heres-what-gold-bugs-miss-about-bitcoins-intrinsic-value/2/#ea0d6707ce07&q;&g;&l;span", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/st-louis-fed-some-ways-bitcoin-more-robust-many-fiat-currencies/&q;", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/NeverForget?src=hash&a;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&q;", "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2394024&q;"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T04:31:12.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3fce907a0bdbff48d772260fb312e4be31dee72a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme2a08fUsQvzUwmmWrVrLpY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Will bitcoin and crypto kill worlds economy???", "title_full": "Will bitcoin and crypto kill worlds economy???", "published": "2018-06-05T04:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.201, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3fce907a0bdbff48d772260fb312e4be31dee72a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme2a08fUsQvzUwmmWrVrLpY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jamisky", "published": "2018-06-05T04:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "Will bitcoin and crypto kill worlds economy???", "text": "To say crypto will kill the world's economy is possible on because there are many crap coins in the market will will have little or no value in the future.

Although problematic in its own right, the attack highlights one of the biggest weaknesses of blockchain platforms like Bitcoin — computing power.\nBlockchain backed cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and ZenCash, are built on a “proof-of-work” system. That means that the network goes along with what a majority of ‘nodes’ (or miners) say is true. It’s a secure system because to trick it, you need to control more than half of those nodes, or an equivalent amount of computing power.\nWhile that might be difficult for a platform like Bitcoin where there are thousands upon thousands of high-powered mining rigs, it’s much easier to trick smaller cryptocurrency networks. That is exactly what happened with ZenCash, where over a period of four hours, attackers used masses of computing power to take control of the blockchain and create alternate histories, thereby letting them spend their ZenCash twice.\nBecause the attackers covered their tracks, no one quite knows what they did with it, but no doubt it was profitable. Crypto51 looks at the hash rate, or global computing power currently mining different cryptocurrencies, and how much a 51 percent attack would technically cost to perform if rented from existing networks. In the case of ZenCash, the attacker would theoretically only have had to spend around $30,000 to complete the double-spend hack.\nBlockchain networks like Bitcoin, which are far larger, would require a much greater expenditure to complete a 51 percent attack — $717,000 for just one hour, according to Crypto51. Fortunately, there isn’t enough rental power in the world to conduct such an attack, but if an organization was to get a hold of enough hashing power, those currencies are just as vulnerable and could be attacked in much the same way.\nZenCash isn’t the only cryptocurrency that has been hit with a 51 percent attack. As Bitcoinist reports, both Bitcoin Gold and Verge have both been hit in a similar manner in recent months. They required less hashing power than ZenCash, so it’s possible that this latest attack is just another example if a trend of upward trajectory attacks that target much more vulnerable cryptocurrencies and blockchain platforms.\nFifty-one percent attacks aren’t the only problems faced by Bitcoin and public blockchain platforms, though, these developers are trying to solve them.\nHackers prove how powerful computers can cheat Bitcoin and blockchain ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T22:18:55.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d9ae33ccd1c4bdd173c9d547736af5f735481432", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSaMU5e985FKloqYuGazzexM6XEMoqVA3eZd7M9uH6sOxyKo2vHI6hefbczewNZMZfYixVtd6eexrxoOdbmOEdtd3qs7RIapMzry5kKRsTHjmRywIhUjR.6lpZBy5T_Ldg", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "r/CryptoMarkets", "title": "Bullish Bitcoin Signals Suggesting Bears Nearing Point of Exhaustion : CryptoMarkets", "title_full": "Bullish Bitcoin Signals Suggesting Bears Nearing Point of Exhaustion : CryptoMarkets", "published": "2018-06-05T04:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.051, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d9ae33ccd1c4bdd173c9d547736af5f735481432", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSaMU5e985FKloqYuGazzexM6XEMoqVA3eZd7M9uH6sOxyKo2vHI6hefbczewNZMZfYixVtd6eexrxoOdbmOEdtd3qs7RIapMzry5kKRsTHjmRywIhUjR.6lpZBy5T_Ldg", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "DifficultDuty", "published": "2018-06-05T04:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bullish Bitcoin Signals Suggesting Bears Nearing Point of Exhaustion : CryptoMarkets", "text": "submitted by /u/DifficultDuty\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://verifiedtopics.com/bullish-bitcoin-signals-suggesting-bears-nearing-point-of-exhaustion/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T01:17:14.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4e65205ebba0c309fdf6ba5b9735b4acf9ecab3a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vzyp7lQoHwZqZvBIbhWYRlFk-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-05T04:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4e65205ebba0c309fdf6ba5b9735b4acf9ecab3a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vzyp7lQoHwZqZvBIbhWYRlFk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-05T04:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ June 5, 2018 NEWS CNBC: Google Searches for Bitcoin Down 75% Since Early 2018 Cointelegraph According to research from Google Trends, web searches for the word \" Bitcoin \" dropped 75% since the beginning of 2018, halving in just the last three ...

Digital coins, on the other hand, have no such backing.\n“For those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that’s exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least,” he said. “The last thing I’d want to own is Bitcoin if the grid goes down.”\nFood would be better, he said.\nThe past year’s euphoria over Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fits into the “fraud cycle,” in which people grow less skeptical during long periods of market gains, plowing into investments that would normally seem too good to be true, he said. The bull market of the 1990s culminated with accounting scandals such as Enron’s. Later, another run led to the global financial crisis of 2008, he said.\n“We’re now nine years into this bull market, same as the ’90s, so I suspect that now things are starting to percolate,” he said, singling out Bitcoin and initial coin offerings for other tokens. “This is simply a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough in monetary policy.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Shailesh Bhatt, a key accused in the Surat kidnapping case, wherein cryptocurrency worth Rs 155.21 crore was allegedly extorted from Dhaval Mavani in February, 2018, had alleged that Nair threatened him with legal consequences and extorted Rs 4.50 crore from him. Bhatt had filed a complainant with CID (crime), alleging that he was kidnapped at the instance of Amreli SP Jagdish Patel, Inspector Anant Patel and others including BJP ex-MLA Nalin Kotadiya, and extorted of Bitcoins worth Rs 12 crore. After the CID probed the matter, it came to light that Bhatt’s kidnapping was set up by his business partner Kirit Paladiya, in collusion with the accused police officers and others. CID sources said they questioned Nair in connection with Bhatt’s allegations. “However, Nair said that while he knew Kirit Paladiya for a long time, he had not extorted money from Bhatt,” said a CID official. Sources in the CBI said an internal inquiry has been begun against Nair. “Nair has been transferred to Shillong in Meghalaya for the duration of the inquiry,” said a CBI source. CID meanwhile dispatched teams to track down Kotadiya and Bhatt. “We have sent teams to three states to trace Kotadiya and Bhatt,” added a senior CID crime official. Nirlipt Rai made Amreli SP After the arrest of Jagdish Patel, the Amreli superintendent of police, his post fell vacant. On Monday, the government posted Nirlipt Rai as the new SP of Amreli.

Although problematic in its own right, the attack highlights one of the biggest weaknesses of blockchain platforms like Bitcoin — computing power.\nBlockchain backed cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and ZenCash, are built on a “proof-of-work” system. That means that the network goes along with what a majority of ‘nodes’ (or miners) say is true.\nIt’s a secure system because to trick it, you need to control more than half of those nodes, or an equivalent amount of computing power. While that might be difficult for a platform like Bitcoin where there are thousands upon thousands of high-powered mining rigs, it’s much easier to trick smaller cryptocurrency networks.\nThat is exactly what happened with ZenCash, where over a period of four hours, attackers used masses of computing power to take control of the blockchain and create alternate histories, thereby letting them spend their ZenCash twice. Because the attackers covered their tracks, no one quite knows what they did with it, but no doubt it was profitable.\nCrypto51 looks at the hash rate, or global computing power currently mining different cryptocurrencies, and how much a 51 percent attack would technically cost to perform if rented from existing networks. In the case of ZenCash, the attacker would theoretically only have had to spend around $30,000 to complete the double-spend hack.

Co-founder of Datatrek Research and Wall Street Bitcoin analyst Nicholas Colas, cited by CNBC, links the decline in web searches to the coin’s price rates that have similarly dropped by approximately 50 percent this year. In an email to his clients, Colas adds that “[Bitcoin] needs a new narrative in order to reestablish global attention”. Sponsored Links Google Trends analyzes different periods of popularity of certain web searches. A value of 100 is taken as a peak popularity for a specific search term. In the beginning of January Bitcoin’s popularity was 37, dropping to as low as 9 by the beginning of June. Colas also mentions the decreasing number of newly created Bitcoin wallets, comparing the current period with the last quarter of 2017, when Bitcoin prices neared $20,000. The growth in the number of new wallets in 2018 so far was only 3.7 percent, while in late 2017 it compounded 7.6 percent monthly. “Bitcoin wallet growth needs to be +5 percent/month to see meaningful price appreciation”, Colas concluded. Google searches for other cryptocurrencies are also in decline, according to CNBC. Ethereum – the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization – has dropped by 70 percent since early 2018, Bitcoin Cash has lost 82 percent and XRP fell 87 percent.\nStill, the fifth largest cryptocurrency EOS’ searches have jumped 97 percent in 2018.

Look at the disaster our 'trusted third party' banks have done.\nAs for the second point in bold, the miners also SUPPORT the network and therefore deserve the fees, this is why it is called 'Proof of Work.'\nAs for the energy efficiency argument, I've said this many times. Alternative energy is possible and if we were to take Bitcoin Cash as seriously as far a making it a globally adopted currency, billions would be invested into these alternative energy sources if the desire was there. China runs on coal and thats the problem, not Bitcoin Cash. Lets also remember how many bank related services would not be running 24/hours a day. The energy efficiency articles are often overstatements without any real factual backing. Those statistics are often kept quiet. Its important to care about the environment for future generations, but there are alternatives here.\nTheir is no flaw, Bankers use a Loan System to Create Unlimited Sums out of thin air, of which they have completely Centralized Control.\nA Well Designed Proof of Stake System using ULI is Decentralized , as no one can confiscate or deny transactions like in the banking system.\nAs far as your alternative energy , that is beyond nonsense. The alternative energy is growing at 2.6% per year max and that is projected until 2040.\nIt is a joke, at the insane rate bitcoin is pulling power, you need a New Nuclear Power Plant running at full capacity almost on a bi-weekly basis starting in late 2019 .\nDue to regulatory restrictions , that is never going to happen.\nThe more likely scenario is that World Governments begin blocking Bitcoin Mining and only allow their chosen few to receive the electricity for bitcoin mining.\nThis gives the world governments the power to choose only those that will comply with their requests on which transactions to include in the blockchain and which address to blacklist. They may not be able to steal the funds, but they will force the miners to freeze in place anyone's bitcoin they so deem enemies of the state.\nThe Insane Energy waste is a security vulnerability because it further increases Centralization of bitcoin , not a security benefit as some in here so foolishly believe.\nIn the end result , a Centralized bitcoin will be no better than a Centralized Banking System.\nDecentralization is the key to avoiding Government Control and Censorship from Totalitarian Regimes.\nPower, regulations, centralisation. At the end of the day the power is in the hands of the wealth and they will regulate the control.\nAnd it ain't gonna be zeitcoin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T17:17:34.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e06ba2ca91a2e7d44cf55bf954121eba84818704", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfUSwKKWtJ6wCs8H1gcBJPI-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin have more risks than benefits?", "title_full": "Bitcoin have more risks than benefits?", "published": "2018-06-05T03:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.064, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e06ba2ca91a2e7d44cf55bf954121eba84818704", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfUSwKKWtJ6wCs8H1gcBJPI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Pyr3x", "published": "2018-06-05T03:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin have more risks than benefits?", "text": "Yes, it is really a very risky investment project, and you should be ready for it when you decide to earn with the help of cryptocurrency.

Although problematic in its own right, the attack highlights one of the biggest weaknesses of blockchain platforms like Bitcoin — computing power.\nBlockchain backed cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin,and ZenCash , are built on a “proof-of-work” system. That means that the network goes along with what a majority of ‘nodes’ ( or miners ) say is true. It’s a secure system because to trick it, you need to control more than half of those nodes, or an equivalent amount of computing power.\nWhile that might be difficult for a platform like Bitcoin where there are thousands upon thousands of high-powered mining rigs, it’s much easier to trick smaller cryptocurrency networks. That is exactly what happened with ZenCash, where over a period of four hours, attackers used masses of computing power to take control of the blockchain and create alternate histories, thereby letting them spend their ZenCash twice.\nBecause the attackers covered their tracks, no one quite knows what they did with it, but no doubt it was profitable. Crypto51 looks at the hash rate, or global computing power currently mining different cryptocurrencies, and how much a 51 percent attack would technically cost to perform if rented from existing networks. In the case of ZenCash, the attacker would theoretically only have had to spend around $30,000 to complete the double-spendhack.\nBlockchain networks like Bitcoin, which are far larger, would require a much greater expenditure to complete a 51 percent attack — $717,000 for just one hour, according to Crypto51. Fortunately, there isn’t enough rental power in the world to conduct such an attack, but if an organization was to get a hold of enough hashing power, those currencies are just as vulnerable and could be attacked in much the same way.\nZenCash isn’t the only cryptocurrency that has been hit with a 51 percent attack. As Bitcoinist reports , both Bitcoin Gold and Verge have both been hit in a similar manner in recent months.

The plant emanates a loud humming from fans to cool the servers for the large network of computer servers in the building. TOMMY MARTINO, Missoulian Save\nNew or expanded cryptocurrency — or Bitcoin — mining operations could be limited in Missoula County under temporary emergency interim zoning that will be discussed during the commissioners’ June 14 meeting.\nOn Monday, commissioners said they don’t know what action, if any, they’ll take on the measure. But they hope that public comments made at the meeting will help chart a path forward amid concerns over noise, the amount of energy used by the cryptocurrency mining operations, and how that energy consumption could affect consumers.\n“We definitely need to find more information. I want to hear the pros and cons,” Commissioner Cola Rowley said. “What the staff put together is fantastic, but I want more information from outside people, and I see that hearing as a way of getting that.”\nTwo commercial-scale cryptocurrency mining facilities currently operate in the county, and electric utilities that operate in Missoula County say they’re receiving quite a few inquiries from other mining firms.\nAttorney Jaymie Bowditch, who represents Project Spokane — one of the companies operating a cryptocurrency mining operation in Bonner — said his clients have two main concerns about the possible interim zoning. They’re worried it would limit expansion possibilities, and that it would regulate a particular type of business.\n“To be blunt, the potential for this interim zoning — they are significantly concerned with it,” Bowditch told the commissioners. “They’re worried about the breadth and authority to regulate businesses through zoning.”\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, created in 2009, and is the most widely used. Mining involves using large blocks of computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles, and successful miners are paid in cryptocurrency and listed on digital public transaction ledgers. It’s a digital currency, with a value Monday of $7,537, down from a high of about $15,800 in December 2017.\nMontana is an attractive location for cryptocurrency mining operations because of low electricity rates and a cool climate that helps keep the computers from overheating.\nHowever, mining a single bitcoin takes as much electricity as it does to power the average American household for two years. Another way to look at it is that the amount of electricity consumed by bitcoin operations worldwide could power more than 6 million households.\nMissoula County lists five concerns with cryptocurrency mining operations. Those include:\n• Noise pollution from cooling equipment, which could cause stress-related illness;\n• An increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which could add to climate change;\n• Increased electric rates for other utility customers;\n• The possibility of a fire safety hazard;\n• The production of electronic waste that contains heavy metal and carcinogens.\nNeighbors near the Bonner bitcoin mining operations have voiced concern over the hum of the hundreds of fan blades operating in a warehouse. Last month, after a sometimes-explosive meeting, the Missoula Development Authority Board declined to release $135,000 in Tax Increment Financing funds to purchase less noisy blades, as well as undertake sound engineering work.\nCommissioner Jean Curtiss said she’s not sure if the concerns fall under the authority that allows them to create the emergency interim zoning.\n“I think we need more information before we decide this … we need to know the population growth needs for power, those kinds of things,” Curtiss added.\nDeputy County Attorney Matt Jennings also noted that entities like the Public Service Commission are in charge of setting rates, except for local co-operatives.\n“I don’t know the co-ops' opinions and how they’ll protect their customers, but they are totally autonomous from the county,” Jennings said.

One is quite useless without the other and if you try to base your money solely on store of value or rapid deflation — basically for sake of seeing a number on a screen appreciate — then you are running a pump scheme desperately looking for others to provide you with the real justification for the exceedingly higher price and you are just as much against sound money as anyone instead preferring to see it depreciate.\nThis is the case even if you think that you will necessarily have the use value in commerce of that same number created increase in relation to other goods or necessarily keep the same price tag on the global market later when you finally decide to reconfigure it's attributes. The market will not treat your coin the same way once you give it an actual use case besides speculation and there can be no guarantees as to its price once you stop those actions that made it rise in price so far.\nCentral planning or manipulation of the price system through the introduction of artificial shortages do not make sound money, no matter your intentions or the direction price takes in order to compensate for your shenanigans. Bubbles form in environments where for one reason or another demand becomes artificially great in relation to supply considering somethings actual use case. What is done to the price of an asset by forcing rapid deflation is the private equivalent of what the central banks of the world do to all other assets when they are devaluing their locally prescribed fiat currency.\nTo Quote: Objectivist philosopher Ayn Rand, a big proponent of money as a store of value,\nMoney is a tool of exchange ; it represents wealth only so long as it can be traded for material goods and services . Wealth does not grow in nature; it has to be produced by men. . .\n. . When people refuse to consider the source of wealth, what they refuse to recognize is the fact that wealth is the product of man’s intellect, of his creative ability, fully as much as is art, science, philosophy or any other human value.\nSource: The Objectivist Forum\nand\nSo you think that money is the root of all evil? . . . Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which can’t exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value . Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil?\nSource: For the New Intellectual\nAs per Satoshis design — now arguably better implemented in the form of Bitcoin Cash — bitcoins were always a store of value, because they represented the fungible results of hours of precious computer power expended to create them.\nThey clearly had value to the creator and they also clearly were fungible enough to be divisible into very small pieces and easily passed on to another wallet held by Satoshi himself or by one of his earliest friends to join him in running the network.\nThe Bitcoin design had been created as the productive response to issues of the past that all stemmed from the problem of having to trust in the reliability of a third party as mediator in any money transactions. It mitigated abusive banking policies and it used competitive market principles rather than a mint or other overseer to keep the network available to any user and drive down the cost of each transaction to the point where it could be free or mostly go completely unnoticed, which would make it usable as cash payment in e-commerce or in person.\nThere were no \"moochers\", no arbitrary price manipulation, no central entity that could not be replaced and no price tags preventing small and casual cash-like transactions of any kind.\nAny high but limited amount of inflation pressure at the time would have been mitigated by Satoshis own valuation of the importance of these attributes even before he had anyone to trade his coins with and also later when he potentially had, which is exactly how the so called \"subjective theory of value\" describes prices on a free market.\nEconomist Ludvig Von Mises, representing the Austrian School of economics and arguably the foremost influence on Rand in this area of thought, had the following to say about money in this regard\nIn the case of money, subjective use-value and subjective exchange-value coincide.\nHe also explicitly reminds us that,\nBoth are derived from objective exchange-value, for money has no utility other than that arising from the possibility of obtaining other economic goods in exchange for it.\nSource: The Theory of Money and Credit\nBut as both Mises and here below Rand are quick to point out, since this means that money is not merely meant to be passed around carelessly (at any rate, slow or fast, cheaply or expensively), the most important function of money is retaining value until it is time to do so , including of course the very moment of the exchange itself. When exactly that time is, can not be allowed to be decided by another human being or by a government-like entity that might be tempted for reasons of controlling such behavior to introduce a tax or a special fee of some kind. Money — the default method of exchange within a network of people, or a community — must still be liquid enough to allow it to be spent cheaply and easily at all times.\nMoney is the tool of men who have reached a high level of productivity and a long-range control over their lives. Money is not merely a tool of exchange: much more importantly, it is a tool of saving, which permits delayed consumption and buys time for future production. To fulfill this requirement, money has to be some material commodity which is imperishable, rare, homogeneous, easily stored, not subject to wide fluctuations of value, and always in demand among those you trade with.\nThis leads you to the decision to use gold as money. Gold money is a tangible value in itself and a token of wealth actually produced . When you accept a gold coin in payment for your goods, you actually deliver the goods to the buyer; the transaction is as safe as simple barter . When you store your savings in the form of gold coins, they represent the goods which you have actually produced and which have gone to buy time for other producers , who will keep the productive process going, so that you’ll be able to trade your coins for goods any time you wish.\nSource: Philosophy: Who Needs It\nBitcoin fits perfectly into the formula so far described and we may conclude that when it comes to its basic function as money, there is not much more to say in terms of Bitcoin qua the design described in the final edition of Satoshis paper; Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\nBut the story did not end there (a brief but still long overview of the breakdown of the Bitcoin community around Bitcoin Core) As Bitcoin was already making mainstream appearances time and time again (which it had already started to do while Satoshi was still openly in the community and working on the project), it turned out that many of the remaining developers, as well as those that would arrive later, would completely reject Satoshis views and the design he had proposed. While they likely still keep convincing themselves that they are developing Bitcoin and that their actions have been in the best interest of the project as they see it, they had and still have radically different priorities and the community that formed around them naively competed to rationalize the basis for these priorities among each other and to any newcomers. This resulted in what must carefully be described as a \"cult like\" atmosphere and lead to a number of debilitating changes in the networks protocol.\nEverything started to change. New ideas that went completely against the Bitcoin design started to be made part of the general concerns and everything from scaling, network topology, acceptable fee levels and even transaction speed and reliability were made to perform worse than they used to because of the deep ideological differences that allowed this. The economic understanding of the gradually reduced block rewards for the miners was only one of the many casualties within the community.\nAccording to design, as the tokens of CPU cycles started to spread across the world, the inflation would start to taper off and ultimately at some point in the still distant future ensure that no actively inflating parties were allowed on the network anymore; Thereby safeguarding the limit of 21 million coins and that any price being gradually established during the time of initial distribution would meet up with objective exchange value as per the users in the community and from there remain relatively stable. Then, the plan always was, fees and interest in running the network itself would be the remaining incentive already built into the system to keep it going.\nHowever soon, long before the final stage of the coin distribution which even today still has a really long way to go, developers working on the official reference software implementation that had been named \"Bitcoin Core\" no longer all expected that this would happen. In fact, not everyone agreed that the system should perform as \"cash\" at all , but instead perhaps as a \"digital gold\" or \"store of value\" that could then still be traded easily, only through other presumably still decentralized means.\nThat's how it was decided and eventually why increasing the amount of transactions on the network through a simple and safe change of a single parameter was not only considered a potentially unsustainable path to continue down in the long run, but also actually not as high a priority as other factors much less relevant to the systems function as \"cash\".\nInstead of upgrading per the only plan consisted with the original design and as suggested by Satoshi, his successor Gavin Andresen and countless others that eventually would become isolated and for various reasons themselves decide to or be forced to have their role in Bitcoin development further reduced, the block space available for such transactions was kept so low that it eventually got full. This in turn triggered an event in the self-stabilizing transaction fee parameter, the price of which would normally trend as low as it could over time by virtue of being priced in the designs own deflationary native currency and nodes choosing to keep their fees low for sake of internal competition. Now the market in fees traded steadily higher, spiking several times, and with the introduction of features that would let the users more easily increase their fees to have higher chance of being one of the lucky to transact on time, got more and more extreme. At one point it had Greg Maxwell — prominent developer of technologies that would eventually enable \"solutions\" this problem, such as the Lightning Network to be deployed as a side chain to what ought to be the main chain — supposedly celebrating the event\nPersonally, I’m pulling out the champaign that market behaviour is indeed producing activity levels that can pay for security without inflation, and also producing fee paying backlogs needed to stabilize consensus progress as the subsidy declines\nThis in turn, not only priced out all casual and cash type transactions, but also generated a lock-in effect as users could no longer sell what supposedly was still \"currency\" without loosing a significant portion of their balance or perhaps do anything at all, until the price of the \"coins\" had trended high enough to compensate for any fees. The now known risks and fees, had spread throughout the system in various ways. For example had fees to and from exchanges increased and the newly developer introduced RBF function (the one that would allow a user to increase fees, and that was wrongly argued on different occasions to have been part of the original design) made users have to wait for hours or days before their transactions were considered safe. In other words, the system was no longer the one described in the paper and behaved more like a typical bank.\nBut while Bitcoin use for casual and outward facing commerce transactions stagnated , this didn't stop the price rallies that were increasingly driven on by this fee based lack of \"liquidity\" for recent buyers waiting to sell and fears of missing out on a good investment. It can also be speculated, that not only the lock in-effect for traders looking to ride the price but the high fees on users themselves contributing to a rapid concentration in wealth amongst miners and exchanges, thereby replacing the deflation already brought on by increased difficulty and reduced block rewards with a state of hyperdeflation.\nWhile this may sound good for every bag holder on the onset, it was not so good for the small users looking to spend their coins. Their money store of value had now become more like a time locked interest paying account with a really large withdraw fee.\nIt also doesn't help at all in the long run if the bull market draws in more speculating \"adopters\", since this deflationary mode is only a temporary benefit to traders and doesn't itself necessarily bring any reliable value or relatively stable price at higher levels at all. It can just as well collapse again at any moment and lead to countless losses or just rob users of their money by not making it usable on the network anymore.\nYou would do better to compare this to \"pumping\" pretty much any currency, stock or commodity , as the goal is get more people on board before entirely without building anything that should logically attract interest in the first place.\nIn the end, the market response will be what the market response will be and you have no control over it. Now that there is Bitcoin Cash, the same is true for it. No guarantees exist or can be made that either of the two chains will remain the more successful one as compared to the other, but the market will be the ultimate arbitrator in the long run.\nTLDR: Savings and consumption go hand in hand. Bitcoins were a store of value ever since inception, even when only Satoshi were mining them. All market prices must emerge and be entertained in the market place without top down manipulation through the introduction of artificial scarcity. Pumping prices or letting the various parts of the design malfunction/be fundamentally changed to go against the rest is not sustainable and will only break the incentives model. In the long run the market is the ultimate arbitrator in all matters of money prices.\n submitted by /u/fruitsofknowledge\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T22:14:34.053+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ccc32caa9cf571b14a476cd5e9eb0b8cb0d07759", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeqQMe90ltUWW91fws4bRiDG2VMiYbLosA6bDMjV4A0QCHWPj8XQ9AOIsaWQ5lMQROXRxW8x_Hi8fvFpSmjbFBwGCNc79xTL3qK9Hr1aJ5uA--", "site_full": "alterminds.xyz", "site": "alterminds.xyz", "site_section": "http://alterminds.xyz/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Alter Minds", "title": "Bitcoin Interest Drops 90 Percent from December, Google Trends", "title_full": "Bitcoin Interest Drops 90 Percent from December, Google Trends", "published": "2018-06-05T03:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i1.wp.com/alterminds.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-Trends.jpg?fit=1179%2C541&#038;ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ccc32caa9cf571b14a476cd5e9eb0b8cb0d07759", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeqQMe90ltUWW91fws4bRiDG2VMiYbLosA6bDMjV4A0QCHWPj8XQ9AOIsaWQ5lMQROXRxW8x_Hi8fvFpSmjbFBwGCNc79xTL3qK9Hr1aJ5uA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alter Minds", "published": "2018-06-05T03:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Interest Drops 90 Percent from December, Google Trends", "text": "\nOnline searches for Bitcoin on Google Trends have taken a hit following a drop in market prices since the beginning of the year. Advertisements Bitcoin Searches Take a Nosedive\nFigures from Google Trends don’t paint a pretty picture. Mid-December searches for Bitcoin were recorded at 100 out of a scale of 100. However, fast-forward six months later and Google Trends show that number at 10, a drop of 90 percent. From January, when results were pegged at 44, the decline in interest is over 75 percent.\nNotably, the results highlight that this time last year low figures for Bitcoin searches were recorded in June as well.\nAccording to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, this drop in interest is not a good sign for crypto prices, reports CNBC.\n“We use Google Trends to track search queries for ‘bitcoin’ as a proxy for potential new buyers,” he added. “Bitcoin needs a new narrative in order to reestablish global attention.”\nSince the beginning of the year the number one digital currency has dropped in value by over 55 percent, and is currently trading at over $7,500, according to CoinMarketCap. Interestingly, while Colas admits that the company loves the idea of the cryptocurrency, he adds that his team are not fans of purchasing it at current levels.\nOthers, however, think that now is the perfect time to invest in the market.\nDan Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capital Management, a hedge fund company focused on cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, was reported at the beginning of the month as saying that Bitcoin’s value may have reached a bottom, and that now is the time to buy.\nThe founder of the San Francisco-based company said on CNBC’s ‘Fast Money‘ that ‘all cryptocurrencies are very cheap right now. It’s much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally as it goes.’ Back in April, Morehead also said that the worst could be over for the digital currency. He said then that was a good time to purchase Bitcoin, calling it a ‘screaming buy‘ when it was valued around $6,600.\nIt’s not just Bitcoin, though, that is feeling the brunt of disinterestedness from potential new traders. Google searches for other major cryptocurrencies have also declined. Ethereum is down by 85 percent since the beginning of the year; Ripple has dropped by 91 percent; and Bitcoin Cash has experienced a decline of 80 percent.

The company has been better about engaging in open-source development under current CEO Satya Nadella, but former CEO Steve Ballmer’s assertion that “Linux is cancer” still leaves a sour taste nearly two decades later.\nThe backlash was particularly pronounced in the cryptocurrency community. Though GitHub is a for-profit company, it offers a range of free services for open-source projects, and it hosts the source code for virtually every cryptocurrency protocol.\nMany people argued that the acquisition would have little impact on cryptocurrency, with a few suggesting that Microsoft may add new features that make the user experience better for developers.\nHowever, Wladimir van der Laan, the lead maintainer of the Bitcoin Core GitHub repository, stated on Twitter that the move is “the beginning of a long painful road” for the platform and that the Bitcoin project should move its source code elsewhere. Yes.No real hurry, but I expect this is the beginning of a long painful road of gh toward obsolence, possibly ending the same way as codeplex did.\n— Wladimir (@orionwl) June 4, 2018\nYes,” he replied when asked whether the Bitcoin repository should be moved to a new platform.

This may or may not speed it up.”\nOf course, controversial announcements often lead to a backlash among users, only to have some of the loudest voices fail to live up to their claims to take action. For his part, however, van der Laan said that he canceled his paid GitHub subscription and has made his personal Bitcoin git repository available through a TorV3 hidden service.\n“No longer going to pay for this when it’s just another Microsoft tax,” he said.\nFeatured Image from Flickr/Othree .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wladimir van der laan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve ballmer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "github", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satya nadella", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "github", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin core", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-05T20:15:28.090+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd1e6f5d27b0981241e7e6625a453827ffc40761", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeqQMe90ltUWW91fws4bRiYzgqZm6abjofLnQVCFxDSvjS9tPBDZWOza.3rL2ALi436IOOXKR90K5HVbLx1wDK5JQscUqWzoE-", "site_full": "alterminds.xyz", "site": "alterminds.xyz", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Bears Return in Full Swing! • Alter Minds", "title_full": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Bears Return in Full Swing! • Alter Minds", "published": "2018-06-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://i1.wp.com/alterminds.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/180605_bitcoin-1100x683.png?fit=1100%2C683&#038;ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dd1e6f5d27b0981241e7e6625a453827ffc40761", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeqQMe90ltUWW91fws4bRiYzgqZm6abjofLnQVCFxDSvjS9tPBDZWOza.3rL2ALi436IOOXKR90K5HVbLx1wDK5JQscUqWzoE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Bears Return in Full Swing! • Alter Minds", "text": "Jun 5, 2018 | Crypto | 0 comments Advertisements\nBitcoin Price Key Highlights Advertisements Bitcoin price recently broke out of a descending trend line and is pulling back for a retest. Price is at a crucial area of interest, though, and a bounce or break could determine the next long-term direction. If these support levels hold, bitcoin could bounce back to the swing high and resume the reversal.\nBitcoin price is pulling back to an area of interest after breaking above a longer-term descending trend line.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is above the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the upside. This suggests that the uptrend is more likely to resume than to reverse. However, price has fallen below the longer-term 200 SMA as an early indicator that bearish momentum is kicking in.\nRSI is indicating oversold conditions, though, so a bounce may be in order. Stochastic has already climbed out of the oversold area to show that buyers are ready to return. A larger pullback to the broken trend line closer to the 61.8% Fib may be the last line of defense for bulls, and a break below this could lead to a drop to the swing low. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin was off to a promising start for the week but it looks like bulls were unable to sustain the momentum as investor worries lingered. Not even remarks from Steve Wozniak on how bitcoin is the only digital gold were able to help. He cited:\nAll the others tend to give up some of the aspects of Bitcoin. For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control. That’s the first one they have to give up to try to have a business model.\nStill, the dollar managed to recoup its losses in the latest US session, likely on the bounce in equities.

When requested about contemporary feedback from Square and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey – who remarked right through CoinDesk’s Consensus 2018 convention in New York that he hopes bitcoin turns into the web’s “native currency” – Wozniak stated he hopes that imaginative and prescient works out.“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking,” Wozniak was once quoted as announcing through CNBC on Monday. Wozniak was once interviewed right through the Money 20/20 convention, which is happening this week in Amsterdam.

These comprise curated suites of digital assets, often based around a specific theme, that can be purchased via a single token or on a crypto exchange with a single click.\nSo far, crypto baskets have been largely geared around “entry level” tokens such as LTC and ETH. Coinbase Index Fund gives investors exposure to all assets listed on GDAX, but since these comprise various weightings of BTC, BCH, ETH, and LTC only, there’s little imagination on display. Nor is there an entry route for retail investors; you’ll need at least $250,000 to buy in. Not all basket-based services are as exclusive though. One Basket, Many Tokens\nOn Tuesday June 5, a service called Flipside Crypto released a basket that was created in conjunction with Coinmetrics.io. Its smart contracts basket of the day contained eight Proof of Work coins. At the start of each new day, a new basket is created, with each one rated according to its volatility, developer activity, and other metrics. Dailycryptobasket.com is a novel take on crypto baskets to date, and one which shows there’s scope for originality and innovation in this field. Daily Crypto Basket’s selection of themed tokens\nSet Protocol is a project that’s taking a different approach to serving up collateralized baskets of tokens. Sets of ERC20 tokens can be grouped together using smart contracts and exchanged via a single token. Then there are projects like FCTF (First Crypto Traded Fund), which aims to peg the price of 10 digital assets to a single token. It even enables token holders to profit from fees paid to a Dash masternode in theory. Set Protocol\nAs a relatively new trading option, crypto baskets have yet to prove themselves or to gain mass adoption. They also face competition from tokenized projects that enable traders to follow the profile of experienced traders and to have their trades automatically emulated, with all profits paid back in the form of yet more tokens. For now, crypto baskets are still viewed as “starter packs” best suited to new traders. With China’s Okex having just launched its OK06 Exchange-Traded Tracker, days after Huobi issued its own basket of 10 tokens, crypto investors will soon be in need of baskets to hold their baskets of tokens.\nDo you think token baskets will take off, or are they a niche product best left to novice traders?

Cloud mining service Coinmint confirmed it would press ahead with opening a Bitcoin mining plant in an abandoned smokestack in Upstate New York, CNBC reports June 5. The move, which authorities greenlighted in January, will see the company invest “up to $700 mln” in the project, which will repurpose the former 1300-acres-large Alcoa aluminium smelting plant by the end of 2019. Operations will continue under the newly-formed subsidiary North Country Data Center Corporation, which began work this week, a press release confirmed. “As long as bitcoin network exists we anticipate mining to be profitable,” Coinmint CEO Prieur Leary said quoted by CNBC, adding in the release that the subsidiary launch “is a key milestone towards the Massena site reaching its full capacity.” This year has seen multiple schemes to leverage former infrastructure in area with cheap electricity for the purposes of mining Bitcoin . Not all have struck a chord with local governments, with plans in nearby Quebec meeting with stiff criticism over the impact on local economies. “If you want to come settle here, plug in your servers and do Bitcoin mining, we’re not really interested,” the region’s Premier Philippe Couillard said in March. For politicians in Massena, the nearest town to the Alcoa plant, the project conversely represents a boon to the local workforce, as it promises to create an extra 150 jobs. “The thought of 150 jobs and revitalization of the Alcoa East Facility is exciting and what we have been working for,” Massena Town Supervisor Steve O'Shaughnessy said as part of the press release. “We are ready to provide any assistance we can to move this project to its full potential.” Post navigation ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "prieur leary", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitlyfool.com william suberg upstate new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinmint", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north country data center corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alcoa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "upstate ny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "upstate new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T21:25:48.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2028f5636ca5f12f6689738a1f15963ea8b226f2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVLvCaoUqI_pcztz1BpGhzXneonFfZj8bzr5gSAgZrkRyxvU34hEwPYB31ASF7JiOci0b_VxQz_sGE_vzB0Bkv3g--", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Twitch Streamers Can Now Tip With Four Cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Twitch Streamers Can Now Tip With Four Cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-06-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.023, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/OakenFold.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2028f5636ca5f12f6689738a1f15963ea8b226f2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVLvCaoUqI_pcztz1BpGhzXneonFfZj8bzr5gSAgZrkRyxvU34hEwPYB31ASF7JiOci0b_VxQz_sGE_vzB0Bkv3g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jamie Redman", "published": "2018-06-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Twitch Streamers Can Now Tip With Four Cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin News", "text": "3274 Twitch Streamers Can Now Tip With Four Cryptocurrencies\nUsers of the popular video game streaming application Twitch can now tip each other using a variety of cryptocurrencies.

Essentially Twitch streamers can get a Streamlabs account tied to their Coinbase account which enables crypto-infused tips with no additional fees. Streamlabs representative Tom Maneri revealed the integration on Sunday, June 4.\n“It’s time to give one of your Lambos a wash, because all Streamlabs broadcasters can now accept cryptocurrency tips,” Maneri details . In order to tip on Twitch users need to have a Coinbase and Streamlabs account. Integrating Streamlabs With Coinbase to Tip Using Twitch\nIn order to integrate cryptocurrency tipping in Twitch users need to have a Coinbase account and head to the Streamlabs ‘donation settings page’ to select the ‘Coinbase option.’ From there you need to log in, and tether your Coinbase account to the Streamlabs platform. After that, a tip page will now show up for viewers, and, just like fiat, cryptocurrency tips work with your alerts as well so you can be notified when receiving a tip. Moreover, there are no fees involved with the process minus the network fee associated with the specific cryptocurrency chosen for tipping.\n“Streamlabs does not charge a fee, but some network transaction fees may apply depending on the currency being used,” Maneri explains.\nCryptocurrency proponents are quite pleased with the tipping integration as Twitch is extremely popular gaming site that has millions of unique users and is one of the top 50 most trafficked websites in the world.\nWhat do you think about being able to tip people with cryptocurrency using the streaming video game platform Twitch?

In a recent interview with CNBC , the computer mogul admitted that he hopes bitcoin will become a single global currency and that he shares the sentiment of Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, who expressed his belief last March that bitcoin will become a unifying cryptocurrency for every nation within the next 10 years.\n“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says,” he explained, “not that I necessarily believe it’s going to happen, but because I want it to be that way.”\nWozniak first bought bitcoin when it was priced at $700, roughly $6,700 less than where it currently stands. He has since sold almost his entire stash but for one coin, admitting that he never wanted to be an investor but was only intrigued by how the cryptocurrency worked.\nHe also owns two ether (the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain platform), which he has been very complimentary toward. At a recent conference in Vienna, Wozniak praised Ethereum and said it had the potential to become “the new Apple.”\n“Ethereum interests me because it can do things and because it’s a platform,” he affirmed.\nWozniak now refers to bitcoin as “pure” and says it’s the true equivalent of digital gold.\n“Bitcoin is mathematically defined,” he explained, “there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there’s a way it’s distributed … and it’s pure and there’s no human running it, there’s no company running it, and it’s just going and going, and growing and growing, and surviving. That, to me, says something that is natural, and nature is more important than all our human conventions.”\nThis is not the first time Wozniak has been vocally positive about bitcoin. At a Money 20/20 event in Las Vegas last October, the Apple co-founder lauded the cryptocurrency and its blockchain technology as stronger and more financially sound than both gold and USD. He stated that traditional currencies are “kind of phony,” as they are widely vulnerable to inflation, and that the problem with gold is that there is no fixed supply.\n“There is a certain amount of bitcoin that can ever exist,” he continued. “Gold gets mined and mined and mined. Maybe there’s a finite amount of gold in the world, but cryptocurrency is even more mathematical and regulated, and nobody can change mathematics.”\nWozniak also called for further regulation efforts , saying they were crucial to bitcoin’s survival.\n“Regulation is an essential element to the fintech transformation happening today,” he exclaimed. “Fairness, equality and truth is the foundation for good regulation and that will lay the groundwork for good development.”\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .

That’s one thing where I think it probably still has utility, but the governments have figured that out,” he concluded.\nFeatured Image from YouTube/The Washington Oxi Day Foundation Follow us on Telegram .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jim chanos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chanos", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kynikos associates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institute for new economic thinking", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enron", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T01:32:44.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0d67eea8bd57495ea88b1b1e974486dabcf13cbf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7r8RtQPebM82s9ToFyXtms-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "title_full": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "published": "2018-06-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0d67eea8bd57495ea88b1b1e974486dabcf13cbf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7r8RtQPebM82s9ToFyXtms-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nTo get started visit ------> https://btctarget.blogspot.com/2018/04/guide-to-earn-btc-in-2018.html\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can trust us with 100%, we always pay!

Okex’s New Exchange Traded Tracker (ETT)\nOkex, the Chinese-run cryptocurrency exchange based in Hong Kong, has joined the recent trend of trading platforms creating their own ETF-like investment tools for their users. It launched its first exchange traded tracker (ETT) on June 5, which was fully sold out within just three minutes. It includes six coins (BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, EOS, and OKB) and requires USDT to subscribe. The minimum subscription for the instruments is 100 units.\nA couple of days ago, we reported that Huobi, the Singapore-headquartered exchange, has decided to create its own ETF style instrument based on an index of ten assets. Bitoasis Resumes Dirham Transactions\nLast month, Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitoasis enacted a suspension of deposits and withdrawals in UAE dirhams. This Monday, without explaining what was the cause of the issue, the company announced that transactions are reinstated. In a letter to its clients, quoted by Arabian Business , Bitoasis apologized for the inconvenience and said that now “users can deposit and withdraw their funds in AED as usual, without any interruption.”\n“In light of the recent inconsistency of service across our payment options, we will be revising and updating the options available to our customers on the platform to ensure continuity of our services,” the Bitoasis statement continued. “We will be notifying our customers with the update on our new payment options soon.” Myetherwallet Attack Blamed on Russian Hackers, Uneducated Users\nMyetherwallet (MEW), the web’s most popular client-side ethereum wallet, has been compromised by a DNS attack on April 24, 2018. Today the team behind the wallet issued a response to the event, further explaining what happened and detailing the steps taken to prevent its reoccurrence.\nThey say that the attack was carried out by a native Russian speaker, which was able to phish only about $150,000 worth of ether from MEW users. They quote Internet Security experts as explaining that the “financial resources required for such an attack likely exceeds the amount of funds taken.”\nThe team added that it is a lack of safety education that led some clients to fall for the fraud. “We hope that from this experience, every single person who interacts with cryptocurrencies and the blockchain will understand how important self-education is.
