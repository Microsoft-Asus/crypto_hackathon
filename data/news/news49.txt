If the upward movement of bitcoin fades and the dominant cryptocurrency is unable to bounce back quickly to the higher end of $7,700, a bleed out to the $6,000 region can be expected. Conditional Rally\nThe corrective rally from $7,040 to $7,700 sparked significant optimism, especially amongst short-term bulls that have predicted the price of bitcoin would rebound back to the $10,000 region within June. While the $10,000 June target is still in play, another correction in the upcoming days will likely occur, given that the corrective rally from $7,040 has stopped at $7,700 and BTC has declined to $7,600.\nA short-term break out to the $8,000 region supported by the corrective rally from $7,040 was conditional, as it required the volume of BTC to spike and the cryptocurrency to sustain momentum at its weekly peak, in the $7,700 region.\nHowever, due to its low trading volume, BTC has failed to test a major short-term support level at $8,000 and fell to $7,600. A drop to $7,500 could result in BTC experiencing yet another minor correction, potentially to the higher end of $6,000.\nWhile the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of BTC is 43.3, it is not demonstrating an oversold condition for BTC. A further drop in BTC would not lead the RSI to drop by large margins and thus, a short-term turn around back to the $7,700 mark if BTC falls to $7,500 is unlikely.\nThe daily candle on June 4 was supposed to be the big short-term break for BTC, rising above the one-month descending trendline from May 6 and effectively establishing a bottom at $7,040. But, the recent decline in the price of BTC will likely send BTC back to the lower end of $7,000 or in worst case scenario, to the $6,000 region. Short-Term Not Important\nDespite the negative price trend of BTC, most multi-billion dollar hedge funds are still extremely optimistic in BTC and the entire cryptocurrency market.\nThe expected decline in the price of BTC is a 5 to 10 percent drop maximum, which could extend to 15 percent at its worst. But, as Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead stated, which oversees more than a billion dollars in cryptocurrencies and digital assets, hedge funds look at the 5 to 10-year trend of the market.\nIn the mid to long-term, Morehead stated that bitcoin is still a screaming buy, adding:\n“As digital tokens continue to multiply and gain wider use, the $400 billion crypto market could balloon to $4 trillion, and even $40 trillion is definitely possible. It’s the 10-year forecast.”\nIf BTC recovers gradually from the $6,000 to $7,000 region and establish major support levels with strong and volume in the upcoming months, the $20,000 to $50,000 BTC targets of large-scale investors can still be in play.\nOften, tokens enjoy a surge in volume and price when the price of BTC is increasing gradually and volume of the cryptocurrency market picks up. If BTC enters the $7,500 region, it is likely that tokens will experience a substantial drop in value, once again.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T15:45:03.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ba6ee3442115d320b4a8856cd28bc2ab9e847ced", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_pozj1Z8NU88Qzypaqq3fGO3u9Uy6T5oDI0tGi9RUCFUWPhza7JPUxYDaDQkJxlqwQckHOEem0b5QVfWvhMEi5SM1", "site_full": "investorshub.advfn.com", "site": "advfn.com", "site_section": "http://investorshub.advfn.com/Bitcoin-Invt-GBTC-29559/", "site_categories": ["investing", "stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Invt.

The move was finally made possible yesterday.\nThis latest development is as a result of the partnership between Brisbane Airport and TravelByBit, which is an Australian startup that is working on developing payment platforms that will help travelers pay for trips using Bitcoin and other digital currencies.\nWith this latest development, Bitcoin would be used in the 30 retail stores in the airport, with other cryptocurrencies also to be used for payment of goods and services. The co-founder of TravelbyBit and its current CEO, Caleb Yeoh, while commenting on this latest development stated that this is just the start for the company.\nHe added;\nWe did a test for two weeks and we launched it last week. We’re gradually rolling it out. More are coming, we just need time to train up the staff.\nThe announcement brought about excitement in the cryptocurrency world, with the official Twitter account of NEM, tweeting that its currency XEM has been listed as one of the coins to be accepted at Jason Lee at Forte Cafe in Brisbane Airport.

Kudos to @TravelbyBit ! pic.twitter.com/0JwjOnQesi\n— NEM (@NEMofficial) June 4, 2018\nWhile explaining their company objective, Yeoh revealed that the payment systems they designed are easy to use and most importantly, it fosters trust between the retailers and their customers. He added that;\nWe’re just trying to build a real-world use case for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is perfect for travel, there’s no exchange rate issues or risk of credit card fraud.\nThe Bitcoin price like the general cryptocurrency market has dipped since achieving its all-time high in December 2017, having lost over 60% of its peak value. The market has recovered a bit this weekend with the Bitcoin price trading around the $7,700 region.

Instead, there is a complex mathematical and cryptographic underpinning to the blockchain, the technology that underlies bitcoin. The bitcoin network is maintained by a number of players and that is why it is often referred to as decentralized.\nWozniak founded Apple with Steve Jobs in 1976 and was behind the launch of the company's first personal computers. He spoke to CNBC at an event at the Money 20/20 conference in Amsterdam, Netherlands, hosted by Feedzai.\nThere are now over 1,000 cryptocurrencies in existence, but Wozniak said that bitcoin is the only one that remains \"pure\" because others have had to give up some of the aspects that makes bitcoin what it is, such as decentralization.\n\"Only bitcoin is pure digital gold… and I totally buy into that. All the others tend to give up some of the aspects of bitcoin. For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control.

Unlike many of the new startups creating their own blockchains, Hodl Hodl is doing these complex transactions on the bitcoin blockchain, countering the narrative that bitcoin is only good as a store of value.\nThe exchange platform debuted in March, and within weeks it garnered more than 5,300 registered users in over 30 countries, all transacting directly through either the bitcoin or litecoin blockchain by using what’s known as a multi-signature smart contract.\nHodl Hodl never touches bitcoin deposits or traditional fiat payments. Rather, it simply provides listings for people to connect, plus an interface to help users apply smart contracts directly to bitcoin.\nThose contracts rely on multisig wallets, where one key belongs to the exchange and the other to the seller. The seller’s keys are generated on the front end, in the browser, never stored on the company’s server or database.\nBecause of that setup, Hodl Hodl CTO Roman Snitko said:\n“Even if the exchange is hacked, the hacker only gets access to one key, whereas the other belongs to the user and the funds cannot be moved.”\nThis paved the way for a disparate real estate platform by the same team, called Househodl, which is set to launch in July with similar multisig contracts in lieu of the banks and lawyers who typically hold funds in escrow.\n“It’s better than dealing with banks and being unreasonably scrutinized time and again for every penny, even though your money is clean,” Snitko told CoinDesk.\nThis underscores the reasons why Snitko and CEO Max Keidun chose to work directly with the bitcoin blockchain rather than build a platform in parallel. They wanted a simple solution that didn’t require the startup to take on all the compliance responsibilities of a bank, the way some might argue exchanges like Coinbase have.\nHodl Hodl’s private key is useless by itself – a relief to traders spooked by the long history of multimillion-dollar thefts of user funds held at traditional crypto exchanges. Their verification process varies by jurisdiction, staying as hands-off as they can be within local regulations, to give users more responsibility and freedom. Unlike Coinbase, Hodl Hodl gives users their own private key.\n“No single party controls the funds on that address,” Snitko said. “That, in turn, means increased security, but also that we’re not exactly a money transmitter from a regulatory point of view.”\nBy coupling compliance with decentralized security features, the Hodl Hodl team strives to show that bitcoin itself can also be leveraged for peer-to-peer business transactions. The team’s upcoming platform, Househodl, will take that idea even further by applying it directly to real estate purchases.\n“Because it’s safer,” Snitko said about why they chose bitcoin. “I do think it is the only secure, decentralized blockchain that stood the test of time.” Bitcoin’s security perks\nFirst and foremost, Hodl Hodl’s interest in bitcoin derives from its security.\nAccording to the founders, it’s much harder for intermediaries to misappropriate money frozen in this transparent, multi-sig escrow process, because no one has complete custody and all the parties involved can look at the blockchain to see what’s going on.\nAs such, multisig on a public ledger represents an upgrade to the centuries-old practice of depositing funds with a third party until a future condition is met.\nApplying this exchange’s smart contract to real estate first occurred to the Hodl Hodl team when a friend tried to sell her apartment to buy more bitcoin. The transaction took months because there were numerous bureaucratic intermediaries, from bankers to real estate agents.\nSnitko said:\n“It’s a whole mess that could be avoided if there was a platform for selling and buying real estate with bitcoin. That’s when we realized there is a demand on both sides of the equation.”\nThe team realized the a multisig process in Hodl Hodl’s flagship business could also offer a more transparent escrow system for buying property with bitcoin. Such transparency is lacking in traditional escrow processes, a situation often exploited by the intermediaries buyers trust the most.\nFor example, according to the New York Law Journal, the Lawyers’ Fund for Client Protection paid $10 million in 2017 to victims of lawyer misconduct that included the theft of escrow funds. In March of this year, another New York attorney was disbarred for hiding client funds in his personal escrow account, veiled behind the trappings of bank paperwork.\nEven if such conduct is rare today, the fact that it can happen suggest that there’s room for improvements that reduce reliance on trusted third parties. “I think real estate is the best use case for bitcoin payments right now,” Snitko added, “Because it’s relatively huge amounts of BTC that are being transferred so even if transaction fees go up, they would still make sense.” On-chain advantages\nUnlike the flagship exchange’s pure P2P model, Househodl contracts will require a third cryptographic key held by a neutral third party, such as a lawyer, plus more paperwork and identification than online currency swaps on Hodl Hodl.\nFunds only move if everyone cooperates, which would prevent the type of lawyer misconduct seen in New York. Yet, all of this still happens directly on the bitcoin blockchain, thanks to the exchange-tested workflow.\n“You will even be able to sign all the papers remotely on our [Househodl] platform, a one-stop-shop,” Keidun told CoinDesk.\nSeveral American real estate agents have already expressed interest in signing up for Househodl, Keidun said. But, due to the unclear regulatory landscape in the U.S., Househodl will probably launch in blockchain-friendly Dubai first, then steadily expand to Europe and North America.\nIn the meantime, new confidential trading options might give Keidun’s small startups a competitive advantage over other P2P platforms, both exchanges and blockchain startups in the real estate industry.\nMany P2P platforms broadcast all live offers to all participants, the same way CraigsList organizes listings by category. So Hodl Hodl allows private offers, which are only visible if the seller sends a direct link to the buyer, or vice versa. This is one advantage Hodl Hodl has over its competitors. And the users don’t even need to sacrifice transparency for privacy, since the transactions are still on-chain, it’s just that they aren’t broadcasting the details a stranger would need to find them.\nIn addition, neither Hodl platform requires the user to cash out, the way incumbent P2P exchange LocalBitcoins does. Yet again, that points back to the fact that the escrow takes place on the blockchain itself.\n“That’s one difference we have from LocalBitcoins, where your funds are essentially held on LocalBitcoins,” Snitko told CoinDesk.\nCome summertime, Househodl will also offer such private listings for buying or selling real estate directly with cryptocurrency.\n“The idea is that you don’t need to cash out into a fiat currency to buy property,” Snitko said, touching on the broader issue of balancing compliance with the bitcoin community’s cypherpunk ethos by adding:\n“The most important challenge, I think, is to guarantee that the purchase is 100 percent legal and there are no legal loopholes to exploit.”\nKeys image via Shutterstock\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

As electricity is heavily-subsidized in the country, many Venezuelans have turned to crypto mining to survive the country’s disastrous hyperinflation. Venezuela’s fiat currency has become nearly worthless, currently trading for around 6 bolivars to a single satoshi.\nMajor Chinese exchange, Huobi, announced that it’ll be launching a cryptocurrency ETF, or Exchange Traded Fund. The fund, named HB10, will allow retail investors to purchase a basket of the top 10 major cryptos, weighted by market cap and liquidity.\nFollowing Binance’s lead in relocating to Malta, Polish exchange, BitBay, announced that they’ll also be moving their operations to the crypto-friendly island nation. The move follows problems for BitBay with uncooperative Polish banks.\nThe International Monetary Fund has responded to the rise of cryptocurrencies by urging central banks around the world to improve their fiat currencies in order to remain competitive with crypto. The IMF report, released this week, is sub-titled “Crypto assets may one day reduce demand for central bank money.”\nThat’s what happened this week in Bitcoin. See you next week.

Jun 4, 2018\nThe bearish market mauled cryptocurrencies last month, with all the coins in the top 15 reflecting double-digit losses. Market sentiment also was at an all-time low, as the crypto-community turned to memes for emotional support when the market went down.\nNot even mainnet launches could turn the tables for Tron [TRX]; EOS maybe partially. They registered losses over the month as well, as the bearish market trapped all cryptos in quicksand. All top coins ranked by the percentage of their losses are: Cardano [ADA]:\nCardano’s ADA token took the biggest hit last month, starting off the month at the value of $0.37 and dropping to a low of $0.22, where it is currently trading. This represents a loss of a whopping 40.5%! This undoubtedly puts ADA at the position of biggest loser in the market this month.\nOver the last month, Cardano released a paper wallet with an offline storage feature. The announcement came right after the launch of their first testnet on 28 th of May. It also saw a listing on Cryptopia and a partnership with Metaps . However, all the good news could not stop the coin from falling as it did. Bitcoin Private [BTCP]:\nNot as prominent as other coins on this list, this coin is in the center of attention after multiple endorsements by influencers . However, this was not enough to save it from a nosedive, as it saw the second largest loss this month.\nStarting the month off at $39.27, it reached a high of $47.35. It is currently trading at around $21.45, which marks a loss of 37.7%. The announcement of various positive news could not help its case.\nNear the beginning of the last month, it was listed on HitBTC . The developer team also announced shortly that they will begin phase one of beta testing for their merchant platform. This coincided with their release of a full node wallet . Farther along, the website crypto51.app specified that the coin was at a high risk of 51% attack , with a cost of just $778 to attack the coin. Neo [NEO]:\nTouted as the next Ethereum, Neo rests comfortably in the position of the third biggest loser this month. While it started the month off at $84.28, hitting a high of $89.29, it is currently trading at $55.87. This comes out to a loss of 33.7%.\nIts case was not helped by the news, as a security vulnerability was discovered in the network’s NEP5 protocol last month. There was also news of the NEO Foundation co-founding a Joint Task Force along with Ontology Foundation , and of a NEO based exchange integrating Ledger devices just yesterday. Dash [DASH]:\nDash’s token took a huge hit in the market over the last month, with a 32.8% loss over that time. It started trading last month at around $482.41 and is currently trading at $324. It hit a high of $520 this month.\nDash had a rough month, as it was one of the coins recommended for delisting by Japan’s Financial Services Agency in May. This was followed by the coin being delisted from Tokyo’s Coincheck and South Korea’s largest exchange platform Korbit in quick succession. However, a light seemed to burn on the horizon for Dash, as it saw a partnership with Rewards.com . Monero [XMR]:\nThis privacy coin is in the same boat as Dash, as it saw a drop of 31.3% over the last month. It was trading at $245 at the beginning of the month and saw a high of $257. It is currently trading at around the $168 mark.\nMonero also saw a delisting on Coincheck and Korbit , due to its privacy properties. Also on the exchange side of things, Monero was replaced on Changelly by Monero Original, a fork of the coin. Changelly restored XMR trading soon after and said the delisting was only for preparation of the fork.\nThe XRM wallet also received updates for enhanced community interaction. It also introduced features for better security. Stellar Lumens [XLM]:\nLumens did not deliver a stellar performance last month, with a 30.2% drop in value. It was trading at the $0.43 mark at the beginning of last month, reaching a high of $0.44 soon after. It is currently trading at $0.30, a marked decrease in price.\nThe coin had nothing but good news this month, as news of announcements, listings and events poured in. First on the list was new exchange CoinbitGlobal, which listed Lumens as one of the coins available at launch. deVere Group also listed Lumens as a coin due to growing demand by investors. USA’s premier stock exchange NASDAQ added support for Stellar’s token to be traded on their platform. Binance also added a new XLM-USDT pair.\nIBM’s partnership with Lumens was also emphasized on as Jesse Lund, Head of Blockchain at IBM, said that it has “never been stronger”. The blockchain grew bigger, as 300k new users were found to have started utilizing the blockchain in the span of 6 months.\nStellar engaged in community development, announcing the 7 th Stellar Build Challenge to engage community developers. It also partnered with SatoshiPay to offer 100k coins as free credits. Ripple [XRP]:\nRipple’s famed XRP token, resting at the 3 rd position by overall market cap has come in the middle of the pack for drops in value this month. The token had a strong start at the beginning of May, trading at $0.81 and reaching a high $0.91 over the month. The coin is currently trading at $0.62, resulting in a 27.02% drop in price over the month.\nThe software behind the XRP Ledger saw development as the finished product was released after almost 6 years of development. The official announcement came after teasing it on Twitter and changing the version number on GitHub.\nxRapid saw positive results from consumers who used the product to perform pilots. They were to test the cross-border transactions that Ripple processed with 60-70% savings. Companies were “delighted” and called the technology a “game changer”.\nRipple saw listings on CoinbitGlobal exchang e, Coinome , and Uphold , along with full support on the Revolut platform. London’s premier trading institution LMAX also added XRP as a coin on the exchange. Japan’s SBI Group launched a trading exchange for cryptocurrencies, where XRP is rumored to be the base pair for all coins.\nIt also saw mainstream recognition when Ashton Kutcher donated $4 million to charity on the “ Ellen DeGeneres Show ”. EToro performed a survey that showed that investors preferred Ripple’s token overall coins. Bitcoin Cash [BCH]:\nControversial Bitcoin fork Bitcoin Cash was one of the most stable coins this month, but still saw a gradual depreciation in value. It was trading at $1471 at the beginning of last month and is currently trading at $1088. Even as it reached a high of $1832, it still reflected a loss of 26.03%.\nThe Bitcoin Cash coin underwent a hard fork on May 15 th , in order to increase the block size from 8 MB to 32 MB. There were a variety of applications made available after the fork, such as Memo.cash , Handcash and Bitek .\ndeVere group listed Bitcoin Cash as one of the cryptos for trading, while Gemini exchange also added the coin, with exchange BL3P removing the coin from its platform. Tron [TRX]:\nThis was a big month for Tron, but the event failed to transition into the price as it fell a solid 25% in value over May. It was trading at $0.08 at the beginning of the month and went down to a price of $0.06 after reaching a high of $0.09.\nThe mainnet for Tron launched on May 31 st , with all materials being submitted to Github on the day. This translated to a slew of exchanges adding support for the exchange. Binance , Zebpay , Coinnest, Cryptopia, Bitbns, and OKEx were just some of the exchanges that announced support.\nTRON Foundation released a redesigned website , and also launched the Tron Virtual Machine . They acquired BitTorrent as one of Tron’s “pillars”. Tron offered $100k as bug bounty for the mainnet, quickly upping it to a whopping $10 million! VeChain:\nVeChain’s token saw a 22.7% drop over the month, from a price of $4.93 down to today’s $3.81. It reached a high of $5.60 over the month.\nThe VeChain platform rebranded to ‘VeChainThor’ last month. The trading platform BitMark added support for the trading of VeChain tokens. Indian platform Zebpay allowed for the trading of the token as well. VeChain also partnered with Bright Food , a famous Chinese national food brand.\nThey released their upgraded whitepaper and development plan. They also collaborated with SlowMist and other third-party firms to enhance the security of their blockchain. EOS [EOS]:\nAnother coin which announced its mainnet migration for this month, EOS saw a 19.01% drop in value over the month. While it is one of the five coins this month that lost less than 20% in value over the month, it still dropped from almost $18 to its current price of $14.57.\nIt saw the last week dotted with security concerns , with a team from Qihoo 360 discovering serious vulnerabilities in the code of the blockchain. Millions worth of EOS was stolen from investors as block.one became the victim of a scam.\nZebpay, Bitbns, KuCoin, Kraken and Bithumb were some of the exchanges that supported the mainnet swap . Litecoin [LTC]:\nThe OG Bitcoin fork, Litecoin, has seen a performance that is the best it can do in a bearish market. As the currency with the 4 th lowest losses, Litecoin saw a drop from $151 to $123, which reflects a drop of just 18.54%.\nLitecoin saw support for native transactions added on exchange platform Abra and Gemini Exchange added Litecoin for trading. Prominent exchange platform NASDAQ also added support for the coin .\niPayment Inc. also added support for payments through Litecoin, while it boasted added security in the form of increased hashpower. Litecoin partnered with TapJets , SurfAir and VRPorn to increase usage. Ethereum [ETH]:\nEthereum’s price this month did not offer any surprises to investors. With a passable depreciation of 17.7% over the month, investors had nothing to say about the project that changed the blockchain. From a price of $723 at the beginning of last month, ETH has depreciated to $595. This is after it reached a high of $831 over the last month.\nEthereum ranked highest in China’s ranking scales for cryptocurrencies and their accompanying blockchains last month. Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin was offered a job at Google to work on their secret blockchain project.\nReal estate service provider Propy added support for individuals to buy houses using Ethereum last week. There was a development of games on the Ethereum blockchain. Bitcoin [BTC]:\nBitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, stayed strong this month with almost the least amount lost in top cryptocurrencies. The coin started off strong with $9199 at the beginning of May, going up to a high of $9917 and currently trading at $7655. This marks a 16.7% depreciation in value.\nBitcoin’s month was plagued with rumors of sell-offs, as Mt. Gox moved 8200 BTC from cold wallets . It also marked the move of institutional investors into the market, as Goldman Sachs started offering Bitcoin futures for trade. Taxes can also be paid through Bitcoin, said an announcement earlier today.\nConcerns over the blockchain’s electricity consumption increased, as a study confirmed that it consumes as much electricity as Ireland does in a year. It failed to see an increase after Consensus and Fundstrat’s Tom Lee clarified why. Bittrex added support for Bitcoin to be bought with USD.\nGerman authorities and Scotland Yard confiscated Bitcoin during this month. IOTA [MIOTA]:\nThe surprise underdog remained the most resilient to the bearish market, with the lowest losses this month. IOTA reflected a 14.7% decline in its price, after dropping from $2.24 to $1.91. It reached a high of $2.66 over the month.\nIOTA entered into a partnership with Porsche for Startup Autobahn. It also has a collaboration in the works for Kontakt.io . It released its mobile wallet known as Trinity Mobile Beta .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cardano", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ada", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T17:04:58.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ad473208a2ac4b2169b66d5cab5b506be4faee6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRfy4UHGN1lvmIX5q11IOR4p0eSmXe6PTsB77erYT2CTXleFVpqByp2.mYh6fFfRD94ahqg2WRFQVImzxeAcOZSaW5khiIjaGZ6Ha0C0uqEUIih5DSxXqWVsqJNoGrnxBw-", "site_full": "www.exchangerates.org.uk", "site": "exchangerates.org.uk", "site_section": "http://www.exchangerates.org.uk/news/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Exchange Rates UK - Currency News", "title": "Bitcoin dominance grows as alt-coins fall out of favour", "title_full": "Bitcoin dominance grows as alt-coins fall out of favour", "published": "2018-06-04T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 39881, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1ad473208a2ac4b2169b66d5cab5b506be4faee6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRfy4UHGN1lvmIX5q11IOR4p0eSmXe6PTsB77erYT2CTXleFVpqByp2.mYh6fFfRD94ahqg2WRFQVImzxeAcOZSaW5khiIjaGZ6Ha0C0uqEUIih5DSxXqWVsqJNoGrnxBw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "François Auré", "published": "2018-06-04T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin dominance grows as alt-coins fall out of favour", "text": "Bitcoin Dominance Grows As Alt-coins Fall Out Of Favour Bitcoin Dominance Grows As Alt-coins Fall Out Of Favour Facebook BTC/USD bulls refuse to give up\nThe price of Bitcoin continues to put hand over hand in as it attempts to claw itself out of the hole it has been in around $7000.\nA constructive performance over the weekend now sees the major cryptocurrency approaching $7700, almost within touching distance of the $8000 handle which might provide a little relief it could be meaningfully breached.\nIn the absence of any new fundamental news, cryptocurrency markets are perhaps focusing more obsessively on the technical picture and thus by holding around $7000 it is an encouraging indication that maybe a short-term bottom has formed in the marketplace.\nOf course in the famously slippy and illiquid crypto-markets, the dangers of a succession of big sell orders coming in and invalidating support is always possible, but there is no question that daylight away from major levels is always good news. Bitcoin dominating Alts in Crypto risk off markets\nThere is no question that Bitcoin tends to outperform Altcoins in periods of market stress as the less liquid and more volatile smaller cap coins find their long positions liquidated back into BTC. Given the troubled performance of most major altcoins this year, it is not surprising that Omkar Godbole was reporting the rising dominance of BTC over the weekend, as it continues to rise back towards 50% of the market cap,\n“Meanwhile, the bitcoin dominance rate, an indicator that tracks the percent of the total cryptocurrency market cap contributed by bitcoin, rose from 35.86 percent (May 6 low) to 40 percent, signalling a possible rotation of money out of alternative cryptocurrencies and into bitcoin.”\nIn Mr. Godbole’s view, the rotating out of Alt’s should be confirmed if you look at BTC/USD’s performance on the crypto leaderboard,\n“The argument has merit, as BTC ranked 18th on the list of losers among top 25 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, meaning it outperformed most of the big names.”\nIt remains to be seen if the bounce in prices will be enough to attract some increased speculation as Bitcoin markets have been lacking volume recently. If the bulls are set to jump back in and crypto-twitter is right that we are set for a new bull trend to fresh highs then perhaps Bitcoin is going to be grabbing headlines again as interest on the newswires appears to be bottoming out again.

The only thing it is good for is money laundry, drugs, terrorism etc. As Andreas Antonopoulos says, then Bitcoin would not be real money, if it could not be used for those purposes. Real money can be used in general. Surprise.\nGuess what is still the biggest currency used for those illegal activities? Normal fiat currencies.\nBitcoin can bring so much more positive to the world than negative. I have always felt that, but recently I got involved with a project, where a specific use case stared me right in the face.\nhttps://mathbot.com (still very early stage) is a website, where kids and adults from anywhere around the world can go and learn math and programming. This is done by programming a robot to solve first very simple tasks to increasingly more complicated tasks. It is a game. It is fun. This is free for everyone and will no doubt have a positive impact on the world. Where does Bitcoin come in?\nIf parents wants to incentivize kids, they can pay any amount they like and feel is sufficient and then the kid will earn back 90 percent of that amount at each level they pass. This carrot might go a long way in the industrialized world, where kids have a lot of choices of things to do and games to play, which can be hard to compete with for an educational game. Enter Bitcoin .\nIf this payment from parents to the open source organisation was with credit cards, then charge back fraud would absolutely finish off the project financially. Bitcoin is non-reversible transactions and thereby enables this project to exist and finance the development of a game that hopefully will have a lot of positive impact in this world.\nAlready it is a huge advantage for merchants to receive non-reversible transaction, but it is the first time, where I have seen that a positive impact project would otherwise not even have been possible. Thanks to Satoshi for making this a better world!\nThe end.\nNo need to read any further, the rest is just personal.\nWhen I was a kid my grandfather offered me that for each multiplication table I would learn, he would pay me 20 Danish Krones. At the time (before money printing inflation) that was a good amount for a young boy. So my sister would teach me and I would rehearse and then go for the test. I loved it. I learned the multiplication tables and made a buck at the same time. If a financial incentive can work for me, it will also work for other. Maybe not all, but for some. I am pretty optimistic about that.\nI was bored in kindergarden and wanted to start in school one year earlier than what the law prescribed. So I convinced my parents to go talk to the school and to convince them to let a motivated kid start earlier. I was naturally told that certainly NOT was going to be the case. I had to start at the same age as everyone else. Somebody wants to learn and you squash it? How dare you!?\nAt least if someone could have given me Mathbot, then I could just have learning math and programming. And you know what, by the time I started school I could be helping the teacher, because there is no one holding you back saying that you can only learn one year of math per year. Scary thought right? I could have progressed to high level math before starting school. Why don't we offer this opportunity to our kids?\nGoing through 1st to 9th grade in Denmark, they were not allowed to do split education. I was not challenged enough so by the time I reached high school math all of a sudden went from super easy to pretty hard. I wish I could constantly have been challenged at the level where I was. This is another problem that Mathbot solves.\nBut hey, it is free to play, why don't you test it out and let us know if there are any bugs still to be fixed. We might just all learn something 😉\nThe post Positive Bitcoin Use Case Otherwise Not Possible appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andreas antonopoulos", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "mathbot", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T09:52:28.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9bf5b18e86067a5b02c0312a25a9476f022daa63", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdDfw8jFYOoM5AFzghx1Fa4-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "What do Altcoins offer that Bitcoin does not?", "title_full": "What do Altcoins offer that Bitcoin does not?", "published": "2018-06-04T09:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9bf5b18e86067a5b02c0312a25a9476f022daa63", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdDfw8jFYOoM5AFzghx1Fa4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Raiden0729", "published": "2018-06-04T09:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "What do Altcoins offer that Bitcoin does not?", "text": "Quote: from: ashley_49 on June 03, 2018, 11:43:52 PM Actually new investors cannot decide about where to invest as they are new here and the market is full of numerous coins but not all are good.

We are used to hearing stories about established men from the legacy system telling us how terrible Bitcoin is for the world. The only thing it is good for is money laundry, drugs, terrorism etc. As Andreas Antonopoulos says, then Bitcoin would not be real money, if it could not be used for those purposes. Real money can be used in general. Surprise. Guess what is still the biggest currency used for those illegal activities? Normal fiat currencies. Bitcoin can bring so much more positive to the world than negative. I have always felt that, but recently I got involved with a project, where a specific use case stared me right in the face. https://mathbot.com (still very early stage) is a website, where kids and adults from anywhere around the world can go and learn math and programming. This is done by programming a robot to solve first very simple tasks to increasingly more complicated tasks. It is a game. It is fun. This is free for everyone and will no doubt have a positive impact on the world. Where does Bitcoin come in? If parents wants to incentivize kids, they can pay any amount they like and feel is sufficient and then the kid will earn back 90 percent of that amount at each level they pass. This carrot might go a long way in the industrialized world, where kids have a lot of choices of things to do and games to play, which can be hard to compete with for an educational game. Enter Bitcoin . If this payment from parents to the open source organisation was with credit cards, then charge back fraud would absolutely finish off the project financially. Bitcoin is non-reversible transactions and thereby enables this project to exist and finance the development of a game that hopefully will have a lot of positive impact in this world. Already it is a huge advantage for merchants to receive non-reversible transaction, but it is the first time, where I have seen that a positive impact project would otherwise not even have been possible. Thanks to Satoshi for making this a better world! The end. No need to read any further, the rest is just personal. When I was a kid my grandfather offered me that for each multiplication table I would learn, he would pay me 20 Danish Krones. At the time (before money printing inflation) that was a good amount for a young boy. So my sister would teach me and I would rehearse and then go for the test. I loved it. I learned the multiplication tables and made a buck at the same time. If a financial incentive can work for me, it will also work for other. Maybe not all, but for some. I am pretty optimistic about that. I was bored in kindergarden and wanted to start in school one year earlier than what the law prescribed. So I convinced my parents to go talk to the school and to convince them to let a motivated kid start earlier. I was naturally told that certainly NOT was going to be the case. I had to start at the same age as everyone else. Somebody wants to learn and you squash it? How dare you!? At least if someone could have given me Mathbot, then I could just have learning math and programming. And you know what, by the time I started school I could be helping the teacher, because there is no one holding you back saying that you can only learn one year of math per year. Scary thought right? I could have progressed to high level math before starting school. Why don’t we offer this opportunity to our kids? Going through 1st to 9th grade in Denmark, they were not allowed to do split education.

Before app stores became common, the APIs enabled Facebook to strike data-sharing partnerships with at least 60 device makers, including Apple, Amazon, BlackBerry, Microsoft and Samsung, that allowed them to offer Facebook features, such as messaging, address books and the like button, to their users. But they may have given access to more data than assumed, says the article. New York Times reporters Gabriel J.X. Dance, Nicholas Confessore and Michael LaForgia write that “the partnerships, whose scope has not been previously reported, raise concerns about the company’s privacy protections,” as well as its compliance with a consent decree it struck with the Federal Trade Commission in 2011 . The FTC is currently investigating Facebook’s privacy practices in light of the Cambridge Analytica data misuse scandal . “Facebook allowed the device companies access to the data of users’ friends without their explicit consent, even after declaring that it would no longer share such information with outsiders,” the New York Times story says. “Some device makers could retrieve personal information even from users’ friends who believed they had barred any sharing, The New York Times found.” Facebook said in April it would begin winding down access to its device-integrated APIs, but the New York Times says that many of those partnerships are still in effect. Facebook is already under intense scrutiny by lawmakers and regulators, including the FTC, because of the Cambridge Analytica revelation, which raised serious concerns about the public APIs used by third-party developers and the company’s data-sharing policies. “In the furor that followed, Facebook’s leaders said that the kind of access exploited by Cambridge in 2014 was cut off by the next year, when Facebook prohibited developers from collecting information from users’ friends,” the New York Times says. “But the company officials did not disclose that Facebook had exempted the makers of cellphones, tablets and other hardware from such restrictions.” Facebook told the New York Times that data sharing through device-integrated APIs adhered to its privacy policies and the 2011 FTC agreement.

Pay attention to market ROTATION or EXTENDING CYCLE mode MARKET IS DOING ONE OF TWO THINGS ALL THE TIME: EXTENDING or ROTATING and More importantly practice practice practice.... reason for practice.... you must build your own system within the system ( market profile) , why? cause everyone perceives things differently. its called thought process Trade market that has big ranges ranges trade fx 2 to 3 days swings trade sp500 futures intraday at the US equity open only Trade using market profile. you will begin to notice and i repeat, you will begin notice market movement interacting with your system and based on that you start adjusting little by little on your own. Keep in mind that money management and fundamentals are very important and not very hard. get that concept under your belly first then start taking trades at the opens. Look for 3 to 4 days of trending ( extending mode) , and go opposite (ROTATION) based on market profile number alignment ( back to Mean mode).\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T08:39:29.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "36ce6ce529c0d1891400cfb8649041139ebf17e5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0VzzCN3om0EA3FN7YLhZndMtU-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-04T08:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "36ce6ce529c0d1891400cfb8649041139ebf17e5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0VzzCN3om0EA3FN7YLhZndMtU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-04T08:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ June 4, 2018 NEWS Bitcoin price analysis: BTC/USD stays below $7700, short-term momentum waning FXStreet Bitcoin is trading a $7,650, off the intraday high registered at $7,755.

This announcement has hit the market right when all the coins seem to be hitting the bull market again.\nThe interview begins with the discussion of Bitek, a BCH to Colombian converter which is when Roger Ver makes the announcement of Bitcoin Cash hitting convenience stores in Japan. He says:\n“I didn’t post it or talk about it publically yet but we just had a meeting over this week; Bitcoin Cash is coming to tens of thousands of convenient stores in Japan and you’ll be able to buy anything in the entire convenient store with Bitcoin Cash which means including like paying your electric bill”\nThe interview proceeds with an explanation of how the very first version of Bitcoin was to be able to buy coffee and now Bitcoin Cash is aiming towards it. In addition to this, Roger Ver also talks about the various partnerships of Bitcoin Cash which includes, Menufly which is functioning in major cities in the U.S which now accepts BCH as payment and Bitbox which provides various tools for developers aspiring to develop on Bitcoin Cash.\nMemory Dealers, a Redditor says:\n“And the BTC boys can’t be angry because they don’t even want BTC to be used for payments. ‘Muh store of value!’”\nMob Two, another Redditor says:\n“Yep, freaking awesome. Definitely on the right path to cash for the entire world. Love it!”\nRicardo town says:\n“Important thing about this: you can pay for anything at convenience stores in Japan. I bought items off Amazon at convenience stores in cash. I paid all my bills. I paid for everything at convenience stores. If this pans out, you can then almost buy everything with BCH in Japan”\nEli Afram, a Twitterati says:\n“This is what real adoption looks like. Way to go :)”\nAccording to CoinMarkertCap, at the time of press, Bitcoin Cash [BCH] was trading at $1187 with a market cap of $20 billion and has seen a significant rise of more than 11% in the past 24 hours.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corbin fraser", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger ver", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T17:05:09.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f9509341b9443e3ac6613380e3d09d06d6b2654", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_9GNKz9GihsQiIiR1JAWWCYyRHNzB4MgxJ6QaeeqYOX1mM5ae5bBcBHjylOZNCveeHZoum6RhK29xqa7PWOW2vTE.wFUjurmcH_VLXnkB2gg--", "site_full": "www.bmmagazine.co.uk", "site": "bmmagazine.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Business Matters", "title": "Is cryptocurrency still Bitcoin & everybody else?", "title_full": "Is cryptocurrency still Bitcoin & everybody else?", "published": "2018-06-04T08:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_708948427-e1528146969354.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f9509341b9443e3ac6613380e3d09d06d6b2654", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_9GNKz9GihsQiIiR1JAWWCYyRHNzB4MgxJ6QaeeqYOX1mM5ae5bBcBHjylOZNCveeHZoum6RhK29xqa7PWOW2vTE.wFUjurmcH_VLXnkB2gg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Business Matters", "published": "2018-06-04T08:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is cryptocurrency still Bitcoin & everybody else?", "text": "As a small business owner, you have to decide which opportunities are worth pursuing and which might be a waste of your time.\nIt has become increasingly clear that cryptocurrency isn’t exactly something which you can ignore.\nAfter all, the digital coins often lead off the financial news every night, for good and bad, and more and more people are taking the dive to see what they’re all about in terms of incorporating them into their personal finances.\nSmall business simply can’t stick their head in the sand and pretend that they’ll just fall by the wayside. Otherwise, they run the risk of becoming obsolete should cryptocurrency be the thing that separates their competitors from them.\nIn terms of cryptocurrency, many people know about Bitcoin, which is the preeminent player in the market when it comes to market share and brand awareness.\nThere are many other coins on the market besides Bitcoin, which can muddy up the decision-making process for business owners trying to figure out how to proceed. Investors are also faced with the same deluge of cryptocurrency choices, which is why many turns to trading robots much like Crypto CFD Trader to help them with these tough decisions.\nFor a business owner, however, is it worth it to even consider a crypto offering besides Bitcoin? That depends on what you’re seeking. Everybody Knows Their Name\nThe obvious benefit to Bitcoin is that it is the one cryptocurrency that stands above the rest in terms of name recognition. As a result, being able to accept payments from customers with Bitcoin can lend your business a certain amount of notoriety.\nThere are plenty of users of the coins, including many who see it as more than an investment opportunity. You can certainly draw in more business by having it on your website or your storefront that you accept payment in it. The Limitations\nWhen it comes to Bitcoin, you have to realize that it acts pretty much the same way as any other form of payment does. It might take place at a faster rate and provide you with more convenience, but it is still just another way of making a transaction. That kind of thing may not be the jolt that you want out of a technological innovation that you adopt for your business. The Alternatives\nWhen you start searching around for some of the other top names, in terms of market share and recognizability, among the so-called alt-coins, you’ll find that they may provide you with a little bit more versatility than does Bitcoin.\nBut these coins are also not nearly as well established, meaning that incorporating them might mean you having to scrap those plans if the coins go under. And you might have a harder time finding people to exchange them with you if you do choose to use them as currency.\nBitcoin is still the top coin in the realm of cryptocurrency , although it is starting to have to vie for attention just a bit with the others. You will be taking less of a chance with it, but your expectations for it might have to be tempered a bit compared with the potential of the others.

There is a key ascending channel formed with support at $1,170 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair may correct a few points in the short term before it makes another upside move towards $1,220. Bitcoin cash price is trading nicely above $1,100 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD remains in an uptrend and it could eye an upside break above $1,200 in the near term.\nBitcoin Cash Price Trend The past few sessions were pretty bullish as bitcoin cash price started an upside ride from the $1,040 swing low against the US Dollar. The price surged higher and broke many hurdles on the way up, including $1,100. It even managed to clear the $1,180 resistance and spiked above the $1,200 level. A high was formed at $1,209 before the price started a downside correction.\nAn initial support is around the 23.2% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,075 low to $1,209 high. There is also a key ascending channel formed with support at $1,170 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair remains in an uptrend as long as the price $1,100 pivot level is intact. Below the channel support, the next support is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,075 low to $1,209 high at $1,142. However, any major correction from the current levels is less likely, especially below $1,140.\nLooking at the chart , the price is in a nice uptrend above $1,100. On the upside, the price could once again break the $1,200 barrier for more gains towards $1,250.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is signaling more upsides in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is currently correcting lower towards the 55 level.\nMajor Support Level – $1,140\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,200\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Zooming Higher appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T08:02:48.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "26daadc46f7b4c9d27ea9f6b933660a3f4562bd5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9vJQ1uaynVa4xakI_wmkZxqTh7HMTUrAeY_VkIIb3b9jqH0CcUmc26F12pQsUe.F0ajN7rhedRFp6y.FS63zu122ZuLk1hdIA-", "site_full": "www.apsense.com", "site": "apsense.com", "site_section": "http://www.apsense.com/feed/articles.xml", "site_categories": ["marketing", "computer_networking", "tech", "business", "social"], "section_title": "APSense Articles Updates", "title": "Bitcoin Service Phone Number 1-888-270-8375", "title_full": "Bitcoin Service Phone Number 1-888-270-8375", "published": "2018-06-04T08:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.apsense.com/m_photo/profile/20180604/1528088411904827.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4886, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "26daadc46f7b4c9d27ea9f6b933660a3f4562bd5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9vJQ1uaynVa4xakI_wmkZxqTh7HMTUrAeY_VkIIb3b9jqH0CcUmc26F12pQsUe.F0ajN7rhedRFp6y.FS63zu122ZuLk1hdIA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-04T08:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Service Phone Number 1-888-270-8375", "text": "Bitcoin Service Phone Number 1-888-270-8375 by Dev Sumit Live Technical Support Services We have many years experience to provide technical support services for Bitcoin customers in very affordable charges, our technical support team is available 7x24 hour, to troubleshoot Bitcoin related issues and provide best effective solutions.

Well, you might want to step back a little bit and take a good hard look at all that becoming one of these miners entails. It is by no means an easy process , and it can be a costly one to get everything started. Even then, there is no guarantee of success. Like any other business opportunity, deciding to become a Bitcoin miner means that you should diligently observe all the pros and cons and then make a realistic assessment of your chances of success and profits.\nJumping right it can be a catastrophic error in what has become an increasingly competitive field. But you also shouldn’t discount it out of hand either, because Bitcoin mining does indeed hold the potential for great profits. In fact, you can extract substantial profits out of the Bitcoin realm simply by investing in it, which is something you can do with the help of an artificial intelligence-enhanced trading robot in the manner of Crypto CFD Trader . Here are three of the things that you need to keep in mind before putting out your Bitcoin Mining shingle. It’s Costly\nBitcoin mining requires the solving of a complex mathematical problem before anyone else in the network can do it. Since there are many miners out there, you must give yourself a lot of chances, which means investing in high-powered hardware. That can also mean finding the space to put all that equipment, as well as also conceivably hiring the workers to run the equipment and keep it operating properly. That is no small task and, certainly, no cheap one either. Your initial profit margin might be thin to nonexistent. It Requires Lots of Power\nHere is where you might think twice if you are concerned about the environment. Bitcoin mining requires the kind of power that usually can’t be sourced from environmentally-friendly producers. That means you might want to look about how you can offset this environmental footprint to compensate, which, again, can lead to rising costs for operation. It’s Competitive\nThis might have been less of a concern a year or two ago, but the fact is Bitcoin saturation has been spreading to the point that many people know much more about it now than they did only a short time ago. As a result, many entrepreneurs are jumping into this field, crowding it and making the margin for error razor slim for new enterprises. Success isn’t out of the question, but it is not a dead-cinch lock either, which is what you might be fooled into believing when you read about Bitcoin mining.\nIn short, Bitcoin mining is not something that you should enter in a halfhearted manner. But it is something that could be a lucrative business if you go into it with clear eyes and a good plan.

The rising value of the coins is clear evidence of that.\nBut there are many people who bring up issues surrounding the coins whenever they can do so. The skepticism in some cases is off-base, but in other cases has some evidence behind it. As a small business owner deciding whether some nod to Bitcoin is the right move for your business, you must make that call as carefully as possible.\nIt is very little in the world of business that is without risk, so the fact that Bitcoin possesses some shouldn’t dissuade you from considering it. But you should also try to get to the bottom of whether your concerns are genuine or if you’ve been the victim of a kind of fear-mongering on behalf of the doubters.\nYou might be better off trying to dip your toes in the water by investing in it personally first, which you can do with the help of a trading robot in the vein of Bitcoin Code . As for the so-called negatives about Bitcoin, there are some which are legitimate and some which might be unfounded. Look for yourself and see which apply to your business. Crime\nOne of the biggest draws for individuals involved with Bitcoin can also be a kind of drawback for businesses, and that is its inherent security features. When two parties conduct a transaction using Bitcoin, no personal information is exchanged. That means that people who are looking to fund illegal activities can use it in that manner if they so desire. But if you are running a business that is on the up and up, this doesn’t seem like it would come into play. Security\nThis is, again, something that can easily be prevented if you take the right precautions. Many people are concerned that their coins can somehow be hacked. This can certainly happen if you keep your coins in an exchange of some sort. But if you use a physical wallet with a password that only you know when you make a transaction, there shouldn’t be any worry about your funds being hacked out of your business account. Falling Value\nWhen you receive payments in Bitcoin, you go into it knowing that the value of the coins you receive will change, often significantly, in a short period of time. That means that you need to have a contingency plan should the Bitcoin price drop shortly after you receive a payment. The good news is that the value can just as easily rise.\nAs you can see, not all the concerns about Bitcoin will be applicable to your business. Do your research and take baby steps and you should be able to incorporate it quite effectively.

It is by no means an easy choice, with pros and cons attached to both, and it could simply come down to what your individual needs from the move to cryptocurrency.\nWhen deciding between Ethereum and Bitcoin, you must understand the differences and similarities between the two. You might choose to embrace one or the other based on the philosophy behind them, or it could come down to a utilitarian standpoint in that one can do a little (or a lot) more for you than the other. Whatever the case, they both also make for exciting investment opportunities, opportunities you can exploit with the help of a trading program like QProfit System . In the case of the Ethereum or Bitcoin debate for your small business, there are several key points that you must consider. Bitcoin’s Popularity\nIn terms of popularity, Ethereum is playing catch-up to Bitcoin, which got the jump on all other cryptocurrencies and seems like it has a strong standing at the top of the heap. Its brand is such that many people think that Bitcoin is cryptocurrency, not realizing that there are other types of coins which fall into the crypto realm. That can make adding it to the list of payment options for your business very attractive, since many adopters are already out there. Ethereum’s Applications\nEthereum holds one big advantage on Bitcoin for the way that it does far more than act as currency. It uses the blockchain technology to allow for people to create and utilize many applications. Some of these, such as smart contracts, can be easily incorporated into your business operations. In that way, it is more of a one-size-fits-all kind of coin, something that you can pay off your debts with but goes so much farther than that. Other Factors\nThe popularity of Bitcoin is such that you can easily sell it off to willing buyers; Ethereum is far less liquid. Bitcoin also is the coin that bears the brunt of the bad news whenever a regulatory body threatens to crack down on cryptocurrency, so that can make it a bit more volatile. Ethereum might have a bigger room for upside in terms of its value, simply because it isn’t as valuable as Bitcoin is right now.\nYour business might have a place for only one cryptocurrency , which means that you will have to decide between the top two. Whatever that decision is, you should only enter it after taking the time to consider all the positives and negatives.

And after the tx is being mined it have three status which are pending, success and failure, which refers to the transaction state.\nIs this the same as bitcoin as I could not see the state of transaction in bitcoin. I can't find any status of the transaction in txid of api returns (i use insight api). How could i ensure that the transaction is in pending/complete state and how can i ensure that the transaction is success or failure. I am thinking of checking 6 confirmations but I don't think that this is a \"safe\" and proper way as confirmation numbers varies.\nTo summarize 1) How do i ensure that a transaction is in pending or completed state 2) How do i ensure that a transaction is in success or failure state after completed.\nWhat I did in ethereum to confirm the transaction is completed and success: 1) Keep looping and call the txid api every x seconds to get tx detail until it returns non-null object 2) if it returns an object, i can check the status (which is success or failure) to confirm that the transaction is success.\nHow it is done in bitcoin way?\nSample output of insights api tx: { \"txid\": \"\", \"version\": 2, \"locktime\": 0, \"vin\": [ ... ], \"vout\": [ ... ], \"blockhash\": \" 586ebc988140383fd557f9bbc09ca0ac10cff2cb0fafd\", \"blockheight\": 525860, \"confirmations\": 9, \"time\": 1528080051, \"blocktime\": 1528080051, \"valueOut\": 3.27637624, \"size\": 290, \"valueIn\": 3.27737624, \"fees\": 0.001 }", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T14:46:26.110+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "23dd72085528e477df48ad18337b08694f97d073", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNJX0MU4hYrY96oWuWLrm9TWmQNJdtw3I62x703o0YVHWy2hroXe7MGkuoUEODIo8bh3OwrTyv947TZbc8fkE2H8-", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/news-btc", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "NewsBTC - Barchart.com", "title": "Key Points Bitcoin cash price started a nice upsid", "title_full": "Key Points Bitcoin cash price started a nice upsid", "published": "2018-06-04T07:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.095, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "23dd72085528e477df48ad18337b08694f97d073", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNJX0MU4hYrY96oWuWLrm9TWmQNJdtw3I62x703o0YVHWy2hroXe7MGkuoUEODIo8bh3OwrTyv947TZbc8fkE2H8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aayush Jindal", "published": "2018-06-04T07:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Key Points Bitcoin cash price started a nice upsid", "text": "Key Points Bitcoin cash price started a nice upside move and traded above the $1,100 resistance against the US Dollar.
