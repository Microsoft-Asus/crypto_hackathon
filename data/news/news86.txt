succeed without bitcoin?\nSince 2017 until now. Already many banks and companies have tested Blockchain Technology and it turns out they have done well. Probably already many among banks or other companies, who have implemented this Technology. In fact I've heard there is an automotive company that implements it on its auto parts to test the authenticity of its auto parts.\nExactly, blockchain has many different ways to be implementied. Blockchain is technology that can be used alone for many purposes but it's often mixed with Bitcoin itself and many don't understand the difference.\nFinancial industry is the first one that has begun to test it and they are seriously thinking for mass use of it in their businesses. Also, very popular are start ups based on blockchain.\nShortly it could be said that blockchain is technology of the future that could and will be implemented for various businesses and it's one of the benefits that Bitcoin has brought.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T21:08:43.040+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "458a5c7655f3aa239b2f4a43536c9cf7a5dc49d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQxvMpmV1kYL_JQJWf7Kn.yX8_Si.XVWefkN8OGed3d4psxcKGkduZex46XacRlkmk6gGWjqgCFyKTZjC2QquEMTL6YPYXSULOc4xxniYX5vmKiHrjM_to_Mm880EjD.4OiEr1bMKBBDA--", "site_full": "businesstech.co.za", "site": "businesstech.co.za", "site_section": "http://businesstech.co.za/news/feed/", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "BusinessTech", "title": "Bitcoin could fall to $2,800 by the end of the year: analyst", "title_full": "Bitcoin could fall to $2,800 by the end of the year: analyst", "published": "2018-05-31T08:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Bitcoin-e1509610309713.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 19721, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "458a5c7655f3aa239b2f4a43536c9cf7a5dc49d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQxvMpmV1kYL_JQJWf7Kn.yX8_Si.XVWefkN8OGed3d4psxcKGkduZex46XacRlkmk6gGWjqgCFyKTZjC2QquEMTL6YPYXSULOc4xxniYX5vmKiHrjM_to_Mm880EjD.4OiEr1bMKBBDA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bloomberg", "published": "2018-05-31T08:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin could fall to $2,800 by the end of the year: analyst", "text": "Bitcoin could fall to $2,800 by the end of the year: analyst Bloomberg 31 May 2018 shares\nThe biggest cryptocurrency has renewed its flirtation with the $7,000 price level.\nThe slide has helped to also send other digital assets into retreat, with Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin all lower on Wednesday.\nSince failing to regain the psychologically important $10,000 level on May 4, it has closed lower in New York in 12 out of 17 sessions.\nThe hype surrounding last year’s hottest asset class have faded in 2018, with fewer online searches and more pressure for regulators, with technical analysts saying the decline replicates the pattern seen following the collapse of the Mt.

According to their claims, this was because Bitcoin was a profound inspiration to them during their first Stellar designing.\nTheir older statements express:\n“The Bitcoin network was the first to show that it’s possible for a group of untrusted parties to agree on a common database, and the Bitcoin community still influences our understanding of this technology’s impact.”\nchikunGoboom, a Twitterati questions:\n“Charlie do have an opinion of stellar?

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange. A prominent economist, author of “When Markets Collide,” and “The Only Game in Town” Mohamed El-Erian thinks cryptocurrency is the future and that it will be government-backed. We believe that most top digital currencies will survive this bear market and the traders should view the current fall as a buying opportunity instead of fearing it. Sygnia Asset Management, a major South African investment firm with $14.5 billion under management, is launching a cryptocurrency exchange in late 2018. It will also create a fund to invest in digital currencies on behalf of its clients. So, should we also start investing at the current levels or wait a little more? Let’s find out. BTC/USD We are clear that Bitcoin can be purchased on dips because it offers a great risk to reward ratio if purchased anywhere between $6,075 to $7,000. We believe that it is in consolidation, as long as it stays above $6,075. A break of this level will be negative and will attract further selling. We had recommended buying the leading cryptocurrency on a sharp fall below $7,000 in our previous analysis, but the bulls held on to the $7,100 levels on May 28 and May 29. The current rebound will face resistance at the downtrend line and above that at the 20-day EMA, which is at $7,963. The BTC/USD pair has given a tradeable bounce from close to the 30 levels on the RSI for the past year and a half. Until proven otherwise, we believe that this trend will continue. The next dip from the overhead resistances will offer us a buying opportunity. It is advisable to watch for a couple of days before initiating a long position. ETH/USD Ethereum broke below the support line of the descending channel on May 28, but the bears could not follow up on their selling at lower levels. As a result, the digital currency rebounded sharply on the very next day, erasing all the losses. The rebound will face selling at higher levels as the 20-day EMA has turned down and has completed a bearish crossover. The next dip will give us a better idea whether the decline has ended at $492.5 on May 28 or will it extend to $464.65 levels. Once we get a confirmation of a bottom, we shall recommend long positions on the ETH/USD pair. Currently, we don’t find any trade on it. XRP/USD Ripple has formed a large descending triangle pattern. It broke below the critical $0.56270 support on May 28 but rebounded on the next day. It is currently facing resistance at the 20-day EMA, which has turned down. If the next dip holds above $0.54, the traders can wait for a break out above the 20-day EMA to go long. The minimum upside target objective of such a trade is a move back to $0.8. We can expect a rally to $1.2 if the XRP/USD pair breaks out of the downtrend line of the descending triangle. If the $0.54 level breaks, a fall to $0.45 is likely. This is the last support, below which the digital currency can sink to $0.24. BCH/USD We believe that Bitcoin Cash is trading in a range whose resistance is at $1,600. The support of the range is still undecided. It can either be $750 or closer to $620. Currently, the cryptocurrency is struggling to sustain above the downtrend line. If the bears succeed in breaking below the May 28 lows of $878, a slide to $750 is probable. This should offer some support, but if this also breaks, the next support is at $620. If the $878 level holds, the BCH/USD pair can remain range bound for a few days. We don’t find any reliable buy setups at the current levels; hence, we are not recommending any trade on it. EOS/USD We had proposed a buy at $14.25 on EOS , but it turned down from $12.98 on May 28. The 20-day EMA is currently acting as strong resistance. The EOS/USD pair can remain range bound between $10.3384-$12.9870 for the next few days, before breaking out or breaking down from it. We don’t find any buy setup as long as prices remain inside the range. If the virtual currency breaks down of the range, it will become very negative, hence, we suggest waiting for the break out to close (UTC) above $12.98 to form any long positions. LTC/USD Litecoin has held the $107 support levels once again, but it is facing resistance at the downtrend line. Even if this level is crossed, it will face resistance at the 20-day EMA at $129. We shall consider a buy only after the LTC/USD pair sustains above $129 for a couple of days. On the downside, if the $107 level breaks, it will signal the completion of a descending triangle pattern. Though its pattern targets are way lower, the digital currency can slide to $84 and below that to $75. ADA/USD Cardano is showing buying at lower levels. It has broken out of the descending channel and is moving towards the overhead resistance at $0.23. If the bulls break out of this, the cryptocurrency will gain strength and pick up momentum on crossing above $0.3. We like the way the ADA/USD pair bounced from the oversold levels on the RSI. This shows that bulls are willing to enter at lower levels. We recommend a long position on a breakout and close (UTC) above $0.23 with the stops below $0.17. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency fails to break out of $0.23 and turns down, breaking below $0.17. XLM/USD The wedge pattern did not give us a clear breakout or a breakdown. Hence, we have removed it today. Stellar pulled back sharply from 0.2428 levels on May 29 but is facing selling close to $0.30 levels. If the bulls can scale above the $0.303 levels, it will indicate the start of a rally to $0.385. Therefore, traders should wait for the breakout and close (UTC) above $0.303 before initiating any long positions. If the XLM/USD pair fails to hold the current levels and breaks down to $0.24, it can slide to the next lower support at $0.184. IOTA/USD After a sharp pullback on May 29, IOTA has climbed to the ninth spot, that’s why it’s way back in our analysis. It continues to consolidate between $0.9150-$2.2117. Currently, the price is close to the overhead resistance at $1.63. The 20-day EMA is also just above it. We believe that the bulls will find it difficult to break out of these two resistances. We anticipate a retest of the recent lows of $1.33 in a couple of days. If the lows hold, the traders can buy a breakout and close above $1.63 with a target of $2.2. If the lows break, the IOTA/USD pair will decline to the bottom of the range at $1. Therefore, we suggest buying only after the lows are successfully held in the next retest.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

There is a new connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $965 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair has to stay above the $960 and $950 support levels to avoid a downside break in the near term. Bitcoin cash price is holding an important support around $950 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD has to move past the $1,040 resistance to gain further.\nBitcoin Cash Price Support After yesterday's ride , bitcoin cash price faced sellers near the $1,030-1,040 resistances against the US Dollar. The price started a downside correction and declined below the $1,000 support. It also declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $971 low to $1,031 high. It opened the doors for a larger correction and the price dipped towards the $950 support area.\nThe $940-950 support area acted as a decent buy zone and protected further losses. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $971 low to $1,031 high also prevented declines. BCH price moved back above the $960 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. More importantly, there is a new connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $965 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair remains well supported on the downside around the $950 and $960 levels.\nLooking at the chart , the price is clearly facing a major hurdle on the upside near $1,040. A break and close above the stated $1,040 resistance is needed for buyers to take control. On the downside, a break and close below $950 will most likely push the price back in the bearish zone.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is slightly placed in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is currently flat near the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $950\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,040\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Holding Important Support appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T08:04:54.030+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a41797d4a7d501a9932fded416db3b6565ff80d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywOl5DShMMW5AtIyXMmRySGPRWnT5NDUCGOmaSNSeXKw6UdFk1DJdwNA--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Bears Defend Channel Resistance", "title_full": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Bears Defend Channel Resistance", "published": "2018-05-31T08:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8a41797d4a7d501a9932fded416db3b6565ff80d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnywOl5DShMMW5AtIyXMmRySGPRWnT5NDUCGOmaSNSeXKw6UdFk1DJdwNA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-31T08:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Bears Defend Channel Resistance", "text": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights\nBitcoin price continues to trend lower as it bounced off the top of the channel on the 1-hour time frame. A continuation of the slide could take it down to the Fibonacci extension levels. There are some signs of bearish exhaustion from technical indicators, though. Bitcoin price looks ready to resume the drop after bouncing off resistance, but there are signs of bearish exhaustion.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This suggests that the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse. The 200 SMA recently held as dynamic resistance since it lined up with the top of the channel near $7,600.\nA continuation of the drop could send bitcoin price to the 38.2% extension near the swing low of $6,950. Stronger selling pressure could take it to the channel support at $6,750 or the 78.6% extension close to the $6,300 support. The full extension is located near $6,000.\nRSI is pulling up from oversold conditions to show that buyers are getting the upper hand. Similarly, stochastic is heading north from oversold levels so bitcoin price could follow suit. In that case, there's still a chance for an upside break of the channel top, especially since the gap between the moving averages is narrowing.\nBTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin price took another hit from negative remarks in the absence of any other industry updates. Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller remarked that bitcoin could be extinct by 2118, citing:\n\"The one scenario is that something like what happened after 2013 when bitcoin topped $1,000, and then lost 80 percent of its value. It looked like bitcoin was just fading away.\"\nHe did mention that it could continue to exist but maybe under a different name or mechanism as there have been so many forks already. Also, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse mentioned that bitcoin price influence over other altcoins could be over soon.\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Bears Defend Channel Resistance appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T08:04:55.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee2a6249d7cdb9e7d30be4e80ba345003687bd19", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQH6.BkPOqy24SUtVKleSycggALXE7rNjwUraw57HkrICqXg9NMn1TV3Jp8dPwMhT1vQscCeqIRD2OPOBxuOXDXIC18gPAo4NDZ7rECYows_w--", "site_full": "hanistudio10.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://hanistudio10.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "HANI STUDIO | Your Free Online Computer Academy", "title": "Cloud mining free and get free 100 ghs earn unlimited bitcoin", "title_full": "Cloud mining free and get free 100 ghs earn unlimited bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-31T08:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ee2a6249d7cdb9e7d30be4e80ba345003687bd19", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQH6.BkPOqy24SUtVKleSycggALXE7rNjwUraw57HkrICqXg9NMn1TV3Jp8dPwMhT1vQscCeqIRD2OPOBxuOXDXIC18gPAo4NDZ7rECYows_w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Hani Studio (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-31T08:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cloud mining free and get free 100 ghs earn unlimited bitcoin", "text": "\nHi guys Welcome! today i will going to show you cloud mining free and get 100 ghs earn unlimited bitcoin best free cloud mining site with free ghs bonus just signup and get 100 ghs free for free bitcoin mining. if you want to watch more videos subscribe my channel and press bell icon for my updated videos notifications Thanks for watching Link: http://tmearn.com/pAQx http://zipansion.com/1B1Rw ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T08:03:32.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "244255909299190a8c17184ccfe4bf7dbccf78bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFTjQnjlLwjpMF19AxScgjpnGYJfN0Z4jm6o_eixP01l_zNcTlrTWgivTJeL9TpG_Z7c2MSkWXQGr", "site_full": "www.youbrandinc.com", "site": "youbrandinc.com", "site_section": "http://www.youbrandinc.com/feed", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "You Brand, Inc.", "title": "3 Steps to Buy and Store Bitcoins Anonymously", "title_full": "3 Steps to Buy and Store Bitcoins Anonymously", "published": "2018-05-31T08:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.youbrandinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/15269972018016.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "244255909299190a8c17184ccfe4bf7dbccf78bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFTjQnjlLwjpMF19AxScgjpnGYJfN0Z4jm6o_eixP01l_zNcTlrTWgivTJeL9TpG_Z7c2MSkWXQGr", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Scott Scanlon", "published": "2018-05-31T08:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "3 Steps to Buy and Store Bitcoins Anonymously", "text": "3 Steps to Buy and Store Bitcoins Anonymously by 0\nJim Epstein from the July 2018 issue – view article in the Digital Edition Bitcoin is the first uncensorable digital currency: When it moves between buyers and sellers, there’s nothing anyone can do to stop it. The now-shuttered online marketplace Silk Road couldn’t have existed before bitcoin, because it’s unfathomable that Visa, Mastercard, or PayPal would approve transactions on an e-commerce site for buying and selling illicit drugs. Bitcoin is often mistakenly described as a “fully anonymous” cryptocurrency.\nIn fact, while global superpowers can’t prevent you from spending your bitcoins, that doesn’t mean they can’t figure out what you bought. More than 100 Silk Road users have gotten into trouble with law enforcement since 2012, and the Snowden leaks revealed that the National Security Agency has worked to uncover the identities of other bitcoin users as well.\nThere’s no such thing as perfect anonymity, but a handful of best practices can go a long way toward shielding your transactions from government spies and other malevolents. Don’t keep your bitcoins on a custodial exchange such as Coinbase.\nThese sites store your identity and may share it with law enforcement agencies, making transactions about as private as mailing a personal check with a return address. Instead, set up a bitcoin “wallet”—a software application that enables you to send or receive bitcoins in a peer-to-peer fashion, directly from your own computer.\nWith a wallet, the secret codes required to spend bitcoins aren’t stored by a third-party company or somewhere in the cloud. You maintain them yourself.

Now, with increasing awareness of digital assets, those who are thinking of putting their money into Bitcoin will most likely weigh their options a bit more before buying into the cryptocurrency.\nIn a statement, Barclays analysts said\nCombined with the results of our theoretical modeling, survey findings suggest that, unlike the peaks in Bitcoin prices in 2011 and 2013, the most recent peak may have been the ultimate top and that speculative interest could decrease from here\nThis lower demand means that Bitcoin holders are now oversupplied. This state of the market is now dictating the price movement of Bitcoin. The analysis shows that Bitcoin demand pushed up the prices, which was quickly followed by a sell-off.\nBitcoin Thrill Has Worn Off\nPeople are not buying Bitcoin for speculation purposes as much as they did in recent months. Now that investors know more about Bitcoin, they are more aware of its pitfalls.\nRight now, Bitcoin awareness in the US is at 60%, while Canada’s is at 64%. It is even higher in South Korea, which is at 90% and in Japan it is around 88%. This increase in knowledge has lowered the possibility of speculative buying. As bitcoin awareness increases, the chances for bitcoin to reach the $20,000 high of December 2017 have diminished significantly.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "barclays", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T07:22:21.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b9930eccb6572a6fc0b1f1c3279c11a5c46b0706", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSctm3UpDA412ZXCIjgmhEfB0llcw7DX1wTOFaAANmYwKRHvD1aWv_9CGKFCJ4jH2Cw--", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "3 Steps to Buy and Store Bitcoins Anonymously", "title_full": "3 Steps to Buy and Store Bitcoins Anonymously", "published": "2018-05-31T07:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b9930eccb6572a6fc0b1f1c3279c11a5c46b0706", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSctm3UpDA412ZXCIjgmhEfB0llcw7DX1wTOFaAANmYwKRHvD1aWv_9CGKFCJ4jH2Cw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-31T07:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "3 Steps to Buy and Store Bitcoins Anonymously", "text": "3 Steps to Buy and Store Bitcoins Anonymously\n3 Steps to Buy and Store Bitcoins Anonymously Reason Full coverage Google ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T07:13:42.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "54429d4511365cbdf0f9c7e7a62cf9e8a946b1ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhEFOnFdDqdYoRTTDvwfzlpQ-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-31T07:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "54429d4511365cbdf0f9c7e7a62cf9e8a946b1ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhEFOnFdDqdYoRTTDvwfzlpQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-31T07:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 31, 2018 NEWS Austrian Financial Market Authority Stops 'Active Managed Mining' Operation Bitcoin News (press release) You receive your payment in Ethereum or Bitcoin currency.

BCH\\/USD has to move past the $1,040 resistance to gain further. Bitcoin Cash Price Support\nAfter yesterday\\u2019s ride , bitcoin cash price faced sellers near the $1,030-1,040 resistances against the US Dollar. The price started a downside correction and declined below the $1,000 support. It also declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $971 low to $1,031 high. It opened the doors for a larger correction and the price dipped towards the $950 support area.\nThe $940-950 support area acted as a decent buy zone and protected further losses. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $971 low to $1,031 high also prevented declines. BCH price moved back above the $960 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. More importantly, there is a new connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $965 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair. The pair remains well supported on the downside around the $950 and $960 levels.\nLooking at the chart , the price is clearly facing a major hurdle on the upside near $1,040. A break and close above the stated $1,040 resistance is needed for buyers to take control. On the downside, a break and close below $950 will most likely push the price back in the bearish zone.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD \\u2013 The MACD for BCH\\/USD is slightly placed in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \\u2013 The RSI for BCH\\/USD is currently flat near the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level \\u2013 $950\nMajor Resistance Level \\u2013 $1,040\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH\\/USD Holding Important Support ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T15:38:01.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4032069777af33ba48ab41dcf4365933304b9a38", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNBBmbuda_MV1IPjfldkjE6Aijpbno88.lmthMYQl.aFk6y9q9DIdJ.qR6A_AnIsWMSY2bYN3J9mpZgFyC4cfHI7PkmD9F8bQoQ--", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/news-btc", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "NewsBTC - Barchart.com", "title": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights Bitcoin price contin", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights Bitcoin price contin", "published": "2018-05-31T07:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.162, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4032069777af33ba48ab41dcf4365933304b9a38", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNBBmbuda_MV1IPjfldkjE6Aijpbno88.lmthMYQl.aFk6y9q9DIdJ.qR6A_AnIsWMSY2bYN3J9mpZgFyC4cfHI7PkmD9F8bQoQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sarah Jenn", "published": "2018-05-31T07:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights Bitcoin price contin", "text": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights Bitcoin price continues to trend lower as it bounced off the top of the channel on the 1-hour time frame. A continuation of the slide could take it down to the Fibonacci extension levels. There are some signs of bearish exhaustion from technical indicators, though.\nBitcoin price looks ready to resume the drop after bouncing off resistance, but there are signs of bearish exhaustion.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This suggests that the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse. The 200 SMA recently held as dynamic resistance since it lined up with the top of the channel near $7,600.\nA continuation of the drop could send bitcoin price to the 38.2% extension near the swing low of $6,950. Stronger selling pressure could take it to the channel support at $6,750 or the 78.6% extension close to the $6,300 support. The full extension is located near $6,000.\nRSI is pulling up from oversold conditions to show that buyers are getting the upper hand. Similarly, stochastic is heading north from oversold levels so bitcoin price could follow suit. In that case, there’s still a chance for an upside break of the channel top, especially since the gap between the moving averages is narrowing. BTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin price took another hit from negative remarks in the absence of any other industry updates.\\u00a0Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller remarked that bitcoin could be extinct by 2118, citing:\n“The one scenario is that something like what happened after 2013 when bitcoin topped $1,000, and then lost 80 percent of its value. It looked like bitcoin was just fading away.”\nHe did mention that it could continue to exist but maybe under a different name or mechanism as there have been so many forks already. Also, Ripple CEO\\u00a0Brad Garlinghouse mentioned that bitcoin price influence over other altcoins could be over soon.\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Bears Defend Channel Resistance ",

A mosque in Britain’s capital is willing to receive your donation – in bitcoin.\nThe Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, east London, has decided to accept bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a bid to widen its donor base and cut down on currency conversion fees, mosque leaders said.\n“For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,” said blockchain consultant Lukasz Musial, who helped the mosque set up the technology. “For the donor, it’s just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque’s perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,” Musial said.\nEgypt’s Grand Mufti, the nation’s top Sunni Muslim official, said this year bitcoin was not permitted according to Islamic law, Egyptian media reported, but Shacklewell imam Abdalla Adeyemi defended the mosque’s decision.\n“Bitcoin is like any other currency. It’s … accepted by a group of people… We ourselves are not trading. We are not involved … we are a charity,” Adeyemi told Reuters.\nThe mosque says it is one of a handful to accept cryptocurrencies out of hundreds in London and its move is yielding results. It says it is on track to double its donations this year to more than £10,000 ($13,300).\nMuslims with the means are religiously obliged to give alms, often calculated based on Islamic texts as being 2.5 percent of their wealth, and many do so during the holy month, a time when Muslim charities are most active.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ramadan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shacklewell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lukasz musial", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "musial", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abdalla adeyemi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shacklewell lane mosque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dalston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T07:07:36.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7cb1917d78ce03ad12f0a71df3f7d269e574634a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY6ijqaA.DDRzivrl6ZvKmrolSAciv_a2U9UfBbrK7yLjytcVBTUE1MEqqo2ggHMi4.ervBwcQtvpMOgJRo.1cAVP3GDQrFiF8-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "A crash course in freeing your mind from Bitcoin Core", "title_full": "A crash course in freeing your mind from Bitcoin Core : btc", "published": "2018-05-31T06:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.088, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7cb1917d78ce03ad12f0a71df3f7d269e574634a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY6ijqaA.DDRzivrl6ZvKmrolSAciv_a2U9UfBbrK7yLjytcVBTUE1MEqqo2ggHMi4.ervBwcQtvpMOgJRo.1cAVP3GDQrFiF8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "derekmagill", "published": "2018-05-31T06:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "A crash course in freeing your mind from Bitcoin Core", "text": "submitted by /u/derekmagill\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://derekmagill.com/2018/05/30/crash-course-bitcoin-core/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T04:35:18.083+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f69dc3c06935dde3b8fb5e5e4d18f58d445638b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUtSf_Ar24.Yjuicx7PauqgaPXQSz9pMUNauiHLdU2YA9.gvxUYtAZqg9LhG38tUvDTEAjXxLROLuUjt7H6HxBC1MTae_SYQTOGczJ1wqabta7dJjeYPZF2lxTXbSuXUxM-", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/cryptocurrency-news", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency News - Barchart.com", "title": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) has remained in a shrinking price", "title_full": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) has remained in a shrinking price", "published": "2018-05-31T06:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f69dc3c06935dde3b8fb5e5e4d18f58d445638b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUtSf_Ar24.Yjuicx7PauqgaPXQSz9pMUNauiHLdU2YA9.gvxUYtAZqg9LhG38tUvDTEAjXxLROLuUjt7H6HxBC1MTae_SYQTOGczJ1wqabta7dJjeYPZF2lxTXbSuXUxM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Josh Olszewicz", "published": "2018-05-31T06:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) has remained in a shrinking price", "text": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) has remained in a shrinking price range for the past 120 days.

Despite a climbing hash rate, which continuously posts record highs, transactions per day remain sharply down from last year. Transaction fees and unconfirmed transactions are also down dramatically from last year, which is a win from a network user point of view. Transaction batching and SegWit adoption , a protocol improvement allowing for cheaper transactions and large block size, have played a significant role. According to the Global Cryptocurrency Benchmarking Study by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, the number of active Bitcoin wallets is nearing 25 million and has been increasing steadily since 2015. Although wallets can be created but not destroyed, wallet usage can be seen as a loose metric for adoption and interest. Globally reported over the counter (OTC) volume from LocalBitcoins.com remains sharply down from December and January, with upticks in volume in a few countries. OTC volume spikes tend to correlate with geopolitical uncertainty and trade instability, much of which is being fueled by the Trump administration\\u2019s economic policies. The platform also recently implemented Know Your Customer and Anti Money Laundering ( KYC\\/AML ) requirements, which may provide increased legitimacy. Chinese OTC volume has remained consistent since February 2017, when domestic exchanges were barred from transacting. Although increasing slightly, the volume is at levels typical for a country without access to full-fledged exchanges. Despite the ban, in recent comments to the Chinese Academy of Engineering, Chinese President Xi Jinping recently lauded blockchain applications as \\u201cbreakthrough\\u201d technology. Additionally, the U.S. and China appear to be headed for a prolonged trade war fueled by new U.S. tariffs and reciprocal Chinese tariffs, which may also fuel OTC interest. Canadian OTC recently reached record highs in both CNY and BTC denominations, in the setting of ongoing North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiations . Canadian PM Justin Trudeau acknowledged that \\u201cNo NAFTA is better than a bad deal.\\u201d \\u00a0President Trump has already exited the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) on the basis that it was a bad deal for the U.S. , but the TPP may be revived due to Chinese trade tensions. Iranian OTC volume also spiked recently, potentially in response to the US dropping the Iran nuclear deal . RT recently reported that India will pay for Iranian Oil in Rupees to skirt U.S. sanctions, while Iran switched to the Euro for financial reporting. South American countries Argentina , Brazil , and Chile have all had increases in volume over the past few weeks as well. Peru has posted a record high in the Peruvian Sol and BTC denominations. Venezuela continues to post record highs in Bolivar volume, fueled by hyperinflation . The entire region seems inexorably linked due to instability and Venezuelan mass migration . The re-election of Venezuelan president, Nicol\\u00e1s Maduro Moros, signals that this economic meltdown will continue. There have been some reports that the Venezuelan government has begun \\u201cconfiscating everything to mine cryptocurrencies themselves.\\u201d Ongoing Brexit and recent Italian government debt crisis has not fueled Euro OTC volume as of yet. If the Italian debt crisis mirrors the debt crisis Greece experienced in 2015 , OTC volume may rise sharply. According to economist Desmond Lachman, \\u201conly Greece has a higher debt-to-GDP ratio [than Italy] among countries in the eurozone,\\u201d but Italy\\u2019s economy is 10 times larger than Greece. In September 2017 Circle launched it\\u2019s OTC services in Italy, and is therefore well-positioned ahead of any turmoil. U.S. and Russian tensions seem to vacillate between heated or friendly on any given day depending on who you ask, with the proxy war in Syria generally stoking tensions between the two. Russia\\u2019s gold reserves have been increasing every quarter for the past few years, recently hitting a fresh all time high, and may suggest less tolerance for the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency. Iran and Russia have also recently been in talks to use cryptocurrencies to bypass U.S. sanctions . The Russian legislature passed a draft of law regarding regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies and digital transactions. Paxful, another peer-to-peer OTC exchange, has seen a continued trend of increasing volume week over week. However, the total volume of LocalBitcoins is over three times that of Paxful. Bitcoin exchange traded volume this week has been led by the Tether (USDT) and USD markets for the fifth consecutive week, mostly on Binance, OKEX, and Bitfinex. In Asia, the JPY volume has increased since last week but remains down as a percentage of total volume. The Korean Won (KRW) volume has almost double since last week and the premium has increased as well, currently at 2.4%. China's\\u2019 Yuan (CNY) volume remains minimal based on it\\u2019s historic domination in the past. Technical Analysis Bitcoin price structure has remained in consolidation purgatory since cooling off from a meteoric rise near the end of 2017. Periods of ranging, indecisive price action are critical for the market to regain momentum for a move in either direction. A key hallmark for this is a descending volume profile, which has been the case since the low set in February. Although consolidation within a trend should always be assumed as trend continuation, casting a wide net with analysis, while avoiding analysis paralysis, and mapping out several scenarios is the key to eliminating surprises. Predicting the exact future price is less important than reacting to the price action with a potential trajectory and predetermined target. This process can be done with Chart Patterns, Ichimoku Cloud, Moving Averages, Pitchforks, and historic macro trends. Further background information on the technical analysis discussed below can be found here . A symmetrical triangle has formed as price has consolidated, making lower highs and higher lows. In Technical Analysis of Stock Trends (1948), Edwards and Magee suggest that roughly 75% of these triangles lead to a continuation of the trend, while the rest mark reversals. In any case, this pattern will be a \\u2018trade the breakout\\u2019 situation as it will likely lead to weeks of trend follow through. Breakouts post consolidation typically occur after at least 66% of the triangle has completed (yellow highlight). A multi-month descending volume profile also breeds the possibility for other chart patterns. On the weekly chart, an inverted Head and Shoulders reversal chart pattern. The most obvious problem with this pattern is the left shoulder dips below the trough of the head, which may invalidate the pattern entirely. Nonetheless, the potential structure remains with a 1.618 fib extension and measured move of US$12,000 and US$14,000 respectively. On the daily chart, an inverted Adam and Eve double top chart pattern is also possible, although there are many issues with its current structure and placement relative to price. The Adam (V) nor the horizontal support are completely clean or expected. Inverted patterns are typically seen at the top or markets, not after a downward move. While this makes the probability of the pattern becoming a reality less likely, it does not mean that it cannot happen. An inverted Head and Shoulders appeared on the weekly Oil chart after a significant downward move as well, which reached it\\u2019s 1.618 fib extension almost exactly on target. If this inverted Adam and Eve is real, it yields a price projection of ~US$2,900 and US$4,600 based on the measured move and 1.618 fib extension. The measured move target nearly matches the low set in September, as well as the previous resistance throughout June and August. Bollinger Bands, a measure of price volatility, have also coiled tighter and tighter, as illustrated by the Bollinger Band Width (BBW) indicator. An oscillator similar to RSI, %B, which shows the depth of price relative to the Bands, shows a growing bullish divergence as price dips lower without further expansion of the Bands themselves. The Ichimoku Cloud uses four metrics; the current price in relation to the Cloud, the color of the Cloud (red for bearish, green for bullish), the Tenkan (T) and Kijun (K) cross, and the Lagging Span. The best entry always occurs when most of the signals flip from bearish to bullish, or vice versa. The Cloud metrics on the weekly time frame are; price above Cloud, nearly bearish Cloud, newly bearish TK cross, and Lagging Span in price and above Cloud. Together, these signals suggest the trend is neutral but leaning weakly bullish because price remains above Cloud. This is the first TK cross since 2015, while the previous bearish TK cross in a similar position led to a multi-month downtrend. TK crosses on high timeframes are significant and should be seen a long exit signal for trade entries which began in 2015. Price itself is below the Kijun and, seemingly, in no-man\\u2019s land. A long entry would not be warranted until price is above the Kijun with a bullish TK cross, essentially also above the neckline of the head and shoulders chart pattern. The Cloud metrics on the daily time frame are; price below Cloud, bearish Cloud, newly bearish TK cross, and Lagging Span below price and Cloud. A long entry based on traditional Cloud rules does not occur until the Cloud is breached by price. A short entry has triggered with a bearish TK cross below Cloud, the strongest type of entry signal in the Cloud system. Optimal short entry occurs with a Kijun bounce at US$8,200. On the two day chart, price is flirting with a clean breach of the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) while being bound below the 50EMA as well. A 50\\/200EMA cross on this timeframe would be the first since November 2015, with the last bearish cross (red) resulting in a multi-month downtrend. On the daily chart, price is below the 200EMA, and the 50\\/200EMAs hold a bearish cross. With multiple EMA crosses occurring in succession on the same timeframe, any one cross becomes less valuable as an actionable signal. There is currently a mild hidden bullish divergence on RSI. Open long\\/short interest on Bitfinex is net long and has remained essentially flat over the past few weeks (top panel, chart below). A Pitchfork on the daily chart starting in 2017, with anchor points in January, May, and July, shows price reaching a similar distance below the mean (red line) as was reached above the mean in December. Price has closed this pitchfork for several days suggesting bearish invalidation. If price returns to inside the Pitchfork, a return to the mean is possible. Price has returned to the original upward trending Pitchfork beginning in 2015, with anchor points in January, May, and August of that year. Price broke North of this trend in October 2017 and again currently sits in the upper limits. A downside target of US~$5,300 is possible should price return to the mean (red line) of the prior trend. The OKEX quarterly futures rollover begin at the end of June. The rollover dates have been significant since 2015, with an alternating top\\/bottom price pattern between contract expirations. The entire quarter has been essentially flat thus far, potentially bucking the longstanding trend. The quarterly premium (blue) over the past month has been shrinking each day, with the weekly futures (green) price now below spot. Futures below spot price is an example of backwardation . A large premium over spot, as was seen throughout December and January, is typically an indicator of bullish sentiment, including exuberance and euphoria. This was an example of contango . Conclusion For better or worse, economic and trade policies worldwide have begun to dramatically shift with multiple political uncertainties. Bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies broadly, have more recently represented a global futures market to price-in credit risk or lack of confidence in leadership. CNBC recently discussed Bitcoin as a fear gauge for the market, similar to the volatility index. Technicals are the most bearish they have been in months. Based on the current price structure, breaking up would be much more surprising than breaking down. Admittedly, trend-based indicators like the Cloud become more noisy with non-trending price action, and therefore less reliable for actionable signals. However, even when zooming out on the price action, many of the technicals remain bearish. Currently, the trend indicator to watch is the 50\\/200EMA on the two day timeframe. Although too early to determine, one ray of hope would be the possibility of this entire consolidation period representing re-accumulation. Essentially, the entire bull trend from 2015 has been reset, which gives plenty of fuel for a new all time high just as easily as returning to new lows. The direction may be unclear, but the volume-based momentum will be obvious.\nThe post Bitcoin Price Analysis - Geopolitical turmoil and economic unrest first appeared on Brave New Coin", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cambridge centre for alternative finance", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T15:47:17.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b4621062488f46261f0766c07a4017ef1c2b0a02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XXTL8eNOU6d4Tpt39b1d8W8Atg5yiZbnZeI.ShqBTeV.BVVdA6eLYDdmdfy_9Ac9ixJ5Wo1KY4.2u9lEfnn08VplmfLAHPVecQC2ziDHUVOfGxPAZVARlrqcZiufBuqids-", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/brave-new-coin", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Brave New Coin - Barchart.com", "title": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) has remained in a shrinking price", "title_full": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) has remained in a shrinking price", "published": "2018-05-31T06:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b4621062488f46261f0766c07a4017ef1c2b0a02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XXTL8eNOU6d4Tpt39b1d8W8Atg5yiZbnZeI.ShqBTeV.BVVdA6eLYDdmdfy_9Ac9ixJ5Wo1KY4.2u9lEfnn08VplmfLAHPVecQC2ziDHUVOfGxPAZVARlrqcZiufBuqids-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Josh Olszewicz", "published": "2018-05-31T06:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) has remained in a shrinking price", "text": "Bitcoin ( BTC ) has remained in a shrinking price range for the past 120 days.

Globally reported over the counter (OTC) volume from LocalBitcoins.com remains sharply down from December and January, with upticks in volume in a few countries. OTC volume spikes tend to correlate with geopolitical uncertainty and trade instability, much of which is being fueled by the Trump administration\\u2019s economic policies. The platform also recently implemented Know Your Customer and Anti Money Laundering ( KYC\\/AML ) requirements, which may provide increased legitimacy. Chinese OTC volume has remained consistent since February 2017, when domestic exchanges were barred from transacting. Although increasing slightly, the volume is at levels typical for a country without access to full-fledged exchanges. Despite the ban, in recent comments to the Chinese Academy of Engineering, Chinese President Xi Jinping recently lauded blockchain applications as \\u201cbreakthrough\\u201d technology. Additionally, the U.S. and China appear to be headed for a prolonged trade war fueled by new U.S. tariffs and reciprocal Chinese tariffs, which may also fuel OTC interest. Canadian OTC recently reached record highs in both CNY and BTC denominations, in the setting of ongoing North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiations . Canadian PM Justin Trudeau acknowledged that \\u201cNo NAFTA is better than a bad deal.\\u201d \\u00a0President Trump has already exited the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) on the basis that it was a bad deal for the U.S. , but the TPP may be revived due to Chinese trade tensions. Iranian OTC volume also spiked recently, potentially in response to the US dropping the Iran nuclear deal . RT recently reported that India will pay for Iranian Oil in Rupees to skirt U.S. sanctions, while Iran switched to the Euro for financial reporting. South American countries Argentina , Brazil , and Chile have all had increases in volume over the past few weeks as well. Peru has posted a record high in the Peruvian Sol and BTC denominations. Venezuela continues to post record highs in Bolivar volume, fueled by hyperinflation . The entire region seems inexorably linked due to instability and Venezuelan mass migration . The re-election of Venezuelan president, Nicol\\u00e1s Maduro Moros, signals that this economic meltdown will continue. There have been some reports that the Venezuelan government has begun \\u201cconfiscating everything to mine cryptocurrencies themselves.\\u201d Ongoing Brexit and recent Italian government debt crisis has not fueled Euro OTC volume as of yet. If the Italian debt crisis mirrors the debt crisis Greece experienced in 2015 , OTC volume may rise sharply. According to economist Desmond Lachman, \\u201conly Greece has a higher debt-to-GDP ratio [than Italy] among countries in the eurozone,\\u201d but Italy\\u2019s economy is 10 times larger than Greece. In September 2017 Circle launched it\\u2019s OTC services in Italy, and is therefore well-positioned ahead of any turmoil. U.S. and Russian tensions seem to vacillate between heated or friendly on any given day depending on who you ask, with the proxy war in Syria generally stoking tensions between the two. Russia\\u2019s gold reserves have been increasing every quarter for the past few years, recently hitting a fresh all time high, and may suggest less tolerance for the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency. Iran and Russia have also recently been in talks to use cryptocurrencies to bypass U.S. sanctions . The Russian legislature passed a draft of law regarding regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies and digital transactions. Paxful, another peer-to-peer OTC exchange, has seen a continued trend of increasing volume week over week. However, the total volume of LocalBitcoins is over three times that of Paxful. Bitcoin exchange traded volume this week has been led by the Tether (USDT) and USD markets for the fifth consecutive week, mostly on Binance, OKEX, and Bitfinex. In Asia, the JPY volume has increased since last week but remains down as a percentage of total volume. The Korean Won (KRW) volume has almost double since last week and the premium has increased as well, currently at 2.4%. China's\\u2019 Yuan (CNY) volume remains minimal based on it\\u2019s historic domination in the past. Technical Analysis Bitcoin price structure has remained in consolidation purgatory since cooling off from a meteoric rise near the end of 2017. Periods of ranging, indecisive price action are critical for the market to regain momentum for a move in either direction. A key hallmark for this is a descending volume profile, which has been the case since the low set in February. Although consolidation within a trend should always be assumed as trend continuation, casting a wide net with analysis, while avoiding analysis paralysis, and mapping out several scenarios is the key to eliminating surprises. Predicting the exact future price is less important than reacting to the price action with a potential trajectory and predetermined target. This process can be done with Chart Patterns, Ichimoku Cloud, Moving Averages, Pitchforks, and historic macro trends. Further background information on the technical analysis discussed below can be found here . A symmetrical triangle has formed as price has consolidated, making lower highs and higher lows. In Technical Analysis of Stock Trends (1948), Edwards and Magee suggest that roughly 75% of these triangles lead to a continuation of the trend, while the rest mark reversals. In any case, this pattern will be a \\u2018trade the breakout\\u2019 situation as it will likely lead to weeks of trend follow through. Breakouts post consolidation typically occur after at least 66% of the triangle has completed (yellow highlight). A multi-month descending volume profile also breeds the possibility for other chart patterns. On the weekly chart, an inverted Head and Shoulders reversal chart pattern. The most obvious problem with this pattern is the left shoulder dips below the trough of the head, which may invalidate the pattern entirely. Nonetheless, the potential structure remains with a 1.618 fib extension and measured move of US$12,000 and US$14,000 respectively. On the daily chart, an inverted Adam and Eve double top chart pattern is also possible, although there are many issues with its current structure and placement relative to price. The Adam (V) nor the horizontal support are completely clean or expected. Inverted patterns are typically seen at the top or markets, not after a downward move. While this makes the probability of the pattern becoming a reality less likely, it does not mean that it cannot happen. An inverted Head and Shoulders appeared on the weekly Oil chart after a significant downward move as well, which reached it\\u2019s 1.618 fib extension almost exactly on target. If this inverted Adam and Eve is real, it yields a price projection of ~US$2,900 and US$4,600 based on the measured move and 1.618 fib extension. The measured move target nearly matches the low set in September, as well as the previous resistance throughout June and August. Bollinger Bands, a measure of price volatility, have also coiled tighter and tighter, as illustrated by the Bollinger Band Width (BBW) indicator. An oscillator similar to RSI, %B, which shows the depth of price relative to the Bands, shows a growing bullish divergence as price dips lower without further expansion of the Bands themselves. The Ichimoku Cloud uses four metrics; the current price in relation to the Cloud, the color of the Cloud (red for bearish, green for bullish), the Tenkan (T) and Kijun (K) cross, and the Lagging Span. The best entry always occurs when most of the signals flip from bearish to bullish, or vice versa. The Cloud metrics on the weekly time frame are; price above Cloud, nearly bearish Cloud, newly bearish TK cross, and Lagging Span in price and above Cloud. Together, these signals suggest the trend is neutral but leaning weakly bullish because price remains above Cloud. This is the first TK cross since 2015, while the previous bearish TK cross in a similar position led to a multi-month downtrend. TK crosses on high timeframes are significant and should be seen a long exit signal for trade entries which began in 2015. Price itself is below the Kijun and, seemingly, in no-man\\u2019s land. A long entry would not be warranted until price is above the Kijun with a bullish TK cross, essentially also above the neckline of the head and shoulders chart pattern. The Cloud metrics on the daily time frame are; price below Cloud, bearish Cloud, newly bearish TK cross, and Lagging Span below price and Cloud. A long entry based on traditional Cloud rules does not occur until the Cloud is breached by price. A short entry has triggered with a bearish TK cross below Cloud, the strongest type of entry signal in the Cloud system. Optimal short entry occurs with a Kijun bounce at US$8,200. On the two day chart, price is flirting with a clean breach of the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) while being bound below the 50EMA as well. A 50\\/200EMA cross on this timeframe would be the first since November 2015, with the last bearish cross (red) resulting in a multi-month downtrend. On the daily chart, price is below the 200EMA, and the 50\\/200EMAs hold a bearish cross. With multiple EMA crosses occurring in succession on the same timeframe, any one cross becomes less valuable as an actionable signal. There is currently a mild hidden bullish divergence on RSI. Open long\\/short interest on Bitfinex is net long and has remained essentially flat over the past few weeks (top panel, chart below). A Pitchfork on the daily chart starting in 2017, with anchor points in January, May, and July, shows price reaching a similar distance below the mean (red line) as was reached above the mean in December. Price has closed this pitchfork for several days suggesting bearish invalidation. If price returns to inside the Pitchfork, a return to the mean is possible. Price has returned to the original upward trending Pitchfork beginning in 2015, with anchor points in January, May, and August of that year. Price broke North of this trend in October 2017 and again currently sits in the upper limits. A downside target of US~$5,300 is possible should price return to the mean (red line) of the prior trend. The OKEX quarterly futures rollover begin at the end of June. The rollover dates have been significant since 2015, with an alternating top\\/bottom price pattern between contract expirations. The entire quarter has been essentially flat thus far, potentially bucking the longstanding trend. The quarterly premium (blue) over the past month has been shrinking each day, with the weekly futures (green) price now below spot. Futures below spot price is an example of backwardation . A large premium over spot, as was seen throughout December and January, is typically an indicator of bullish sentiment, including exuberance and euphoria. This was an example of contango . Conclusion For better or worse, economic and trade policies worldwide have begun to dramatically shift with multiple political uncertainties. Bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies broadly, have more recently represented a global futures market to price-in credit risk or lack of confidence in leadership. CNBC recently discussed Bitcoin as a fear gauge for the market, similar to the volatility index. Technicals are the most bearish they have been in months. Based on the current price structure, breaking up would be much more surprising than breaking down. Admittedly, trend-based indicators like the Cloud become more noisy with non-trending price action, and therefore less reliable for actionable signals. However, even when zooming out on the price action, many of the technicals remain bearish. Currently, the trend indicator to watch is the 50\\/200EMA on the two day timeframe. Although too early to determine, one ray of hope would be the possibility of this entire consolidation period representing re-accumulation. Essentially, the entire bull trend from 2015 has been reset, which gives plenty of fuel for a new all time high just as easily as returning to new lows. The direction may be unclear, but the volume-based momentum will be obvious.\nThe post Bitcoin Price Analysis - Geopolitical turmoil and economic unrest ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

This could mean that the next leg lower is already underway, with the price heading for $2,800 by the end of the year, Day said.\n© 2018 Bloomberg", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text="], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "paul day", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "market securities dubai", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mt. gox", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T14:02:48.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "94d793617287ade472044fa179240f4bf05ae7b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC.lrE1sxj9KdXyWLsDz4d6JPb_Z8Hx1aZzba3e21tMV0CH36_R4apjpQ2k6EgpckmAqgWevaPViKLlY8CebOsCG5_GtO1nsY.PdetaPQJ8Y.FOX7AD7NQYE-", "site_full": "www.newsr.in", "site": "newsr.in", "site_section": "https://www.newsr.in/latest/Markets.htm", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Markets: newsR", "title": "Bitcoin For America: Cryptocurrencies In Campaign Finance - newsR", "title_full": "Bitcoin For America: Cryptocurrencies In Campaign Finance - newsR", "published": "2018-05-31T06:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.079, "main_image": "https://cdn.newsserve.net/700/i/20180531/3744-Bitcoin-For-America-Cryptocurrencies-In-Campaign-Finance.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "94d793617287ade472044fa179240f4bf05ae7b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC.lrE1sxj9KdXyWLsDz4d6JPb_Z8Hx1aZzba3e21tMV0CH36_R4apjpQ2k6EgpckmAqgWevaPViKLlY8CebOsCG5_GtO1nsY.PdetaPQJ8Y.FOX7AD7NQYE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsr.in", "published": "2018-05-31T06:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin For America: Cryptocurrencies In Campaign Finance - newsR", "text": " 17 hours ago )\nAs cryptocurrencies are becoming more mainstream, so are political donations in crypto 👓 View full article", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cryptocurrencies in campaign finance", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T17:31:47.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b119495e485ecc76f3ce1acc0d226d644f886a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmboWHJzkcErCJdFIl1ZF74w-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "bitcoin is the vehicle, we run it", "title_full": "bitcoin is the vehicle, we run it", "published": "2018-05-31T06:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4b119495e485ecc76f3ce1acc0d226d644f886a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmboWHJzkcErCJdFIl1ZF74w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "wallstone", "published": "2018-05-31T06:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin is the vehicle, we run it", "text": "Bitcoin is an amazing system that managed to accelerate the whole wolrd economy and bring some inovation and new opportunities to it.

The VIX has been hailed as the stock markets “fear gauge” since its inception in 1991.\nThe VIX is a measure of volatility in the stock market which is calculated by aggregating the weighted prices of the S&P Index. They utilize the midpoints of real-time SPX option bids for this purpose. It provides a measure of constant, 30-day expected volatility of the US stock market.\nThe VIX index is an indirect indicator of credit risk in the market, as it represents volatility. Stutland said that there is a correlation between the VIX and Bitcoin over the last 30 days. He said:\n“…[It] is starting to measure out credit risk in the market. That’s what cryptocurrency is becoming. It’s becoming a way to sort of de-risk yourself from credit risk in the banking industry.”\nHe also stated that cryptocurrency is still unregulated, offering a way for investors to transfer capital. He also said:\n“Bitcoin is a way to for investors to basically move their money off the balance sheets of banks and into their own wallets. Essentially storing their money under their pillow in the form of virtual currency.”\nCredit risks lead to investors being cautious with their money, due to the inherent risk involved in borrowing from a bank. Stutland said that Bitcoin is “getting ahead of credit risk in the banking industry.”\nThe price of Bitcoin is still in the lows today after last week’s bearish run brought it down to the low $7000s. It attempted a rally yesterday, going up from $7170 to $7440 in just over 2 hours. It is currently trading at around $7500.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian stutland bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian stutland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stutland", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "equity armor investments", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p index", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T11:25:57.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "27803c01e8c1243af054eb34f9dfbedf3ec5de48", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme_gyDIdMISwlibB6VfgHEs-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Bitcoin failed as a currency", "title_full": "Bitcoin failed as a currency", "published": "2018-05-31T06:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "27803c01e8c1243af054eb34f9dfbedf3ec5de48", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme_gyDIdMISwlibB6VfgHEs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "perla", "published": "2018-05-31T06:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin failed as a currency", "text": "Quote: from: ribowo76 on May 30, 2018, 08:47:38 PM With the current transaction speed, as well as high transaction costs.

It is not. It is a fundamental breakdown of the security assumptions.\nProof of work (PoW)'s assumption is that the majority of the hashrate will cooperate and converge on a single chain, because it is most financially advantageous thing to do. When that is no longer the case, PoW is broken and we should just move to something else - not to try to fix it up.\nYou might think that adding checkpoints helps to improve this situation, but consider this:\nEither the checkpoints are created for old blocks (weeks or months old), in which case there is clearly nothing being prevented. A week-deep reorganization would utterly destroy the currency and the trust in it, and not be prevented by this.\nOr the checkpoints are created for recent blocks (days or hours perhaps), in which case they may indeed affect what chain is accepted on the network during certain circumstances, but at the same time it is effectively replacing PoW based consensus with \"developers-decide\" consensus... something that doesn't need a complex peer to peer protocol at all, as effectively developers need to run systems to keep the system in check.\nSo, either checkpoints have an effect - and change the security assumptions into an uninteresting one, or they don't - and they don't matter.\nTo answer your question: the primary reason for removing checkpoints is due to the confusion they create. They make people think they're part of the system's security model (like your question shows). It does not. It was introduced as a necessity for implementing an optimization (skipping script validation) and an unrelated denial-of-service attack (the disk of a new node being filled with low-difficulty blocks during synchronization). Since some changes in the P2P protocol (headers based synchronization) we no longer need checkpoints to do these things safely.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T08:32:35.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "151edfa5fac9a618728540b951301dcc09e1980a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXi7Bix_wZLnE79ibgee_IE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "What are the best bitcoin wallets?", "title_full": "What are the best bitcoin wallets?", "published": "2018-05-31T05:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "151edfa5fac9a618728540b951301dcc09e1980a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXi7Bix_wZLnE79ibgee_IE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "dancingnancy", "published": "2018-05-31T05:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "What are the best bitcoin wallets?", "text": "Quote: from: cryptotank55 on January 07, 2018, 02:44:10 AM Looking for a secure place to store my bitcoins.

Tezos Beta, Mainnet On Horizon The embattled project, which has faced multiple delays, infighting and even consumer lawsuits since its $232 million ICO ended in July 2017, pledged to debut its mainnet release following the successful beta rollout. The custodial Tezos Foundation confirmed the move in a press release and on social media May 29. The betanet is coming! It is important that all contributors verify their donation. Visit https://t.co/uAZ5E5HRWF to learn more. #tezos #tezoslaunch https://t.co/rV6KGVOCNr — Tezos Foundation (@TezosFoundation) May 29, 2018 “After reaching fundamental milestones in recent months, the Tezos Foundation is excited to announce that final preparations for the Tezos beta network («betanet») are underway,” the release reads. As launch approaches, the Foundation will make further announcements with additional details on its official website. Lawsuits Swirl As Bitcoin Suisse Denies Involvement Tezos continues to grapple with the aftermath of several consumer lawsuits which disgruntled investors in the project launched in recent months. Disputes between the project’s creators and the Tezos Foundation served to deaden confidence that a finished product would emerge, with major backer Tim Draper nonetheless avoiding suggestions there were any problems. This month, Bitcoin Suisse, which became embroiled in the legal disputes after offering brokerage services to Tezos, claimed it was never part of the ICO in an official court filing . Meanwhile, ahead of the beta launch, Tezos is demanding that ICO investors “verify” their contribution using a dedicated tool. “A genesis block will be proposed by the Tezos Foundation at betanet launch. To prepare for this, it is imperative that all contributors verify their donation—regardless of size—to confirm that it was received by the Foundation,” the release confirms. Investors will enter their public key hash to check the Foundation has a record of funds sent. Each corresponding hash formed part of the PDF contribution certificate each received upon successful contribution to the ICO. What do you think about Tezos’ progress?

In an interview with The Independent , the former Bitcoin evangelist said that other cryptocurrencies were more technologically advanced than Bitcoin. He identified Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash as the harbingers of the coming flippening. Bitcoin is Outdated Roger Ver used to be one of the staunchest Bitcoin proponents around. These days, however, his tent is firmly pitched in the Bitcoin Cash camp , the first and most popular of all the Bitcoin forks . According to Ver, Bitcoin is outdated when compared to the technically superior features of the other coins presently in existence. Ver believes that Bitcoin’s technology is rife with defects. These defects will ultimately lead to reduced interest in the premier cryptocurrency. In his opinion, many of the more than 1,600 digital currencies currently in existence have been developed to offer more robust and efficient solutions that Bitcoin. Both Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash Will Overtake Bitcoin Ver states that Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash will experience significantly higher growths than Bitcoin in the coming months and years. He even goes as far as predicting that Ethereum will overtake Bitcoin before the year is out, with Bitcoin Cash taking center stage by 2020. I see it happening, and I believe it’s imminent. Ethereum could overtake Bitcoin by the end of the year, and Bitcoin Cash could do the same before 2020. This series of events, known as the flippening , will occur when Bitcoin is no longer the dominant digital currency in the crypto market. According to Ver, Bitcoin’s modest gains over the next few years and months will be unable to keep up with the relentless march of Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Can and Will Adapt Not everyone agrees with Ver’s logic, however. Some experts believe that Bitcoin can assimilate any paradigm-shifting technology, thus maintaining its dominance of the market. Michael Jackson of venture firm Mangrove Capital Partners believes that Bitcoin will overcome the problems currently facing the network: There is so much talent in the crypto space, and people are working on solving these scalability problems. I don’t see why bitcoin shouldn’t remain in the number one spot. It is still by far the best known, and it is ultimately the reserve currency in the space.

The market maker and regular CNBC contributor told the network’s post-market show Fast Money yesterday that “Bitcoin is sort of becoming the new VIX, in sort of getting ahead of credit risk in the banking industry.” VIX, which stands for the CBOE Volatility Index, is a popular and trusted measurement of both volatility and fear in the traditional financial market. It utilizes S&P 500 stock options prices and is often referred to as the stock market’s “fear gauge.” Stutland, however, thinks Bitcoin might be better than the VIX. He explained: There is huge correlation right now between VIX and bitcoin 30 days ago, 30 trading days ago, that is starting to measure out credit risk in the market. That’s what cryptocurrency is becoming. It’s becoming a way to sort of de-risk yourself from credit risk in the banking industry. Stutland bases his assessment on the fact that the Bitcoin and greater cryptocurrency market is still unregulated and allows for the open and easy transfer of capital, noting: Bitcoin is a way to for investors to basically move their money off the balance sheets of banks and into their own wallets. Essentially storing their money under their pillow in the form of virtual currency. Stutland also made note of the fact that increased credit from banks facilitates caution on the part of investors, claiming: As credit risk increases we get more volatility in the market. As noted by CNBC, the VIX reached highs of 18.39 yesterday, up from lows of 12.59 on Friday. Tuesday was decidedly bearish for all three major indexes, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping almost 500 points at its lowest. On the flip side, the Bitcoin market saw a bounceback from what had been a brutally bearish downtrend. The market leader is currently trading, at the time of this writing, at $7,520.49, up 5.42 percent over the last 24 hours. When Bitcoin moves, altcoins follow. Many major market players in the cryptocurrency space saw healthy gains yesterday, with Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS , Stellar, Cardano, IOTA, and TRON all up between 10 and 20 percent over the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin price volatility is known to be highly significant. It suffers from dramatic short-term price fluctuations conveying downside risk. However, from a long-term perspective, Bitcoin’s price is substantially up since early 2017 . Bitcoin’s Long-Term Skyrocketing Trajectory Bitcoin is down considerably since early January 2017. However, if we calm the jitters caused by short-term Bitcoin price fluctuations and focus on the long-term trend, we can see that the cryptocurrency continues to perform spectacularly. As Ran NeuNer recently tweeted, “Bitcoin down 50% this year but still up 700% since 1 Jan. 2017.” Bitcoin down 50% this year but still up 700% since 1 Jan 2017. pic.twitter.com/kxPds6GZUF — Ran NeuNer (@cryptomanran) May 27, 2018 Granted, if you entered the market after January 2017, this information might not be relevant. Indeed, if you are a short-term cryptocurrency investor, you might be losing money. Short-term and long-term investments carry different degrees of risk. Short-term investing carries more downside risk because it more closely resembles gambling. On the other hand, long-term investment involves holding a vehicle for more than a year, or several years. Therefore, early Bitcoin adopters are doing well, even if they have had to suffer long bear market periods, as shown in the chart below. Financial investors advise diversifying. For instance, Edward Jones, Financial Advisor, writes : As an investor, you’ll probably need a mix of long-term and short-term vehicles. By knowing the differences between these two categories, you should have a good idea of what to expect from your investments — and this knowledge can help you make those choices that are right for you. The Trend Is Your Friend Certainly, whether Bitcoin’s price will continue its ascending trajectory is unknown. Nevertheless, predictions on both sides abound . For example, The Motley Fool predicts that the entrance of institutional investors will be detrimental “as it introduces their crypto skepticism and deep pockets into the equation.” Conversely, others predict that Bitcoin’s price will increase precisely because of the entrance of institutional investors. Explaining why “Bitcoin is a buy despite its continued losses,” Spencer Bogart, blockchain venture capitalist, declared to CNBC : Every major bank is trying to do something in the space. Either they’re going to be offering bitcoin to their clients, they’re working on a custody platform or they’re opening up a trading desk. A deeper institutionalization of bitcoin is overall positive. Indeed, there are as many predictions as predictors. But the truth is that financial markets are unpredictable. Long-term investing is less risky than short-term. And, do not forget that “the trend is your friend.” Do you think the entrance of financial Institutions into the crypto market will affect Bitcoin’s price positively or negatively?

This is $100 less than where it stood yesterday afternoon, though the currency was trading for as high as $7,500 during Tuesday’s evening hours. The bitcoin arena is something of a mixed bag. For example, China’s president Xi Jinping recently endorsed blockchain technology, stating that it has the potential to heal global economies. Speaking at a recent conference with the Chinese Academy of Sciences this week, Jinping said that the advantages of the blockchain are crucial to the development of the 21st century, and he’s hoping for elevated adoption in China. “Ever since the start of the 21st century, a new generation of industrial revolution is substantially reshaping the global economic structure with artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and blockchain constantly making application breakthroughs,” he stated. This marks a serious shift in opinion, as up to this point, China has been one of the strictest countries when it comes to cryptocurrency and blockchain regulation. On the other hand, popular South Korean digital currency exchange Bithumb has announced it will proceed with a trading ban in 11 countries starting in mid-June. Some of the nations included are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Ethiopia, Serbia, and Trinidad and Tobago. The exchange is eager to enforce anti-money laundering laws ever since its offices were raided in early January, and wants to ensure its customers are safe and protected. These countries, along with five others, do not possess valid legislation that stands against money laundering and other illicit activities in the financial space, according to company executives. All accounts stemming from these countries will be shut down by June 21. Upbit – South Korea’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency exchange – was also raided in April on suspicious of embezzlement, while four executives from other trading platforms in South Korea have been arrested and charged with fraud. It is unclear if the announcement bore any negative consequences on the price and caused the drop from yesterday’s high. The good news is that analysts say recovery is likely imminent, and investors have a lot to look forward to in the coming weeks. One source, for example, says that today’s small , but noticeable price drop, is part of a consolidation process after a significantly aggressive move that took the price up by roughly $400 yesterday from the previous day. Bitcoin has been trading with a narrowing range, but market trends still show it moving higher as the pressure from recent sell-offs finally begins to subside. A heavy supply zone is witnessed at the $7,600 mark, while resistance is likely to occur at $7,560. However, key support has moved up to $7,470. Another source suggests that bitcoin’s newfound uptrends can be attributed to political activity in Italy and southern Europe. The country’s constitutional crisis and fears of the nation leaving the Euro-zone ultimately led to global stocks and the euro falling overnight, while the U.S. dollar and various cryptocurrencies appear to be gaining in value and substance. It is unclear if this is coincidence or correlation, but bitcoin is showing future bull behavior as Italy undergoes serious financial change, and many investors are jumping into the foray without asking questions. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xi jinping", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jinping", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chinese academy of sciences", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T03:53:08.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c21f3ea10cce4b99ab85cf76e3791888022c3c11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbGfFkmSO44jXO1shc8ZR5Y-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "The future of the Bitcoin", "title_full": "The future of the Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-31T05:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.055, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c21f3ea10cce4b99ab85cf76e3791888022c3c11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbGfFkmSO44jXO1shc8ZR5Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JonathanCoper", "published": "2018-05-31T05:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "The future of the Bitcoin", "text": "I think Bitcoin will have a great place in the future.

users from using bitcoin with big blocks - as long as there is a way to communicate short messages people will keep using the chain almost as before, and it seems to me there has been a massive propaganda campaign to make people believe they still have to \"run their own nodes\" as a way to resist censorship when they don't even help to keep the chain alive!\nOnce the distinction between miners and users is clear the choices BTC made into the 2nd layer seem useless if not hazardous.\n submitted by /u/unitedstatian\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

want to implement more features that can risk peoples funds, especially if people dont read the sighash/op codes of transactions to see if funds can be manipulated by others.\nbut it seems no one will talk about the risks of the new features but instead divert attention away from core implementing new features without a level playing field of consensus. by talking about these social drama crap that has nothing to do with code/risk\nthis new drama. is to try to this time give another fork the name bitcoin core.. so that people cannot call the network that the REAL core team control and own that same title.\nthus pushing for people to call the network which the REAL CORE TEAM control just bitcoin. because bitcoin core is taken by a crapfork. even though core still should not own bitcoin brand..\nbecause\nCORE do control the (btc) network, and thats why the network should be called bitcoin core.(i mean btc should be bitcoin core.. not this new distraction $BTCC)\nafter all.. think of it this way, imagine if armoury/ btcd (other clients on the btc network) tried to suggest that they were the reference/centre of the network like core does. core would not be happy and REKT them, fork them.\nother implementations are not on the same level as core so its not a level network to give it the network a broad open name like the old 2009-2017 network had\nthe bilateral split of august 2017 seen to it that core gained control of one copy of 2009-2017 network and another team gain (BLOQ) gained control of another copy of the 2009-2017 network. and BOTH went different directions.\nit was not a unilateral split. it was a bilateral split. thus both have no claim over the brand . an no one should lay claim to the brand. so to easily identify which network is which. make it clear\nbitcoin core\nbitcoin cash\njust like the fiat world. no country can lay claim to the \"dollar\" . so make it clear\nU.S dollar\ncanadian dollar.\nin common communication people can abbreviate it to just 'dollar','bitcoin' if the content of the conversations is obvious which currency/community/network they are inside. but nethier should say that they are THE dollar / THE bitcoin. because no one should own \"bitcoin\" brand.\nif you wish to deny that core are making the claiims that core own the network. take a hard look at bitcoin.org and cores github.\nhttps://bitcoin.org/en/development\neverything points to saying that bitcoin is a core project.. and that anyone can take part by joining cores project\nand then saying that other clients are other projects\nbitcoin.org and the github are centred around core as THE project\nthus the network should be defined as bitcoin core until these things happen:\ncore declare they will never again bilateral split or unilateral split off any opponents to cores bips.. meaning if the community do not majority agree with core.. then tough luck core, compromise and unite the communty next time.\ncore declare they use proper community consensus as it was intented\ncore declare to allow other clients to release new features and require consensus without REKT, fork campaigns.\nand\nwhen needed core and other clients work together to take a bit of feature X feature Y from the community where by the whole community CAN come to a consensus upgrade agrement where all clients, including core would include code for. to upgrade the network without rekt,fork,bypassing consensus.\nbut until core declare this, and denounce their monarchy. then the (BTC) network by cores own admission should be known as bitcoin core. but not let core own the brand bitcoin. no one should own the brand\nanyway.. whil we all see the sheep play out thir social drama finer pointy crap. whats happening at code/protocol level of the network the real core devs control will not get discussed and core will slide in new features which could put peoples funds at risk if they dont check out raw tx data
