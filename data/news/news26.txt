Gox bitcoin exchange and also the co-founder of Stellar . He predicts that the blockchain technology will create a universal payment network. The phenomenon of the initial coin offerings also manifests that most markets are not tapped by the financial system. According to a financial research conducted by Autonomous Next, the initial coin offerings have increased their equivalent to approximately 9 million U.S dollars within the last four years. The increase in funds into the initial coin offerings has led to an increase in the number of fraudulent fundraisers. The token sale is a new fundraising model that is channeled directly to retail investors who contribute to projects by purchasing the digital coins. Jeb McCaleb also anticipates that the cryptoassets will be digitized using the same technology. Some startups have already started to link the digital tokens world with the traditional financial markets. Mr. McCaleb is an experienced developer in the world of cryptocurrency.\nJed McCaleb is a cryptocurrency pioneer and has been involved in various large crypto organizations including Mt. Gox Bitcoin Exchange. He is currently the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Stellar. Stellar Developmant Foundation develops cryptocurrency network for cross-border payments. The company shared its views with CNB.com about how the cryptocurrency and the new blockchain technology were going to gain power in the near future. According to Jed, a new universal payments network will be developed. The network will include a public ledger whereby people will be able to view and change currencies thereby allowing people to use common currencies like dollars and euros. Stellar is developing solutions to these concerns. The network carries transaction settlement within five seconds or less hence allowing users to exchange government currencies like the U. S dollars quickly. As a result, IBM is currently using the network to create a cross-border payment system with various big banks.\nAs mentioned on Crunchbase , McCaleb founded Stellar before selling it to Mark Karpeles in 2011. He then co-founded Ripple. Ripple’s XRP coin is the third largest coin based on market capitalization. He then founded Stellar in 2014 whose XLM coins are among the 10th largest coins by market capitalization. Mr. McCaleb is also an advisor to MIRI, a company that conducts research on artificial intelligence.

Also, it has been reported that American universities have started investing in crypto hedge funds. The investments are on a limited scale but nevertheless indicate a growing interest from academic institutions. And, authorities in Belgium warn the public about crypto scams with a “Too good to be true” website.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Tuesday: Exchange ETF Action and Wozniak Wants Bitcoin to Rule World\nFinancial Authorities in Germany Find Six Institutions Trading Cryptos At least six financial institutions in Germany trade cryptocurrencies, the country’s Federal Ministry of Finance revealed. The information emerged from an answer to a question filed by Bundestag member Thomas Lutze. The figure is based on findings of the German financial regulator Bafin , which supervises the financial sector and is also expected to monitor crypto trading activities. The banks involved were not named.\nThere is no case registered with Bafin against financial institutions suspected of any breach of money laundering regulations, due diligence requirements, nor reporting obligations regarding cryptocurrencies, the Bundesfinanzministerium said, quoted by Reuters . Each such institution, which has permission to trade properties, also has the right to set up mechanisms allowing the exchange of bitcoin to euros and vice versa, the ministry noted.\nThe Finance ministry also said that the issuance of a digital central bank money is currently not an option in the Eurozone, “given the wide range of unresolved issues and significant risks associated with unclear benefits.” According to the report, the Federal government in Berlin does not see crypto-related risks to the stability of the financial markets due to the low market capitalization of cryptocurrencies and the limited interdependence with the financial sector.\nEast Coast Universities Invest in Crypto Hedge Funds Academic institutions in the US have started making small investments into cryptocurrency hedge funds, according to a lawyer working in the industry. These universities are getting involved on a limited basis for strategic reasons, the founder of Capital Fund Law Group, John Lore, told Business Insider . “I can’t say the names because that’s attorney-client but we have people mostly on the East Coast that have begun doing investments in this space on a fairly modest basis,” he added.\nThe New York-based law group specializes in providing legal services to the hedge fund industry. According to Lore, at this point investors are putting in very small percentages of their net worth into these new funds. He doesn’t expect institutional investors, such as pension funds, to invest in crypto soon, with one notable exception – university endowment funds, some of which have already begun to invest on a limited scale. “We see academia as a tie between these somewhat young and enthusiastic fund managers and capital raising,” the lawyer said.\nCryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technologies have seen a growing interest from universities. Leading academic institutions, such as Cambridge and Oxford, have introduced crypto and blockchain related courses. In December, the Belarusian National Technical University announced a diploma course covering cryptocurrencies, derivatives, and ICOs, as news.Bitcoin.com reported . In April, the Fundacao Getulio Vargas University in Sao Paulo launched “Brazil’s first Master’s degree in cryptofinance.” It has been reported that North Korea’s Pyongyang University is also offering educational courses on cryptocurrencies.\nBelgian Regulators Warn About Crypto Scams with New Website Financial authorities and regulators in Belgium have launched a website dedicated to warning the public about crypto scams and raising awareness about the associated risks. The move comes in response to substantial increase in interest towards investing in cryptocurrencies and related products. The site, temooiomwaartezijn.be (“Too good to be true”), can also be used to report suspicious offers and projects in the crypto space.\nBelgians can find there useful tips on how to avoid fraudulent schemes. The site advises investors to make sure they know who they are dealing with, check if a project is registered as a scam and never share sensitive personal data. Regulators say people should always request clear and understandable information, take their time to critically evaluate an offer before accepting it and be wary of promises of excessive profits. “If the return seems too good to be true, it usually is. Profit is never guaranteed,” they warn.\nScam-related losses of almost €2.2 million have been reported to financial authorities in the country, with at least 118 victims having contacted Belgium’s Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA). Belgian regulators claim only 4% of the cases are reported. According to their estimates, the total financial loss from fraud related to cryptocurrencies amounts to around 130 million euros annually. In March, the financial watchdog published a list of 19 cryptocurrency trading platforms showing signs of fraud. Last month, the FSMA expanded its blacklist including more businesses reported by customers.\nWhat are your thoughts on today’s topics in Bitcoin in Brief?

An enquiry is underway by the concerned regulatory authorities and I stand committed to extend all my cooperation to the law enforcement agency,” Kundra said, clearing the air on the issue in a statement.\nA businessman with interest in sports, this is not Kundra’s first brush with law.\nIn the past, he had appeared before different authorities on his investments in the Rajasthan Royals IPL team.\nSome members of that team were also embroiled in the cricket spot-fixing scandal.\nIn his statement here vis-A-vis the media speculation of his grilling, Kundra said: “I am terribly disappointed by the irresponsible reporting carried out by some sections of the media. Clarity on the issue should have been sought before carrying such headlines.”\n“The authorities, summoned me merely as a witness, as the accused Amit Bharadwaj happens to be an acquaintance and some introductions were made hence there is a certain protocol being followed by the agencies,” said Kundra.\nHe added that Bharadwaj was intending to buy a team in his Poker League and had entered into a contract with them for the same.\n“However, he was expelled on account of non-payment of fees and I was called as a witness in this connection. While we continuously strive to keep taking steps to improve our reputation, these type of unconfirmed, baseless, reports severely dent our market perception and erode investor sentiments,” he said.\n“Notwithstanding what has happened, at Viaan Industries, we shall continue to focus on growing our gaming and media vertical. We remain excited about the company’s future and strive to keep adding shareholder value,” he said.\nIt may be recalled, the ED, sometime back, had registered a criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against a bitcoin-based investment website GainBitcoin, its founder Amit Bhardwaj and eight others.\nThe ED had alleged that about 8,000 investors lost around Rs 2,000 crore funds by transacting in this scheme.\nThe Pune police had later arrested Bhardwaj and his brother Vivek in the case. tags", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "raj kundra", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "amit bhara", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "raj kundra raj kundra", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kundra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shilpa shetty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kunal", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "indo asian news service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poker league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enforcement directorate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ians", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ballard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T19:30:00.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0fbe6a2b3c050aeda223f052e8885a911d9840a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_hQ0jFPMhvIa4r4KiV3f1.GvPc61nTx8bpVKGhaZt3BegCN54HEh3fQmHojD7SWcEJ5Hf_8teAsQ--", "site_full": "www.homepokergames.com", "site": "homepokergames.com", "site_section": "http://www.homepokergames.com/vbforum/forumdisplay.php?f=25", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Poker Strategy - HomePokerGames Poker Forum", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Bitcoin-crans", "title_full": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Bitcoin-crans - HomePokerGames Poker Forum", "published": "2018-06-06T14:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.025, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0fbe6a2b3c050aeda223f052e8885a911d9840a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_hQ0jFPMhvIa4r4KiV3f1.GvPc61nTx8bpVKGhaZt3BegCN54HEh3fQmHojD7SWcEJ5Hf_8teAsQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Helenwog", "published": "2018-06-06T14:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "XEvil 4.0 allow to get Bitcoins via Bitcoin-crans", "text": "XRumer 16.0 + XEvil 4.0 : NEW revolutional software for solving any CAPTCHA's 1.

The information emerged from an answer to a question filed by Bundestag member Thomas Lutze. The figure is based on findings of the German financial regulator Bafin , which supervises the financial sector and is also expected to monitor crypto trading activities. The banks involved were not named.\nThere is no case registered with Bafin against financial institutions suspected of any breach of money laundering regulations, due diligence requirements, nor reporting obligations regarding cryptocurrencies, the Bundesfinanzministerium said, quoted by Reuters . Each such institution, which has permission to trade properties, also has the right to set up mechanisms allowing the exchange of bitcoin to euros and vice versa, the ministry noted.\nThe Finance ministry also said that the issuance of a digital central bank money is currently not an option in the Eurozone, \"given the wide range of unresolved issues and significant risks associated with unclear benefits.\" According to the report, the Federal government in Berlin does not see crypto-related risks to the stability of the financial markets due to the low market capitalization of cryptocurrencies and the limited interdependence with the financial sector.\nEast Coast Universities Invest in Crypto Hedge Funds Academic institutions in the US have started making small investments into cryptocurrency hedge funds, according to a lawyer working in the industry.

Leading academic institutions, such as Cambridge and Oxford, have introduced crypto and blockchain related courses.

The site, temooiomwaartezijn.be (\"Too good to be true\"), can also be used to report suspicious offers and projects in the crypto space.\nBelgians can find there useful tips on how to avoid fraudulent schemes. The site advises investors to make sure they know who they are dealing with, check if a project is registered as a scam and never share sensitive personal data.

The initial announcement that came out in January said that Brisbane Airport authorities have announced plans to use cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange on all the outlets in the airport premises. The airport’s administration said, “the reduction of customer inconvenience due to the requirement of carrying multiple currencies and credit cards.” While the value of Bitcoins is falling, a move like this will enhance its value again.\nThe payment system has been developed by a Brisbane-based fintech startup called TravelbyBit. Reportedly, TravelbyBit has received more than $85,000 from a commercialization assistance fund. This has helped to develop a system which will be used by customers to pay using Bitcoins or any other cryptocurrency. While the merchants can also choose cryptocurrency or real currency in which they want to receive the money.\nThe General Manager of Strategic Planning and Development of the airport said that this step has been taken while keeping in view the number of crypto investors worldwide. He also added that he is proud of the Brisbane airport for being the first global airport which has worked with a local startup to bring the service to the table. TravelbyBit is also working on a tourist map route which has all the businesses listed that are accepting Bitcoin as a medium of exchange in the famous tourists’ spots in the country.\nThere are 30 outlets in Brisbane airport which are using the new system.

Most agree that the use of digital money is not as simple as other forms of payment.\nAs a means of payment, the currency should be more human, and the industry should strive to improve the basic function of the main services, let consumers are more likely to use it daily, let the default wallet function more intuitive.\nThe bitcoin industry needs to shift gears, not to think about what's going to happen next, and to ignore what's going on.\nBitcoin is easy to use as a payment but transaction fee and late confirmation is not good. Bitcoin volatile goes up and down i think it's not advisable to use bitcoin as a payment for now but the near future i know will be okay the transaction and fees.

However, the ministry said the use of bitcoin mining machines has shown complications in management, with the potential to be used illegally as a currency or in other non-cash payment methods. Cryptocurrency is considered an illegal non-cash payment method in Vietnam. The use of virtual money as a means of payment is prohibited and will be handled according to the country’s legal regulations.

An organisation based in the city, Modern Tech, reportedly duped 32,000 individuals in an investment of approximately VNĐ15 trillion (US$666 million) in two fraudulent digital currency projects. This forced State management agencies to have strict solutions in place on the import of bitcoin mining machines, MoF said. So far, the country has imported some 15,600 bitcoin mining machines. These were mainly imported into three major cities — HCM City, Hanoi and Đà Nẵng.

Follow Torjus Although the new predicted value is more than halved, bitcoin price is still expected to surge (Source: Getty) Torjus Roberg\nBitcoin will fail to meet January's end-of-year price forecast of $33,000 (£24,600) according to experts who now expects the price per coin to reach $14,638 by December.\nThe world's most popular cryptocurrency bitcoin, currently valued at $7,601 per coin, will lose more than half of its earlier predicted value due to stagnant pricing and the crypto still recovering from the price plunge at the start of the year, according to experts at finder.com.\nJohn Ostler, chief executive of finder.com, said: “Our June report shows that bitcoin is not set to recover this year. In fact, our panellists were much more optimistic in January where they were expecting it to hit £24,791 by year's end.”\n“Now, our panel is forecasting less than half of this, at £10,995 by 31 December, likely because bitcoin hasn't risen above £10,000 since it fell in January this year.”\nRead more : Steve Wozniak says bitcoin could become single global currency\nThe cryptocurrency predictions report also forecast that the crypto EOS will be the best performing this year with a predicted 206 per cent price increase by the end of the year to $38.25.\nNone of the 13 cryptos examined are expected to suffer a loss in value by the end of the year, however, IOTA and Monero may suffer eight and seven per cent loss respectively by July.\nJames Lynch, chief executive of CastleCoin, said: “The expected influx of institutional money and increased adoption of cryptocurrency as a whole will likely lead to an increase in the value of bitcoin.”\n“The market is moving towards a state of maturity, and it is unlikely we are going to see the explosive increase we witnessed last year.”\nAaron LePoidevin, co-founder of Every Capital, said: “While I am positive on the longer-term prospects, in the short term, bitcoin might have some downward pressure, as it looks like it could close below the 50-week moving average, with bears pushing prices lower.”\n“There could be a corrective rally, but perhaps not until the third quarter. The Consensus summit in New York showed the strong underlying interest in bitcoin and its applications.”\nIn December last year, bitcoin prices peaked at almost $20,000 per coin causing a worldwide crypto craze before plummeting in the first few months of this year reaching its lowest point since the surge at around $7,000.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://iptc.org/std/rNews/2011-10-07#"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "getty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "torjus roberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john ostler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "torjus roberg bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T14:06:42.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4e5579d8b6237f3f02e1eadec5fc92787827fce3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.6ZH3O918V0hP9zL432TPAr36_XeIIarPZMBQ6P0y_XU_UrYT7h3xACL.EdDajFwoy7YkKqbLtUxwgpLt_Ai9j", "site_full": "www.investorideas.com", "site": "investorideas.com", "site_section": "http://www.investorideas.com/rss/feeds/iimain.xml", "site_categories": ["investing", "stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "Investorideas.com newswire, breaking global stock and business news", "title": "SinglePoint (OTCQB: $SING) Completes Commercial for Bitcoin Wallet Featuring Original Shark Tank Member Kevin Harrington and Provides Update on Form 10", "title_full": "SinglePoint (OTCQB: $SING) Completes Commercial for Bitcoin Wallet Featuring Original Shark Tank Member Kevin Harrington and Provides Update on Form 10", "published": "2018-06-06T14:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4e5579d8b6237f3f02e1eadec5fc92787827fce3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.6ZH3O918V0hP9zL432TPAr36_XeIIarPZMBQ6P0y_XU_UrYT7h3xACL.EdDajFwoy7YkKqbLtUxwgpLt_Ai9j", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T14:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "SinglePoint (OTCQB: $SING) Completes Commercial for Bitcoin Wallet Featuring Original Shark Tank Member Kevin Harrington and Provides Update on Form 10", "text": "Shop\nSinglePoint (OTCQB: $SING) Completes Commercial for Bitcoin Wallet Featuring Original Shark Tank Member Kevin Harrington and Provides Update on Form 10\nSEATTLE - June 6, 2018 (Investorideas.com Newswire) SinglePoint Inc.

Others claim that it is making a massive invasion right here in the states. One of those states happens to be the Silver State—Nevada. Even though bitcoin has slowly become the word on the street, it appears Nevada business is turning it into a household name.\nThose Rising Bitcoins! Bitcoin is a virtual currency. It is controlled by a regionalized network of users. Most businesses appreciate the fact that it is not directly subject to the impulses of the central banking powers that be. They are also happy about the fact that it is not regulated by national governments. Even though there are hundreds of cryptocurrencies in active use these days, bitcoin is without a doubt the most widespread and extensively used. It is the nearest digital money equal to conventional, state-stamped monetary forms.\nIt is no surprise that Nevada’s plentiful sunshine, which often lures in businesses from all over the country, has become sucked up into the bitcoin mania. Some are saying that it is with good reason. One of those reasons is the bitcoin’s significant advantage— liquidity. As the most well-liked cryptocurrency by a significant margin, bitcoin has far superior liquidity than its contemporaries.\nBy contrast, most other digital forms of money either cannot be traded straightforward for fiat monetary standards or lose significant incentive amid such trades. However, this is not the case with bitcoin. It is incentives like these that draw in companies like C4Mining Company in Clark County. This company offers cryptocurrency mining services to allow non-technical shortlisted clients to produce bitcoin through the mining process. The business is scheduled to lease a 100,000-square-foot building in the southern part of the state, which will be its main mining venture.\nNevada businesses do not appear to be shy about accepting a cryptocurrency and worldwide payment systems, which is what bitcoin encompasses. However, what they are shying away from are some of the cons that come with it such as fraud.\nThe Scams As the world’s most prominent digital money, bitcoin has seen more than its fair share of rip-offs, schemes, and attacks. For those businesses familiar with this the bitcoin system, the majority are aware of its imperfections. There is no secret that bitcoin’s weak points have a history of exploitation by sophisticated hackers. Many of which are looking to pocket bitcoin for their use.\nTwo of bitcoin’s evident qualities: its political autonomy and solid secrecy securities – really make it more alluring to criminals and fraudsters. In numerous districts, bitcoin inhabits a legal gray area, indicating local law enforcement authorities look at theft prevention as a low concern. Furthermore, it is often tough for the authorities to indict those guilty for bitcoin attacks, many of which derive in politically on the edge or unfriendly nations. Even with all the red flags, Nevada businesses still cannot wait to get their hands on the bitcoin.\nApproved and Ready One of those businesses is the bitcoin mining tech company mentioned earlier, C4Mining Company. They just became one of the state-approved business applications by the Nevada Governor’s Office of Economic Development. Board members, on March 15, 2018, approved applications for 12 businesses all over the state. These companies would, in fact, create more than 654 new jobs and approximately $500 million in the capital venture.\nAs stated by Gov. Brian Sandoval,\nAfter leading the nation in private-sector job growth last year, Nevada is off to a strong start in 2018, and this impressive slate of diverse companies, either relocating to or expanding in the Silver State, will help to guarantee our growing workforce remains to have access to a steady, sustainable job market and rising wages.\nAmong these is EdgeCore, which has scheduled to construct a 1.1 million square foot data epicenter in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center. Governor Sandoval believes that these businesses are going to usher in a “New Nevada.” He believes that the industry mixture and the potential for growth will help the future of Nevada’s economy. Sandoval also trusts that it will be an economy that will have the capability to endure financial recessions.\nThe Booming Blockchain Some Nevada businesses have their eyes set on the blockchain. Even though bitcoin has progressively turned into a worldwide success, the fundamental innovation behind it — known as blockchain — has not risen to its occasion yet. Nevertheless, it has discovered an ongoing home in Nevada Ruling. The blockchain is, at its least complex, a sort of a young innovation. It can be utilized to track and keep secure a wide range of various records, things like money related exchanges, shipping information, and birth testaments.\nFinancial advancement authorities, tech organizations, and blockchain advocates see a brilliant future for the innovation in Nevada, with the state’s large measures of land and generally economic vitality costs.\nTo finish it off, they say that the state said “let’s do it” when it passed a blockchain charge a year ago, motioning to organizations that Nevada understands what blockchain is, and is keen on giving organizations the space they desire to advance more technological businesses.\nIt appears that not only is bitcoin making its debut in Nevada, but the state is ushering in the new age of businesses that seem ready to embrace technological change.\nBy Jomo Merritt\nEdited by Jeanette Smith\nResources:\nNorth Nevada Business: Bitcoin mining tech company among state-approved business applications\nThe Nevada Independent: Amid Tech Boom, Nevada wants to become home for block-chain related businesses\nLas Vegas Review-Journal: Bitcoin mining Company setting up in Southern Nevada\nImage by Famartin Courtesy of Wikimedia – Creative Commons License\n Business , Nevada , spot", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin · guardian liberty voice many", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "nevada business", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "silver state", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T16:30:06.065+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4ebd88b45d964ca61fe10c29dddcbd7519672695", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTbZomleLMJDY_G8VeAiIxWi.yGge_2SSjmkdazJrd5M5WtKfJYZfhlBsaw0uu8qzFD80skEPdu34yqBuG5UPAsRUXm.dtK6pW4HGypbAz3GQ--", "site_full": "chogyiwrtcmobileteam.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://chogyiwrtcmobileteam.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "bosa@entrepreneur.blogspot.com", "title": "The bitcoin boom: How colocation datacentres are cashing in on cryptocurrency mining", "title_full": "The bitcoin boom: How colocation datacentres are cashing in on cryptocurrency mining", "published": "2018-06-06T13:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4ebd88b45d964ca61fe10c29dddcbd7519672695", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTbZomleLMJDY_G8VeAiIxWi.yGge_2SSjmkdazJrd5M5WtKfJYZfhlBsaw0uu8qzFD80skEPdu34yqBuG5UPAsRUXm.dtK6pW4HGypbAz3GQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cho gyi1980 (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-06T13:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "The bitcoin boom: How colocation datacentres are cashing in on cryptocurrency mining", "text": "Latest Technology News and Expert Advice A roundup of news and tips on the topics you're interested in | June 06, 2018 ISSUE HIGHLIGHTS The bitcoin boom: How colocation datacentres are cashing in on cryptocurrency mining Keeping cloud costs in check: Why good governance is key Who needs hybrid cloud object storage?

An enquiry is underway by the concerned regulatory authorities and I stand committed to extend all my cooperation to the law enforcement agency,” Kundra said, clearing the air on the issue in a statement.\nA businessman with interest in sports, this is not Kundra’s first brush with law.\nIn the past, he had appeared before different authorities on his investments in the Rajasthan Royals IPL team.\nSome members of that team were also embroiled in the cricket spot-fixing scandal.\nIn his statement here vis-A-vis the media speculation of his grilling, Kundra said: “I am terribly disappointed by the irresponsible reporting carried out by some sections of the media. Clarity on the issue should have been sought before carrying such headlines.”\n“The authorities, summoned me merely as a witness, as the accused Amit Bharadwaj happens to be an acquaintance and some introductions were made hence there is a certain protocol being followed by the agencies,” said Kundra.\nHe added that Bharadwaj was intending to buy a team in his Poker League and had entered into a contract with them for the same.\n“However, he was expelled on account of non-payment of fees and I was called as a witness in this connection.

First, to remove the current minimum “dust limit” of 546 Satoshi. This will makes it is possible for users to send as little as 1 Satoshi via a BCH transaction. Any miner can accept a 1 Satoshi transaction amount, and it should be included in a valid block that all other miners will accept.\nSecond, to accept some free (zero mining fee) transactions in each block they mine. CoinGeek and nChain believe that miners should be able to accept free transactions, rather than requiring users to pay a minimum of 1 Satoshi per byte. In addition, if miners choose to accept some transactions with zero mining fee, this further encourages more Bitcoin Cash transaction usage.\nCoinGeek and nChain believe in miner choice, and a healthy competitive marketplace for miners. They invite other miners to join them in this “Miner’s Choice” initiative to ignite growth of Bitcoin Cash usage.

The team states that the planned network upgrade is underway and that the majority of the components needed for it are already prepared.\nA hard fork is seemingly underway for the Bitcoin Gold network as announced in an official update dated June 4 th . The upgrade comes as an answer to two pressing issues – the threat of ASIC miners for the Equihash space and the spate of 51% attacks that have plagued Bitcoin Gold, Verge, and ZCash of late.\nThe Threat of ASIC Miners Back in October 2017, Bitcoin Gold emerged as a hard fork of the main Bitcoin blockchain, taking place at block 491407. The forked network introduced an alteration to the hash algorithm which is used to mine Bitcoin. It rendered Bitcoin application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) useless.\nHowever, Bitmain has since introduced a new ASIC called Antminer Z9. It's specifically designated to mine cryptocurrencies based on Bitcoin Gold's underlying Equihash Proof-of-Work algorithm. To this, the team quickly responded :\nWe will not allow that to happen. ASIC-resistance is central to our mission.\nThe team will be carrying out upgrades over the existing Equihash algorithm, calling the newer version Equihash-BTG. In a nutshell, the solution is to adopt new parameters to the existing algorithm, requiring \"dramatically\" more memory for the ASIC to run and causing mining attempts to be \"impossibly unprofitable.\"\nTackling 51% Attacks The algorithm update, according to the team, has a secondary effect. Immediately after the fork, the new network is going to become a lot safer from 51% attacks. As it stands, Bitcoin Gold shares its algorithm with a lot of other coins. This suggests that the collective pool's Equihash power is far greater than the one of BTG's underlying network, making it easily susceptible to attacks of the kind.\nAccording to the team, as soon as the updated Proof of Work algorithm comes to light and Bitcoin Gold takes off on its own algorithm, the network's hashpower won't be large enough for someone to try and control.\nThe news must come as a relief to the BTG community, especially after the recent events. In late May, Bitcoin Gold's network was subjected to 51% attack in which the hacker made off with $18 million in BTG tokens.\nThe team has noted that \"most of the necessary components for the Network Upgrade have been coded, but need more thorough testing.\" While there are no dates specified for the release, seven days' notice will be given prior to the upgrade, according to the official statement.\nDo you think the planned changes will help the BTG circumvent the aforementioned issues or will they just temporary delay them?

Kundra — the husband of Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty — had appeared before the ED office in Mumbai on Tuesday. According to some media reports (not by IANS), he was reportedly grilled for several hours by the ED investigators. “I was summoned by the ED merely as a witness. An enquiry is underway by the concerned regulatory authorities and I stand committed to extend all my cooperation to the law enforcement agency,” Kundra said, clearing the air on the issue in a statement. A businessman with interest in sports, this is not Kundra’s first brush with law. In the past, he had appeared before different authorities on his investments in the Rajasthan Royals IPL team. Some members of that team were also embroiled in the cricket spot-fixing scandal. In his statement here vis-A-vis the media speculation of his grilling, Kundra said: “I am terribly disappointed by the irresponsible reporting carried out by some sections of the media. Clarity on the issue should have been sought before carrying such headlines.” “The authorities, summoned me merely as a witness, as the accused Amit Bharadwaj happens to be an acquaintance and some introductions were made hence there is a certain protocol being followed by the agencies,” said Kundra. He added that Bharadwaj was intending to buy a team in his Poker League and had entered into a contract with them for the same.

The king of the virtual currencies is also supported by the 50 SMA on the 1-hour timeframe chart. Bitcoin price succumbed to the bear pressure in the market yesterday, although it used the support at $7,400 to bounced and trade a little above $7,600.\nThe market has been walloping in bear pressure for weeks now, but appearing on CNBC’s Fast Money segment, Fundstrat’s co-founder Tom Lee maintained his bullish sentiments on Bitcoin. Lee said that comparing Bitcoin’s blowup in late last year to the current figures is somewhat irrelevant. However, he went ahead to compare the current daily volumes to those recorded a year ago saying:\n“Compared to a year ago, (over) the same time (the first 6 months of 2017), Bitcoin volumes are up nine hundred percent.” Commenting on Bitcoin price struggled recoil, he said, Bitcoin makes all of its performance in 10 days, in any year. So I don’t think that the fact that it is at the current levels is going to prevent it from actually rising before the end of the year.”\nDuring the session on Tuesday, Bitcoin price broke below the ascending trendline. The bullish trendline will now prevent the gains toward $7,700. However, to attack this level, BTC/USD must make it through the selling pressure at $7,650. In the meantime, the 50 SMA will continue supporting the price to avoid declines because the next support target rests at $7,400.

Bitcoin is Quote: d at $7,617 dollars compared to $7,482 back then, a gain of just under 2 percent. Litecoin is trading at $120 dollars right now, up by $3 dollars.\nBitcoin Slightly Higher\nBitcoin has advanced higher by almost 2 percent in a low volatility environment. The high during the past seven days was at $7,775 and the low at $7,270 dollars, a range of $505 dollars or close to 7 percent. This is very low compared to recent price movements. For example the 14 week ATR (Average True Range) is around $1,500 while the 5 week ATR is at almost $1,000 dollars.\nToday we got close to the low from last Wednesday after bitcoin exchange Bitfinex went down. Prices quickly bounced back after the site relaunched. Markets are rightly worried about a Bitfinex outage, back in August of 2016 the exchange said that it lost 120,000 bitcoins to a hack.\nOn the technical side things haven’t changed much, which is to be expected during low volatility. We are still in a downtrend on the daily charts. A breakout above the $7,775 swing high is needed to end the bearish trend. A move above the $8,590 swing high is needed for a new rally. A breakout above the $10,000 round figure could accelerate the gains.\nOn the lower end there’s a large area of support starting from last week’s low at $7,046 to the lows set back in April at $6,420 dollars. A clearing of this area should give us enough momentum to take out the 2018 low at $5,980 dollars per coin. On the weekly charts BTC/USD is range-bound. Prices are still looking bullish on the monthly charts.\nLitecoin up by $3 Dollars\nLitecoin is trading higher by $3 , from $117 to $120 dollars per coin. Similarly to BTC/USD here too we remain in a bear market on the dailies. A breakout above the $128.80 swing high is needed to end it. A move beyond $140.62 dollars could re-start the uptrend.\nOn the lower end there’s a large area of support, starting from the $109.28 low hit last Tuesday and ending with the low for the year at $105.55 dollars. A break of this strong support area could lead to extended losses below. The psychological $100 round figure could also act as temporary support but its not as important as $105.55. and monthly charts LTC/USD is still in an uptrend.

The authorities summoned me merely as a witness as the accused Amit Bharadwaj happens to be an acquaintance and some introductions were made hence there is a certain protocol being followed by the agencies.”\nHe went on to add that Bharadwaj was intending to buy a team in the poker league and got into a contract for the same.\n“However, he (Bharadwaj) was expelled on account of non-payment of fees and I was called as a witness in this connection.

The use of virtual money as a means of payment is prohibited and will be handled according to the country’s legal regulations.\nMoF cited the example of a case in HCM City to prove shortcomings in virtual money management. An organisation based in the city, Modern Tech, reportedly duped 32,000 individuals in an investment of approximately VNĐ15 trillion (US$666 million) in two fraudulent digital currency projects.\nThis forced State management agencies to have strict solutions in place on the import of bitcoin mining machines, MoF said.\nSo far, the country has imported some 15,600 bitcoin mining machines.\nThese were mainly imported into three major cities — HCM City, Hà Nội and Đà Nẵng. Last year alone, more than 9,300 machines were imported, including 2,300 into Hà Nội, some 7,000 into HCM City and the remaining into Đà Nẵng.\nIn the first four months of the year, the country imported more than 6,300 bitcoin mining machines, including 4,300 machines into Hà Nội and 2,009 machines into HCM City.\nEarlier, Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc asked the State Bank of Việt Nam (SVB), financial institutions and other organisations providing payment brokerage services to intensify inspections and promptly report suspicious cryptocurrency transactions.\nPhúc issued Directive No 10/CT-TTg on the matter, following repeated warnings from relevant agencies on risks associated with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, along with the threat that cryptocurrencies can be used to finance crimes, such as money laundering, terrorism, tax evasion and fraud.\nMeanwhile, cryptocurrency trading and investment are on the rise, posing a threat to the stability of the financial market as well as social order and safety due to the high risks involved. Phúc instructed the Ministry of Public Security to join hands with the SBV and relevant ministries to detect and handle any case of cryptocurrency being used for illegal payment, any activity connected to money laundering and any terrorism-related activity sponsored via cryptocurrency. The MoF has been asked to study the global experience to recommend solutions to counter initial coin offering. In addition to this, the ministry should work to reduce the import of bitcoin mining machines.\nThe Ministry of Industry and Trade must channel efforts to address illegal activities related to the use of bitcoin to make payment on e-commerce websites or applications. The Ministry of Justice is responsible for completing a legal framework on the management and settlement of cryptocurrency or crypto assets. — VNS", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ministry of finance", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hcm city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T15:46:13.054+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2cb433c3875d09d357c6dad78e7bbb4f194cca9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSSry0Re.po9jcuwyRJk_jaQfarnV4SxRKudO8Z99PjK0wH4QFWZ2AfLUNM0.AVOAQWaeKmNUMom0", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Apple Co-Founder Wants ‘Pure’ Bitcoin to Be the Currency of the Internet", "title_full": "Apple Co-Founder Wants ‘Pure’ Bitcoin to Be the Currency of the Internet", "published": "2018-06-06T12:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2cb433c3875d09d357c6dad78e7bbb4f194cca9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSSry0Re.po9jcuwyRJk_jaQfarnV4SxRKudO8Z99PjK0wH4QFWZ2AfLUNM0.AVOAQWaeKmNUMom0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-06T12:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Apple Co-Founder Wants ‘Pure’ Bitcoin to Be the Currency of the Internet", "text": "Apple Co-Founder Wants 'Pure' Bitcoin to Be the Currency of the Internet\n/u/2jgilpulg2\nsubmitted by /u/2jgilpulg2\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T12:45:46.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "44a92af2e65141af7464595c9c316e0278a38eea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisVvFENVBPCHWD9Bim2xK50uGv2gWxmXZs3uHhXtwufHGD3jbtQsG__fNG0i42QLfbAeDUH.BuJIVK74S1G2JAINYTEaLCB7W1Audqjs2mpOZpv_HhgRb4Qy.x1ktXzPRXwE7QLTF1ztrSOcNgZtAWXNPvdSuhaPbLQHoKNIZa85b.I9VeAWKfUIPzfF4JFNDZA--", "site_full": "www.forexcrunch.com", "site": "forexcrunch.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/ForexCrunch", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Forex Crunch", "title": "Bitcoin Cash price analysis: BCH/USD resumes uptrend; South Africa Reserve Bank finalizes testing of JPMorgan’s ‘Quorum’ protocol", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash price analysis: BCH/USD resumes uptrend; South Africa Reserve Bank finalizes testing of JPMorgan’s ‘Quorum’ protocol", "published": "2018-06-06T12:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forexcrunch-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/forexcrunch-logo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 70067, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "44a92af2e65141af7464595c9c316e0278a38eea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisVvFENVBPCHWD9Bim2xK50uGv2gWxmXZs3uHhXtwufHGD3jbtQsG__fNG0i42QLfbAeDUH.BuJIVK74S1G2JAINYTEaLCB7W1Audqjs2mpOZpv_HhgRb4Qy.x1ktXzPRXwE7QLTF1ztrSOcNgZtAWXNPvdSuhaPbLQHoKNIZa85b.I9VeAWKfUIPzfF4JFNDZA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FX Street", "published": "2018-06-06T12:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash price analysis: BCH/USD resumes uptrend; South Africa Reserve Bank finalizes testing of JPMorgan’s ‘Quorum’ protocol", "text": "Bitcoin Cash price is currently forming a bullish flag pattern that is battling to find support above $1,125. The SARB has tokenized the South African Rand on the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).\nThe latest slide which started in the early trading hours of Monday this week was supported by both the 50 SMA and the bullish trendline. A brief but sharp ascent occurred during the session on Tuesday, but selling pressure limited the gains marginally above $1,150. Bitcoin Cash price is currently forming a bullish flag pattern that is battling to find support above $1,125.\nIn other news in the market, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has announced that it has completed piloting ‘Project Khokha’. The bank has been testing the working of a Proof-of-Concept algorithm that it intends to use when conducting interbank money transfer. The protocol, ‘Quorum’ is a product of JPMorgan developed on Ethereum platform. The SARB has tokenized the South African Rand on the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). While the project has been accorded a lot of time and expertise, the Bank Governor, Francois E. Groepe has clarified more than once that it is only meant as a backup solution.\nTechnically, Bitcoin Cash is facing immediate resistance at $1,150, but the bullish flag pattern could lead to an upside breakout which will attack $1,200. However, the moving averages show that the buyers are slowly losing grip. Furthermore, the MACD is heading towards the negative region on the 1-hour chart. The 100 SMA could offer support above $1,100, however, the zone at $1,075 – $1,050 will prevent declines towards $1,000.\nBCH/USD 1-hour chart", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin", "https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin-cash"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "jpmorgan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "south africa reserve bank", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reserve bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarb", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T15:20:52.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1b10b779c61771c2052648dcefb6615c24daab86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSbGjSyDWYoqXm02qu2lMVtZMHuYT327hEvsWNWAFBFQm2gLdhYCUbVYxu59KDxW3HUgbz3GWsocn", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Slovenia Plays Host to the World’s First “Bitcoin City”", "title_full": "Slovenia Plays Host to the World’s First “Bitcoin City”", "published": "2018-06-06T12:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b10b779c61771c2052648dcefb6615c24daab86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSbGjSyDWYoqXm02qu2lMVtZMHuYT327hEvsWNWAFBFQm2gLdhYCUbVYxu59KDxW3HUgbz3GWsocn", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-06T12:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Slovenia Plays Host to the World’s First “Bitcoin City”", "text": "Slovenia Plays Host to the World's First \"Bitcoin City\"\n/u/SlovenianCat\nsubmitted by /u/SlovenianCat\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "slovenia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T12:40:33.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a0420b06a43a29681fefa4f24862dd19ea3b7840", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmddbflYaauphjjQ6Wds49fc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=9.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Off-topic", "title": "Worst mistake you did with Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Worst mistake you did with Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-06-06T12:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a0420b06a43a29681fefa4f24862dd19ea3b7840", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmddbflYaauphjjQ6Wds49fc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ethicalbtc", "published": "2018-06-06T12:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Worst mistake you did with Bitcoin?", "text": "I didn't believe with my friend when he buys his first bitcoin.

They point to limited examples of scaled use as evidence that blockchain will remain a cryptocurrency-centric phenomenon, or, at best, in the enterprise periphery.\nIn one sense, I agree: the full future of efficient, inexpensive, transparent, and secure transacting may rest in future blockchain versions. The solution revolution is not quite yet at hand. Basic transacting needs for some sizeable companies means the latency, cost, and block size limitations affecting public chains are non-starters. They are understandably ill-equipped right now for heavy enterprise use.\nBut the groundwork is being laid. The iterative cycle of blockchain development means smarter innovators and innovations. Forthcoming platforms, protocols, side-chains, and other infrastructure hold the key to transformation via the blockchain.\nNow, this isn’t to say that enterprise use cases don’t exist.\nEven in blockchain’s infancy, signs of notable applications are surfacing.\nRemarkably, the industry most impacted by impending blockchain application is financial services. For decades, the mess of regulatory intervention, legacy processes, archaic systems, and misaligned incentives in this space have seemed ripe for overturning. Yet time and again innovation was snuffed out.\nThat big banks, insurers, and credit providers are at the forefront, and nearest to production-ready implementation is the biggest story about which no one is talking.\nJPMorgan has its own internal blockchain infrastructure called Quorum and partnerships with Zcash. This week, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office released the company’s patent application for an interbank payments system. American Express is using Ripple to help corporate clients send funds from U.S. to U.K. banks and has filed a patent for using blockchain and cryptocurrencies for customer reward points record-keeping. RBC is experimenting with blockchain for international fund transfers, building a direct alternative to Swift transactions. Bank of America is in process on a patent for a Blockchain-based storage system with automated data authentication. These are the dominant incumbents that innovate at a glacial pace and are quick to crush upstart tech. These are the companies that institutionalize convoluted processes as a competitive advantage.\nAnd it’s these companies leading the blockchain revolution at enterprise scale. Even they sense what’s to come.\nBeyond financial services, blockchain’s significance is growing everywhere from the public sector to manufacturing, media, supply chain, and healthcare. Microsoft reports that while 80% of customers using blockchain in Azure are financial service institutions when considering pipeline engagements, that numbers drops to just over 50%. Blockchain is building its non-financial use footing.\nDemocratizing the technology and simplifying development is the next step to unleashing blockchain at scale; this is underway today as cloud service providers AWS, Baidu, and Google have all entered the BaaS (Blockchain-as-a-Service) space. Azure’s enterprise-grade development and implementation platform supports a number of ledger solutions and is already at work with Webject and The Monetary Authority of Singapore.\nRigorous architectural principles and onboarding processes must follow. IBM is addressing these issues in its recently announced, enterprise-ready blockchain service based on Linux’s Hyperledger Fabric. This open source project is being developed by about 120 current members of the Hyperledger consortium, including IBM, SAP, Fujitsu, and Accenture. The company is also rapidly launching consulting services and has undertaken more than 400 blockchain projects on behalf of the world’s most mature companies.\nJuniper Research believes that more than half of the world’s big corporations are actively considering, or are in the process of deploying blockchain projects. Two-thirds expect the technology to be integrated into existing operations by the end of 2018. So, while the large-scale enterprise applications may not be entirely in place today, they are underway.\nUltimately, doubters need to look no further than where VCs and corporate venture dealmakers are feasting. To date, over $1.8 billion has been invested into blockchain ecosystem companies by major enterprise corporate venture arms. In an article published through Haas Fintech at U.C. Berkley, the author highlights research from Outlier Ventures. An excerpt from the company’s industry tracker states:\n“ [...] 140 companies [are conducting] PoCs, from ABN Amro to Wells Fargo. It also lists about 15 companies that have applied for patents related to blockchain technology, including Amazon, Boeing, IBM, and Western Union.\n\"Companies have also been signaling interest in blockchain technology through strategic investments and acquisitions. In 2016 and 2017, Airbnb, Daimler, Rakuten, and several others acquired blockchain-related startups, while the investment arms of Jaguar, Land Rover, JetBlue, Verizon, and others made blockchain-related strategic investments [...] ”\nThere is no damning deficiency keeping blockchain from exploding in the enterprise. Every advancing technology has limitations that require it to ‘catch up’ for hardened enterprise use. Improvements in stability, interoperability, and modularity take time.\nAnd hiccups are inevitable. There is a shortage of capable developers and trillions of dollars of sunk architecture costs with which to contend. Orchestrating the movement of stakeholders, systems, and organizations to accommodate the distributed nature of blockchain is challenging. Finance and IT leaders are naturally averse to disrupting legacy business.\nBut these issues are temporary and, as history has proven, navigable.\nBlockchain offers an endless range of use possibilities. Eliminating intermediaries to increase efficiencies and speed. Reducing costs and time related to transaction reconciliations. And eliminating fraud and establishing shared records of truth.\nThese simple ideas mean unimaginable economic benefit and improvement. It is simply a matter of time.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.reuters.com/article/us-rbc-blockchain/exclusive-royal-bank-of-canada-using-blockchain-for-u-s-canada-payments-executive-idUSKCN1C237N", "http://fortune.com/2017/11/16/amex-payments-ripple-blockchain/", "https://www.waratek.com/application-security-platform/?utm_source=DZone&utm_campaign=ba&utm_medium=postrolltextad&utm_content=appsecplatform", "https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/accelerating-the-adoption-of-enterprise-blockchain/", "https://www.coindesk.com/american-express-patent-filing-touts-blockchain-for-fast-payments/", "https://www.coindesk.com/jpmorgan-seeks-patent-blockchain-powered-interbank-payments/", "https://www.waratek.com/solutions/legacy-platforms/?utm_source=DZone&utm_campaign=ba&utm_medium=postrolltextad&utm_content=legacy", "https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/blockchain/", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bank-of-america-seeks-patent-on-blockchain-based-data-storage-system", "https://appdevelopermagazine.com/5935/2018/3/28/ibm-has-a-new-blockchain-platform", "https://www.waratek.com/runtime-application-self-protection-rasp/?utm_source=DZone&utm_campaign=ba&utm_medium=prerolltextad&utm_content=rasp", "https://blockchainatberkeley.blog/a-snapshot-of-blockchain-in-enterprise-d140a511e5fd"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T12:55:51.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "160eed8a7f32c752fcc3561bc01d03b22069b182", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_pozj1Z8NU88Qzypaqq3fGO3u9Uy6T5oDI0tGi9RUCFUWPhza7JPUxYDaDQkJxlqwQckHOEem0b5QVQ5FP2ud2Mw1", "site_full": "investorshub.advfn.com", "site": "advfn.com", "site_section": "http://investorshub.advfn.com/Bitcoin-Services-Inc-BTSC-30680/", "site_categories": ["investing", "stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Services Inc.

June 6, 2018 1:00 pm\nThe Russia FIFA World Cup has a June 14 start date with all eyes on a Saudi-Russian tie.\n“The Bitcoin price could be in for a boost as football fans descend on the country,” Forbes reported.\n“Some have turned to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to pay their way to the Russia World Cup as it was revealed in May that some hotels in Kaliningrad, host to some of the tournament’s games, were accepting Bitcoin as payment while some airlines and travel agents, will be taking the cryptocurrency.”\nAt the time of publishing, Bitcoin was at $7600+.\nHowever, bitcoin holders are on edge fearing wallet thefts among other heists.\nHackers stole about $530 million worth of cryptocurrency from the Coincheck exchange in Japan this year, one of the biggest such heists ever.\n“At its peak at the end of 2017 there were roughly 400,000 Bitcoin transactions per day though this has now fallen back to around 200,000 transactions per day, and fees are back down with it,” Forbes said.\nIs there a crypto insurance market on the rise?\nRead: Did the UAE have a chance at making the World Cup and blew it?\nThe UAE has an insurance solution\nRegal RA DMCC, a gold investment and trading firm in Dubai, is the first company in the Middle East to receive a license to trade cryptocurrencies, the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC)said.\nThe company said it launched the world’s first “deep cold storage” solution, which allows investors and traders to store their digital currencies – Bitcoin, Ethereum and other altcoins – in a vault located in Dubai’s Almas Tower, the headquarters of free zone DMCC, without connection to a network – alongside the company’s current stock of physical gold.\n“We have developed what we believe is the number one most secure way of investing in crypto-commodities,” Tyler Gallagher, chief executive of Regal Assets, which owns Regal RA, said in a statement earlier this year.\nAnother safe way of dealing with cryptos is to pour it into sound residential projects.\nClick: Forget winning the World Cup: Saudi is playing to win big at sports business\nThe 2.4 million-square-foot Isle of Man-headquartered Knox Group is one example of such firms. The company in September said it will launch a $0.32 billion residential and commercial property project in Dubai, to be purchased in Bitcoin.\nBut a February survey of Bayut.com found only 3% of those polled by the Dubai property portal were interested in using a digital currency to buy, sell or rent property.\nBitOasis.net, a UAE digital currency site offers Multisignature Protection technology to protect client assets adding an extra layer of security, and as protection against fraud, it calls clients to confirm any high risk or large transactions before moving digital assets.\nRelated: Are you into Bitcoin slalom? There is now treatment for that\nGlobal Crypto insurers\nReuters reported that major global insurers are starting to offer protection against cryptocurrency theft, including XL Catlin, Chubb, and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance, still a small part of the global $720 billion per year commercial insurance business.\n“The risks are clear: digital currency investors have already lost billions from dozens of cryptocurrency hacks, technical errors, and fraud. Many hacked exchanges later shuttered,” said Reuters.\n“For insurers, the challenge is how to cover those risks for customers they know little about, who use technology few understand.”\nXL Catlin now offers annual crime coverage of up to $25 million per incident.\nRead: Bitcoin is here to remind you that it is falling again, losing $18bn in 24hrs\nDigital coin sales raised more than $5 billion across nearly 800 deals in 2017, according to venture capital data provider CB Insights, but there are no estimates yet how much of that has been insured or of total premiums collected.\n“Annual premiums for $10 million in theft coverage would typically run at about $200,000, or 2 percent of the limit, insurance experts say. That compares with about 1 percent or less for traditional financial clients, depending on the company, loss history, and other factors, reported Reuters.\nBitsonline, an industry site, said The process for obtaining cryptocurrency coverage does not come cheap or without major scrutiny.\n“Following Know Your Customer (KYC) or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures will be par for the course when it comes to obtaining a policy for protection,” Bitsonline said.

Moreover the ED had filed its case based on an FIR of the Maharashtra Police in this case and the Pune Police arrested Bhardwaj and his brother Vivek from Delhi earlier.

Slovenia is Home to Worlds First Crypto Friendly Mall\nSet in the center of the country’s capital city, Ljubljana, the eponymously named BTC City shopping mall will be transformed into a completely Bitcoin-friendly environment where every shop and venture will accept the cryptocurrency and operate via blockchain technology. The 1,558,398 square foot complex which was built in 1954 as a storage and logistics center had become a commercial shopping district by the mid-1990s.\nToday it is completely transformed as the largest shopping center in the country boasting over 500 stores as well several travel and tourism ventures including a luxury hotel and casino, a multiplex cinema, a water park and the Crystal Palace office park — home to Slovenia’s tallest building.\nSlovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar recently made a visit to the center where he was offered a cup of coffee purchased by the secretary of state Tadej Slapnik using cryptocurrency. Representatives of BTC City released a statement concerning the Prime Minister’s visit which read in part;\n“The purpose of his visit was to open the Beyond 4.0 international conference, dedicated to digital society and blockchain, and to get acquainted with BTC City’s strategy to become a Bitcoin City,”\nBTC Company which owns and manages BTC City wants to see the center become the first of its kind in the world where business partners visitors and consumers interact in a cryptocurrency supportive ecosystem. The company seeks to integrate all state of the art technology into the space using Cryptocurrency and blockchain as well as bringing in artificial intelligence, virtual reality, augmented reality and machine learning.

The use of virtual money as a means of payment is prohibited and will be handled according to the country’s legal regulations.\nMoF cited the example of a case in HCM City to prove shortcomings in virtual money management. An organisation based in the city, Modern Tech, reportedly duped 32,000 individuals in an investment of approximately VNĐ15 trillion (US$666 million) in two fraudulent digital currency projects.\nThis forced State management agencies to have strict solutions in place on the import of bitcoin mining machines, MoF said.\nSo far, the country has imported some 15,600 bitcoin mining machines.\nThese were mainly imported into three major cities — HCM City, Hà Nội and Đà Nẵng. Last year alone, more than 9,300 machines were imported, including 2,300 into Hà Nội, some 7,000 into HCM City and the remaining into Đà Nẵng.\nIn the first four months of the year, the country imported more than 6,300 bitcoin mining machines, including 4,300 machines into Hà Nội and 2,009 machines into HCM City.\nEarlier, Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc asked the State Bank of Việt Nam (SVB), financial institutions and other organisations providing payment brokerage services to intensify inspections and promptly report suspicious cryptocurrency transactions.\nPhúc issued Directive No 10/CT-TTg on the matter, following repeated warnings from relevant agencies on risks associated with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, along with the threat that cryptocurrencies can be used to finance crimes, such as money laundering, terrorism, tax evasion and fraud.\nMeanwhile, cryptocurrency trading and investment are on the rise, posing a threat to the stability of the financial market as well as social order and safety due to the high risks involved. Phúc instructed the Ministry of Public Security to join hands with the SBV and relevant ministries to detect and handle any case of cryptocurrency being used for illegal payment, any activity connected to money laundering and any terrorism-related activity sponsored via cryptocurrency. The MoF has been asked to study the global experience to recommend solutions to counter initial coin offering. In addition to this, the ministry should work to reduce the import of bitcoin mining machines.\nThe Ministry of Industry and Trade must channel efforts to address illegal activities related to the use of bitcoin to make payment on e-commerce websites or applications. The Ministry of Justice is responsible for completing a legal framework on the management and settlement of cryptocurrency or crypto assets. — VNS", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ministry of finance", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hcm city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T05:44:46.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "418e7750d7469d6f51302c1a2c6c245690eda087", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1pProOUxd6mGloA8nQi69zz", "site_full": "nigeria.shafaqna.com", "site": "shafaqna.com", "site_section": "http://nigeria.shafaqna.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nigeria News (News Reader) |", "title": "Slovenia’s Bitcoin City to Become World’s First Fully Crypto Friendly Lifestyle Center", "title_full": "Slovenia’s Bitcoin City to Become World’s First Fully Crypto Friendly Lifestyle Center", "published": "2018-06-06T12:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5727, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "418e7750d7469d6f51302c1a2c6c245690eda087", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJW44mmt9R4j.IQ3qU4s1pqZCrwJDfbzy1pProOUxd6mGloA8nQi69zz", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T12:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Slovenia’s Bitcoin City to Become World’s First Fully Crypto Friendly Lifestyle Center", "text": "17 hours ago Slovenia’s Bitcoin City to Become World’s First Fully Crypto Friendly Lifestyle Center A former warehouse complex in one of the smallest countries in the EU is now moving towards becoming the first lifestyle center in Europe to totally embrace blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies.

Over the last two years, the privately owned company has also built up a trading desk of around a dozen people that buys and sells millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin and other virtual or cryptocurrencies in private deals.\nNow the firm is opening trading to a small group of its 500 clients, with plans to expand.\nThe move is the latest sign that the virtual currency markets, which were once relegated to the fringes of the financial world, are being embraced by big, mainstream investors.\nThe parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, the Intercontinental Exchange, has been in talks about opening a subsidiary for cryptocurrency trading, and Goldman Sachs is on the verge of opening its own trading operation.\nBut Susquehanna, which has around 1,800 employees around the world, has a lot more money backing its trading desk  and a lot more ability to interact with clients  than the hedge funds and trading firms that have also been early participants in the virtual currency markets.\nThe arrival of big financial institutions has raised concerns among some Bitcoin aficionados, who worry that it will harden Bitcoins status as a speculative trading asset like gold and diminish hopes that it can be used in day-to-day transactions.\nNot so, said Bart Smith, the head of the digital asset group at Susquehanna. The firm believes that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies inspired by it are likely to have a wide array of uses, but for now, he said, Bitcoins best bet is to challenge gold as a scarce commodity that can be moved around more easily.\nThe original Bitcoin software determined that only 21 million Bitcoin would ever be created. That cap isnt expected to be hit until 2040( Hydrogen edit : the correct year is 2140***), and the limited number of tokens currently in circulation has made the online currency appealing as a commodity.\nMr. Smith said that he could also imagine Bitcoin, or some competitor, becoming a digital payment method for the internet  as Jack Dorsey, Twitters chief executive, recently predicted  but that he wasnt too worried if that didnt happen.\nWe believe that this technology and this asset class is going to change some facet of financial services, and we think it is going to exist forever, he said.\nSusquehanna first experimented with trading Bitcoin in 2014 after the investor twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss asked the firm about being involved with a Bitcoin E.T.F. that they had applied to regulators to create.\nRegulators eventually denied that application. But Susquehanna kept its one Bitcoin trader on board, and then added a few more last year when the cryptocurrency markets took off.\nThe firm decided to step up its operation, and go out to clients, after seeing the success of Bitcoin futures contracts, which were introduced by exchanges in Chicago late last year and have been growing volume in recent months.\nSusquehanna will trade futures, which are contracts tied to the future price of Bitcoin. It will also allow customers to buy and sell actual Bitcoin and a few other cryptocurrencies like Ether and Bitcoin Cash.\nTo make these available to customers, Susquehanna recently amended the broker dealer license that it has on file with regulators. That change will allow the company to trade cryptocurrencies that are labeled by regulators as securities. Regulators in the United States have recently indicated that many newly created virtual currencies  though not Bitcoin  should likely be categorized as securities and traded only by regulated entities.\nMost of the cryptocurrency exchanges where Susquehanna trades are largely unregulated. Bloomberg recently reported that American authorities were investigating whether some traders were taking advantage of this to manipulate the price of Bitcoin by posting lots of trades that they didnt intend to complete.\nMr. Smith said he had not seen clear evidence of manipulation, but cryptocurrency markets are still very immature compared with the other markets where Susquehanna trades, especially given the lack of regulations for many of the largest exchanges holding cryptocurrencies.\nHe said the single biggest problem for sophisticated investors was the security risk in holding virtual currencies. In other markets, Susquehanna doesnt have actual custody of stocks or bonds.\nBitcoin was built so that users can hold and transfer their tokens with a password or private key that no one else knows. If the private key is compromised, a hacker can take the coins, and the owner has no way to get them back. That has led to big losses at several Bitcoin exchanges.\nSusquehanna built its own systems for storing the cryptocurrencies it is holding for more than a day. To deter hackers, the private keys are kept in devices in an off-site facility that is not connected to the rest of the companys computer systems.\nThere were no financial services firms out there two years ago that were storing and moving large amounts of cryptocurrencies, so there is no road map, he said.\nThen there is the matter of trying to figure out on a daily basis what a single Bitcoin or Ether token should be worth.\nThere is still little agreement on what factors traders should take account of when deciding on a value for cryptocurrencies, given that many of the expected uses for digital tokens are still hypothetical. While Mr. Smiths teams look at the technical and security specifications of the coins, it is much harder to answer the most important question: Will they be used as something other than a digital commodity?\nThe value is: What do you think the best-case scenario of these different digital assets is in the future  and handicapping what is the percentage chance that they will get there, he said.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/technology/bitcoin-susquehanna.html\nTried to bold the best parts & corrected the error where the article claimed bitcoin would reach its cap in \"2040\"(2140 is the correct year).\nHere is a stark contrast to claims of bitcoin being a \"bubble\", bitcoin being a \"safe haven\" for terrorists, criminals and money launderers, bitcoin being \"created out of thin air with no intrinsic value\" and other perhaps somewhat biased, negative portrayals commonly covered by the mainstream media.\nThis investment firm says they believe bitcoin will be around forever. It seems they're backing up their words by perhaps being the 1st big investment firm to deploy bitcoin and crypto currency investment services. Here is perhaps good news for long term bitcoin HODLers and perhaps a hint that bitcoin will make a comeback at some point in 2018.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/technology/bitcoin-susquehanna.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T23:25:23.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fee38de687473aa1848dc341a0ff0acee898073d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY7muKyJ93NK2mE6Ht7YBDxk9uepI.Xhw0U6.a3hu20quXhP8AdWqu3tZvfloceIkzw--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Can BTC/USD Break This Resistance?", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Can BTC/USD Break This Resistance?", "published": "2018-06-06T11:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fee38de687473aa1848dc341a0ff0acee898073d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY7muKyJ93NK2mE6Ht7YBDxk9uepI.Xhw0U6.a3hu20quXhP8AdWqu3tZvfloceIkzw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-06T11:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Watch: Can BTC/USD Break This Resistance?", "text": "Key Points Bitcoin price formed a support base near $7,350 and recovered nicely against the US Dollar. There is a key connecting bearish trend line in place with resistance at $7,650 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair has to move past the $7,650 and $7,680 resistance levels to gain traction. Bitcoin price is showing positive signs above $7,500 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD must clear the $7,650 barrier for more gains in the near term.\nBitcoin Price Analysis Yesterday, we saw a bearish wave below the $7,400 level in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair traded as low as $7,369 before buyers appeared. A base was formed near $7,350 before the price started an upside move. It traded higher and broke the $7,450 level along with the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last downside move from the $7,780 swing high to $7,350 swing low.\nThe price also succeeded in settling above the $7,500 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Later, there was a close above the 50% Fib retracement level of the last downside move from the $7,780 swing high to $7,350 swing low. However, the price is currently struggling to clear the $7,650 resistance. There is also a key connecting bearish trend line in place with resistance at $7,650 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Therefore, a close above the $7,650 resistance is needed for an upside acceleration towards $7,800.\nLooking at the chart , the current price action is positive, but a proper break above $7,650 is needed for buyers to take control. On the downside, an initial support is around $7,500, followed by $7,400. Below this last, the price may perhaps retest the $7,350 support.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD has reduced most of its bullish slope.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is now placed well above the 55 level.\nMajor Support Level – $7,400\nMajor Resistance Level – $7,650\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: Can BTC/USD Break This Resistance? appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T11:42:41.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1a8ecd0d18d96e9a8d61ed0be03505f408b9b5a6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyYwhyEfwMxKhXy37J9EOnzMVM17Xnod4zIsHbEGISc_UVeuo8K3u3wMwycqCB_9VR.A--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Apple Co-Founder Wants ‘Pure’ Bitcoin to Be the Currency of the Internet", "title_full": "Apple Co-Founder Wants ‘Pure’ Bitcoin to Be the Currency of the Internet", "published": "2018-06-06T11:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1a8ecd0d18d96e9a8d61ed0be03505f408b9b5a6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyYwhyEfwMxKhXy37J9EOnzMVM17Xnod4zIsHbEGISc_UVeuo8K3u3wMwycqCB_9VR.A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-06T11:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Apple Co-Founder Wants ‘Pure’ Bitcoin to Be the Currency of the Internet", "text": "Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is hopeful that Bitcoin will become the single currency of the Internet. In this regard, Wozniak joins Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and Square, in his enthusiasm for Bitcoin becoming the single worldwide currency.\nBitcoin: The Native Currency of the Internet\nA growing number of influential voices are claiming that Bitcoin should become the currency of the Internet.\nMost recently, during a CNBC interview, Wozniak conveyed his sentiment that Bitcoin should become the currency of the Internet, affirming Bitcoin's purity and power. During the interview, Wozniak said:\nBitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of bitcoin, there's a way it's distributed… and it's pure and there's no human running, there's no company running and it's just… growing and growing… and surviving, that to me says something that is natural and nature is more important than all our human conventions.\nWozniak also indicated that he agrees with Jack Dorsey regarding the fact that Bitcoin should become the single global currency. Specifically, Wozniak said:\nI buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it's going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking.\nWozniak was referring to Dorsey's prediction, \"The Internet is going to have a native currency.\" Dorsey issued this prediction at the Consensus Blockchain Conference in New York in May. As reported by CNET , Dorsey also stated :\nThe internet is going to have a native currency, so let's not wait for it to happen, let's help it happen. I don't know if it will be bitcoin, but I hope it will be.\nBitcoin Makes Square Profitable\nDorsey seemed to acquiesce to client demand when Square started to provide Bitcoin trading capabilities to its Cash App. When announcing these new features, the company stated :\nCustomers can now buy and sell Bitcoin in Cash App. We observed that this was a feature our customers wanted, and we support Bitcoin because we see it as a step in the long-term path toward greater financial access for all.\nDorsey was right. Since Square, Inc. added Bitcoin trading features to its payment app, the value of its stocks has increased significantly. As a result, last April, Dan Dolev, an analyst at Nomura Instinet, believing that this ascending trajectory would most likely continue, raised its Square target price to USD 65, from USD 50. As of this writing, a share of SQ is already over USD 61.\nDorsey and Wozniak remain faithful to their vision that the Internet will eventually have only one currency, preferably Bitcoin. Some time ago, Wozniak declared that Bitcoin was better than gold, and Dorsey said :\nBitcoin will overtake the dollar in importance as it becomes the single global currency of the internet within a decade.\nWhat do you think of Bitcoin becoming be the single currency of the Internet?

Speaking to CNBC on Monday, Wozniak stated that he hopes Dorsey’s prediction will come true.\n“I buy into what Jack Dorsey says, not that I necessarily believe it's going to happen, but because I want it to be that way, that is so pure thinking.”\nWozniak, or ‘The Woz’ as he is nicknamed, went on to expound on the qualities that make Bitcoin unique and valuable – i.e. the fact that it is “pure”, since there is no single issuing authority.\n“Bitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of Bitcoin, there's a way it's distributed… and it's pure and there's no human running, there's no company running and it's just… growing and growing… and surviving, that to me says something that is natural and nature is more important than all our human conventions.”\nDespite the fact that many other influential figures (such as Warren Buffet) have levelled a fair amount of criticism at Bitcoin and its peers, Wozniack has maintained a positive and optimistic stance on cryptocurrencies. In October last year, at the Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas, Wozniack claimed Bitcoin and blockchain technology were better than both gold and the US dollar. He stated that traditional fiat currencies were “phony” (since their supply could easily be manipulated by the government and other powerful players), while gold had no fixed supply.\nWozniak has been a vocal proponent of cryptocurrencies – he bought Bitcoin when it was priced at around $700 (the cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $7600), only to sell his entire stash (save one BTC) after he became disappointed with the hype surrounding the price movement of the digital asset, which he felt was too stressful to keep up with.\nIn addition to extolling Bitcoin’s virtues in comparison with the dollar and gold, and endorsing Dorsey’s sentiments, Wozniack also commented on what makes Bitcoin superior to the thousands of other cryptocurrencies that have now emerged.\n“Only Bitcoin is pure digital gold… and I totally buy into that. All the others tend to give up some of the aspects of Bitcoin. For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control. That's the first one they have to give up to try to have a business model.” × Stay up to date with market trends and exclusive crypto news!

However, the digital coin saw a big price jump in the afternoon surging above the $7,600 mark. Bitcoin managed to defend that level in the final hours of the session and finished the day at $7,633.76. This was significantly higher than Bitcoin’s opening level of $7,500.90.\nWhile in today’s early trading Bitcoin experienced a brief drop below $7,600, falling to an intraday low of $7,591.53, it has largely stayed above that mark since the start of the session. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price was hovering around $7,620, according to data from cryptocurrency tracker Coinmarketcap.\nBitcoin looked poised for a significant rally on Sunday, when its price rose to a two an 11-day high of $7,754.89. As noted by Coindesk, the coin closed the session above a key falling trendline resistance level, signalling a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change. In addition, a bullish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving average also hinted at a possible short-term positive price action. However, Bitcoin’s decline on Monday afternoon signalled that the rally had come to an end. This outcome was not entirely surprising, given Bitcoin’s low trading volumes, which had warned of a possible bull trap, Coindesk notes in a technical analysis piece published yesterday.\nIn today’s trading, the Bitcoin price stood at $7,619.75, as of 09:19 BST. The digital currency has gained 2.4% in the past 24 hours, Coinmarketcap data shows.

Tucker is of the view that the fear of quantum computing as an existential threat to bitcoin and other blockchain applications is based on scare-mongering and ignorance.\nIn actual fact he says, the entire basis of blockchain technology is to crowdsource solutions for problems including security threats potentially posed by quantum computing, and this is what makes Blockchain networks superior to centrally planned networks and platforms. Insisting that any potential security risks are solvable, Tucker references a research paper published by Dr. Gavin Brennen, a quantum physicist at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, who is a globally respected authority on the subject of quantum computing.\n“Still A Long Way Off”\nDr. Brennen’s paper analyses the threats posed by advanced quantum computing to blockchain technology using a study to ascertain how possible it is for a quantum computer to ‘rig’ a blockchain by centralizing it’s hashing power, and whether it can crack a cryptographic key, which is currently the main security apparatus that protects blockchain users. The results indicate that quantum technology as we imagine it and quantum technology as it currently exists are still far away from each other.\nIn answer to both scenarios, the answer is no, based on current quantum computing capacity. Existing quantum infrastructure supports gate speeds that are relatively low compared to those needed to carry out an extremely complicated function like cracking a cryptographic key in a short period of time. In another ten years, there is a possibility that hardware permitting gate speeds of up to 100GHz may be in existence, but at the same time, the already extremely-fast ASIC hardware that is used for the Proof-of-Work blockchain functions will also continue to evolve and improve in that time.\nBitcoin isn’t vulnerable to quantum computing, research suggests.\nIn other words, any theoretical advantage that quantum computing possessed over the blockchain is canceled out in practice by the constraints of existing hardware and continued evolution of blockchain security. The technology that can successfully compromise a blockchain running currently, is always about ten years away from successful development, such that by the time it comes out, it is always effectively obsolete.\n“Red Herring”\nBoth Dr. Brennen and Tucker agree that while there is certainly a security risk posed by quantum computing to blockchain networks, at least on paper, these fears are based on sensational reporting and scaremongering. Tucker’s opinion is that the conversation about quantum computing posing an existential threat to the blockchain is a red herring because it serves as a distraction from what should really be discussed. In his words,\n“…This quantum threat to Bitcoin is mostly a red-herring, not entirely false but a fixable issue, especially given the robust network behind cryptocurrency and the strong incentive to provide the best security possible.”\nhttps://www.ccn.com/quantum-computing-poses-no-realistic-threat-to-bitcoin-research/\nbe not idiot", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ccn.com/quantum-computing-poses-no-realistic-threat-to-bitcoin-research/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T22:38:49.019+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 29608, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=2600", "requestsLeft": 636}
