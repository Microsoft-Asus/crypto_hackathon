Robert Sluymer told CNBC's Futures Now :\nWhen we step back, we see the first phase starting to happen. We think Bitcoin is starting to bottom off some very key support around $7,000 and we think it's going to start a recovery process here.\nSluymer's statements come after the first and foremost cryptocurrency has found support at key support levels around the psychologically-significant level of $7,000 multiple times. In each instance, Bitcoin went on to recover — as it did earlier this week. Sluymer explained:\nThat's certainly the first step in a bottoming process – to see some sort of consolidation or a basing taking hold.\nTechnical Indicators Adding to the belief that Bitcoin has bottomed out is the market leader's Relative Strength Index (RSI), a popular momentum indicator that compares the magnitude of recent gains and losses over a specified time period in an effort to measure speed and change of price movements. According to Sluymer, the RSI supports Fundstrat's belief that Bitcoin is ready to rally. He stated:\nThat RSI indicator in the bottom of the chart is very oversold and starting to bottom so that's really part of that bottoming phase taking hold.\nHowever, one should always exercise caution when following the advice of anyone analyzing the cryptocurrency market — which itself is prone to high levels of volatility and unregulated price manipulation . Because of this, there are some other indicators which may help confirm a reversal. Fundstrat's head of technical strategy explained:\nThe next thing that has to happen is to see Bitcoin actually rally through the downtrend and we use the 15-day moving average, it's very simplistic, but it's a pretty good proxy across most markets.\nThat 15-day moving average is roughly $7,800. Should Bitcoin manage to hold a level above said price, it is likely that buyers will enter the market with increased confidence.\n'The Setup is Very Attractive Here' It has been over one week since Bitcoin last traded above $7,800, but Sluymer believes we're currently in a prime buying opportunity. He told CNBC:\nWe think the setup is very attractive here. If you're short we think you should be very careful and reducing your short exposure. I think if you're looking to be long this is where you start adding here to your long exposure.\nAt the time of this writing, Bitcoin is currently trading at $7,591.31, up 0.32 percent over the last 24 hours.\nDo you think Bitcoin has bottomed? Do you agree with Fundstrat's analysis that the market leader is already beginning to rally?

After being shut out by Polish banks, BitBay moved its headquarters to Malta and stopped serving Polish customers.\nPhoto by freestocks.org on Unsplash In a delightful bit of irony BitBay, a Central European exchange, has shut down operations in Poland even as it received an invitation by the Polish government to participate in a national blockcha… Seeing a tremendous opportunity to leverage machine learning technologies in the healthcare industry, Bessemer Venture Partners is launching a $10 million early-stage seed program to back new start… Read more from techcrunch.com…\nthumbnail courtesy of techcrunch.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/01/bitcoin-exchange-abandons-poland-even-as-the-government-invites-it-to-a-working-group/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitbay", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pfsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockchain working group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "poland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malta", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T18:16:19.038+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "05e7834ee3040858374f9b7d5fe8e4dc2b6b9f93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbsyODlAMh2d1KP.YjNwWws-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Bitcoin and Economy", "title_full": "Bitcoin and Economy", "published": "2018-06-01T18:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "05e7834ee3040858374f9b7d5fe8e4dc2b6b9f93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbsyODlAMh2d1KP.YjNwWws-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "costanos02", "published": "2018-06-01T18:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin and Economy", "text": "We all know that the development of a certain country comes from the taxes of its citizens, and we all know people who engage bitcoin don't pay taxes to the government, what will happen to a country where 80% of its citizens engage in cryptocurrency?\nThere is a big possibility that this things might happen In the future because bitcoin is growing faster and very known today.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T01:11:29.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "47430204f215660c718bb6b84933b813f9ac4c94", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSmcaKUV5lKVbJWO4I_oWP07NlG9GEYCEi.wH68r3v_f5.hcNexMvmMLzyt_ujegg41zAZch6WTeg--", "site_full": "safehaven.com", "site": "safehaven.com", "site_section": "https://safehaven.com/feed/rss", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "Safehaven.com", "title": "Has Bitcoin Found A Bottom?", "title_full": "Has Bitcoin Found A Bottom?", "published": "2018-06-01T18:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://d2t794khe5w43b.cloudfront.net/article/718x300/1d399cee78bf819374f1c330b6709a22.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "47430204f215660c718bb6b84933b813f9ac4c94", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSmcaKUV5lKVbJWO4I_oWP07NlG9GEYCEi.wH68r3v_f5.hcNexMvmMLzyt_ujegg41zAZch6WTeg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tanya Abrosimova", "published": "2018-06-01T18:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Has Bitcoin Found A Bottom?", "text": "Has Bitcoin Found A Bottom? By Tanya Abrosimova - Jun 01, 2018, 9:26 AM CDT\nBitcoin retraced from Thursday's high reached at $7,609 to trade at $7,494 at the time of writing. The price is struggling to regain $7,500 handle amid low-profile and mostly directionless trading activity during Asian hours. The most popular digital currency is unchanged since the start of the day, with the upside potential dying out as long as the price stays below $7,500.\nSpeaking in Stockholm last week, the head of Bank of England Mark Carney dwelled upon the role of central banks in the crypto industry. Carney, known for his distaste for digital currencies as a means of payment, reiterated his interest in blockchain technologies and their transformative role in the future of finance.\n“Is our role going to be changing the payment systems and helping private providers of digital money, or will we go all the way to a central bank issued digital currency? This is one of the most exciting and important areas. And certainly the most important area to get right,” Carney said in an interview published by the Riksbank on Thursday.\nBitcoin's technical picture\nOn the intraday level, BTC/USD is supported by $7,400, surrounded by a number of technically important levels. Namely, 50-SMA (hourly chart) comes at $7,464, it is followed by 200-SMA at $7.416 and 100-SMA at $7,373. The upside short-term trendline currently at $7,442 offers additional support. On the upside, strong resistance is created by $7,600 and $7,683 (23.6 percent Fibo).\nBTC/USD, the hourly chart\nRipple, the third largest coin by market value, is changing hands at $0.6080, back above important $0.60 handle, but still off Wednesday's high reached at $0.6262. XRP/USD is unchanged since the start of the day with current market cap $23.9B.\nMeanwhile, Ripple company is running a rebranding campaign in an attempt to draw a clear line between the company and the digital coin. The reason behind this move is to answer the criticism about the centralized nature of XRP and convince regulatory authorities that it is not a security. It remains to be seen whether the re-brand helps Ripple to distance itself from the currency and prove its point. But it may provide the impulse that will help the coin to break free from Bitcoin and gain sustainable long-term upside momentum.\nRipple technical picture\nTechnically, XRP/USD broke above $0.6000 handle, but no follow through cast doubt on the sustainability of the breakout. 50-SMA (hourly chart) at $0.6057 serves as near-term support, followed by $0.60 and $0.5929 (100-SMA). On the upside, a sustainable move above $0.61 attract buying interest and push the coin towards May 30 high at $0.6262 and to the next psychological level $0.6300.\nXRP/USD, the hourly chart\nIOTA is rallying strongly, building upon Thursday gains triggered by Trinity Mobile wallet app launch. IOT/USD gained over 8 percent in a couple of hours ahead of the European session. Currently, the coin is changing hands at 1.87 with strong upside momentum. Average trading volume spiked to $15M from $129M the day before with most active transactions registered in IOT/USD at Binance (30 percent from total daily volume).\nMeanwhile, IOTA Foundation announced the partnership with DNB, Norway’s largest financial services group. They will work together to explore the potential of the economy of things and IOTA Tangle technology.\nDavid Sønstebø, the founder of IOTA Foundation commented:\n“Norway has always been a vanguard in adopting cutting-edge technological paradigm shifts that improve the efficiency of our society, I am very excited at the IOTA Foundation which is spearheading Distributed Ledger Technology and IoT payments working with Norway’s largest financial institution on carrying this tradition onwards.”\nIOTA is testing 50-DMA at $1.87, while this level may cap the upside for the time being, a sustainable movement higher will increase bullish pressure and push the price towards critical $2.0 with 23.6 percent Fibo at $2.057. On the downside, the correction is likely to be limited by $1.61 (100-DMA). once cleared, 1.60 will come into focus.\nIOT/USD , daily chart\nThe price is struggling to regain $7,500 handle amid low-profile and mostly directionless trading activity during Asian hours.

Bitcoin Building a Base for Another Move Higher?\nThe largest cryptocurrency ends the week marginally higher and is currently building a b ase for a potential move higher, while the RSI indicator sees BTC bouncing back from oversold territory. BTC has good support between $5603 and $6438 and is unlikely to threaten support in the short-term – all things being equal. On the upside $8578 looks a likely first target before the coin re-tests the recent the recent high just above $10,000. Bitcoin (BTC) Daily Price Chart in US Dollars (October 2017 – June 1, 2018) Ripple Remains Rangebound\nRipple continues to trade either side of $0.60 and likely needs a fresh fundamental push to break this level. IG Client Sentiment continues to show that retail is heavily net-long the token – currently around 96% - which does leave a possible sharp move to the downside a possibility. Support between $0.54 and $0.58 should hold in the short-term although a sell-off back to $0.46 cannot be discounted. A break and close above $0.96 would put bulls back in control of short-term price action. Ripple (XRP) Daily Price Chart in US Dollars (February – June 1, 2018) Ether’s Higher Lows Point to Further Gains\nA series of five higher lows this week helped Ether rebound strongly from the $500 area and leaves the token eyeing $600 or potentially higher. Upside targets include the 20- and 50-day moving averages, at $633 and $644 respectively before the 200-day ma comes into play just above $700. On the downside $500 should provide solid support with $454 below. Ether (ETH)Daily Price Chart in US Dollars (February – June 1, 2018) Litecoin Needs Further Consolidation\nLitecoin bounced off the double low around $109 made in late-March/early-April early in the week and has been creeping higher ever since. LTC needs to consolidate above the $124 - $129 level - the gap formed on the May 22/May 23 candles – before it can be seen in a positive light. Above this level $140 is the next resistance level. On the downside $109 should provide a reasonable level of support ahead of $103.

investment risk, investment reward, technology and adoption. No cryptocurrency on the list has received an \"excellent\" A or a B+ rating, while 14 coins were rated B or B-.\nADA, DCR, EOS were given B grading, whereas BTC, ETH, BTS, IOTA, ONT, NEO, XRP, STEEM, TRX, XLM, and ZIL were rated B-.\n54 cryptocurrencies were included in C, C+ or C- category. They include BCH, DASH, DOGE, ETC, LSK, LTC, XMR, XEM, QTUM, SC, STRAT, UBQ, VEN, WAVES, and ZEC.\nWhen Weiss first launched its Cryptocurrency Ratings on January 24, Bitcoin has been rated C+ because its network was facing major bottlenecks causing delays and high transactions costs.\nBitcoin plunged from $11,500 to below $6,000, or about 47 percent, within two weeks of publishing the report.\nBitcoin recovered marginally from that level, and has been trading around $7500 this week.\nWeiss Ratings faced widespread criticism over the report and suffered a hack of its site temporarily. Many in the crypto community fiercely denounced the grade as overly punishing.\nAs per Weiss Ratings definition, cryptocurrencies do not have to achieve an A grade to merit interest by investors. \"'B' or even 'B-' also qualify as the investment rating equivalent to 'buy.' At the same time, investors should not be overly alarmed by a 'C' rating. It is a passing grade; and for investors, implies the equivalent of 'hold.'\"\nby Joji Xavier RTTNews Staff Writer\nFor comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com\nEconomic News\nWhat parts of the world are seeing the best (and worst) economic performances lately?

First we spent one day in Helsinki. It was the cheapest option for us when we wanted to travel from Tallinn to Sweden. Ulrika has never set her foot in this neighboring country, and Pontus has never been to Helsinki so see the Finnish capital on foot. We calculated that we walked about 15 km this day, so we managed to see a big part of Helsinki. Then there were Bitcoin and freedom-minded meetings on our Sweden agenda, and to meet family and friends.\nVi har haft fullt upp, men vi känner nu att det var dags att göra en uppdatering om vad vi har sysslat med efter vår tripp till Tallinn och vårt vecka 20 ultraljud där. Först spenderade vi en dag i Helsingfors. Det var det billigaste alternativet för oss när vi ville åka från Tallinn till Sverige. Ulrika har aldrig satt sin fot i detta grannland och Pontus har heller aldrig varit i just Helsingfors, så vi tog vara på möjligheten att få se den finländska huvudstaden till fots. Vi räknade ut att vi promenerade cirka 15 km denna dag, så vi hann se en hel del av Helsingfors. Därefter var det bitcoin och frihetliga möten på vår Sverigeagenda, samt att träffa familj och vänner. A bitcoin ATM greeted us when we arrived to Helsinki, so it was easy for us to get the local currency (Euro) here in Finland. 0 confirmations, no need to sign in and give out personal information and we were ready to spend a day in Helsinki. The ATM can be found in the ferry terminal at Västra Hamnen and you can change the language so you don’t have to know Finnish to use it. The second thing that greeted us in Helsinki was the Bad Bad Boy, the 8.5 meters tall urinating statue. And a visualization of the mean depth of the Baltic Sea – only 55 meters. We had taken the morning ferry from Tallinn so the sun was still rising when we came to Helsinki. Ulrika thinks that these sorts of cranes look like dinosaurs. We found a beach, but it was to cold to jump in. We took a walk through Kaivopuisto park and found a small hill from where we got a nice view over a few of the islands just outside of Helsinki. There we also found a memorial for all seafarers and the deceased at sea. One district in Helsinki is called Ulrikasborg, which translates to Ulrika’s castle in English, so we had to go there. Ullis is a nickname Ulrika and this district have in common. It was funny that we found Pontus café in Ulrikasborg. Finland was until 2009 the only country in the world that had Swedish as one of their official languages, since 2009 Swedish is also an official language in Sweden. Therefore, signs etc. in Helsinki have both Swedish and Finnish written on them, like the academic book store in the picture. Finland has their moomins (by Tove Jansson) and we had to take a picture of one when we where here. Atlas Obscura got us to see the Pohjola Insurance building – the company that wants to remind their customers that witches, bears, and gnomes are present so you better be insured. The building was built by architect Eliel Saarinen in 1901 and the name “Pohjola” is from the Finnish epic saga called the Kalevala. According to the legend, Pohjola was a Northern region ruled by an evil witch where you could find the roots of the World Tree. We walked passed Helsinki train station, which has an interesting architecture. Djurgårdsviken was still covered by ice, when we were here. It looked fragile so we strolled around the lake to get to Berghäll, another district of Helsinki. We used google maps and Atlas Obscura (link to the site can be found in the end) to get around here and we think that we were able to see quite a lot of Helsinki by foot before we had to board the next ferry. Churches are interesting and we think that the architecture, both exterior and interior, often reflects the culture and the mindset of the people in that country. In Finland, the embellishments and colors are stripped of the church, whereas churches in Central America are much more colorful and full of decorations. Hanasaari Power Plant is apparently a coal-consuming power plant. We found a lot of beautiful wooden ships in the Northern harbor. More pictures from Helsinki can be found in the slideshow below.\nHelsinki Cathedral was one of our last stops on our walk before we left Helsinki. Skatudden seems like a nice place to chill out during the summer months in Helsinki. Our ferry departed from Skatudden so we had to go to the ferry terminal. We went with Tallink to Tallinn, but we couldn’t book a ticket back to Sweden at the same time, long we needed to stay in Estonia. So when it was time for us to go to Sweden, it was cheaper to take the morning ferry to Helsinki and from there, take the night ferry with Viking Line to Stockholm. This was the reason we had an unexpected, but pleasant, day in Helsinki. We came to Stockholm the morning after and Gröna Lund, the amusement park, greeted us. Unfortunately, no bitcoin ATM was present here when we came to Stockholm. Back in Sweden and Pontus had a lecture about Bitcoin and the current economic system at the E-Commerce and Shop Tech fair. Pontus has been voted in as a member of the board for the Swedish Bitcoin association so that was why he ended up on stage at this kind of fair. Link to the Swedish Bitcoin Association can be found in the end. We also ended up meeting up with our old Bitcoin meet up group in Linköping. We were able to attend this years Freedomfest in Stockholm arranged by the Swedish Mises Institute.

On a support site , Ticketfly states that it is “investigating a cybersecurity incident” and its website and other services will be inaccessible for the time being. No timeframe has been provided as to when Ticketfly’s operations will return to normal.\nThis whole unfortunate incident started late Wednesday night when people started to notice some suspicious activity coming from Ticketfly. The Ticketfly website had been defaced with an image of V from the film V for Vendetta —a standard pulled from the hacker stock art collection—and a message that read, “Ticketfly HacKeD By IsHaKdZ. Your Security Down im Not Sorry.”\nWith these types of incidents, it’s often hard to tell just how fucked the victim of the hack is. It’s possible for an attacker to vandalize a site without doing any real damage to the behind-the-scenes infrastructure. Unfortunately, in the case of Ticketfly, the breach appears to be far worse than just the digital equivalent of graffiti.\nAdvertisement\nThe apparent hacker, going by IsHaKdZ, told Gizmodo via email that he found a vulnerability in the Ticketfly website and attempted to report it to the company. Motherboard reported seeing email conversations purportedly between the hacker and Ticketfly employees. The hacker said he “asked them 1 bitcoin for protection,” and when he didn’t receive it, he exploited the vulnerability.\nAccording to IsHaKdZ, he is in possession of a “complete” database containing sensitive information that he stole from Ticketfly. According to Motherboard , the hacker has several spreadsheet files that appear to contain personal information about thousands of Ticketfly customers and employees of venues that use the service. The database includes names, home addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers.\nIsHaKdZ is threatening to release another database, apparently labeled “backstage.” The hacker hasn’t provided any indication as to what the files might contain.\nAdvertisement\nTicketfly hasn’t disclosed what information may have been accessed by the hacker, but it has conceded that at least some data has been stolen. All the company has publicly said so far is that “some client and customer information” is believed to be compromised.\nA spokesperson for Eventbrite, Ticketfly’s parent company, told Gizmodo the following regarding the incident:\nWe’ve determined that Ticketfly.com has been the target of a cyber incident. Out of an abundance of caution, we have taken all Ticketfly systems temporarily offline as we continue to look into the issue. We realize the gravity of this decision, but the security of client and customer data is our top priority. We are working tirelessly, and in coordination with leading third party forensic experts, to get our clients back up and running.\nAdvertisement\nThe hack is bad all on its own, and Ticketfly is going to have to do some explaining to the customers and venues that it allowed to be exposed by the apparent vulnerability, but the company has another pressing issue to attend to as well: the fact that its primary operations have been disrupted.\nTicketfly is a ticket purchasing platform. Venues host events and allow people to purchase tickets through Ticketfly. With the site down, tickets for upcoming events can’t be digitally accessed by customers or verified by the venue. For the time being, Ticketfly is planning on supplying venues with a printed guest list to check in each person who purchased a ticket for the show.\nFrom the sounds of it, it’s going to be quite the hassle. Showgoers are expected to have a photo ID ready to go at the door. If the person attending the show didn’t buy the ticket, they’ll have to bring the credit card used to make the purchase, a photocopy of the buyer’s ID, and a note from the buyer authorizing the person to pick up the ticket.\nAdvertisement\nIndividual venues may handle the issue differently, and Ticketfly has recommended venues use social media to let ticket buyers know what they’ll need to get in the door. Regardless, venue operators will likely be dealing with some pissed off patrons through no fault of their own.\nUpdate, June 2nd, 2:40pm: A spokesperson for Ticketfly provided the following update on the situation:\nIn consultation with leading third-party forensic and cybersecurity experts, we are in the process of bringing the Ticketfly ticketing system back online with the security of our clients and fans top of mind. We are grateful for the outpouring of support our community has shown us while we continue to work through this cyber incident.\nAdvertisement\n[ Motherboard , Engadget ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.engadget.com/2018/06/01/ticketfly-hacked-venue-customer-data/", "https://support.ticketfly.com/customer/portal/articles/2941983-ticketfly-cyber-security-update", "https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1002046742806781952&#39;,", "https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mbk3nx/ticketfly-website-database-hacked-data-breach", "https://www.engadget.com/2018/06/01/ticketfly-hacked-venue-customer-data/&#39;,", "https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1002046742806781952", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41dluExakeE", "https://support.ticketfly.com/customer/portal/articles/2941983-ticketfly-cyber-security-update&#39;,", "https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mbk3nx/ticketfly-website-database-hacked-data-breach&#39;,"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ticketfly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ticketfly", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ticketfly", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T03:41:47.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c4ed993f74f95d897f4bf7cc83a08b55e2e1d0b6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeBnUpJeAW31mS9mDUg5gai.WAbesIqueFJ_fIk9nlggWFWfFHh4oyimw5YkkFj4Ke_olTCj899DWA--", "site_full": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin24on.blogspot.se/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "bitcoin24on.blogspot.com", "title": "Fundstrat: Bitcoin Recovery Underway, ‘Setup is Very Attractive’", "title_full": "Fundstrat: Bitcoin Recovery Underway, ‘Setup is Very Attractive’", "published": "2018-06-01T17:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c4ed993f74f95d897f4bf7cc83a08b55e2e1d0b6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS2gW571WBkNoNBWnxIr0b1j5Nu3NoWFeBnUpJeAW31mS9mDUg5gai.WAbesIqueFJ_fIk9nlggWFWfFHh4oyimw5YkkFj4Ke_olTCj899DWA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin 24on (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-01T17:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "Fundstrat: Bitcoin Recovery Underway, ‘Setup is Very Attractive’", "text": "Home » bitcoin » bitcoinist » crypto » news » Fundstrat: Bitcoin Recovery Underway, ‘Setup is Very Attractive’ Fundstrat: Bitcoin Recovery Underway, ‘Setup is Very Attractive’ bitcoin , bitcoinist , crypto , news #bitcoin # invest #money\nAfter threatening to fall through the floor, Bitcoin has seemingly found support above $7,000 — leading Fundstrat Global Advisors to claim a market rally is already underway. ‘It’s Going to Start a Recovery Process Here’\nYesterday, the head of technical strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors — an independent research boutique which provides market strategy and sector research — announced his company’s belief that Bitcoin is bottoming. Robert Sluymer told CNBC’s Futures Now :\nWhen we step back, we see the first phase starting to happen. We think Bitcoin is starting to bottom off some very key support around $7,000 and we think it’s going to start a recovery process here.\nSluymer’s statements come after the first and foremost cryptocurrency has found support at key support levels around the psychologically-significant level of $7,000 multiple times. In each instance, Bitcoin went on to recover — as it did earlier this week. Sluymer explained:\nThat’s certainly the first step in a bottoming process – to see some sort of consolidation or a basing taking hold. Technical Indicators\nAdding to the belief that Bitcoin has bottomed out is the market leader’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), a popular momentum indicator that compares the magnitude of recent gains and losses over a specified time period in an effort to measure speed and change of price movements. According to Sluymer, the RSI supports Fundstrat’s belief that Bitcoin is ready to rally. He stated:\nThat RSI indicator in the bottom of the chart is very oversold and starting to bottom so that’s really part of that bottoming phase taking hold.\nHowever, one should always exercise caution when following the advice of anyone analyzing the cryptocurrency market — which itself is prone to high levels of volatility and unregulated price manipulation . Because of this, there are some other indicators which may help confirm a reversal. Fundstrat’s head of technical strategy explained:\nThe next thing that has to happen is to see Bitcoin actually rally through the downtrend and we use the 15-day moving average, it’s very simplistic, but it’s a pretty good proxy across most markets.\nThat 15-day moving average is roughly $7,800. Should Bitcoin manage to hold a level above said price, it is likely that buyers will enter the market with increased confidence. ‘The Setup is Very Attractive Here’\nIt has been over one week since Bitcoin last traded above $7,800, but Sluymer believes we’re currently in a prime buying opportunity. He told CNBC:\nWe think the setup is very attractive here. If you’re short we think you should be very careful and reducing your short exposure. I think if you’re looking to be long this is where you start adding here to your long exposure.\nAt the time of this writing, Bitcoin is currently trading at $7,591.31, up 0.32 percent over the last 24 hours.\nDo you think Bitcoin has bottomed? Do you agree with Fundstrat’s analysis that the market leader is already beginning to rally?

However, Dan Morehead, founder of cryptocurrency hedge fund Pantera Capital , says that now is a perfect time to buy.\nSpeaking with CNBC , Morehead noted that the bitcoin price has broken below its 230-day moving average, an event which has historically proven to be an excellent trading opportunity for investors willing to purchase bitcoin and hold onto it for at least a year.\n“Without even thinking about it,” he said, “you make an average of 239 percent.”\n“That’s the essence of this trade: It rarely ever gets cheap to its long-term average,” added Morehead, a former Goldman Sachs executive. “So today is a good day to be buying.”\nMorehead, as CCN reported , correctly predicted that bitcoin would see a massive correction from its mid-December highs. However, a subsequent prediction that the market was beginning to enter a bull cycle perhaps jumped the gun because the bitcoin price stalled at $9,990 and dipped back down to a present value near $7,500.\nNevertheless, Morehead said that Pantera is still experiencing positive returns, largely because it has diversified its portfolio to include a range of cryptoassets. He said that the firm currently holds investments in approximately 35 initial coin offering (ICO) tokens, as well as 25 liquid cryptocurrencies.

The bitcoin exchanges are developing into a shadow banking system, which do not give their customers actual bitcoin but rather display a “balance” and allow them to transact with others. However if Alice sends Bob a bitcoin, and they’re both customers of the same exchange, it just adjusts their balances rather than doing anything on the blockchain. This is an e-money service, according to European law, but is the law enforced? Not where it matters. We’ve been looking at the details.\nIn March we wrote about how to trace stolen bitcoin , describing new tools that enable us to track crime proceeds on the blockchain with more precision than before. We waited for victims of bitcoin theft and fraud to come to us, so we could test our tools on real cases. However in most of them it was not clear that the victims had ever owned any bitcoin at all.\nThere are basically three ways you could try to hold a bitcoin. You could buy one from an exchange and get them to send it to a wallet you host yourself, but almost nobody does that.\nYou could buy one from an exchange and get the exchange to keep the keys for you, so that the asset was unique to you and they were only guarding it for you – just like when you buy gold and the bullion merchant then charges you a fee to guard your gold in his vault. If the merchant goes bust, you can turn up at the vault with your receipt and demand your gold back.\nOr you could buy one from an exchange and have them owe you a bitcoin – just as when you put your money in the bank. The bank doesn’t have a stack of banknotes in the vault with your name on it; and if it goes bust you have to stand in line with the other creditors.\nIt seems that most people who buy bitcoin think that they’re operating under the gold merchant model, while most exchanges operate under the bank model. This raises a whole host of issues around solvency, liquidity, accounting practices, money laundering, risk and trust. The details matter, and the more we look at them, the worse it seems.\nThis paper will appear at the Workshop on the Economics of Information Security later this month. It contains eight recommendations for what governments should be doing to clean up this mess.

(NYSE: MCD ), which makes sense, since a new Justice Department probe is turning Bitcoin futures into hamburger. Between May 21 and May 25, the value of a Bitcoin fell about $1,000, to slightly over $7,500.\nDespite headlines about a “rebound” it’s a huge comedown for the virtual currency, whose value started the year at over $14,000 and was as high as $17,000 in January .\nCharts on other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) , LiteCoin (LTC) and Cardano (ADA) mirror that of Bitcoin. One Iota (MIOTA) is now worth $1.53. Ripple (XRP) , supposed to mirror the U.S. dollar, is trading at 62 cents. Maybe they meant the Canadian dollar? Nope, that’s at 77 cents. Crypto Is Closely Held\nCritics have long called Bitcoin a “pump and dump” scheme, easily manipulated by hype, high prices easily crashed by just a few traders.\nA single “Bitcoin Whale,” an anonymous wallet worth $1.49 billion, sent the price of Bitcoin down $200 on a single day in April . The “whales” can swamp the market with sales, then scoop up Bitcoin at lower prices to gain even more control of the currency.\nWhen stocks are closely held, big owners must file statements about their intents to sell with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). An example of such a 10b5-1 I encountered recently is this one filed by Garmin Ltd. (NASDAQ: GRMN ) co-founder Dr. Min Kao .\nSuch statements are required to prevent a big holder, or “whale,” from swamping the market. But such rules don’t apply to Bitcoin.\nSome whales have publicly stated their intention to sell, like the bankruptcy trustee for Mt. Gox, a failed Bitcoin exchange, in Tokyo. Nobuaki Kobayashi said in March he still held $1.9 billion in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, and was looking to get the best price for it on behalf of those who lost money there.\nAs in the April example, other Bitcoin futures whales like to be anonymous. With an estimated 40% of Bitcoin held by just 1,000 wallets , the currency is very easy to manipulate. Compare Brokers The Investigation\nThe Justice Department said it is working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), under which the Bitcoin futures established last year are regulated against things like spoofing, which involves flooding the market with fake orders to panic people.\nOne example of spoofing might have been hiding in plain site in New York recently. Three Lamborghinis parked outside the Consensus conference at the New York Hilton turned out not to be owned by Bitcoin traders or owners but rented by the conference as a publicity stunt.\nPublicly, Bitcoin bulls welcomed their new Department of Justice overlords, yet reporters still call crypto “a global investment crazy, drawing legions of loyalists,” celebrity endorsements and attracting the attention of Wall Street.\nThis just in. The Department of Justice is not based on Wall Street. The Bottom Line\nBlanket statements like the one above, from Bloomberg , in the face of falling prices which are evidence the Bitcoin bubble has already sprung a major leak, are as silly as CNBC writing of a “rebound” after a dead cat bounce off $7,100 per Bitcoin.\nBitcoin’s advantages remain its disadvantages. It’s a global shark tank, one which reporters without skin in the game attract small traders to, filled with big fish just waiting to take away their money.\nThe dream of a single global currency untethered to any national bank still sounds laudable, but it’s increasingly clear that where there is no government, there remains government. Of the strong, over the weak. Of the rich, over the poor.\nDana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

Shortly before the start of American Friday trading, Bitcoin is trading at around $7389, and has not realized any expected upward impulse.\nBitcoin struggled to make the upward movement, following the Ether market, which gained up to $585 from $491 during the week. The total capitalization of the cryptocurrency market has slightly increased, from $330 billion to $333 billion, by about 1 percent.\nExactly one week ago, on May 25, the price of Bitcoins traded around the level of $7341. Today, as of June 1, the Bitcoin price is trading around $7377. Over the past five trading sessions, the main digital currency market has remained in the range of $7022 to $7585, struggling to record any major or minor movement in both upward and downward movement.\nBased on the market's behavior this week, it is unlikely that Bitcoin will return to previous support levels at $10000 and $12000 any time soon. Moreover, Bitcoin was unable to quickly reach the level of 7800-8000 dollars over the past several days, despite favorable technical and non-market factors (an increase in demand for Bitcoins amid massive sale-off on global stock markets).\nIf Bitcoin can exceed the $8500 mark in the next few days with a strong surge in volume, the market may be able to break its downward trend line. However, without strong gain, it is unlikely that Bitcoin will initiate volume increase in the short term.\nTechnically, $7000 - $7300 zone is a strong support zone. This was proved by the past five days. At the same time, there are still risks of market drop in the area of the next support of $6500.\nFortFS ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T17:12:18.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "95c2deabc372604bc85c06893ae5471405c76fc1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9GpoK49ucKkRXWUnl5lOwQIvQFkSk6yArZLZwwueBneMvSGnmvY_B7Qvi4IlryrkN._2IuS3r68PNO7K4dr82qyaHggcFDFzIcATFif3XHLA--", "site_full": "www.bitcoin.name", "site": "bitcoin.name", "site_section": "http://www.bitcoin.name/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News", "title": "Square Stocks Up $8B After Adding Bitcoin Functionality", "title_full": "Square Stocks Up $8B After Adding Bitcoin Functionality", "published": "2018-06-01T17:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "95c2deabc372604bc85c06893ae5471405c76fc1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9GpoK49ucKkRXWUnl5lOwQIvQFkSk6yArZLZwwueBneMvSGnmvY_B7Qvi4IlryrkN._2IuS3r68PNO7K4dr82qyaHggcFDFzIcATFif3XHLA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "adminbtc", "published": "2018-06-01T17:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "Square Stocks Up $8B After Adding Bitcoin Functionality", "text": "Leave a reply\nSquare’s stock, listed as SQ on the New York Stock Exchange, has rallied from USD 36 to USD 58 (+61%) since it added Bitcoin functionality to its popular Square Cash app in November 2017 . This has resulted in the stock’s market cap increasing over USD 8 billion, to USD 23 billion. This is the highest Square’s stock has ever been.\nSquare is a company which originally processed credit and debit card transactions for merchants, before releasing Square Cash, which is an extremely popular mobile app that people use to send money to each other instantly with credit or debit cards. Money can be instantly deposited into a user’s bank from a Square Cash account, and there is also a Square Cash card that users can take to an ATM and get cash out. These features have made Square Cash an excellent way for some users to transfer money instantly, far faster and cheaper than Western Union or MoneyGram if the receiver is equipped with the right card.\nIn November 2017, Square Cash added Bitcoin functionality to a limited set of users in a beta test, before opening up Bitcoin service to all of its Square Cash customers in the United States. Users can buy and sell Bitcoin on Square Cash at no fees . There is a margin of 1-2% between the buy and sell prices though, which is standard for Bitcoin exchanges and is how Square Cash makes money. Most other Bitcoin exchanges like Coinbase charge additional fees and are potentially more expensive than Square Cash.\nNow that Square Cash has Bitcoin, it offers some a far better and cheaper option to buy and sell Bitcoin, when compared to a Bitcoin ATM which often charges fees of 5-10%. It can also be more efficient than Bitcoin exchanges, since Square Cash deposits money instantly while exchanges can take 2 to 5 days.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/6307-getting-started-with-bitcoin-in-cash-app", "https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom", "https://cash.app/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/11/14/squares-cash-app-a-new-place-to-buy-and-sell-bitcoin/#65fc27434ce3", "https://t.me/bconews"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "new york stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square cash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moneygram", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T20:02:27.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c7f4d4d86d68b8032ea103d639719e3f7cf5ad3b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS4wjRtdxs5CnjsS1KOFYqg-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "What do you mean when you say Bitcoin is number 1", "title_full": "What do you mean when you say Bitcoin is number 1", "published": "2018-06-01T17:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 16, "participants_count": 17, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.038, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c7f4d4d86d68b8032ea103d639719e3f7cf5ad3b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS4wjRtdxs5CnjsS1KOFYqg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "soenaderecho10", "published": "2018-06-01T17:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "What do you mean when you say Bitcoin is number 1", "text": "Quote: from: mudra102 on May 31, 2018, 08:46:34 AM Many people have freedom from global control.

I believe everyone see BTC and ALTS as different assets for the many reasons that we know.\nOn the scale of $ 100, if you were told to distribute the money in Altcoins and Bitcoins then how much will go in the account of BTC and how much will be in the altcoins account?\nAlso explain why you have chose that % !\nThe facts before you answer :\nIt doesn't matter which altcoin you are investing in. Just think about all kinds of altcoin altogther, whether they are under development, developed, running with full nodes etc etc.\nBitcoin has no conditions as such as it is what it is right now.\nLet me start first :\nBTC Allcoation would be : $ 25\nALT Allocation would be : $ 75\nMy reasons :\nAltcoins are very much premature stage of bitcoin and I see them as little BTC of 2009 who eventually out busted like very crazy. After the period of 10 years all the altcoins (legit one) will have chance to grow and garnish themselves the same way and hence I think putting at least 75 % gross amount in it would be profitable.\nYou can use this code.

However, many market participants will remain wary of talking heads from the crypto industry talking up the price and may prefer to sit it out and wait for the optics on regulations to become clearer.\nNevertheless, Morehead sees positive effects coming from future regulation in the US: \"Many institutions are essentially buying the rumour [of potential SEC regulations] and selling the fact. Getting invested now so that in three, four, five months when the institutional, quality-regulated custodians that we ' re hearing about come online, they ' ll already have their positions.\" EOS $4 billion record token sale\nFor a change though, all eyes are not so much on bitcoin as blockchain platform EOS, which completes a year-long token sale at midnight (GMT) this Friday and has raised $4 billion. The EOS initial coin offering, as token sales are known, outstrips the largest of the initial public offerings that have taken place in US equity markets in 2018. The EOS network - which is a blockchain platform for running decentralised applications - is expected to go live this weekend.\nThe blockchain platform has been built by Block.one and when the mainnet launches it will cede control to the EOS token holders who will then be able to vote to elect \"block producers\", of which there will be 21 in total.\nEOS is the largest ICO ever, dwarfing the previous holder of that title, Telegram, the messaging app that raised $1.7 billion in its presale. It is estimated that $6.6 billion was raised in token sales last year and $9.1 billion so far this year. The sheer size of the EOS fundraising effort and the expectations surrounding its prospects, means its success or otherwise could be market-moving for the sector.\nMatthew Newton an analyst at global investment platform eToro is bullish about the launch: \"Now that the auction is coming to an end, we expect to see hundreds of entrepreneurs get to work on blockchain based, decentralised, apps. We ' re confident that one or more of these will be able to compete with the ' unicorns ' of the future.\"\nThe EOS platform only becomes fully operational after the code has been made publicly available, a randomly selected group of \"appointed block producers\" has tested the chain and it is then opened up to token holders. The first transactional activity is the voting process in which 15% of tokens have to take part, to elect 21 block producers who will have the executive power in EOS ' s delegated proof-of-stake (dPoS) consensus system which gives the most power to those who control the largest holding of tokens.\nUnlike Bitcoin and Ethereum ' s proof-of-work systems in which computers compete to solve mathematical tasks, dPoW is a much more efficient design. Vitalik Buerin, the inventor of Ethereum, has described the EOS governance system as a plutocracy although the voting on block producers is a continuous process, updated every two minutes, so membership of the group of 21 will change frequently. Token holders can delegate their votes to other members of the network to use.\nHowever, there is a mass of confusion about how to vote. Due to the lack of user-friendly tools for voting, it may not be a straightforward task to get 15% voter turnout. Token holders have until 2 June to register their Ethereum token address with EOS prior to launch. EOS the Android of the blockchain world?\n\"Tomorrow is a major moment for EOS as it becomes independent of the Ethereum network. But the mainnet launch represents more than just an upgrade,\" said eToro ' s Newton in comments for Interactive Investor.\nNewton continued: \"EOS is fundamentally trying to change the way in which apps are developed and accessed. Just like Google allowing developers to build on Android, EOS is opening up its blockchain to anyone who wants to write on it. But unlike Google, you need to actually have a stake in EOS to do so.\"\nBlock.one stated in a blog post on 20 April that it would not be a block producer and was not backing the efforts of any entities seeking to be block producers. Block.one owns 100 million EOS tokens (10% of total supply). The EOS token sale was not open to investors in the US and China.\nThe first block producers to be elected will probably be from among the exchanges and mining pools, and among the favourites are Huobi, Bitfinex and Antpool. There is a total supply of 1 billion EOS token and the circulating supply is fairly tightly held, with four whales thought to won 15% of supply. Huobi and Bitfinex are major crypto exchange based in Hong Kong and the US, respectively and both are investors in Block.one.\nEarly this week Chinese security firm Qihoo360 found a bug in the EOS code, which has since been fixed, but highlights the dangers of untested code with no track record unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum. Dan Larimer, EOS ' s chief technical officer and the developer behind Steemit and Bitshres, two already successful blockchains, expects there will be some software vulnerabilities exposed in the first couple of weeks or so.\nThe large amounts of money at stake in block rewards alone, mean fierce competition to become block producers as well as fraudsters hovering around the launch ready to make clones to trick EOS token holders into sending their tokens to illegitimate chains. Investors are already targeted investors with phishing emails, with reports of people losing millions of dollars worth of EOS tokens by being tricked into sending their wallet ' s private key to fraudulent addresses. Also, Block.one ' s email support set-up was attacked last weekend, which has added to the security concerns. The official EOS web address is EOS.io.\nEOS is the fifth-placed coin with a market capitalisation of $10.9 billion and is currently trading down 1.5% at $12.2, according to Cryptocompare.\nEOS has a lot of competition to beat to become the \"third-generation\" blockchain platform of choice, the first-gen being bitcoin and Ethereum the second-gen. NEO, Cardano, IOTA, Stellar, Qtum, to name a few, all have blockchain platforms up and running or in development aimed at delivering similarly efficient block verification and transactional capacity improvements. China ' s President Xi likes blockchain, Bittrex exchange gets a banker\nIn other crypto news China ' s leader President Xi Jinping, speaking at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, identified blockchain as a key transformational technology for the new industrial revolution: \"Ever since the start of the 21st century, a new generation of industrial revolution is substantially reshaping the global economic structure … with artificial intelligence, internet of things and blockchain constantly making application breakthroughs.\"\nThe Chinese government's Ministry of Information Technology recently began ranking 28 blockchains, with Ethereum, Steem, Lisk, NEO and Komodo currently the top five rated projects.\nPopular crypto exchange Bittrex has found itself a banking partner - New York commercial bank Signature Bank, with a market cap of $7.6 billion and annual sales of $1.36 billion. The US-based exchange will now be able to offer fiat/crypto trading pairs, although initially only in certain states of the US.\nBill Shihara, chief executive at Bittrex sees the deal as a sign of a maturing sector: \"It's been a long path… It's not just about banks being able to trust Bittrex. It's about banks being able to trust crypto in general. And I think it's really showing that crypto is turning the corner in terms of mainstream acceptance.\"\nLack of access to banking facilities has been a major drag on the development of the crypto ecosystem, with many banks still unwilling to take on the risks associated with the sector in terms of anti-money laundering considerations and the lack of wider regulation. World Cup lift?\nWith the World Cup two weeks away, hotels in host city Kaliningrad are accepting bitcoin payments after teaming up with payments provider Free-Kassa. Anna Subbotina from Apartments Malina said of the move: \"We have decided that fans should be able to pay for our services with the help of this innovative technology.\"\nSubbotina expects other hotels in the enclave city, the most westerly territory of Russia, to follow its lead in also accepting crypto. She added: \"We are seeing increasing interest in cryptocurrencies.

Cryptocurrencies suddenly reverse trend to the downside, there is potential for more gains.\nMost of the major cryptocurrencies have begun correcting lower on Friday. The downside movement is being led by the King of the virtual currencies, Bitcoin which is down $1.13% on the day while trading at $7,405. The other assets have also followed in the steps of Bitcoin, for instance, Ethereum price is trading at $574 while it is correcting lower a subtle 0.39%. Moreover, Ripple price has not been left behind, it is down 0.18% but is it is still supported above $0.60.\nThe latest news from Israel says that the country has decided to delay regulations that had been scheduled to take effect on June 1. The decision was arrived at after a meeting held by the finance committee of Knesset: The arm of the government in charge of legislation. The co-chair of Israel Bar Association (IBA) Jacob Enoch in an e-mail to the news website, Cryptovest said:\n“The reason for the delay is the lack of a prohibition on money laundering, which implies that these companies have not been mindful of, and have not acted to prevent, money laundering to this day. This is something that is not acceptable to say about an entire market.”\nEnoch went ahead to say that this move is rather dramatic and will only be beneficial to the large financial institutions. These institutions are wary of the competition that is bound to come after regulated FinTech firms start to operate in the country. He said in conclusion:\n“One can only hope, that such inevitable antagonism among fintech investors will not snowball into a potential loss of trust,”\nBitcoin price short-term analysis\nBitcoin price has broken out of the short-term contracting triangle we explored earlier in the previous hour. Moreover, breaking past the 61.8% Fib retracement level opened the gate for the price to test the support level at $7,300. BTC/USD is trading at $7,398, besides there is a reactive bullish momentum that is battling to reverse the sadden downside movement. The 200 SMA failed to support the price above $7,400 will offer resistance as the price retraces steps towards $7,500.\nBTC/USD 1-hour chart", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/news/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-usd-rising-marginally-above-7-550-imf-deputy-director-dong-he-advises-central-banks-to-consider-issuing-digital-tokens-of-their-own-201806011149", "https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jacob enoch", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cryptovest", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "israel bar association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "knesset", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T16:12:44.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c49c63f3f00f22721c1259427527f22963cdeb1d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.shv5UO2Jt9mmhofyC7ovmdh5JYtcvmzQmRb4bEUCYtw8iAXCsYNV9SE-", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "r/Bitcoin recap - May 2018", "title_full": "r/Bitcoin recap - May 2018", "published": "2018-06-01T15:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c49c63f3f00f22721c1259427527f22963cdeb1d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.shv5UO2Jt9mmhofyC7ovmdh5JYtcvmzQmRb4bEUCYtw8iAXCsYNV9SE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-01T15:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "r/Bitcoin recap - May 2018", "text": "r/Bitcoin recap - May 2018\n/u/SamWouters\nHi Bitcoiners!\nI'm back with the seventeenth monthly Bitcoin news recap.\nFor those unfamiliar, each day I pick out the most popular/relevant/interesting stories in r/Bitcoin and save them.

"Negative side of Bitcoin", "text": "Quote: from: Kelampok ijo on May 25, 2018, 11:20:45 AM In addition to having a lot of extraordinary impact among the world community, surely we all know how the Dark Side against Bitcoin, Bitcoin is currently a concern because with all its decentralized and unbounded advantages in the system of transactions and ownership. But on the other hand, it is reaping the dark side of the digital currency.\nI think Bitcoin is very useful for criminals who want to hide money from their crimes. Because if they save money in the bank, the money from the crime can be easily traced. Bitcoin can also be abused by people who want to hide their income from government, and avoid paying taxes. Then, the state revenue from the tax will be lost because of the money that is not tracked. Not only in the criminal acts alone, the most basic lack of Bitcoin also occurs because of its unreal form.\nNot to mention the instability of the value of Bitcoin currency if converted to other conventional currencies are very volatile. Today, maybe the owner can be very rich by having Bitcoin worth 1,000 US dollars. However, who knows if in the future the value of money is only left 50 US dollars.\nsome minor events that cause huge losses for Bitcoin owners. A man once lost about 600 US dollars for doing a reset on his smart phone and in fact, he accidentally permanently remove the Bitcoin digital wallet.\nA number of online platforms are testing the payment with Bitcoin currency, among others WordPress, Reddit, Namecheap, Mega, and Zynga. However, some countries even banned transactions with Bitcoin. The Chinese government, for example, forbids all financial institutions from receiving Bitcoin transactions. While the EU rate Bitcoin more easily stolen. In terms of investment is also bad because the currency is determined only based on market demand and has a high fluctuation rate.\nThe only thing that might be a negative about bitcoin is that it possesses the highest volatility rate among the cryptocurrency on the market. Since it was created first and gained trust from the investors and users, bitcoin do have the ability to burst up and down because of high demand with a very limited supply.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-02T07:03:13.050+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ad676e9b87709ba1dfdda1f35e4a1f2c9fd392f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQarM32BDmb9vjgpBRCHHMx6jXLxMYaggmtBM8.k9UnKRTMld8M.xj1P7bEvuivyyXW92Wai4TmEax2GAeatH2kY8D9tI80AzNGVmDHNBA5cg--", "site_full": "sg.finance.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/topic/investing", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Yahoo Finance - Business finance, stock market, quotes, news", "title": "Bitcoin Prices Rise; Spain Supports Crypto Regulation", "title_full": "Bitcoin Prices Rise; Spain Supports Crypto Regulation", "published": "2018-06-01T15:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.358, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FF4vknlnDoyALZKvE5II5Q--~B/aD0zMTM7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/investing_com_631/510ab93622515b78f86e3eee4dc1a738", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ad676e9b87709ba1dfdda1f35e4a1f2c9fd392f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQarM32BDmb9vjgpBRCHHMx6jXLxMYaggmtBM8.k9UnKRTMld8M.xj1P7bEvuivyyXW92Wai4TmEax2GAeatH2kY8D9tI80AzNGVmDHNBA5cg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Investing.com", "published": "2018-06-01T15:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Prices Rise; Spain Supports Crypto Regulation", "text": "Cryptocurrency prices traded higher on Friday morning in Asia More Investing.com – Cryptocurrency prices traded higher on Friday morning in Asia despite potential regulations worldwide.

However, the more established bitcoin becomes, the more retailers and businesses will be willing to accept it as a legitimate currency. Here are five things you probably didnt realize you could buy with your bitcoins.\n1. Gift cards At sites like Gyft and eGifter, you can purchase gift cards for all sorts of retailers that dont formally take bitcoin yet.\n2.

PizzaForCoins has been around for a while, allowing you to place orders for various pizza chains through their website and paying with your bitcoin.\n3. Airline/hotel/space flight tickets Surprisingly, big companies like Expedia and CheapAir now accept bitcoin directly through their websites for hotel reservations and airline tickets.
