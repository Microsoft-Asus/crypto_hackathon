It's a question that financial advisors increasingly hear these days.\nYet advisors, for the most part, don't recommend investing in digital currency, or in the investment vehicles that have cropped up around it, at all. In fact, earlier this year, Merrill Lynch banned bitcoin buying across the firm. JP Morgan chairman Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a fraud (he later softened some of his comments), and Vanguard CEO Tim Buckley told CNBC in an interview: You will never see a fund from Vanguard on bitcoin.\nThere's no doubt that bitcoin has been wildly volatile, so for now, many advisors apparently remain wary and urge investors to avoid cryptocurrency investments altogether.\nCryptocurrency is very controversial, but it's really here to stay, he said. And the underlying [blockchain] technology is really fundamental to the types of companies that people are building right now.\nIt's important for individuals who want to invest in cryptocurrency to first understand what it is and also how blockchain technology works, Sokolin explained.\nTo be sure, one of the most compelling things about cryptocurrency is actually blockchain, he added. To that point, Amazon just announced that its cloud computing arm is partnering with a start-up called Kaleido to make it easier for customers to put their services on blockchain.\nIt's volatile right now, so you should not just go and fill your entire portfolio with cryptocurrencies, he said. But it is a good way to add alternatives to your general allocation, something like 3 [percent] to 5 percent of your portfolio.\nSokolin warned financial advisors that their clients are going to buy bitcoin whether they like it or not.\nSo [advisors] can choose to say that this whole thing will fall apart and not get educated about it and not help [investors], but that's really irresponsible, he said.\nAdvisors need to take the time and brush up on the subjects of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology so they can properly address questions from their clients, Sokolin explained.\nAdvisors really need to start to understand the basics of how blockchain works, he said. Start to understand why there are different cryptocurrencies.\nWhat's the difference between a payments coin, like bitcoin or ethereum? Sokolin added. All of these things are different, so advisors have to spend the time so they can actually help their clients make sense of this.

This follows market leaders such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter either severely restricting crypto ads or banning them altogether.\nAlso read: Ethereum Futures in US One Step Closer as CME Deal is Struck Microsoft’s Bing Search Engine Bans Crypto Ads\nAdvertiser Policy Manager, Melissa Alsoszatai-Petheo, posted an update to Microsoft’s Bing search engine ad policy. Bing Ads to Disallow Cryptocurrency Advertising is the title of the company’s rather obvious move. “We are always evaluating our policies to ensure a safe and engaging experience for our Bing users and the digital advertising ecosystem,” Ms. Alsoszatai-Petheo began. “Because cryptocurrency and related products are not regulated, we have found them to present a possible elevated risk to our users with the potential for bad actors to participate in predatory behaviors, or otherwise scam consumers.”\nBing has consistently ranked a very distant second behind the Google juggernaut, which gobbles up better than 60% of search traffic on the internet. Google at the beginning of 2018 announced a far more specific series of cryptocurrency related prohibitions, down to defining contract for difference (CFDs) products.\nIt wasn’t too much later when Facebook followed , as we reported at the end of January, with “a new ruling issued on January 30, ‘ads must not promote financial products and services that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices, such as binary options, initial coin offerings, or cryptocurrency.’” Twitter too, a mere two months later, presented its new advertising policy, severely restricting initial coin offering (ICOs) and token sales. Protection is the Pretext\n“To help protect our users from this risk,” the notice from Bing continued, “we have made the decision to disallow advertising for cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency related products, and un-regulated binary options. Bing Ads will implement this change to our financial product and services policy globally in June, with enforcement rolling out in late June to early July.”\nOther than seeking a press cycle of promotion, it does appear “scams” were a bit of a problem during 2017, according to Bing’s annual report. “Tech scams are widely used by bad actors and we rejected 25 million ads in this category in 2017,” they insisted. And under the banner of misleading ads, Bing noted how last “year, we took down 30 million such ads, 20,000 such websites and 43,500 bad actors.”\nDo you think crypto ad bans will have a negative impact?

To rethink what is possible in our world, we need to consider what kind of world we want to live in. Although we refer to it as a civilization, it is anything but civilized. Visions of global unity & fellowship have long inspired humanity, yet the social arrangements up to the present have largely failed to produce a peaceful and productive world. While we appear to be technically advanced, our values and behaviors are not. The possibility of an optimistic future is in stark contrast to our current social, economic, and environmental dilemmas. The Choice Is Ours includes interviews with notable scientists, media professionals, authors, and other thinkers exploring the difficulties we face.Part I provides an introduction and overview of cultural & environmental conditions that are untenable for a sustainable world civilization. It explores the determinants of behavior to dispel the myth of “human nature” while demonstrating how environment shapes behavior. The science of behavior is an important - yet largely missing - ingredient in our culture.Part II questions the values, behaviors, and consequences of our social structures, and illustrates how our global monetary system is obsolete and increasingly insufficient to meet the needs of most people. Critical consideration of the banking, media, and criminal justice systems reveals these institutions for what they really are: tools of social control managed by the established political and economic elite. If we stay the present course, the familiar cycles of crime, economic booms & busts, war, and further environmental destruction are inevitable.Part III explains the methods and potential of science. It proposes solutions that we can apply at present to eliminate the use of non-renewable sources of energy. It depicts the vision of The Venus Project to build an entirely new world from the ground up, a “redesign of the culture”, where all enjoy a high standard of living, free of servitude and debt, while also protecting the environment.Part IV explains how it is not just architecture and a social structure that is in desperate need of change, but our values which have been handed down from centuries ago. They too need to be updated to our technological age, which has the potential to eliminate our scarcity-driven societies of today. Our problems are mostly of our own making, but we can still turn things around before the point of no return. It’s not too late for an optimistic outlook on the fantastic possibilities that lie before us.Jacque Fresco-Futurist, Industrial Designer, Social Engineer, Founder of The Venus ProjectJeffrey A.

But what is bitcoin and why is there so much noise about it? Even though that is not the goal of this article, we will touch on this subject for a bit.\nHowever, our goal in this article is to understand the underlying network infrastructure on which Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrencies run, and also look at security threats to this network that may affect the operations of these cryptocurrencies. Overview of Cryptocurrencies\nEven though quite a lot of people have heard about Bitcoin, only a few are into it (trading, mining, etc), and of those, only a handful really understand what this cryptocurrency is and the technology that drives it and other cryptocurrencies.\nWhen you buy something from the supermarket and you pay with some money (e.g. dollar notes), why does the supermarket collect those paper notes from you? On its own, that note is just paper and has no inherent value. However, the reason you can use it as a legal tender is that the Government that issued that note (usually through their Central Bank) guarantees to back the monetary value of that note.\nHowever, not everyone is happy with the current state of the financial industry. Why do we need centralized entities (e.g. central banks) to control the generation and transfer of money, instead of a decentralized peer-to-peer model ? There are a couple of benefits of a decentralized model including privacy (of transactions and money property), inability of law enforcement to seize funds, possibly reduced transaction fees, and widespread access even to the unbanked who are estimated at 2 billion people globally.\nBut the biggest issue of decentralized control of a financial medium is TRUST . We (generally) trust the central entities handling our money and when we pay someone, that person also trusts that their own central entity will honor the payment.\nEnter the world of Cryptocurrency. Simply put, a cryptocurrency is a digital currency that relies on cryptography for the creation of the currency units and also uses cryptography to verify the transfer of units between parties. Control is decentralized and everyone on the network has access to each other, without a central entity controlling the system.\nSo how is trust maintained in a network like this? Let’s use Bitcoin as an example. Let’s say you go to a coffee shop that collects bitcoin payments and you buy a cup of coffee, that transaction must be recorded somewhere showing that the amount of bitcoin you have has reduced, while that of the coffee shop has increased. This record is kept in a publicly accessible ledger (history of records) called a Blockchain . However, before your transaction can be added to the blockchain, it must be verified by “miners”. This process of mining is computationally intensive and on the average, new blocks (a group of transaction records) are created every 10 minutes on the bitcoin blockchain.\nNote : One of the incentives of mining is the ability to earn cryptocurrency units. However, since so many other people are also trying to compute acceptable blocks to be added to the blockchain, it is more of a race against time. As such, people form Mining Pools to put their resources together and rewards are shared among the pool members.\nSince blocks are chained together with a cryptographic function, it is extremely difficult for someone to go back and change something (e.g. increase their currency units after spending it). The computational difficulty in forging fake blocks is what makes the Blockchain secure in terms of integrity and trust of information stored in it. Cryptocurrency from a Networking Perspective\nBased on the brief description of cryptocurrencies that we did above, some questions should come to your mind from a networking perspective. For example, how does one party transfer units of the currency to another party? Over which medium does this transfer happen? Also, over which medium do all the nodes on a network have access to the blockchain ?\nIf one of the goals of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is widespread access, then they need to rely on an infrastructure that everyone already has access to – the Internet . Therefore, the operation of these currencies can be thought of as applications/services that run on top of a networking infrastructure, in this case, the global Internet.\nSo to join the Bitcoin wagon, for example, all you need to do is install a bitcoin client on a computer, get a list of peers to connect to (IP addresses or DNS name resolutions), initiate connections to a few random peers (default TCP port 8333), and that’s it!\nNote : Even though all bitcoin nodes are equal (no hierarchy), nodes can perform different functions. As such, there are different types of bitcoin nodes like full nodes, mining nodes, SPV nodes, and so on. You can read more about that here .\nWhoever wishes to know more about Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies, should definitely start from the Andreas Antonopoulos YouTube page . General Security Attacks on Cryptocurrencies\nAs with any technology, especially one that is exposed on the Internet, cryptocurrencies are subject to various security threats and attacks including: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) and Hijacking attacks : In a MITM attack, an attacker gets in the middle of the communication between a victim and the rest of the network (or a particular subset of the network). The attacker can intercept messages meant for the victim or from the victim, and result in cryptocurrency issues like transaction delay, loss of mining revenue, and wastage of computing resources. In the case of hijacking, the attacker can steal resources from a victim by redirecting the victim’s connection to an illegitimate destination. A real example of this is where an attacker made about $83,000 by redirecting miners’ connections to the attacker’s own mining pool. This happened in 2014. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks : DoS and Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks are common in the world of cryptocurrency. These attacks are usually done against digital currency exchanges, effectively locking out legitimate users from accessing their virtual money. Examples here include a DDoS attack against Bitcoin Gold (a fork of Bitcoin), DDoS attack against Poloniex (a digital currency exchange), and DDoS attack against Bitfinex (also a digital currency exchange). All these attacks happened in 2017, so they are common enough. Theft : Even though the underlying blockchain technology itself may be secure against theft (to a large extent), the implementation and services that use this technology may not be. There have been several instances where bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been stolen from one party (or several parties) to another, usually untraceable, party. Mining attacks : Like we already said in this article, mining requires a lot of computational resources. Attackers have therefore found a way to use the computers (or servers) of unsuspecting victims to mine cryptocurrency. There is a scary report here about such attacks. You may have noticed that when you visit some websites, there is a sudden increase in your CPU/RAM performance. This could be a sign that your computer is being used to mine cryptocurrency. Keep in mind that some websites are upfront about it. Instead of showing you ads for their free service, they ask you to help them mine cryptocurrency instead. DNS hacks : Internet users rely on the Domain Name System (DNS) to resolve a domain name to an IP address. Therefore, we can say DNS is just a directory containing domain names to IP addresses entries. But what happens if an attacker is able to modify a DNS entry so that users are directed to a different destination than intended? This is exactly what happened to MyEtherWallet ( MEW ), an Ethereum-based service. By attacking DNS, users of the MEW service were redirected to a different (and similar looking) website and once they entered their login details, some of their cryptocurrency units were stolen. It is estimated that about $150,000 was stolen during the duration of the attack. Focus: Routing Attacks on Cryptocurrencies\nHaving covered some of the attacks on cryptocurrencies, let us now focus on some of the ways the underlying network infrastructure can be attacked , affecting cryptocurrencies. BGP Hijack\nSince Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies mostly rely on the Internet as their means of communication, attacking this network infrastructure can disrupt the operations of these cryptocurrencies. One of such attacks against the Internet is known as BGP Hijack .\nTo put it simply, BGP is the routing protocol of the Internet . Different Autonomous Systems (AS) share routing information with each other using BGP. For example, if AS1 has been assigned the prefix 192.0.2.0/23, it will announce that prefix to its neighbors, AS2 and AS3. So if hosts connected through AS2 want to reach a destination in the 192.0.2.0/23 network, the routers in that AS know to send it to AS1.\nNote : This is a very simple example that does not use real AS numbers or real prefixes.\nNow let us assume AS4 is under the control of an attacker. In a BGP Hijack, that AS4 may announce a more specific prefix (e.g. 192.0.2.0/24) to AS2 and AS3. Since routers generally prefer more specific routes in their routing table, any traffic meant for 192.0.2.0/24 is now forwarded to AS4 instead of AS1.\nNote : BGP Hijack is actually very common on the Internet. While some of it is due to misconfiguration, others are done with malicious intent. See examples of high-profile BGP Hijacking incidents here , here , and here .\nSo how can this attack affect cryptocurrencies specifically? Well, an attacker can effectively cut off a set of nodes (e.g. mining nodes) from the rest of the cryptocurrency network. When service is restored after the attack, all the work the mining nodes have done will be wasted , leading to loss of revenue. In another instance, the attacker can redirect the miner’s connection to a mining pool controlled by the attacker. We saw a real example of that earlier in this article. Traffic Interception\nThe Internet is just an interconnection of networks . This means that before your traffic gets to a particular destination, it will cross several other networks (ASes). If an attacker can sit in the path of your traffic and intercept such traffic, they can get very creative.\nLet’s use the mining that happens in Bitcoin as an example. A miner solves a mathematically difficult problem to come up with a block and then adds that block to the blockchain. Now imagine that an attacker intercepts this block before it gets on the blockchain and delays it just a little until someone else solves the same problem and that other block is used in the blockchain. What happens is the miner that first solved the block whose traffic was delayed will have wasted time and effort and also lost out on the potential mining rewards for solving that block. Feasibility and Practicality of Routing Attacks\nNot only are these two routing attacks technically feasible as we have described above, they are also very practical . If you take a look at the live distribution of Bitcoin nodes for example, you will notice that over 50% of nodes are concentrated in just 3 countries in the world. Also, it is estimated that China has approximately 81% of the Bitcoin mining pools in the world. What this means is that something that is meant to be decentralized is actually quite centralized in a few locations.\nAccording to this research , 60% of all bitcoin connections can be seen by only 3 ASes (large ISPs). So if there was a concerted effort by a group of attackers (e.g. state-supported hackers) against one or all of these ISPs, they could potentially disrupt the bitcoin network (and indeed, the entire Internet). Also, what if there is a targeted attack against China which has the most mining pools? Securing Cryptocurrencies against Routing Attacks\nThe routing attacks we have described in this section are not specific to cryptocurrencies alone. As such, we can apply the same security measures that have existed for years to prevent these kinds of attacks.\nFor example, BGP Hijacks can be limited by using prefix filtering , implementing Resource Public Key Infrastructure ( RPKI ), and also extending BGP using the BGPSec Protocol .\nThe effectiveness of Interception attacks can be greatly reduced by multi-homing where a node or group of nodes (e.g. mining pool) are connected to the cryptocurrency network via multiple paths. Also, as with any MITM attack, an attacker cannot modify what he/she cannot see. Therefore, by implementing traffic encryption , even if the traffic is intercepted, it cannot be altered. Conclusion\nCryptocurrencies and the Blockchain technology on which it runs provide some very interesting possibilities for the now and the future. While it is yet to be seen if these cryptocurrencies will survive in the long run, it is important for those who are already on this cryptocurrency train to understand what it really is, and more importantly, the security threats against cryptocurrencies.\nIn this article, we have considered some of such security threats and then focused on the routing attacks against cryptocurrencies, including BGP Hijack and Traffic Interception . While these attacks are not specific to cryptocurrencies alone, they can have potentially damaging effects on cryptocurrency operations like wastage of resources and loss of revenue.

But what is bitcoin and why is there so much noise about it? Even though that is not the goal of this article, we will touch on this subject for a bit.\nHowever, our goal in this article is to understand the underlying network infrastructure on which Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrencies run, and also look at security threats to this network that may affect the operations of these cryptocurrencies. Overview of Cryptocurrencies\nEven though quite a lot of people have heard about Bitcoin, only a few are into it (trading, mining, etc), and of those, only a handful really understand what this cryptocurrency is and the technology that drives it and other cryptocurrencies.\nWhen you buy something from the supermarket and you pay with some money (e.g. dollar notes), why does the supermarket collect those paper notes from you? On its own, that note is just paper and has no inherent value. However, the reason you can use it as a legal tender is that the Government that issued that note (usually through their Central Bank) guarantees to back the monetary value of that note.\nHowever, not everyone is happy with the current state of the financial industry. Why do we need centralized entities (e.g. central banks) to control the generation and transfer of money, instead of a decentralized peer-to-peer model ? There are a couple of benefits of a decentralized model including privacy (of transactions and money property), inability of law enforcement to seize funds, possibly reduced transaction fees, and widespread access even to the unbanked who are estimated at 2 billion people globally.\nBut the biggest issue of decentralized control of a financial medium is TRUST . We (generally) trust the central entities handling our money and when we pay someone, that person also trusts that their own central entity will honor the payment.\nEnter the world of Cryptocurrency. Simply put, a cryptocurrency is a digital currency that relies on cryptography for the creation of the currency units and also uses cryptography to verify the transfer of units between parties. Control is decentralized and everyone on the network has access to each other, without a central entity controlling the system.\nSo how is trust maintained in a network like this? Let’s use Bitcoin as an example. Let’s say you go to a coffee shop that collects bitcoin payments and you buy a cup of coffee, that transaction must be recorded somewhere showing that the amount of bitcoin you have has reduced, while that of the coffee shop has increased. This record is kept in a publicly accessible ledger (history of records) called a Blockchain . However, before your transaction can be added to the blockchain, it must be verified by “miners”. This process of mining is computationally intensive and on the average, new blocks (a group of transaction records) are created every 10 minutes on the bitcoin blockchain.\nNote : One of the incentives of mining is the ability to earn cryptocurrency units. However, since so many other people are also trying to compute acceptable blocks to be added to the blockchain, it is more of a race against time. As such, people form Mining Pools to put their resources together and rewards are shared among the pool members.\nSince blocks are chained together with a cryptographic function, it is extremely difficult for someone to go back and change something (e.g. increase their currency units after spending it). The computational difficulty in forging fake blocks is what makes the Blockchain secure in terms of integrity and trust of information stored in it. Cryptocurrencies from a Networking Perspective\nBased on the brief description of cryptocurrencies that we did above, some questions should come to your mind from a networking perspective. For example, how does one party transfer units of the currency to another party? Over which medium does this transfer happen? Also, over which medium do all the nodes on a network have access to the blockchain ?\nIf one of the goals of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is widespread access, then they need to rely on an infrastructure that everyone already has access to – the Internet . Therefore, the operation of these currencies can be thought of as applications/services that run on top of a networking infrastructure, in this case, the global Internet.\nSo to join the Bitcoin wagon, for example, all you need to do is install a bitcoin client on a computer, get a list of peers to connect to (IP addresses or DNS name resolutions), initiate connections to a few random peers (default TCP port 8333), and that’s it!\nNote : Even though all bitcoin nodes are equal (no hierarchy), nodes can perform different functions. As such, there are different types of bitcoin nodes like full nodes, mining nodes, SPV nodes, and so on. You can read more about that here .\nWhoever wishes to know more about Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies, should definitely start from the Andreas Antonopoulos YouTube page . General Security Attacks on Cryptocurrencies\nAs with any technology, especially one that is exposed on the Internet, cryptocurrencies are subject to various security threats and attacks including: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) and Hijacking attacks : In a MITM attack, an attacker gets in the middle of the communication between a victim and the rest of the network (or a particular subset of the network). The attacker can intercept messages meant for the victim or from the victim, and result in cryptocurrency issues like transaction delay, loss of mining revenue, and wastage of computing resources. In the case of hijacking, the attacker can steal resources from a victim by redirecting the victim’s connection to an illegitimate destination. A real example of this is where an attacker made about $83,000 by redirecting miners’ connections to the attacker’s own mining pool. This happened in 2014. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks : DoS and Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks are common in the world of cryptocurrency. These attacks are usually done against digital currency exchanges, effectively locking out legitimate users from accessing their virtual money. Examples here include a DDoS attack against Bitcoin Gold (a fork of Bitcoin), DDoS attack against Poloniex (a digital currency exchange), and DDoS attack against Bitfinex (also a digital currency exchange). All these attacks happened in 2017, so they are common enough. Theft : Even though the underlying blockchain technology itself may be secure against theft (to a large extent), the implementation and services that use this technology may not be. There have been several instances where bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been stolen from one party (or several parties) to another, usually untraceable, party. Mining attacks : Like we already said in this article, mining requires a lot of computational resources. Attackers have therefore found a way to use the computers (or servers) of unsuspecting victims to mine cryptocurrency. There is a scary report here about such attacks. You may have noticed that when you visit some websites, there is a sudden increase in your CPU/RAM performance. This could be a sign that your computer is being used to mine cryptocurrency. Keep in mind that some websites are upfront about it. Instead of showing you ads for their free service, they ask you to help them mine cryptocurrency instead. DNS hacks : Internet users rely on the Domain Name System (DNS) to resolve a domain name to an IP address. Therefore, we can say DNS is just a directory containing domain names to IP addresses entries. But what happens if an attacker is able to modify a DNS entry so that users are directed to a different destination than intended? This is exactly what happened to MyEtherWallet ( MEW ), an Ethereum-based service. By attacking DNS, users of the MEW service were redirected to a different (and similar looking) website and once they entered their login details, some of their cryptocurrency units were stolen. It is estimated that about $150,000 was stolen during the duration of the attack. Focus: Routing Attacks on Cryptocurrencies\nHaving covered some of the attacks on cryptocurrencies, let us now focus on some of the ways the underlying network infrastructure can be attacked , affecting cryptocurrencies. BGP Hijack\nSince Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies mostly rely on the Internet as their means of communication, attacking this network infrastructure can disrupt the operations of these cryptocurrencies. One of such attacks against the Internet is known as BGP Hijack .\nTo put it simply, BGP is the routing protocol of the Internet . Different Autonomous Systems (AS) share routing information with each other using BGP. For example, if AS1 has been assigned the prefix 192.0.2.0/23, it will announce that prefix to its neighbors, AS2 and AS3. So if hosts connected through AS2 want to reach a destination in the 192.0.2.0/23 network, the routers in that AS know to send it to AS1.\nNote : This is a very simple example that does not use real AS numbers or real prefixes.\nNow let us assume AS4 is under the control of an attacker. In a BGP Hijack, that AS4 may announce a more specific prefix (e.g. 192.0.2.0/24) to AS2 and AS3. Since routers generally prefer more specific routes in their routing table, any traffic meant for 192.0.2.0/24 is now forwarded to AS4 instead of AS1.\nNote : BGP Hijack is actually very common on the Internet. While some of it is due to misconfiguration, others are done with malicious intent. See examples of high-profile BGP Hijacking incidents here , here , and here .\nSo how can this attack affect cryptocurrencies specifically? Well, an attacker can effectively cut off a set of nodes (e.g. mining nodes) from the rest of the cryptocurrency network. When service is restored after the attack, all the work the mining nodes have done will be wasted , leading to loss of revenue. In another instance, the attacker can redirect the miner’s connection to a mining pool controlled by the attacker. We saw a real example of that earlier in this article. Traffic Interception\nThe Internet is just an interconnection of networks . This means that before your traffic gets to a particular destination, it will cross several other networks (ASes). If an attacker can sit in the path of your traffic and intercept such traffic, they can get very creative.\nLet’s use the mining that happens in Bitcoin as an example. A miner solves a mathematically difficult problem to come up with a block and then adds that block to the blockchain. Now imagine that an attacker intercepts this block before it gets on the blockchain and delays it just a little until someone else solves the same problem and that other block is used in the blockchain. What happens is the miner that first solved the block whose traffic was delayed will have wasted time and effort and also lost out on the potential mining rewards for solving that block. Feasibility and Practicality of Routing Attacks\nNot only are these two routing attacks technically feasible as we have described above, they are also very practical . If you take a look at the live distribution of Bitcoin nodes for example, you will notice that over 50% of nodes are concentrated in just 3 countries in the world. Also, it is estimated that China has approximately 81% of the Bitcoin mining pools in the world. What this means is that something that is meant to be decentralized is actually quite centralized in a few locations.\nAccording to this research , 60% of all bitcoin connections can be seen by only 3 ASes (large ISPs). So if there was a concerted effort by a group of attackers (e.g. state-supported hackers) against one or all of these ISPs, they could potentially disrupt the bitcoin network (and indeed, the entire Internet). Also, what if there is a targeted attack against China which has the most mining pools? Securing Cryptocurrencies against Routing Attacks\nThe routing attacks we have described in this section are not specific to cryptocurrencies alone. As such, we can apply the same security measures that have existed for years to prevent these kinds of attacks.\nFor example, BGP Hijacks can be limited by using prefix filtering , implementing Resource Public Key Infrastructure ( RPKI ), and also extending BGP using the BGPSec Protocol .\nThe effectiveness of Interception attacks can be greatly reduced by multi-homing where a node or group of nodes (e.g. mining pool) are connected to the cryptocurrency network via multiple paths. Also, as with any MITM attack, an attacker cannot modify what he/she cannot see. Therefore, by implementing traffic encryption , even if the traffic is intercepted, it cannot be altered. Conclusion\nCryptocurrencies and the Blockchain technology on which it runs provide some very interesting possibilities for the now and the future. While it is yet to be seen if these cryptocurrencies will survive in the long run, it is important for those who are already on this cryptocurrency train to understand what it really is, and more importantly, the security threats against cryptocurrencies.\nIn this article, we have considered some of such security threats and then focused on the routing attacks against cryptocurrencies, including BGP Hijack and Traffic Interception . While these attacks are not specific to cryptocurrencies alone, they can have potentially damaging effects on cryptocurrency operations like wastage of resources and loss of revenue.

The value of the cryptocurrency was fluctuating around $8700 (£6445.83) until 3pm yesterday, before going into free fall. Wednesday’s opening value was $8474.24 (£6278.56), before reaching a high of $8492.31 (£6291.95), and a falling to a low of $8328.38 (£6170.50) before the drop continued into the early hours of Wednesday . Bitcoin hit its highest value before Christmas when the token reached the monumental price of just under $20,000. However the value of the cryptocurrency plummeted rapidly by more than $44bn (£30.9bn) in January, falling by more than 10 per cent to below $9000. Economists warned of a bitcoin bubble after the value of the cryptocurrency soared by over 900 per cent last year. The digital currency has faced criticism by banks and finance experts, with billionaire Bill Gates telling CNBC he would bet against the cryptocurrency if he could. Mr. Gates said: “As an asset class, you’re not producing anything and so you shouldn’t expect it to go up. “It’s kind of a pure ‘greater fool theory’ type of investment.

Major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, and Cardano dropped in the 5 to 13 percent region, with Bitcoin Cash and EOS dropping 11 percent and 13.5 percent respectively. Bitcoin Cash and EOS Traders have often described Bitcoin Cash investment as leveraged bitcoin trading because on both the upside and downside, Bitcoin Cash moves by larger margins. Throughout April, as the market continued to recover and bitcoin started to gain momentum in the $9,500 region, Bitcoin Cash experienced a 10 to 20 percent increase in value quite regularly. However, as the cryptocurrency market started to fall, Bitcoin Cash began to record losses with significantly larger margins in comparison to bitcoin and Ethereum. Today, on May 16, Bitcoin Cash fell by more than 6 percent against both bitcoin and Ethereum, which also fell by 5 percent. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of Bitcoin Cash is at 50, signifying a neutral zone for BCH. If the RSI of BCH signifies an oversold condition, the price of BCH could bounce relatively quickly in the short-term but given that the RSI of BCH is neutral and both exponential and simple moving averages are demonstrating a negative short-term trend for BCH, it is likely that the price of BCH will continue to fall over the next 24 hours. Other cryptocurrencies and tokens that have performed strongly against the US dollar over the past month such as EOS and 0x (ZRX) have also slumped over the past week. EOS has dropped by more than 38 percent from its monthly peak in April against bitcoin. Within a period of two weeks, the price of EOS declined from 0.0024 to 0.00149 BTC, by 38.17 percent. Considering that the price of EOS increased from 0.0009 to 0.0024 BTC from early April to April 29, the sudden drop in the price of EOS was unexpected. But, the struggle of EOS, which has been able to secure strong momentum throughout April, demonstrates the current state of the market. Despite the initiation of the Blockchain Week in New York and the Consensus 2018 event, the cryptocurrency market is failing to rebound from its short-term losses. Bitcoin to $50,000 On CNBC, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes stated that he sees the price of bitcoin reaching $50,000 by the end of 2018 , despite the correction the market has seen from February to May. BitMEX, which supports margin trading, profits from both the downside and upside of bitcoin because traders can register short and long contracts. “If it goes up, if it goes down, if you have Bill Gates calling it a fraud … Short it, I don’t care. If you think it’s going to be $1 million in a few months, great, buy it. I still don’t care. We just match trades,” Hayes said, emphasizing that his prediction of bitcoin reaching $50,000 is objective as increase in the price of bitcoin does not impact the profitability of the exchange.

And that came out clearly when two Chinese bitcoin mining equipment makers announced their plan to raise about $1 billion each-in what is deemed to be the largest bitcoin-focused floats ever witnessed around the globe.\nThe filing of the application\nIt was a short while back that the Canaan Creative filed an application with the Hong Kong stock exchange in an effort to obtain an IPO. On the other hand, Zhejiang Ebang Communication is co-operating with several advisers on a Hong Kong float and whatever they achieve is something that we will just have to wait and see.\nA person well conversant with the matter, but who also wanted his identity kept anonymous has disclosed that the price of bitcoin BTC=BTSP has slipped by almost 35 percent. He has also revealed that Beijing is with the passage of time tightening its grip on trade in the virtual currency.\nMost of the equipment makers are currently doing all within their means to ensure that they obtain enough capital to finance growth and still be in a position to meet up to the demand for their top line machines. The two are hopeful that they will be able to raise $1 billion each.\nEfforts by journalists to get Canaan Creative to make comments in relation to the matter turned out to be an exercise of futility after it declined to speak up on the matter.\nLatest developments\nFrom the most recent estimates, it was projected that Canaan is currently able to supply almost 25% of the world’s bitcoin blockchain computing power. The co-chairman Jianping Kong in a recent interview expressed great optimism that the move by China to promote its domestic chip industry would eventually end up giving a major lift to the company’s growth.\nIt was in the course of this year that Ebang got delisted from China’s National Equities Exchange and Quotations. It is worth noting that quite a significant number of companies have lately been promoting links to bitcoin.\nThe good thing about the Bitcoin mining equipment makers lies in the fact that they rely on computers fitted with top line chips which mine coins quite efficiently than is usually the case with the other companies.

Follow him on Twitter @bitentrepreneur. It’s another hard fork day! Today, Bitcoin Cash is creating a new blockchain with 32 MB block size limits and added smart-contract functionality. This is the third hard fork that the Bitcoin Cash community has undergone in under a year, and declares their undeterred commitment to change whatever necessary to grow their blockchain’s transaction abilities. Bitcoin Cash strives to provide an inexpensive and fast medium of exchange for everyday payments. A ‘hard’ fork refers to software changes that require the creation of a new blockchain from a previous one, whereas ‘soft’ forks can impute software updates without the creation of a new blockchain. A hard fork therefore is only implemented when there needs to be changes made at the most fundamental level of the blockchain architecture: the consensus protocol layer. Bitcoin Cash was born out of a hard fork with Bitcoin’s blockchain last summer. After much debate amongst various parties of the Bitcoin ecosystem over how to scale the Bitcoin network, a group of developers organized under the name ABC Bitcoin, wrote the code for a hard fork to create a new blockchain with 8MB block limits. On August 1st, this new code was implemented to copy the entire Bitcoin block history onto a new network to begin mining its own transactions separately, as a distinct currency and under different mining parameters. Bitcoin Cash promises to be a peer to peer cash system. This system should be popular in areas where the traditional financial system has been unable to reach the unbanked. In the case of last summer’s hard fork, not only was a new blockchain created, but also a new coin was introduced to the market to represent value exchanged on this new transaction ledger. However, not all hard forks create new coins. For example, Bitcoin Cash hard forked again last November to fix their algorithm adjusting mining difficulty because the network was producing wildly fluctuating hash rates. To patch the system, various developer teams running different clients on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain agreed to implement a hard fork where they all copied the old ledger onto a new chain, with the software updated, and abandoned the old chain. Although technically November was also a ‘hard’ fork, it was obviously very different than the previous split in community generating not only a new blockchain, but also a new network, and a new coin. Another Bitcoin Cash hard fork took place on May 15 in an effort to quadruple the BCH block size and lay the groundwork for adding smart contracts. However, it shouldn’t be understated that blockchain developers, including Bitcoin Cash, treat hard forking with caution, it’s a delicate process with potentially serious financial consequences. Though while many in the community treat hard forking with outright fear, this is a key part of how Bitcoin Cash operates, so the Bitcoin Cash community is not afraid of hard forks. This time around is more similar to the November hard fork, but slightly different. Today’s fork neither creates a new coin, nor does it correct an existing problem, but rather strictly innovates in two ways. The first major change is the tripling of the block size limit from 8 to 32 MB that is a forward-looking adjustment to accommodate greater transaction throughput per block. I feel better that this block size growth is occurring now, while the usage of Bitcoin Cash still has a ways to grow, rather than later when the network is at full throttle. This the larger block size gives Bitcoin Cash some room to scale, something that other blockchains have been looking to tackle in other ways, e.g. Lightning Network and Proof of Stake. This makes Bitcoin Cash somewhat unique because it attempts to solve the scaling problem at the consensus protocol layer while maintaining the Proof of Work model. However, larger blocks won’t in effect grow the network in terms of usage. It does however provide the ability for unprecedented growth. Growth in usage depends not on the block size but more on the community and businesses supporting Bitcoin Cash. Products, services and merchant adoption are key. After the block-size increase, the next advancement that Bitcoin Cash is putting forward is to add new and re-enable old, previously inactivated, machine-scripting operation codes, or more simply ‘op-codes’, that give developers tools to create smart contracts. These machine codes, called “Satoshi Op-codes” by the Bitcoin Cash community, allow developers to create different types of metadata implementations. By having the ability to call these functions, developers can create “colored coins” or representative tokens. These are tokens that can be tagged in a specific way to correspond to bonds, stocks, precious metals, commodities, and any physical or virtual object. It is hard to say what might come out from this new functionality, but if we base our assumptions on what Ethereum has been able to accomplish from its second layer implementations, then I believe it will give Bitcoin Cash a lot of space for creative and productive ideas to blossom. To that end, we will shall have to see what the developers of the Bitcoin Cash community do with these new functionalities, and if the market decides to settle in this newfound block size that has yet be driven to scale.

I think they are smart enough to be awared that the chance of earning huge profit is high due to the continuous increase on the market value of it. Despite of the risk due to the market volatility, choosing to invest in Bitcoin is a great idea given that market dumps are just temporary and recovery is always expected to happen.\nOf course, they are not foolish. Investment in bitcoin never been a foolish thing. In fact, it is one of the smartest way to earn high profit that could give them financial stability that everyone is wishing for.\nI agree with you. maybe in the first time they don't think that bitcoin will become popular like today and they only used small money to buy bitcoin and as we know, in the beginning, bitcoin created, the price is so cheap so people don't think that they only invest let say $10 but they can have much bitcoin. they think that I am fine to spend $10 and maybe this will not work for a long time. but fortunately, from year by year, bitcoin price is increased and even in December, the price increase so high and they are a lucky person which could buy bitcoin at the cheap price. I think this is a big reward for them and they don't expect to get a big money from bitcoin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities":

prices is: Downwards.\nThe projected upper bound is: 9,551.21.\nThe projected lower bound is: 7,393.19.\nThe projected closing price is: 8,472.20.\nCandlesticks\nWARNING: These prices only contain closing prices. Thus, the candlestick analysis in this expert will be invalid (including the alerts, symbols, and this commentary). To detach this expert, right-click on the NYSE BitcoinIndx chart , choose Expert Advisor, and then choose Detach.\nDuring the past 10 bars, there have been 0 white candles and 0 black candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 0 white candles and 0 black candles.\nA falling window occurred (where the bottom of the previous shadow is above the top of the current shadow). This usually implies a continuation of a bearish trend. There have been 25 falling windows in the last 50 candles–this makes the current falling window even more bearish.\nA gravestone doji occurred. This often signifies a top (the longer the upper shadow, the more bearish the signal).\nMomentum Indicators\nMomentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators.\nStochastic Oscillator\nOne method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 8.9418. This is an oversold reading. However, a signal is not generated until the Oscillator crosses above 20 The last signal was a sell 5 period(s) ago.\nRelative Strength Index (RSI)\nThe RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 46.65. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 31 period(s) ago.\nCommodity Channel Index (CCI)\nThe CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -143.This is an oversold reading. However, a signal isn’t generated until the indicator crosses above -100.

Today I am going to tell you about the bitcoin experience meaning what is bitcoin and how to get bitcoin without spending a dime! First of all you should all know what cryptocurrency is...\nThe textbook definition says it is a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.\nWhat is bitcoin? Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and a system of international payment, it is the first decentralized digital currency.The network is P2P (peer-to-peer) and transactions take place between users directly, without an intermediary. The transactions are verified by network nodes through the use of cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.\nThe experience\nSo far, the bitcoin experience has been a big fart of time! I mean yeah they are pretty cool and too tempting to resist but getting them is really a mess unless you buy them from somewhere which would indicate that either you have money or you are a gambling idiot! If someone has a bitcoin yay for them!\nGetting some\nGetting some millibitcoin or satoshi is easy but do you know how satoshi equals 1 bitcoin? It’s this much 100 000 000 satoshi. How to get satoshi you ask. Rules of earning 1. Never spend money you don’t have! 2. Never Trust stupid ads. 3. Never jump from one faucet to another! 4. Stick to routine. So what the rules basically means is that pick a lane! Ways to get 1.Mining Bitcoin mining is the process by which transactions are verified and added to the public ledger, known as the block chain, and also the means through which new bitcoin are released. Anyone with access to the internet and suitable hardware can participate in mining. The mining process involves compiling recent transactions into blocks and trying to solve a computationally difficult puzzle. The participant who first solves the puzzle gets to place the next block on the block chain and claim the rewards. The rewards, which incentivize mining, are both the transaction fees associated with the transactions compiled in the block as well as newly released bitcoin . Note: If you have the equipment then by all means go ahead but be sure to watch your electricity bill!\n1.Faucets Bitcoin faucets are a reward system, in the form of a website or app, that dispenses rewards in the form of a satoshi, which is a hundredth of a millionth BTC , for visitors to claim in exchange for completing a captcha or task as described by the website.\nHere is a list of verified faucet websites by me and I use. freeBitco.in the earn rate is small you and earn free satoshi every hour and participate in lottery and also mine in your browser. Moonbit.co.in the earn rate is small you and earn free satoshi every 5 mins and participate in lottery and also mine in your browser.\nbitfun.co the earn rate is small you and earn free satoshi every 3 mins and play games do offers and roll dice.\nNote: Try these and let me know how you liked them and if i missed a good one. Also don't spend all day on those just few mins a day. to get a free blockchain wallet click here\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T14:59:11.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eb203b6dc02fc1ebba4ed963ddd9ab675bfa7e29", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThmz3Hpw.26Umoul6Vue07YkbLhATkYFKMtBp9F0sfByc_6PPbTCmVZmO4AtUhJsAdm32SfyS9og5ae2ARVxUgvV2lL00QkTN3Do0eHCZI6Q--", "site_full": "www.binaryscamalerts.com", "site": "binaryscamalerts.com", "site_section": "https://www.binaryscamalerts.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Binary Scam Alerts", "title": "Lord Alan Sugar Warns About Bitcoin Trader SCAM", "title_full": "Lord Alan Sugar Warns About Bitcoin Trader SCAM", "published": "2018-05-16T14:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.binaryscamalerts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bitcointraderscamlordsugar.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb203b6dc02fc1ebba4ed963ddd9ab675bfa7e29", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZThmz3Hpw.26Umoul6Vue07YkbLhATkYFKMtBp9F0sfByc_6PPbTCmVZmO4AtUhJsAdm32SfyS9og5ae2ARVxUgvV2lL00QkTN3Do0eHCZI6Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Patrick Jones", "published": "2018-05-16T14:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Lord Alan Sugar Warns About Bitcoin Trader SCAM", "text": " Bitcoin Scam Reviews » Lord Alan Sugar Warns About Bitcoin Trader SCAM Lord Alan Sugar Warns About Bitcoin Trader SCAM Posted on May 16,\nBitcoin Trader SCAM Update: To anyone who was either scammed by “Bitcoin Trader” or received a personal invitation to join a “unique and profitable” new Bitcoin Trading system, please be advised that the scammers behind the Bitcoin Trader fake app are now using the name of LORD Alan Sugar to entice would-be traders and opportunity seekers. Sugar is a British business mogul whose net worth is estimated at around 1.5 Billion Pounds. Needless to say, he is extremely angry and gunning for the crooks behind this latest sham (for the lack or a better word).\nPlease be advised . The purpose of this scam is to get you signed up and depositing with an unregulated offshore broker. Once that is done the process is complete and you can kiss your money goodbye.\nIn our previous Bitcoin Trader reviews we have explained how fake news is used to promote this fraudulent trading software, and why we believe it to be extremely dangerous and misleading.\nDetailed Bitcoin Trader Review\nA Quick Recap Bitcoin Trader is a classic get-rich-quick type of scam designed to attract and bait you using out-of-context remarks and half-truths. There is no logical narrative and one never knows who is behind the scam. If you have received any form of email communication advising you to signup for this software, you should know you are being deceived by cunning scam artists.\nBinary Options, Forex, and Bitcoin Scams There is a close relation to all three as the affiliate networks promoting the scams are basically the same people. If you feel you have been tricked and your money has been stolen, please reach out and we shall do our utmost to assist you in retrieving stolen funds.\nTo reiterate . This software is dirty and has nothing to do with legitimate Bitcoin trading . That is the truth and we have been repeating it for a while now.\nReplica Scams These crypto scams are being duplicated and copied. The ones which seem to be the most viral are Bitcoin Code and Ethereum Code which is now using actress Gal Gadot to promote fake software.\nAs always, our staff can be reached via our Facebook Group and YouTube Channel , so make sure to subscribe.\nYour browser does not support the audio element.

In fact, earlier this year, Merrill Lynch banned bitcoin buying across the firm.

To that point, Amazon just announced that its cloud computing arm is partnering with a start-up called Kaleido to make it easier for customers to put their services on blockchain.\n\"It's volatile right now, so you should not just go and fill your entire portfolio with cryptocurrencies,\" he said. \"But it is a good way to add alternatives to your general allocation, something like 3 [percent] to 5 percent of your portfolio.\"\nSokolin warned financial advisors that their clients are going to buy bitcoin whether they like it or not.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Your Wealth Weekly advice on managing your money SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and services.\nBy signing up for newsletters, you are agreeing to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy . \"So [advisors] can choose to say that this whole thing will fall apart and not get educated about it and not help [investors], but that's really irresponsible,\" he said.\nAdvisors need to take the time and brush up on the subjects of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology so they can properly address questions from their clients, Sokolin explained.\n\"Advisors really need to start to understand the basics of how blockchain works,\" he said. \"Start to understand why there are different cryptocurrencies.\n\"What's the difference between a payments coin, like bitcoin or ethereum?\" Sokolin added. \"All of these things are different, so advisors have to spend the time so they can actually help their clients make sense of this.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lex sokolin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sokolin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "autonomous r", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kaleido", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T15:28:58.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2b07d7e891552878df3cf958288bca4bf6e78622", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTCIkVbQ6SjMlV.91XFaaTbuNbtTC2ZqH3agxhbnW4k623ys21H54uG", "site_full": "www.forumophilia.com", "site": "forumophilia.com", "site_section": "https://www.forumophilia.com/forum58.html", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Forumophilia -

As of the current scenario, the price is still being held by the Kumo Cloud quite well above the $8,000 area which is expected to push higher once it clears above $9,000 with a daily close. As the price remains above the $8,000 area, further bullish pressure is expected in Bitcoin in future.\n*The market analysis posted here is meant to increase your awareness, but not to give instructions to make a trade.

Police have started probe on the basis of transaction history. According to investigators, Mukund Patel, a resident of Shahibaug, owns Eminent Colours at Samrat Complex on CG Road. Three years ago, he had come in contact with Mehul Puraniya , a resident of Naranpura, through an acquaintance. In 2017, he had to sell 10 bitcoins. However, for the transaction, he needed another digital wallet. It would have taken some time before his account’s KYC process gets over and thus Patel got in touch with Puraniya, who had three wallets, for transfer of cryptocurrency. “According to the complaint, Puraniya provided keys of his three wallets after which Patel transferred 10 Bitcoins to different accounts. At that time, the value of one Bitcoin was Rs 2.92 lakh. After some time, Puraniya informed Patel that 2.56 Bitcoins were sold for Rs 7.49 lakh and he also sent a screenshot of the transaction. Soon after, Puraniya severed all contact,” said an investigator. On the basis of probe, Patel got to know that the wallets used by Puraniya were in the name of Bhavik and Mehul Puraniya and Viral Bhanushali. Officials said that they have sought details of the transactions in the said accounts and the statements of the accused will be recorded soon.

Chinese Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer Canaan Creative plans to start trading of its IPO as soon as July, Bloomberg reports May 16.\nCanaan, which confirmed rumors it was planning an IPO with a filing this week, will likely create the largest Bitcoin-focused offering yet seen when it debuts on the Hong Kong stock exchange.\nCiting anonymous sources, Bloomberg added that while the filing did not mention a specific fundraising target, the figure “could” circle $1bln - a figure which had previously appeared earlier this month.\nThe move would create further competition for mining stalwart Bitmain , with Canaan currently already controlling around 15% of the Bitcoin chips and hardware equipment market.\nIn an interview with Reuters last month, meanwhile, co-chairman Jianping Kong said the numbers were equal to “a quarter of the world’s bitcoin blockchain computing power.”\nMajor IPO backers appearing on the filing are Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse Group AG and CMB International Capital Ltd.\nCanaan has yet to issue a public statement about the move, declining comment after a request from Reuters Tuesday. ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : cointelegraph.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinas-2nd-largest-bitcoin-mining-hardware-producer-plans-to-launch-1-bln-ipo-in-hong-kong", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/china", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitmain", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-15/bitcoin-mining-rig-maker-canaan-said-to-file-for-1-billion-ipo", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/hong-kong", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-16/bitcoin-mining-equipment-maker-canaan-files-for-1-billion-ipo", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/mining", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-canaancreative-ipo/cryptocurrency-miner-canaan-eyes-ipo-bets-on-chinas-push-for-chip-industry-idUSKCN1HD0I3"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "major banks home", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canaan creative", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "major banks bitcoin mining manufacturer canaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ipo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T15:22:46.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d8cbf041b4c2abea7214e34800a763a13e5cff10", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWQdiF5KB.AtkvoimPVb5NI-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=212.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Micro Earnings", "title": "[ANN] Clickfight - The Arena Bitcoin Game - Faucet Game", "title_full": "[ANN] Clickfight - The Arena Bitcoin Game - Faucet Game", "published": "2018-05-16T14:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.019, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d8cbf041b4c2abea7214e34800a763a13e5cff10", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWQdiF5KB.AtkvoimPVb5NI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tob96", "published": "2018-05-16T14:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "[ANN] Clickfight - The Arena Bitcoin Game - Faucet Game", "text": "Any new Players will now start with a tutorial.\nDuring the tutorial, you'll learn the important parts of the arena.\nAfter completing the tutorial, you'll then jump into the \"real\" arena and can fight either our NPCs or other players!\nFurthermore, you can now complete a task from a shortlink service and earn a free darknet energy!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T13:11:57.042+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b7aa07dd8fb8bc1315945e433e4c576c953f36b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTfBnuc3YDV7s6onxFjX3qARZ35sW6M9kt8IpMKTwvahMUKCSAhg2LsdcWKsgYQmfcfPTrH49UP8uidMF9CdCkrn5uVBKB8GiA-", "site_full": "euroxa.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://euroxa.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Euroxa", "title": "More cash for Bitcoin;

Corgan: Blockchain ‘Bashing’ Bitcoin\nIn a long series of tweets summarizing the event, which ends May 16, Corgan highlighted what he described as “cargo-cult engineering” taking preference among speakers.\n“It’s like all the popular kids (Blockchain) are publicly bashing the geeks and nerds (Bitcoin) while privately trying to copy their homework,” he wrote Tuesday.\nEducator Jimmy Song had been first to publicly pan some aspects of Consensus, saying during a panel with a JPMorgan executive that Bitcoin was “the real innovation here.”\n“I don’t see anything other than buzzwords,” he said, adding on Twitter afterwards that his words “verbalized what probably a large amount of the people in the audience were thinking.” 1/ My take on #Consensus2018 so far: It’s like all the popular kids (Blockchain) are publicly bashing the geeks and nerds (Bitcoin) while privately trying to copy their homework.\n— Johnathan Corgan (@jmcorgan) May 15, 2018 ‘Expensive And Slow Database’\nContinuing the theme, Corgan produced a lengthy explanation of why Bitcoin was the only “successful use” of Blockchain technology.\n“A blockchain is nothing more than an expensive and slow database,” he concluded.\nIt is a necessary but *insufficient* ingredient, and not even the most important one, of a system (Bitcoin) designed to provide monetary sovereignty to its voluntary participants.\nQuoting Song’s words about “sprinkling Blockchain dust all over a problem and it will be OK,” the core developer likened Consensus atmosphere to “cargo-cult engineering”– the practice of building infrastructure in the hope that material wealth would generate itself by definition.\nMeanwhile, markets have yet to witness some of the more buoyant predictions from Bitcoin bulls this week come true.\nPrior to the event, Fundstrat analyst Tom Lee announced he expected it to trigger upward price movements which could top 70% compared to levels at the time around $9000.\nSo far, Bitcoin has underperformed, losing almost $1000 as a fresh Mt. Gox sell-off weighs on sentiment as Bitcoin price is currently holding at the $8200 support level.\nWhat do you think about Johnathan Corgan’s perspective on Consensus?

Evrofinance Mosnarbank is the first international backer after the U.S. warned investors about the risks associated with the digital currency. After registering with the Venezeulan government and downloading the software for the cryptocurrency, investors can buy the digital currency by wiring at least €1,000 to an account at Evrofinance.\nIn other news, Coinbase is at work on tools to attract institutional investors, Bloomberg reported. The company is looking to have custodial services and margin trading, for example. Through a service called Coinbase Prime, institutional clients will reportedly have access to margin financing and lending along with over-the-counter trading.\nAnd the Feds are mulling regulations that could take away the unregulated status and anonymity of cryptocurrencies, the New York Post reported. Concerns that cryptocurrencies could be funding activities such as money laundering are behind the Justice Department’s push to have trading platforms find out who is exchanging crypto.\n“One of our major concerns is that we don’t know who has access to these virtual currencies, and who is using them,” Sujit Raman, an assistant deputy attorney general at the Justice Department, said at an event on Tuesday (May 15).\nIn other news, Amazon ’s cloud computing division is making big moves in the blockchain space, CNBC reported: It is partnering with Kaleido to give AWS customers access to the blockchain.\n“They can focus on their scenario and they don’t have to become PhDs in cryptography, we give them a simple platform to build their company on blockchain,” Steve Cerveny, a Kaleido founder, told CNBC.\nAnd HTC has unveiled a new smartphone that is designed for crypto, TheNextWeb reported: The company’s Exodus phone will come with a universal wallet – along with features such as a hardware enclave.\n“Through Exodus, we are excited to be supporting underlying protocols such as Bitcoin, Lightning Networks, Ethereum, Dfinity, and more,” HTC’s Phil Chen told TNW. “We would like to support the entire blockchain ecosystem, and in the next few months we’ll be announcing many more exciting partnerships together.”\n.

The idea behind it was to eliminate the need for intermediaries (banks or government institutions) in transactions and, with them, the possibility of fraud (such as double-spending) and other misuse.\nHow does the bitcoin network function? Based on a peer-to-peer technology known as blockchain . So, if you want to buy something using your digital cash, everyone else in the network needs to verify your transaction before it goes through. The verification process can sometimes take up to one hour (six validations), but that right there is what makes the whole process secure and safe from e.g. double-spending.\nInterested in buying or selling bitcoin? If this is the case, then what you want to do is explore the available digital currency exchange platforms and choose the one that works for you the best. Once you pick yours, you’ll be able to trade in your regular cash for digital one, and vice versa.\nWhile browsing exchange platforms, you might want to take a look at digital wallets , too—MyEtherWallet, Trezor, and Ledger are some of the names from the world of bitcoin. A wallet is necessary if you want to keep your bitcoin secure when you’re not using it; it achieves this with the help of a private key which makes your digital money accessible only to you.\nSo, there you have it: a basic introduction to bitcoin. If you’re willing to find out more about its advantages, the transaction process, and types of crypto wallets, then the infographic we’ve prepared is just for you. By the time you’re done reading it, you should have the basics down and be ready to delve deeper into the world of bitcoin, blockchain, and cryptocurrencies.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.addthis.com/help/api-spec", "https://kriptomat.io/", "https://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T00:35:53.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f75a8f11d579eca24e424f9ea35b22af60983e92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiQ2F6hWlN6TFACAugWF1hWd9TccFJ.Azl1Xt8MLQ.wv1Ne7pNpkTZaUuR6jQ013q5_AdyK7iin7CN_rX.Bqd3ddSjB8K4y0wiVW8CJql1Dv5TL0DIQJyiiXrkZ_gndFJ5.ZL3.EnxBRpEQmvVCsECmsKCXRsmzD0-", "site_full": "www.bullup.nl", "site": "bullup.nl", "site_section": "http://www.bullup.nl/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Bull Up Beleggerclub", "title": "JP Morgan’s Wall Street chief talks China and bitcoin and is preparing for a big downturn in stocks", "title_full": "JP Morgan’s Wall Street chief talks China and bitcoin and is preparing for a big downturn in stocks", "published": "2018-05-16T14:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.bullup.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bullup.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f75a8f11d579eca24e424f9ea35b22af60983e92", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiQ2F6hWlN6TFACAugWF1hWd9TccFJ.Azl1Xt8MLQ.wv1Ne7pNpkTZaUuR6jQ013q5_AdyK7iin7CN_rX.Bqd3ddSjB8K4y0wiVW8CJql1Dv5TL0DIQJyiiXrkZ_gndFJ5.ZL3.EnxBRpEQmvVCsECmsKCXRsmzD0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CNBC", "published": "2018-05-16T14:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "JP Morgan’s Wall Street chief talks China and bitcoin and is preparing for a big downturn in stocks", "text": "JP Morgan’s Wall Street chief talks China and bitcoin and is preparing for a big downturn in stocks A Q&A with JP Morgan Chase’s co-president Daniel Pinto.

But one more session of Nurburgring testing can't hurt, right? 15 photos It corners pretty flat for an electric crossover, so we wouldn't be surprised if it's been fitted with adaptive anti-roll bars, at least as an option. Audi's idea of camouflage consists of random white lines that look like circuit boards or made-up currency symbols like you see on Bitcoin and the other cryptos. Right now, Bitcoin is trading at just under $9,000, so you wouldn't need a lot of them to buy the e-tron. And while Audi won't accept digital currencies, it has begun taking orders for its first fully electric crossover, a bit like Jaguar did with the I-Pace. The official debut is scheduled for August 30 in Brussels, the capital of the country that will be responsible for e-tron production, Belgium. No official specifications are available at the moment, but it's believed at least two power ratings will be offered with the most expensive bringing 500 HP . It should be noted that the 2015 concept had around 430 HP and 800 Nm of torque. This gave it a 0 to 100 kph sprint time of 4.6 seconds and a top speed of 210 kph (130 mph). Unless we're mistaken, that's faster than the R8 e-tron. The 95 kWh battery pack is believed to have enough juice for 400 km (248 miles) of driving on the new WLTP cycle.“ Thanks to the electrical quattro, its long-distance range and comprehensive charging options, customers can drive purely electrically without compromises ”, Audi said in its press release. As far as the styling is concerned, the e-tron quattro has a large taillight element that cuts across the car, just like the A6, A7, and A8. The rest of the bodywork is reminiscent of the Q5, but with a Sportback twist at the back. For a car that doesn't do combustion, its grille is pretty large. audi e-tron quattro Audi spyshots green EV click to load comments for this story", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "audi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaguar", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nurburgring", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T08:15:11.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "10b7eb2f1c8e58591826b8761b647b888e8a172f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8MhJEbIk6Hp4_GAaXVPzclJpH9XhzO13h_bNByQF1qUqLBJSpgY0daynMwfshGS2YxxaoeN55zA1Gih7A0O6ldyckCIu0Y0VReaGehVN2XmSOhMhFzk8mGYCVQ5dOHBt0-", "site_full": "www.dnaindia.com", "site": "dnaindia.com", "site_section": "http://www.dnaindia.com/syndication/rss_column.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Daily News & Analysis", "title": "Gujarat: Most bitcoin tradings illegal, says expert", "title_full": "Gujarat: Most bitcoin tradings illegal, says expert", "published": "2018-05-16T14:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/half/public/2018/05/16/682872-bitcoins-110917.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1715, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "10b7eb2f1c8e58591826b8761b647b888e8a172f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8MhJEbIk6Hp4_GAaXVPzclJpH9XhzO13h_bNByQF1qUqLBJSpgY0daynMwfshGS2YxxaoeN55zA1Gih7A0O6ldyckCIu0Y0VReaGehVN2XmSOhMhFzk8mGYCVQ5dOHBt0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "dnaindia.com", "published": "2018-05-16T14:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Gujarat: Most bitcoin tradings illegal, says expert", "text": "Gujarat: Most bitcoin tradings illegal, says expert Bitcoins dna Correspondent Updated: May 16, 2018, 06:05 AM IST\nSharing his insight into the trade, local cyber expert Viral Parmar revealed that there is no concept of legal or illegal trading but it is the process followed while trading that makes it so. With regards to virtual trading, trading in bitcoin is considered illegal, says Parmar.\nGujarat, he says, has over 50 new cryptocurrencies, owners of most of which have no expertise in the area. \"These currencies are used in the Initial Coin Offering and funds are raised for a new cryptocurrency venture, similar to IPO, but only on the basis of new cryptos and most of such ventures of fraud,\" said Parmar. These factors contribute in making bitcoin trading an illegal trade. As per Parmar, there are two types of trading and the legitimacy of the same depends upon the wallet used by the investor or trader.\nThere are several wallets that for user's KYC and other details before allowing the user to trade, buy or invest in cryptocurrencies. Usually, in such wallets, the entire transaction details of the user can be seen and the person to whom the payment is being made, can be seen.\nBut on the other side, there even wallets that allow the user to trade, buy or invest on cryptocurrencies directly by adding the user id and password of the wallet. In such wallets, no records of the user are found nor of the person to whom the payment is being made. In Gujarat, most users use these wallets so as to avoid revealing their identity.

Top financial concern : “We definitely want to buy an income property by next year. I’d prefer to do Oshawa but we’re considering Hamilton.” Stephen Hajnal has been an electrician for 10 years. It’s a career that offers him both work-life balance and a good paycheque; he works four nine-hour days a week and earns $79,500. If in the future he needs to bump up his earnings, he can work overtime and bring in as much as $120,000 in a given year. Plus, there’s retirement security – he works for a unionized company with a defined contribution pension plan.\nChoosing to study a trade has paid off with plenty of opportunity. Mr. Hajnal works with large organizations such as universities that are upgrading their heating and cooling systems to reduce energy costs and become more efficient.\n“I do a lot of building automation – electrical controls for unit cooling systems and [installing] sensors for temperature and humidity,” he says. “I am happy where I am – not all companies do the four-day week.”\nIn 2014, Mr. Hajnal bought a townhome in Ajax with his wife. Since then, he’s done numerous renovations, averaging $3,000 a year. “We’re probably going to do a rental suite in the basement at some point,” he says.\nHe’s also dabbled in the stock market and invested $4,000 in cryptocurrencies. “I got into that about a year ago,” says Mr. Hajnal. “I’ll trade in between two or three currencies using QuadrigaCX, a bitcoin trading platform. So far, I’ve doubled my money,” he says.\nDespite his success with cryptocurrencies, Mr. Hajnal says he puts most of his money in more standard investment vehicles, such as the tax-free savings account, where he holds technology and real estate investment trust stocks.\nBut his real passion lies with real estate. “We definitely want to buy an income property and then rent out the other one,” he says. He hopes to get his current mortgage down to $100,000 by next year to refinance so he can buy another property.\nDown the road, he wants to purchase several larger buildings. “The ultimate goal is to have a few low-rise rental properties and live off the income from that,” he says.\nHis typical monthly expenses: $1,980 on mortgage.\n$55 on property insurance.\n$300 for property tax.\n$250 on renovations. “I’ve spent quite a bit. We did the furnace, the AC, we’re planning to do the driveway, we changed the windows and doors. Next we’re going to do the roof and then the powder room.”\n$206 for car payment. “I have a 2009 Sonata and my wife has a 2014 Mazda 6.”\n$160 on gas. “I travel quite a bit for work.”\n$350 for car insurance. “[We’re with] Allstate. It’s for my spouse and I.”\n$70 annually for car maintenance. “I can’t remember the last repair.”\n$480 on groceries. “We shop at No Frills, Food Basics or Fresco. We avoid the expensive ones. I normally do the cooking for the week on Saturday and Sunday. We eat a lot of Indian or Asian, lots of pastas. My wife just became vegetarian so we don’t eat a lot of meat.”\n$90 on eating out. We might go out once a month. We usually go out for a family member’s birthday.”\n$20 on coffee or tea. “We usually make it at home. I used to get a coffee at break. Now I make a bigger one and it lasts all day. It’s a good way to save money.”\n$90 on alcohol. “A nice bottle of whisky or cognac will last a few months. In the summer we might get a case of beer. We don’t drink very much.”\n$60 for cellphone. “We are with Koodo.”\n$14 for Netflix.\n$60 for Internet. “It’s Acanac. It’s good – 300 gigabytes a month.”\n$14 on Netflix.\n$50 on clothing. “I usually shop every six months. I go to Mark’s. I go to Winners or the Gap if I feel like spending a bit more for business-casual clothes. I typically spend $300 each time.”\n$15 on hair. “My wife usually cuts mine at home.”\n$170 on pets. “[We have] an older dog who requires a special diet and medications. A Bichon Frisé/Maltese. She’s 13 years old now and she has problems with her eyes – she needs creams and drops. And she has kidney stones. We also have budgies – they are two years old. The birdseed will last a couple of months. And we buy the odd toy – it’s $5 to $10 every couple of months.”\n$400 per year on camping and hiking. “We’re looking at Bon Echo or Algonquin Park this year. We might rent kayaks this year. We have most of the [gear] already. I would call it glamping.”\n$6,000 per year on holidays/trips. “We take two trips of one week each, and two smaller trips on long weekends. In the past year we went to the Mayan Rivera, Mexico and Cuba. We did Washington over the winter and we may do New York City over the summer.”\nAre you a millennial who would like to participate in a paycheque profile?

Corgan: Blockchain ‘Bashing’ Bitcoin\nIn a long series of tweets summarizing the event, which ends May 16, Corgan highlighted what he described as “cargo-cult engineering” taking preference among speakers.\n“It’s like all the popular kids (Blockchain) are publicly bashing the geeks and nerds (Bitcoin) while privately trying to copy their homework,” he wrote Tuesday.\nEducator Jimmy Song had been first to publicly pan some aspects of Consensus, saying during a panel with a JPMorgan executive that Bitcoin was “the real innovation here.”\n“I don’t see anything other than buzzwords,” he said, adding on Twitter afterwards that his words “verbalized what probably a large amount of the people in the audience were thinking.” 1/ My take on #Consensus2018 so far: It’s like all the popular kids (Blockchain) are publicly bashing the geeks and nerds (Bitcoin) while privately trying to copy their homework.\n— Johnathan Corgan (@jmcorgan) May 15, 2018 ‘Expensive And Slow Database’\nContinuing the theme, Corgan produced a lengthy explanation of why Bitcoin was the only “successful use” of Blockchain technology.\n“A blockchain is nothing more than an expensive and slow database,” he concluded.\nIt is a necessary but *insufficient* ingredient, and not even the most important one, of a system (Bitcoin) designed to provide monetary sovereignty to its voluntary participants.\nQuoting Song’s words about “sprinkling Blockchain dust all over a problem and it will be OK,” the core developer likened Consensus atmosphere to “cargo-cult engineering”– the practice of building infrastructure in the hope that material wealth would generate itself by definition.\nMeanwhile, markets have yet to witness some of the more buoyant predictions from Bitcoin bulls this week come true.\nPrior to the event, Fundstrat analyst Tom Lee announced he expected it to trigger upward price movements which could top 70% compared to levels at the time around $9000.\nSo far, Bitcoin has underperformed, losing almost $1000 as a fresh Mt.

The ex-legislator's name came to the fore during interrogation of the main accused, Kirit Paladiya, the mastermind behind the kidnapping of Shailesh Bhatt and extortion of 176 bitcoins case. He was issues the first summons on May 4.\nIt was revealed during investigation that Kotadiya was involved in the crime and he got Rs 70 lakh of the extortion money. Paladiya, who is also the nephew of Kotadiya told CID officials about the ex-MLA's involvement in the case. Police has recovered Rs 25 lakh of the money from Surat-based Nanku Lavaria, a friend of Kotadiya. They have yet to recover the rest of the money.\nAfter Kotadiya skipped the first summons, he was issued summons again on May 5. The accused released a press note on May 7 claiming that the allegations against him were false and he \"is innocent and is being framed by the conspirators\".\nOn May 9, Kotadiya faxed a letter to the CID (Crime), in which he requested the officials to not carry out the third summons since he was \"out of station\" and will only be able to return on May 11 or 12. He has yet to show up.\nMeanwhile, CID officials carried out a search operation at 25 location in Ahmedabad, Surat and Amreli, in search for Kotadiya. The CID had also sent a team to Chandigarh after they got a tip-off that the former legislator was there, but the information turned out to be false.\nOn Monday, the CID submitted a report on the arrest warrant of Kotadiya to the court. The petition was heard on Tuesday and the bench is likely to give its verdict on May 17. MAN DUPED OF 10 BITCOINS\nOn Monday, a complaint was lodged with the Cyber Cell of Crime Branch by a Mukund Patel, 24, resident of Shahibaug area. He stated that the three men, identified as Mehul Puraniya, Bhavik Puraniya and Viral Bhanushali had taken 10 bitcoins from him saying they will convert the same into INR. Patel transferred the bitcoins into the wallet of accused on 12 September, 2017 thinking that he will get the money, but he did not receive the money nor his bitcoins, worth Rs 29.20 lakh as per present market value. 119 BITCOINS SEIZED, TRANSFERRED TO SIT WALLET\nThe 119 bitcoins worth Rs 7.25 crore, which were recovered from Kirit Paladiya’s wallet, has been transferred to SIT by the CID. These will soon be converted into INR. As per officials, since the bitcoin rates change daily, is is not feasible to free them which is why the bitcoins have been transferred. THE WANTED AND THE ARRESTED\nThe CID has arrested six people in the case so far including Jagdish Patel (Amreli SP), Anant Patel (Inspector of LCB), Ketan Patel (Lawyer), Kirit Paladiya (Partner of Shailesh Bhatt) and two constables.

Two recent examples are Coinbase’s new institutional focus and Nomura’s new venture. These stories, and much more, are in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief.\nAlso Read: NY Regulator Approves Bitcoin Cash, Zcash and Litecoin Trading\nCoinbase Goes After Big Money Coinbase, the San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange recently valued at $8 billion , has announced a new suite of services meant to attract more big money players such as the many new crypto hedge funds that pop up all the time. It will launch a cryptocurrency custodian in partnership with an SEC-regulated broker-dealer to a group of initial clients that include 1confirmation, Autonomous Partners, Boost VC, Meta Stable, Multicoin Capital, Polychain Capital, Scalar Capital and Walden Bridge Capital.\nNew offerings also include Coinbase Prime, a suite of tools specifically designed for institutions, and an institutional coverage group headquartered in New York City to provide a higher level of service to these type of clients. “There is clear demand from institutional clients and financial services professionals for more specific solutions with regard to cryptocurrencies that address their sophisticated needs,” said Adam White, Vice President and General Manager of Coinbase Institutional.\nThe company will also be opening a new engineering office in Chicago to continue developing Coinbase Markets, which provides a centralized pool of liquidity for all its products. Over the course of the year it is promised to introduce new features like low latency performance, on-premise data-center co-location services, institutional connectivity and access, and settlement and clearing services. “As a global leader in financial technology, Chicago welcomes innovative companies investing in our city and creating jobs for Chicago residents,” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel. “There is no better city than Chicago for companies that want to put down roots and grow their businesses.”\nKomainu to Protect Mutual Funds Komainu is a new venture established to help overcome barriers for institutional investment in crypto-assets with a custody solution and offering new services, standards and best practices. Its founders include Tokyo-headquartered global investment bank Nomura (NYSE: NMR), hardware wallet developer Ledger , and Global Advisors, parent company of Coinshares .\nJez Mohideen, Global Chief Digital Officer at Nomura, said: “Global investment managers have long been held back from full participation in digital asset markets, limited by operational and regulatory risk. Our new partnership will set the required standards that will bring peace of mind to digital asset investors, and provide tools and products to enable better integration with more traditional investment vehicles such as mutual funds.” Jean-Marie Mognetti, Co-Principal of Global Advisors, added: “After 6 years of research, and collaboration with our administration partner and its regulator, we now have demonstrable progress. This partnership is a progressive stepping stone towards the creation of the necessary prerequisites for further growth within the digital asset ecosystem. This will open new and exciting opportunities to global participants and contribute to move digital asset closer to mainstream offerings.”\nLedgerx Savings Accounts Ledgerx, the CFTC-regulated cryptocurrency management platform, has launched a new savings account-like product. Ledger Savings uses an underlying call overwrite strategy but offers a simple interface so that users won’t need to know anything about investing in derivatives. It targets a 16% per annum yield with a potential 2x exit at maturity in the event BTC doubles from current spot prices. For launch, the savings product will be offered for 3 month, 6 month, and 12 month maturities, at varied rates. After selecting the product for the desired maturity, the USD amount is available immediately to withdraw but the associated BTC is locked for the duration of the savings product.\nRat Poison Squared Fashion If there is one thing that’s true for the cryptoverse, is that it is full of fast moving entrepreneurs. Warren Buffett only bashed bitcoin as “ rat poison squared ” less than two weeks ago, and someone has already found a way to make money from the now infamous glib. Ecoinmerce, a tokenized e-commerce marketplace, has announced the Rat Poison Squared clothing line, to include t-shirts, hats, coffee mugs, and keyrings.\n“We don’t know exactly what ‘rat poison squared’ is supposed to mean,” said Ecoinmerce COO Rex Chen. “What we do know is that Bitcoin created a very productive ecosystem and spawned the entire cryptocurrency revolution, which is driving innovation in nearly every industry. This clothing line is intended to give Bitcoin and cryptocurrency enthusiasts pride in their defiance of the status quo and their belief in a better future.”\nTelegram’s Gram Lawsuit With a seemingly endless torrent of new ICO tokens flooding the market, short and pithy names for these crypto-assets are running out fast. This can lead to people registering coin names just to try and flip them for profit later and to companies to wage battles over who gets to control a certain ticker, as happens with website domain names. The latest example for this is Telegram, which is now reportedly suing a Florida-based venture over the rights to ‘gram’.\nDid Jennifer Aniston Convinced You to Invest in Crypto? The Texas Securities Commissioner has issued an Emergency Cease and Desist Order on May 15 to stop Wind Wide Coin Inc., from fraudulently offering investments in a cryptocurrency trading program. The order alleges that Wind Wide Coin and three sales agents in Houston are offering for sale investments in a cryptocurrency trading program that uses an “automatic trading bot.” The company is promising investors the combination of “no risk” and extraordinarily high returns. The purchase of 0.1 of BTC, for example, will yield 1 BTC 24 hours later, a one-day return of 900%.\nFurther according to the order, Wind Wide Coin is also misleading potential investors by claiming it is a “licensed company” and “legally registered.” And to lure gullible suckers the company’s website has featured endorsements from supposed past investors. To weed out anyone with some common sense, the website used images of celebrities like Jennifer Anniston – which it mistakenly identified as “Kate Jennifer,” an investor. Similarly, a photo of Prince Charles was identified as “Mark Robert,” an investor who provided a testimonial. The same testimonial was then attributed verbatim to a “Johnson Smith,” supposedly another UK investor.\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates?

Over the course of the year it is promised to introduce new features like low latency performance, on-premise data-center co-location services, institutional connectivity and access, and settlement and clearing services. “As a global leader in financial technology, Chicago welcomes innovative companies investing in our city and creating jobs for Chicago residents,” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel. “There is no better city than Chicago for companies that want to put down roots and grow their businesses.” Komainu to Protect Mutual Funds\nKomainu is a new venture established to help overcome barriers for institutional investment in crypto-assets with a custody solution and offering new services, standards and best practices. Its founders include Tokyo-headquartered global investment bank Nomura (NYSE: NMR), hardware wallet developer Ledger , and Global Advisors, parent company of Coinshares .\nJez Mohideen, Global Chief Digital Officer at Nomura, said: “Global investment managers have long been held back from full participation in digital asset markets, limited by operational and regulatory risk. Our new partnership will set the required standards that will bring peace of mind to digital asset investors, and provide tools and products to enable better integration with more traditional investment vehicles such as mutual funds.” Jean-Marie Mognetti, Co-Principal of Global Advisors, added: “After 6 years of research, and collaboration with our administration partner and its regulator, we now have demonstrable progress. This partnership is a progressive stepping stone towards the creation of the necessary prerequisites for further growth within the digital asset ecosystem. This will open new and exciting opportunities to global participants and contribute to move digital asset closer to mainstream offerings.” Ledgerx Savings Accounts\nLedgerx, the CFTC-regulated cryptocurrency management platform, has launched a new savings account-like product. Ledger Savings uses an underlying call overwrite strategy but offers a simple interface so that users won’t need to know anything about investing in derivatives. It targets a 16% per annum yield with a potential 2x exit at maturity in the event BTC doubles from current spot prices. For launch, the savings product will be offered for 3 month, 6 month, and 12 month maturities, at varied rates. After selecting the product for the desired maturity, the USD amount is available immediately to withdraw but the associated BTC is locked for the duration of the savings product. Rat Poison Squared Fashion\nIf there is one thing that’s true for the cryptoverse, is that it is full of fast moving entrepreneurs. Warren Buffett only bashed bitcoin as “ rat poison squared ” less than two weeks ago, and someone has already found a way to make money from the now infamous glib. Ecoinmerce, a tokenized e-commerce marketplace, has announced the Rat Poison Squared clothing line, to include t-shirts, hats, coffee mugs, and keyrings.\n“We don’t know exactly what ‘rat poison squared’ is supposed to mean,” said Ecoinmerce COO Rex Chen. “What we do know is that Bitcoin created a very productive ecosystem and spawned the entire cryptocurrency revolution, which is driving innovation in nearly every industry. This clothing line is intended to give Bitcoin and cryptocurrency enthusiasts pride in their defiance of the status quo and their belief in a better future.” Telegram’s Gram Lawsuit\nWith a seemingly endless torrent of new ICO tokens flooding the market, short and pithy names for these crypto-assets are running out fast. This can lead to people registering coin names just to try and flip them for profit later and to companies to wage battles over who gets to control a certain ticker, as happens with website domain names. The latest example for this is Telegram, which is now reportedly suing a Florida-based venture over the rights to ‘gram’. Did Jennifer Aniston Convinced You to Invest in Crypto?\nThe Texas Securities Commissioner has issued an Emergency Cease and Desist Order on May 15 to stop Wind Wide Coin Inc., from fraudulently offering investments in a cryptocurrency trading program. The order alleges that Wind Wide Coin and three sales agents in Houston are offering for sale investments in a cryptocurrency trading program that uses an “automatic trading bot.” The company is promising investors the combination of “no risk” and extraordinarily high returns. The purchase of 0.1 of BTC, for example, will yield 1 BTC 24 hours later, a one-day return of 900%.\nFurther according to the order, Wind Wide Coin is also misleading potential investors by claiming it is a “licensed company” and “legally registered.” And to lure gullible suckers the company’s website has featured endorsements from supposed past investors. To weed out anyone with some common sense, the website used images of celebrities like Jennifer Anniston – which it mistakenly identified as “Kate Jennifer,” an investor. Similarly, a photo of Prince Charles was identified as “Mark Robert,” an investor who provided a testimonial. The same testimonial was then attributed verbatim to a “Johnson Smith,” supposedly another UK investor.\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates?

Secondly, the candlestick also closed on the opposite of the trend line. The price action also showed that the price retouched the trend line and began a ranged bound movement. Based of that, it was assumed that the downtrend was over.\nIt was previously stated that Bitcoin price is unlikely to continue its downtrend. Today, the price was trading at $8,341.68 at the time of writing. However, the weekly chart shows that it fell again to the previous day's low of $8,341.68. Nevertheless, if the asset continues its fall, it will certainly retest the previous low of $8,000.\nThe relative strength index period 14 is level 27 indicating that the market is oversold. This suggests that the bulls will take control of the market. However, that does not mean the price will not retest the previous low of $8,000 because it can rally even at the oversold market condition.\nBTCUSD Short-term Trend: Bearish\nThe daily chart shows that Bitcoin price has a bearish outlook. Yesterday, the asset was trading at $8,700 in a range bound movement. Later, the price fell to $8,500 and resumed its range bound movement. Bitcoin finally fell to $8,300. Since the price has broken the $8,500 level, it may find support at $8,000.\nThe views and opinions expressed here do not reflect that of CryptoGlobe.com and do not constitute financial advice.

exchange.\nCiting anonymous sources, Bloomberg added that while the filing did not mention a specific fundraising target, the figure “could” circle $1bln – a figure which had previously appeared earlier this month.\nThe move would create further competition for mining stalwart Bitmain , with Canaan currently already controlling around 15% of the Bitcoin chips and hardware equipment market.\nIn an interview with Reuters last month, meanwhile, co-chairman Jianping Kong said the numbers were equal to “a quarter of the world’s bitcoin blockchain computing power.”\nMajor IPO backers appearing on the filing are Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse Group AG and CMB International Capital Ltd.\nCanaan has yet to issue a public statement about the move, declining comment
