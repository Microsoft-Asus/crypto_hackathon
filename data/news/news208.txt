It is the first decentralized digital currency , as the system works without a central bank or single administrator. The network is peer-to-peer and transactions take place between users directly, without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes through the use of cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain . Bitcoin was invented by an unknown person or group of people under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and released as open-source software in 2009.  — Wikipedia Quite simply, Bitcoin is a popularized solution which offers a unique and provable mechanism to issue and manage currency between distrusting peers. It makes use of blocks to store transaction information, each new block minting new coins to the node solving the mathematical problem required to make the block valid. The validation mechanism grows in difficulty over time and the coin issuance rate decreases, therefore the value of the coin is meant to increase proportionally. The principal functionality required to make this protocol useful is to track unspent coins. This allows an account address who is appointed this unspent balance to divide it and create a ticket which they can forward to another account as a mean of payment. 5JH5ro46y5FatXMZ69RyiFFomJugeJ5Bcf6AnqLsKT3F3QGc2hB — This is the private key, used to sign unspent coins and authorize the ticket transference to an other public key, which looks like 1CXvwr49Zzq9LjpWgCQ25k3JrxNcSPzApD The private key must be kept secret, it is used to generate the public key of the account.

Cryptocurrency falls below $8,000 in dramatic drop\nLast night bitcoin hit sub-$8,000 for the first time since mid-April, far below its summer peak of $9.826.\nAt roughly midnight, bitcoin value dropped to $7,962, according to Coindesk.\nAt 5am it rallied slightly to $8,044 before plummeting again to $7,962 at 8am.\nIt has since rallied once again to $8,122 but the uncertainty has left investors rattled.\nHowever despite the falling markets this week, BitMex CEO Arthur Hayes predicted Bitcoin will be at “$50,000 by the end of the year”..\nThe former Citigroup trader told CNBC: “It’s my job to make predictions – whether or not they are right or wrong – it doesn’t really matter to me.\n“I’m a volatility trader at the end of the day. We make our money if its volatile.\n“If it goes up, if it goes down, if you have Bill Gates calling it a fraud, great. Short it. I don’t care.\n“Or if you think it is going to be a million dollars in a few months, great, buy it.\n“We just match trades.”\nToday’s erraticism marks a jarring contrast to the bitcoin boom of late-2017 and early-2018.\nFrom October to December the value of bitcoin soared from $4,309 to $19,304 – a staggering 450% increase.\nCoindesk currently values bitcoin at $8,126.\nIt comes after bitcoin failed to make the top-ten list of public blockchains put together by the Chinese government.\nThe index was created and released by the China Center for Information Industry Development, part of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in Beijing.\nIt evaluates the technological capability, usefulness of the application, and innovativeness of the project.\nBlockchain, the system powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet.\nEthereum, whose currency is called ether, garnered an overall score of 129.4.\nIt has the become the foundation for many initial coin offerings, in which start-ups create their own digital currencies and sell them to investors to generate financing for their projects.\nBitcoin, founded nearly 10 years ago, had a rating of 88 and came in at No. 13.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.express.co.uk/latest/bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "arthur hayes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill gates", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "citigroup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T06:08:42.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b2fb29c4755a1195bc8477987c95ae30e0caaf8e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRRhwKpU9Mmp46dp50LJIv1hoiqmv5iAGwWQeZZ3ECPe0S4Pq2emEwwiQbOjdckkajem1st18EtSUpyb.hNSUH_0sqskC70.fJlGxm98aGULg--", "site_full": "dawnpaknews.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://dawnpaknews.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Dawn News Pakistan", "title": "How do I pay without a payment bitcoin address?

In fact, the market reversed and is now trading at a monthly low! As usual, investors are wondering where the market will go from here.\nMarket Overview Contrary to popular expectation, Bitcoin failed to rally 69 – 130% after the Consensus conference in New York ended this week. In fact, it pulled back nearly 5% as the cryptocurrency market capitalization sank to $389 billion and it appears that the downtrend is set to continue for the short term.\nFortunately, things still bode well for crypto as:\nGoldman Sachs is developing a dollar pegged cryptocurrency ( USDCoin ) through Circle which will finally provide an alternative stablecoin to Tether. As Consensus wrapped up, the CFTC and SEC directors shared their view that they have no desire to stand in the path of blockchain development. A platform for institutional investment in cryptocurrencies is gradually concretizing which further supports claims that institutional investors will boost cryptocurrency prices in the future. Keeping this in mind, at present there is still more tangibly good news than bad news in the crypto-hemisphere and volatility is nothing new to cryptocurrency investors… though all of the moonshot valuations and promises of tripling market caps may have led us to forget this.\nDaily Chart\nAfter a nearly 5% drop, BTC briefly touched a monthly low at $7,925 on Bitfinex. As shown on the daily chart, this is a nearly 50% retracement of the pre-April rally low of $6,425.\nOn 18th May BTC had continued a pattern of lower highs and lower lows and the daily chart shows BTC below the 100 and 200-day MA and at the time of writing the RSI sits below the 50 indicating that bears have the advantage.\n4HR Chart\nThere is a smidgen of positive news for the short term as around midday Saturday the 5 and 10-day MA changed direction and BTC is close to exiting the recently developed downward channel. On the other hand, both the 20 and 50-day MA are sloping downwards and BTC needs to cross the 50-day MA at $8,400. At the time of writing BTC still trades below the 50-day MA suggesting short term continuance of the bearish trend.\nIf BTC is unable to recover or hold above $8,000, there are long term supports at $7,800 and $7,600 but how likely these are to hold is questionable as $7,784 is at the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement. A close below $8,000 means that a reversal favorable to the bears is in place and the ensuing sell off could drop prices to $7,000 or lower.\nVision BTC is close to crossing the 50-day MA at $8,400 and a close above the 50 would set BTC outside the recently developed downward trendline. Failure to recover could lead BTC to touch the $7,784 support at the 61.8 percent retracement.

Sponsored Links\nThe Denver Post reports that Secretary of State Wayne Williams made the proposal in draft rules presented earlier this week. The donations – whether in bitcoin or another digital currency – would be subject to the same state limits as a cash donation, and the value would be determined at the time of the contribution.\n“The FEC is doing it now. So we are just going along for the ride.” noted Suzanne Staiert, Colorado’s deputy secretary of state. Colorado wants to allow political donations in bitcoin and other cryptocurrency https://t.co/otrU5piJH1\n— The Denver Post (@denverpost) May 18, 2018\nThrough May 23 comments on the proposed rule will be accepted by the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office.\nSince cryptocurrency contributions to campaign financing were approved by the Federal Election Commission in 2014, they were widely used. New Hampshire was the first state which in 2014 began to allow candidates to accept crypto donations. Republican Andrew Hemingway became the first U.S. politician to accept Bitcoin contributions.\nTo date, the largest reported bitcoin donation to a political campaign was received by Austin Petersen from Missouri. The amount is 0.284 BTC ($4,500). Senator Rand Paul also accepted crypto donations during his 2016 presidential bid.

Now the website has revamped its user interface and the website’s developer has added services like a direct crypto-to-crypto exchange and a shopping section where users can post items to sell for Bitcoin Cash.\nAlso read: The Exahash Era: SHA-256 Mining is a Significant Achievement in Computer Engineering Localbitcoincash.org Revamps the Site Again With Newly Added Features\nLocalbitcoincash.org offers an escrow service so buyers and sellers can trade Bitcoin Cash (BCH) in a peer-to-peer fashion. The platform was launched in October 2017 in its beta stage and has seen a lot of changes since then. Localbitcoincash (LBC) pretty much offers the same services as its BTC counterpart Localbitcoins but also has a variety of other options for users. Since our last review, the website looks and feels completely different as the colors are now green and black in contrast to its older orange look. The front page shows a step-by-step walkthrough detailing how to use LBC alongside a list of buyers and sellers below this field. The Localbitcoincash.org exchange. LBC’s Fiat and Crypto-to-Crypto Exchange\nThe sidebar to the left has a bunch of different options which include the fiat exchange where users can swap BCH for fiat currencies. Looking at the list of buyers and sellers on Localbitcoincash shows the platform seems to be getting a fair share of users. People from various locations all around the world are selling increments of BCH for their local currency. At the time of publication, prices range from the current spot market price found on online exchanges and some traders are selling for a few hundred more per BCH. The Localbitcoincash.org fiat exchange.\nThe peer-to-peer LBC platform also has a crypto-to-crypto exchange that operates just like Shapeshift or Changelly but without fees. The peer-to-peer platform also has a crypto-to-crypto exchange that operates similarly to Shapeshift, and Changelly. Peer-to-Peer Escrow Shopping\nSimilarly to the operations of the aforementioned platforms, LBC gives registered users a deposit and receiving address so they can swap BCH for cryptocurrencies like BTC, Dash, Ethereum, Smartcash, Steem, and more. Under this feature on the sidebar is the send BCH by email service which allows users to easily send BCH to someone in this mannner. Furthermore, on May 30, the LBC developer announced the addition of a peer-to-peer shopping section where users can sell items for BCH. LBC’s newly added shopping section that allows people to sell goods via escrow.\n“After many weeks of hard work, we are really excited to announce the launch of our peer to peer online shopping platform,” explains the LBC representative. “This means that anyone can trade with anyone freely, instantly and safely via escrow. Anyone can be a seller today and sell physical or digital products — There are no commissions at all by the platform and we don’t have any restrictions built in so users are welcome to message the sellers directly to deal outside of this platform.”\nAll these additions fit with our objective of allowing anyone to earn a living online, especially people from failed states and corrupt countries. In many of these places, citizens had to suffer from the consequences of the failed government for many decades — Our hope is that with Bitcoin Cash, this will change and help lift someone up from poverty into economic freedom and equality.\nThe fiat exchange shows traders selling BCH are located all around the world but some have a cap on how much they are willing to sell. A great majority of the peer-to-peer trading arrangements on Localbitcoincash are ‘Meetup’ swaps where individuals meet in person to trade fiat for BCH. In order to get a scope of what type of trade an individual is offering simply hit the ‘view’ tab to read the trader’s arrangements. The developer of LBC is adding to the website regularly and with each visit the trading portal seems to be more user-friendly over time.\nWhat do you think about the exchange Localbitcoincash?

Blockchair Feed decodes the messages that are written into the BCH, BTC, and ETH networks. The results can be viewed in a real-time feed comprised of messages that range from the banal to the enigmatic.\nAlso read: A Brief History of Hidden Messages in the Bitcoin Blockchain Feast on a Banquet of Messages with Blockchair Feed\nBlockchain explorer Blockchair is widely used by the bitcoin cash and core communities for searching for transactions and checking data pertaining to market prices, dominance, and network performance. It’s also one of the few blockchain explorers that enables users to search for specific words or phrases hidden in transactions. Its latest tool goes a step further and decodes these messages in realtime as they are published on each of the three blockchains. A sample message decoded by Blockchair Feed\nBlockchair Feed provides a fascinating and occasionally bizarre glimpse into the conversations that people are having, sometimes with specific people, and sometimes with the world at large, via their favorite blockchain. Most of the messages that can be viewed in the feed come from the BCH network. That’s largely thanks to the success of micro-blogging social networks such as Memo and Blockpress . Each of these capitalizes on the low fees of bitcoin cash, making it practical to message other users via the OP_Return field. Thanks to the recent upgrade to the BCH network, the size of this field has increased, giving rise to even more possibilities for onchain communication. Blockpress\nOf the two social networks, Blockpress has the cleaner UI which is reminiscent of Twitter. After creating a profile, header, and username, users can dispatch short messages that include emojis. Judging by the spate of messages appearing in the Blockchair Feed, however, Memo is the busier of the BCH social networks at present. As previously reported by news.Bitcoin.com, people have been encoding messages in blockchains for years. The BTC blockchain, for example, contains six marriage proposals. Now, thanks to the rise of tools such as Blockchair Feed, coupled with services like Memo and Blockpress, reading those messages – and even replying to them – has gotten a lot easier.\nHave you tried using Blockpress or Memo yet and if so what are your thoughts on these services? Let us know in the comments section below.\nImages courtesy of Shutterstock, and Blockchair Feed.\nNeed to calculate your bitcoin holdings? Check our tools section.

We've seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need a more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I'm hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research. - said economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries, who works at PwC in the Netherlands. Bitcoin network uses almost as much electricity as Ireland\nThe estimates, based on economics, put the minimum current usage of the Bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland.\nA single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month.\nRead: What is bitcoin? All about the cryptocurrency\nBy the end of this year, de Vries predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts -- as much as Austria and half of a per cent of the world's total consumption.\nIf the price of Bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, de Vries believes the network could someday consume 0.5 per cent of the world's electricity. Process of electricity consumption during bitcoin 'mining'\nBitcoin is dependent on computers that time-stamp transactions into an ongoing chain to prevent the duplicate spending of coins.\nComputers in the network perform calculations continuously, competing for the chance, once every ten minutes, to be appointed to create the next block of transactions in the chain.\nThe user of the computer that wins is awarded 12.5 new coins -- a process known as \"mining\" Bitcoin.\nHowever, all the time, even the users that don't win are expending computing power.\nRead: Bitcoin crosses USD 12,000 mark for the first time: What you need to know about this cryptocurrency 'Bitcoin will eventually reach an equilibrium'\n\"You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you're using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there's a big incentive for people to increase how much they're spending on electricity and on machines,\" de Vries said.\nEconomic principles suggest that the entire Bitcoin network will eventually reach an equilibrium where the costs of the hardware and electricity used to mine equal the value of the Bitcoin being mined. Illustration by Nilanjan Das\nThat information can approximate the total amount of electricity that the network will use at said equilibrium.\nGetting a good estimate is important in determining the sustainability of cryptocurrencies moving forward and in helping shape policy around them, de Vries said.\n(With inputs from PTI)\nInterested in General Knowledge and Current Affairs?

The services are completely anonymous without any personal information required to open an account. Accounts are by number not by name, as the Swiss bank accounts originally were.\nFrom Vault8 “Our premise was to offer services that no one has done before and we did it. We looked into the future and this is what we saw, Vault8. Unlike other companies we didn’t build Vault8 to collect personal information. We build it from the ground up to offer the first and best in service to the cryptocurrency community.”\nHow Vault8 works and the services it offers. Opening a safe deposit box is free. There are 3 types of accounts, Standard, Lender & Investor. Once opened the holder is issued an account number that is used instead of their name. Account holders can deposit into their safe deposit box using a cryptocurrency wallet. They can withdraw from their safe deposit box at any time in the same manner. There is no limit to the number of safe deposit box accounts one person or company can open.\nThere are many self-directed features within the account holder’s area. Account holders can transfer from one safe deposit box to another, their own or another account holder. They can allow temporary access to their box so others can verify their cryptocurrency holdings. There are peer to peer loans using the account holder’s cryptocurrency as collateral; a hold is placed on the collateral until the loan is paid off. If the loan defaults the cryptocurrency is transferred to the lenders safe deposit box.\nAccount holders can convert their cryptocurrency or other physical currency to Vault8 Tokens. Vault8 Tokens are an internal, fixed value cryptocurrency backed by the cryptocurrency or hard currency that it was convert from. Example, account holder converts bitcoin into Vault8 Tokens which are in their safe deposit box. When they want to withdraw from their box they can convert the Vault8 Token to cash or any other crypto or hard currency.\nVault8 is a virtual company, like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies it is virtual. The Vault8 website is a portal for the services offered, no cryptocurrency is received or stored through the website, all safe deposit boxes are offline. Vault8 does not buy or sell cryptocurrency; it is not a money transmitter, or exchange. Vault8 operates around the globe through its portal website and its network of agents.\nAs stated by Vault8 “We developed Vault8 as a data service. The response has been overwhelming not only to the services offered, but by companies and individuals in Dubai, China, Macau, Russia and the US, who are making inquiries as to purchasing Vaut8 to have their own presence in the bitcoin, cryptocurrency market.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.vault8.net/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "first company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "private swiss numbered bank accounts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "standa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ny", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T10:49:03.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2e34355328707d9ff1e98f4c79ba1ed6570cc62e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSxKva2q_LKrDawcTGU7gmyA-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2e34355328707d9ff1e98f4c79ba1ed6570cc62e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSxKva2q_LKrDawcTGU7gmyA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nShare the link to CryptoTab with your friends and get extra earnings in BTC depending on their earnings.

Signs of recovery are now showing themselves as we inch away from the repeated drops of last week. At $8,500, bitcoin is at its highest point since Monday, when it briefly rose to $8,800 following the start of Coindesk’s Consensus Conference.\nIt was prior to this event that Fundstrat’s Tom Lee (no stranger to these price articles) made a bold prediction regarding the currency’s price. He stated that bitcoin would rally during the Conference, and spike harder than it had in previous weeks. Ultimately, the price didn’t rally; in fact, it incurred several drops following the event’s commencement, and didn’t begin exhibiting signs of positive change until the Conference was over. Bitcoin lost about 10 percent of its overall value while the event was taking place.\nLee later “owned up” to his incorrect prediction, writing:\n“Given conferences like Consensus are chances for the community to gather in a centralized place and meet constituents new to the community (growth in attendance), it seems natural that the combination of ‘sanity check’ (all is OK and progress is happening) plus ‘new interest’ (incremental attendance) should strengthen the crypto-community’s conviction, and coupled with growth in incremental constituents, should have aided cryptocurrency prices.”\nLee blames that lack of price rises during the Conference on the fact that regulation in America is still unclear. He says that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general need more clarification from organizations like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), along with an increase in institutional adoption rates before prices can really fire up.\n“Crypto still faces significant internal resistance and hurdles within traditional financial institutions, “he later added. “But it is encouraging, nonetheless, that a large share of incremental attendance comes by way of financial institutions.”\nThe fact is that bitcoin and the world of cryptocurrencies remain relatively volatile and speculative, and it’s right when we think we’ve got it down that we’re ultimately proven wrong. As we’ve seen, it’s near impossible to predict how digital currency prices will react to certain events, news, trends and other factors. Thus, making suggestions about what direction they’ll take in the future is an almost pointless task.\nLee called bitcoin’s maneuvers during the Consensus “very disappointing.” However, the analyst is sticking to his guns and insists that the currency will reach a price of $25,000 by the end of the year, beating out last year’s mega-price record by approximately $5,000. He further states that bitcoin will hit the $91,000 mark by 2020.\nIn addition to bitcoin, most major cryptocurrencies are hurling themselves deeper into green territory. At press time, Ethereum is up to $714 after a long week of wading through the $670 range. Ripple’s XRP has risen by approximately three cents and is on the verge of breaking $0.70, while Litecoin is traversing through the high $130 range.\nBitcoin Cash remains the only major cryptocurrency “still in a funk,” having recently taken a nosedive towards $1,180 after a solid week of meandering through $1,200. The currency has an upcoming hard fork scheduled that’s slated to render the original BCH coin null and void.

RSK, formerly known as Rootstock, will bring smart contracts, a key feature of the ethereum blockchain, to the world’s largest and most popular cryptocurrency , bitcoin. The news came at Consensus 2018, the fourth annual blockchain summit from May 14 to May 16, 2018, at the New York Hilton Midtown. RSK Brings Smart Contracts to Bitcoin\nThe RSK Labs cofounder highlighted the impact of a significant share of the total miners in the Bitcoin network now securing smart contracts on the blockchain . He said, “It’s a major announcement for bitcoin as a whole. This [ten] percent is coming from 80 percent of the total mining pool power.”\nAlthough the current ratio of miners currently securing the side chain is approximately one in ten, around 80 percent of all miners have pledged support in the near future. The action highlights the overwhelmingly positive response to smart contracts being implemented on Bitcoin’s blockchain. With more hash power expected to join the network in the coming months, it will also become possible to implement working smart contracts built to handle daily workloads.\nMiners are rewarded for maintaining the side chain by a concept known as merge mining . Kurman added:\n“It makes sense, after all, because the sidechain is designed to be merged-mined – a process which allows miners to get transaction fees by contributing their hash power to the sidechain, all while using the same equipment, electricity, and power they’re already using to mine bitcoin.” Advertisement advertisement\nRSK could add a new revenue source for Bitcoin miners that have seen profitability dwindle due to the increasing hashrate on the Bitcoin network. With the same hardware and no new cost, miners can join the side chain to keep it running.\nRSK launched the bamboo mainnet beta release on January 5, 2018. This was followed by the announcement of the launch of the RSK blockchain, a side chain of the Bitcoin main chain. The open-source smart contract platform has a two-way peg with bitcoin that will reward Bitcoin miners via merge mining. Bitcoin lacks the turing smart contract capabilities due to which it has historically trailed Ethereum in creating a smart contract.\nEthereum has its ether (ETH) token which is spent as gas to enforce a smart contract or to interact with the main chain. RSK, on the other hand, has no pre-mined coins nor will mint any coins in the future. Hence, RSK has no speculative value and will only complement the bitcoin blockchain rather than compete with it like Ethereum. RSK Lumino as a Second Layer Scaling Solution\nThe RSK side chain allows for improved Bitcoin scalability. The company claims to manage 100 transactions per second “without sacrificing decentralization and reducing storage and bandwidth usage using probabilistic verification and fraud proofs, as well as blockchain sharding techniques.”\nCofounder Kurman acknowledged that even though 100 transactions per second might be a significant improvement over existing technology, it may still be insufficient for mass adoption. The side chain may face scaling problems in the future similar to how existing blockchains struggle with them. Kurman said that his team was already working to find a solution for the issue.\nNewer blocks can be added to the side chain at intervals of ten seconds with low stale block rate. This procedure is possible because RSK uses DECOR and GHOST protocols.\nRSK will launch Lumino, a combination of the best features of Lightning and Raiden .

At press time, entities like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin all experienced small, yet noticeable hikes in their prices, while others, such as Bitcoin Cash, are showing even more noticeable gains over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC)\nBitcoin is sitting just beyond $8,362 – roughly $262 higher than where it was during our previous price article . Bitcoin is up 1.41% over the past 24 hours.\nNew reports about Bitcoin mining have emerged, and suggest that global operations for extracting new coins now require as much electricity as the entire nation of Ireland .\nThe Emerald Isle’s population is considerably larger than that of Iceland, which a few months ago, was identified as the first country to outdo itself via Bitcoin mining . Cryptocurrency mining ultimately required more energy than what was needed to power all of Iceland’s residences. Bitcoin mining may use as much energy as Austria by the end of 2018\nIts newfound status with Ireland’s electricity use shows just how powerful, and even common, Bitcoin mining has become. In addition, Bitcoin mining may use as much energy as Austria by the end of 2018. At press time, global operations require about 3.1 gigawatts of power.\nThe number of gigawatts necessary to power all of Austria is roughly 8.2, suggesting Bitcoin mining energy may possibly double by the time 2019 rolls along.\nIt seems everyone is eager to get their hands on new coins. Ethereum (ETH)\nEthereum is up almost $40 since our previous price piece when it was trading for approximately $677. At press time, the currency’s price has jumped to $714. Ethereum is up 2.96% over the past 24 hours.\nEthereum has been garnering newfound publicity ever since China – a nation known for being hostile towards cryptocurrencies – labeled it as the number one digital asset according to a new coin index.\nIn fact, Apple’s Steve Wozniak recently compared Ethereum to Apple at a Vienna conference and praised its technology, saying it could become “just as influential as Apple was.”\nWozniak also commented,\n“Ethereum interests me because it can do things and because it’s a platform.” Ripple (XRP)\nRipple is currently trading for 68 cents. That’s about two cents higher than where it sat during our previous price discussion. XRP is up 2.44% over the past 24 hours.\nThis week, XRP received assistance from a very unlikely associate: rapper Snoop Dogg.\nSponsored by Ripple Labs and headlined by the 46-year-old music mogul, a concert was held at a warehouse in Manhattan’s Meatpacking District, which was stuffed to the brim with champagne, blood orange margaritas, Ripple community members and musicians. The event was designed to garner further awareness for the Ripple community, and ultimately convince skeptics of the currency’s power. Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\nBitcoin Cash is the only major cryptocurrency that’s still soaking in the red. At press time, BCH is trading for approximately $1,187 – nearly $20 less than where it stood during our previous price article. Bitcoin Cash is up 5.53% over the past 24 hours.\nThis could be in anticipation of the currency’s upcoming hard fork, which is dubbed “BitcoinZap.” The fork is scheduled to take place on Tuesday and will differ from previous hard forks in that a new coin will not be created, and the older version of BCH will become obsolete and thus carry no economic value. Litecoin (LTC)\nLitecoin is presently trading for about $137. That’s five dollars higher than where it stood during our previous price discussion. Litecoin is up 1.83% over the past 24 hours.\nThe #paywithlitecoin campaign appears to be helping as private jet service TapJets recently announced in a blog post that it will add Ripple and Litecoin to its list of potential payment options. Users in need of private travel arrangements will now have the option to pay with LTC.\nThe TapJets team explained in a statement:\n“The people have voted, and we have heard their feedback. TapJets will proceed with the technical evaluation of Ripple (XRP) and Litecoin (LTC).” Market Summary\nSince our last price article , the cryptocurrency market cap rose to $383 billion , roughly $8 billion higher from where it previously stood. Though signs of recovery are beginning to appear, investors are again warned to remain careful when trading cryptocurrencies, which remain largely unregulated and speculative.

According to him, the technology behind bitcoin is capable of so much more than it is being used for today. Jack Ma becomes the latest influential figure in the business world to call bitcoin a bubble. Jack Ma. Source: CNBC Interested in Blockchain and not Bitcoin\nThe Alibaba founder revealed that his company is heavily invested in blockchain research. He also went on to say:\n“Blockchain is now a hot word. First, blockchain is not a bubble, but Bitcoin is a bubble. Bitcoin is just a tiny application of blockchain. At least inside Alibaba, blockchain must be a solution that addresses the privacy and security issues in the digital era.”\nAccording to Ma, Alibaba believes that there is enormous potential for blockchain application in several areas of the company’s business. The e-commerce giant has been researching on blockchain-based solutions with a focus on data security and privacy protocols. The company is also investing in the technology as it reportedly owns the highest number of blockchain technology patents in the world.\nDespite the considerable promise that blockchain holds, Ma is disappointed with the general profit-making narrative that pervades the industry. Speaking during the conference, he bemoaned the fact that many stakeholders seem to view blockchain as a money-making tool rather than a value creation technology. He condemned those who make blockchain to be a “huge gold mine” at the expense of leveraging the technology to improve upon the global business process.\nSo far, Alibaba has implemented some blockchain-based protocols in its business. The company plans to utilize blockchain tech in for public welfare and e-commerce applications. Alibaba signed a partnership with PwC in 2017 to research ways of leveraging the technology in creating a robust food traceability framework to combat counterfeit food products. The previous year, the company launched the first ever blockchain-based email repository service. Business Elites Believe Bitcoin is a Bubble\nJack Ma also spoke about bitcoin , the number cryptocurrency in the world. Ma’s attitude to bitcoin seems to be one of disinterest even going as far as to call it a bubble. This declaration of his is a marked departure from earliest comments where he expressed the fact that he had little knowledge of bitcoin.

If you are a US person or an entity with at least one 25 percent owner who is a US person, please complete the appropriate FATCA form. You are required to provide us with such information,” said Bitfinex. Targeted Users\nWhalepool, a community of day traders focused mainly on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Bitfinex, emphasized that they strongly disavow the decision of Bitfinex and have withdrawn their funds from the exchange.\n“Bitfinex is now requiring users to give their tax information so that it can send it to BVI which will exchange it with your country’s tax authorities. We strongly disavow. If you also disagree with this decision, peacefully protest it by withdrawing your money from Bitfinex,” the Whalepool team said.\nIn response to the statement of Whalepool, the Bitfinex team noted that it has “deliberately targeted users” that it believes have an obligation to self-disclose and emphasized that only a portion of the Bitfinex user base was asked to disclose their tax identification and personal information.\nIn some regions like the US and France, capital gains tax on cryptocurrency investment is quite substantial. Until this month, the gains tax imposed on cryptocurrency trading was 45 percent, which was decreased to 19 percent by France’s Council of State because investors were not willing to disclose their earnings just to be taxed 45 percent.\nIn consideration of the high capital gains tax imposed on cryptocurrency trading, it is understandable that investors in the global cryptocurrency market try to avoid disclosing their tax IDs and prevent from being forced to pay abnormally large taxes on trades.\nThe abrupt decision of Bitfinex led the cryptocurrency market and investors that trade the bitcoin-to-USD, which is still the majority of investors in the market, to panic sell and withdraw their funds out of Bitfinex.\nAccording to CryptoCompare, a cryptocurrency market data provider, Bitfinex remains as the biggest bitcoin-to-USD exchange with more than 29 percent of the market share. Bitcoin Price Falls\nThe period in which Bitfinex sent out its official statement to its clients coincided with the fall in the price of bitcoin on May 17, when the bitcoin price reached a two-month low at $7,925. It is highly likely that the price drop of bitcoin was largely caused by Bitfinex and the sell-off of investors on the platform trading the bitcoin-to-USD pair.\nThe cryptocurrency market still remains extremely volatile. Over the past 24 hours, the daily trading volume of the cryptocurrency market has dropped $5 billion, from $21 billion to $16 billion. As such, it is possible that the bitcoin price falls further below from the current rate at $8,320. But, given that the market has already started to recover from the May 17 dip, it is likely that the bitcoin price rebounds soon, along with other major cryptocurrencies and tokens.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitfinex", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-20T20:04:15.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ec6b56b48c810bb37ff6d5f097610d202687a44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS85FFguq21ncGiBsemCiwF0-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn free Bitcoin!

This week a Reddit user named ‘u/cryptogreetings’ posted a cryptic picture online that contained a puzzle with a 1 BTC prize. Since the image was published online no one has been able to crack it so far as the public address can be seen here . The picture is black and orange and white with a bitcoin symbol and many words, and numbers strewed across the image. The creator says if no one can crack it in a week they will publish some hints to help people out.\n“This work is comprised of Satoshi Nakamoto’s famous whitepaper words, scaled by Log N. Disparate ideas inspired Satoshi to create a solution to revolutionize modern socio-economics and industry,” explains the Reddit user u/cryptogreetings.\nThe work reflects on the elements that brought this technology to life, and challenges the underlying security model. Hidden in plain sight lies something more: a treasure hunt. 1 BTC is concealed within the work. This picture was published yesterday, it contains 1 BTC hidden within the image.

The painting called ‘The Legend of Satoshi Nakamoto’ was designed by @coin_artist , who had hidden clues that revealed a private key to the tethered wallet .

Mr. Hoskinson made the comments right after ADA reached the 7th position by market capitalization.\nDespite that all cryptos are in the green today, the turbulent times shared throughout the market in Jan-Feb have still to recover. So the gains melted away are yet to be recouped. Charles Hoskinson Justifying Cardano Future Position.\nWhat a coin makes is its supportive infrastructure that hoists the market capitalization = market cap. The team behind Cardano have been concentrating mostly in its technological improvement. Because of their market cap, Ethereum and Bitcoin are leading the show, but that will change according to the CEO. “Why is anybody worthy of their positions in the market cap? Bitcoin is advertised as a payment system and a means of exchange and then everybody who’s ever tried to use it for that, it’s been a miserable failure. They usually stop taking it, or they find ways to take cash and through a creative structure like what Bitpay has done. Ethereum claims to be a world computer, but then CryptoKitties breaks it.”\nEven that a very impacting factor is speculation in the crypto-verse, all digital currencies have one target. The goal to change the world for the better. Being it a smaller scale or larger, but the target can’t be achieved if the system is not at that purpose-level and consumer centric.\nThe individual/group who want to be an adopter looks firstly at the team, philosophy and science running the network. That is why the founder added: “The way the ecosystem goes about doing its business is what makes it earn the current positive reputation of becoming the market leader and contender.” The User and Security.\nBased on what Charles Hoskinson said, in half a year-year everybody will feel the platforms impact. The ability to shard and scale while reaching goal-points in the roadmap will return as gains for our network.\nWhen it comes to security, Hoskinson continued with that it begins by making sure you invest in the crypto that has the protocols implemented and are best in the ecosystem. It is titled by many as the first crypto-project born from scientific philosophy based on academic research, peer-reviewed work and software developed on open source standards.\nOnce users are clear on how the Daedalus works and the benefits of cold storage, the issues of security breaches will drastically reduce. The name of Cardano’s e-Wallet is Daedalus, one of a kind in the market. It gives users the ability to activate decentralized applications within the cryptocurrency’s Blockchain.

Now, the PRC is the first country to come out with official government crypto rankings. Its China Center for Information Industry Development (CCID) used three filters through which coins would be judged: innovation, technology, application. Rather surprisingly to some enthusiasts, bitcoin core (BTC) didn’t even crack the top ten, while bitcoin cash (BCH) almost didn’t make the list at all.\nAlso read: Alec Baldwin’s Lambo Movie Backed by Crypto Tech China Lists Ethereum as Best in Crypto Class\nIn what is either widely being referred to as a case of communist schizophrenia or a passive nod to the inevitable financial future, the PRC’s CCID released its first set of cryptocurrency rankings. China, of course, outright banned crypto in all its various forms, and the broader market was thought to have plummeted for a time as a result. That it is now publishing coin rankings is confusing to many observers.\nCN Ledger, a popular Twitter handle, was the first to expose the rankings to the outside world. Its author, Eric Zhao, explained how “most old-school experts haven’t followed the crypto space long enough to grasp some of the traits of tech and community that can’t be found elsewhere.”\nIndeed, this year found Weiss Ratings’ inaugural list of their rankings, as these pages reported. It too was very controversial. “The eagerly-anticipated report rates 74 of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market, scoring them from A to D,” we wrote. “Such was the level of interest in the report, the company’s website was knocked offline as interest peaked on Wednesday morning. Weiss Ratings include some controversial scores for currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum that are sure to spark debate.” Then, as now, BTC ranked lower than Ethereum. Weiss spent a great deal of time defending their decision.\nMr. Zhao hoped the CCID effort signals a kind of new opening. “I believe at least it’s a sign that the officials are starting to treat crypto projects more like a neutral endeavour towards better technology and innovations, rather than just challenging the power and authority of banks and government,” he stressed. BTC Listed 13 of 28\nJust a week ago, the PRC ministry surprised enthusiasts with a press release announcing its Global Public Chain Assessment Index . “This independent analysis of cryptocurrencies and global public blockchain technology demonstrates the confidence of the Chinese Government in the technology, and will act as a guide for government, enterprise and research institute,” news.Bitcoin.com quoted the government notice as stating.\nThe Center for Information Industry Development used three main criteria in scoring cryptocurrencies, though scant information exists about methodology. Application, innovation, technology were used to place 28 total cryptos and their respective blockchains (which the rankings, at least at first glance, weigh heavily).\nOf the top four coins by market capitalization, Ethereum ranked first, followed by bitcoin core (BTC) at number 13, ripple in the 17th spot, and bitcoin cash (BCH) lagging well behind them all at the lowly number 25 of 28. For the CCID, however, the top five cryptos to their liking include ether, steem, lisk, neo, komodo. For those who worry about such rankings, PRC appears to, again, value blockchains over currencies – a common refrain heard in the Western corporate world. If, alternatively, one were to assess various cryptocurrencies according to their efficacy as mediums of exchange, BCH and BTC would likely rank quite high, and could be considered a most obvious threat to a regime bent on control. Whatever the case, cracks do happen inside the communist stronghold: quite a few crypto tech related patents are owned by China, its central bank has openly mused about state-backed crypto, and, of course, its burgeoning video game industry is very bullish on tokens and distributed ledgers. And just announced , “The most popular stock trading app in China, Straight Flush (同花顺), now adds support for showing the price of Crypto-Currencies.”\nDid you think China’s rankings will have any real impact?

Maybe due to the high expectations over Consensus, which did not create that much demand over bitcoin, at least not as much as it happened during previous years.\nI understand it’s your money that is at stake and the market has been quite bearish. But it’s also mine and everyone else’s who decided to change from fiat-currency to cryptocurrency. To most people you know bitcoin is an investment vehicle; maybe a bit more worrying, is the fact that the focus is not even bitcoin anymore, it’s mostly altcoins. Where else we could we get those massive gains (bruh)?\nBut greed comes at a cost.\nI love new ideas, new projects, new ways of thinking and innovation in general. I also love the concept of decentralizing trust and money and the super-power/super-responsibility that comes with it. Obviously, the debate is considerably more interesting when the total marketcap of (insert top-10 project name) is worth billions.\nAt some point we need to stop and ask ourselves, how happy are we with the actual progress of the cryptocurrency space? So many companies have surged, yet where is the real change? Is there a bubble or is the market undervalued? Is price aligned with technology development and adoption, in any way?\nMore importantly: Can you still go to the moon?\n–this article shouldn’t be taken as financial advisement as it represents my personal opinion and views. I have savings invested in cryptocurrency so take whatever I write with a grain of salt. Do not invest what you cannot afford to lose and always read as much as possible about a project before investing. Never forget: with great power, comes great responsibility. Being your own bank means you’re always responsible for your own money–\nI have absolutely no idea, plus I couldn’t care less. Don’t take me wrong, I hope the market turns bullish and we do see a massive bull-run, breaking the CME futures market trend of keeping Bitcoin below 10k. I hope all projects deliver upon their promises. I hope price, technology development and business development align themselves. My desire is that everything works out just fine and everyone who invested takes home some profit.\nThe problem is, of course, reality works a little bit differently.\nMaybe in a different universe where we make no bad choices and aren’t greedy by nature, that could happen.\nWhat I see is many projects being clearly overvalued, a definite lack of research on actual proven concepts and too much money wasted on marketing campaigns, ads, advisors, ICO trackers, paid promotional content instead of focusing on actual product development and fixing important issues. “In order to make money, you need to spend money”\nSure. Welcome to the VC western mentality world. You either think big or go home, right?\nNo. That’s not why I joined cryptocurrency.\nI do want to make money, get rich and don’t have to worry about anything else for the rest of my days, focusing only at doing what I love. But there are many ways of achieving that goal. You don’t need 1000 BTC to start a decentralizing (whatever business) platform with economic incentives. Or at least you shouldn’t. One of the things that drive my passion towards cryptocurrency is what’s about to come: when people with an actual need for the technology start participating, hordes at a time.\nSure, our gains are important. But there’s something way bigger coming which will influence the entire marketcap.\nImagine when those 33% unbanked people around the world realize they can simply download an app and get paid in a currency accepted everywhere. The true beauty of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies remains to be its decentralized, permissionless and transparent nature.\nBut in order for that to happen, we might need to put greed aside for a second and think of ways of better-redistributing money. If you don’t see how that is important for your personal gain, let me clarify.\nThink of what happens when you include 2.3 billion people on the financial system.\nCan you even do it?\nI cannot conceptualize the impact on our daily lives, but from a financial standpoint, this is what I see: 2.3 billion more customers for every business, potentially. By financially including people who did not have a chance to participate in the world economy, you can now reach new customers everywhere; because the means of exchanging are borderless and permissionless, no one can be blocked from exchanging value and services. The digitalization of the world, via mobile smart-phones with internet access, could change how we do business forever.\nFor example, if you do business in Africa or Latin American countries you might know it’s near impossible to take money away, due to the many currency-related restrictions. You can now hop over that problem, just by transacting in cryptocurrency.\nOr maybe if you’re willing to train a whole new workforce, who needs much less cash to sustain an acceptable standard of living. It might not be easy but with the right set of tools, motivation and people we might see new specialized businesses flourishing through developing countries. How will cryptocurrency change jobs and economies worldwide?\nIn order to get to the bottom of that question, first we need to worry about adoption.\nI personally believe there are 3 reasons that could lead to potentially increasing worldwide adoption of cryptocurrency: A Better User Interface; A Better redistribution of money; Standardized multisig/escrow contracts.\nIf you think I forgot about scalability, transaction fees or block size, please rest assured I haven’t. To me those aren’t real problems; as the network grows in security (more miners), user adoption and developer community, I believe we will see those issues getting resolved. Some others will appear, of course, but that’s the nature of innovation.\nYou need to break stuff in order to build new things so it’s not the tech problems that frighten me, to be honest; the values and paths we choose to support our decision-making, that is what concerns me. But we’ll get into that in a bit.\nSo, why is User Interface at the top? Simple answer: would you be able to use the internet without DNS being active? If you do not understand the question, let me rephrase it: how easy would it be to, instead of accessing https://ccn.com , you would have to know a bunch of different IP addresses to be able to connect to the provider website? I’m sure you wouldn’t like that at all.\nKiller user-friendly apps, which make the bridge between the infrastructure and the user are the key which might unlock this puzzle.\nThe first real challenge is making cryptocurrency indistinguishable from digital fiat-currency. We need ways to safe-guard users from making bad decisions, like not keeping their private keys safe, accessing websites via ads, or keeping their entire assets in a single place. To achieve that, we have two main schools of thought to follow. Learning by doing or, Regulating the markets.\nAs regulation is usually the way to avoid, especially during the early development stages of any new technology, we should educate people and allow them to make bad decisions. It’s hard to lose your money, I have been there. I have also been scammed, tricked, made bad decisions on where to store my money, lost private keys and so on. What’s the only good thing about it? Each time I failed I learned something that helped me making better decisions in the future.\nWhat “experts” usually don’t say is that you shouldn’t be afraid to fail, especially if you’re starting in a new field.\nConsider the following: the sooner you fail the sooner you learn. This is, if I had not made all those mistakes back in the day, I would probably do them later on. And I could have lost way, way more money!\nThe hardest lesson we all learn with time is that there are no safeguards in real-life. A stupid comment on twitter can lose you your job; a click in the wrong ad can infect your laptop; just being in the wrong place at the wrong time can change your life drastically.\nWe need to accept we don’t control most things that come our way. We’re either prepared to deal with them or we’re not. One thing I’m pretty sure of: blocking people from investing because it’s in their best interest is just dumb. Why?\nFor one, how is it ok we allow some guys sitting at a table somewhere think they know better? Oh I see, they’re “protecting” us. If it isn’t morally wrong or illegal, don’t even try to tell me what to do. Let me do stupid stuff and make incredibly irrational decisions. That’s how I learn.\nI mean..\nIf it’s ok to gamble, it should be ok to buy cryptocurrency.\nIf it’s ok to share my data with the highest bidder, it should be ok to let me monetize it as I see fit.\nSecondly, everyone makes bad decisions at some point. No exceptions here. If someone tells you how certain they are about a certain event, run like the wind. Honestly, nothing is for certain, much less an unregulated market subject to the will of the whales and institutional investors. I mean, when JP Morgan comes out saying “ We’re considering entering the crypto market ” it means they’re already in, as most of you know.\nPeople are greedy by nature, right? Banks, institutions, corporations, any type of organization are just groups of people trying to get the maximum utility of each play.\nSometimes, even the greatest people make the most stupid mistakes.\nDo you follow, for example, the brilliant Andreas Antonopoulos? I’m sure if you do, you think highly of him. Did you know his co-author on “Mastering Bitcoin”, a blockchain bibble for so many crypto-enthusiasts, was the person responsible for creating Parity? Which got hacked not so long ago?\nDo you think he was an idiot for trusting such a person to be his co-author?\nThis is the harsh truth you don’t read many times. People make mistakes and bad things happen. What matters are the intentions and values on which decisions were made.\nEither a commercial airplane pilot who wasn’t able to account for time correctly or a doctor who failed to diagnose a disease, people sometimes make bad decisions that lead to destructive outcomes. Those events, however, can have a positive impact on future generations, because Human Beings have the capability to learn from theirs and others’ mistakes. Critical thinking is key for cryptocurrency, as we cannot impose too many regulations on something that is already internally regulated. That’s why Bitcoin works, as its internal consensus mechanics promote good behaviour and punish bad actors.\nIf you wonder why we might need to slow down on regulation think of what the current state of finance is doing to the world. There is a clear separation and segregation of classes as the rich can invest while the poor can only work for a pay-check.\nScrew that. Make money work for you. This is not a new idea, not even related to cryptocurrency at all, but it’s an important mmindsetto have. Maybe the story of rich-dad, poor-dad can be an inspiration to you, regarding how to look at money.\nNow, let’s get back on track at the question at hand. How can we better redistribute money?\n–I hope you don’t judge my rant too seriously; sometimes we just need to let it all out—\nBitcoin initiated a process of rewarding participants for securing the network. That’s already pretty cool and quite an achievement, but we need to aim at doing it better. Right now you need special hardware to maintain the security of the network. In time, I hope the mechanics change in order to allow for more people to be rewarded for maintaining the network’s security. Real change, in my opinion, will come from different proof-of-consensus. For example, there might be a different implementation that requires all participants to secure the network. This is, anyone who participates needs to validate transactions at some point, getting rewarded to do it.\nCurrently ,the logic dictates you need to spend energy to maintain the network’s security, which is a fair trade-off. But other logics might appear with different goals. What if instead of energy you staked your time or attention? You do not need a massive data structure change, like switching from a blockchain to a DAG or Hashgraph, to improve consensus mechanics by giving more rewards to users.\nIf everyone agrees to a change in the protocol rules you can potentially just fork bitcoin into a new proof-of-work mechanic, rewarding everyone who already participates in the current bitcoin blockchain (like bitcoin cash, private, gold etc).\nThere are of course opinions against keeping doing hardforks, as it potentially “steals” hashing power from the main network. But hey, that’s a feature of decentralization. People should be able to do whatever the hell they want. If someone believes they have a better way of reaching consensus, let them try. I understand the current feeling is many projects are just forking Bitcoin so that founders and early adopters get rich quick.\nIs that a lie? I doubt it. Again, we humans are quite greedy. That doesn’t refute the fact hardforks can have a potential good outcome!\nIf the overall goal is to improve the network, adoption and user reward why wouldn’t you do it?! I hope people try new things, as it’s the only way to achieve the best possible outcome for everybody. let’s get crazy for a second, shall we? Tokenizing the world economy\nAnother potential solution is if businesses everywhere start adopting a different mentality. What if instead of giving people equity, you can give them a direct way to make money by using your product/services? I understand it’s hard to conceptualize a token which has no real value, as it’s not connected to an organization’s equity, but try to see it from a different perspective: you can now purposely give away tokens to users, for free, as they use your product or service. Those tokens could let them vote upon governance, reward them with a fixed income or allow them to donate back tokens so you can build new features or maximize your business utility.\nThe goal here would be to directly redistribute gains, for example, among the people who support your network: users.\nThose users can be anyone, your suppliers, buyers, employees, investors, etc. Everyone who interacts with your business could potentially be rewarded for participating.\nImagine not having just a source of income, but potentially dozens at the same time, just from sharing your data, buying products, using services or interacting with a network. We could completely shift how the world works by literally giving back to your network. We now have a chance to shift from measuring wealth in profits to measuring wealth in network users. Because all users would have tokens!\nAs crypto-assets are inter-changeable, everyone can easily exchange them for digital cash. Or any other digital asset you see fit. Maybe instead of having 150 currencies, we will end up with hundreds or thousands of digital assets, all of which could potentially be exchanged amongst themselves.\nWe now come to the final point that can greatly influence overall adoption. Standardized multisig/escrow contracts\nAlthough this point would definitely work “under the blockchain hood”, its key for people to trust each other. Meaning, only with standardized and trusted contracts deployed, which use a very easy and friendly interface, we actually have a chance of people trusting the entire system. It’s pretty cocky to say “the blockchain can’t be hacked” when software and websites built over it, could.\nWe can’t forget we still live in an analogue world. People still lookup to institutions and governments for guidance and expect them to behave according to everyone’s best interest and their intrinsic values.\nThe issue is that sometimes, leaders forget those values they swore to abide to when making decisions and base them solely on personal gain. To destroy that mentality we also need a solid and stable infrastructure aligned with a set of organizations lead by people who do not care about personal gain. Hence I understand the role Vitalik, David, Dan or Charles play at their projects. How achievable is that goal?\nIt will depend, again, on all of us. If we promote and invest in projects just for gains, not caring about the purpose or goal, then I don’t see a real future. If we make an effort to bet on projects and people who put the benefit of the many ahead of their own, then I do. I think it’s up to us to let good projects and ideas live, bad ones to die and mistakes to happen.\nSomeone said if we do good deeds the world responds in kind.\nFor more than 2 centuries we had a system that only worked in some parts of the world, it wasn’t all inclusive, it was permissioned and required people to identify themselves to participate. We had a system that did not work 24/7 nor did it reward participants. Come to think about it, no one born after 2008 will ever live in a world where fiat-money is the only option. That’s somehow reassuring.\nThings have changed and we all must make an effort to turn this market into a huge success. From investors, to developers and from miners to users, it’s up to all of us as individuals to promote good agents and to punish bad actors.\nDon’t forget: the more selfish your actions are the worst the overall outcome for the most. I understand that for some of us to win, others need to lose; that’s just how balance works. Except this time the winners can be the many and the losers the few.\nI know it’s a bit of a stretch, but who knows? With a different attitude comes a different outcome. Is Bitcoin a bubble?\nNo. Our immense greed and money lust is. If you fear the market will collapse think of the Internet bubble.\nDo you remember how it ended?\nGreat. Now think of how you’re reading this article.\nNo bubble will destroy bitcoin, we’ve been there already. Now, if there is a bubble it means we weren’t able to control our greed for quick profits and allowed for enormous over-valued silly projects to emerge. Just like during the 2000s.\nThe only good thing is that with any failure comes an important lesson.\nMy only conclusion is that Bitcoin is the new digital internet money. No one was ever able to stop P2P file-sharing; do you really expect cryptocurrency will be any different? If there’s a 51% attack, the network simply forks. Or you switch to a different cryptocurrency.\nI mean, do you really want to kill Bitcoin?\nTry shutting down the internet.\nBitcoin isn’t the bubble. We are.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.

Such a dynamic has generated stinging criticism in ecological circles, where concerns about miners’ reliance on fossil fuel resources is growing. Yet if the world shifts to 100 percent renewable energy usage in the years ahead, Bitcoin could no longer be attacked as ecologically harmful.\nSubscribe to the Bitsonline YouTube channel for more great interviews featuring industry insiders & experts Facing the ‘Energy Problem’\nThe debates around the Bitcoin network’s energy consumption have been picking up steam as of late.\nThis week, Alex de Vries of PwC’s Experience Center in Amsterdam published a paper in Vol. 2, Issue 5 of Joule , a “ground-breaking energy research” journal. The paper was entitled “ Bitcoin’s Growing Energy Problem .” de Vries pictured.\nIn the essay, de Vries concluded that Bitcoin’s energy consumption could soon be inching up past a consumption rate of 8 gigawatts annually:\n“These methods tell us that the Bitcoin network consumes at least 2.55 GW of electricity currently, and that it could reach a consumption of 7.67 GW in the future, making it comparable with countries such as Ireland (3.1 GW) and Austria (8.2 GW).”\nTo be sure, 8GW is a massive amount of energy. Of course, it’s not the 100 terawatts the world’s banking industry uses annually according to some estimates, though I digress.\nThe point? Bitcoin uses a lot of energy, and it’s supposed to . And that reality’s going to cause debate among bitcoiners and nocoiners so long as ecologically harmful fossil fuel resources are powering a sizeable chunk of the Bitcoin network.\nThe entire debate will shift, however, if the world transitions to using 100 percent renewable energy resources. Then, Bitcoin could use energy to its heart’s content without engendering ecological harm. A Future of Use Without Guilt\nFor some, the notion of the international community moving to 100 percent renewable energy has been considered all but impossible.\nAccording to new research featured in the Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews journal, however, a total shift to renewable energy resources is not only argued to be possible but also affordable using contemporary technology.\nThe research, published under the title “ Response to ‘Burden of proof: A comprehensive review of the feasibility of 100% renewable-electricity systems,’ ” explores the various ways renewables could be uniformly used, even in light of energy variation.\nAalborg University’s Brian Vad Mathiesen, a co-author of the research, said:\n“There are some persistent myths that 100 percent renewable systems are not possible. Our contribution deals with these myths one-by-one, using all the latest research. Now let’s get back to the business of modelling low-cost scenarios to eliminate fossil fuels from our energy system, so we can tackle the climate and health challenges they pose.”\nTo that end, the elimination of fossil fuel usage would also eliminate the environmental challenge that Bitcoin’s detractors say it poses.\nIt would also open up the possibility of green energy-backed bitcoin mining farms that are almost entirely automated — e.g. with wind and solar energy at work, only a single program would need to be left running to assess and manage energy flow.\nFor now, we await the future that could be.\nWhat’s your take? Do you think fossil fuels are here to stay for now or are renewables best to pivot toward quickly?

I'ts not being talked about a lot in the industry, mostly because when people have insider knowledge they tend to keep it to them selves. But right now is probably one of the most profitable times in history to mine bitcoin. The \"gurus\" won't admit it because they love that everybody is selling off their cards for half of market value and dumping their bitcoin. That is more for them. On paper Bitcoin mining is at an all time low, but that is because bitcoins value is down aver 100% from its high's earlier this year. If you look at it in the long term, and have a little faith in bitcoin the price will go back up and at least break another all time high this year. So you can already double the number your mining program is telling you, you are earning. Then you take into consideration that GTX 1050 TI' s still have a 200 day ROI even in this bull market.

Most people use it as a store of value (the digital gold fallacy) or to trade on exchanges. A concept known as the Lightning Network was introduced as a solution to this scalability issue. The Basics of the Lightning Network\nThe Lightning Network was first described in a 2015 whitepaper by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja. The concept, however, was actually introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in an email to Mike Hearn in 2013.\nThe Lightning Network works through payment channels which are actually multi-sig wallets (multiple signature). A multi-sig wallet is just a Bitcoin address which requires a signature or private keys of several owners before money in that address can be spent. You can view them as bank vaults which require the turning of two different keys at the same time in order to open.\nA multi-sig wallet can, for example, be the common Bitcoin address of a married couple, wherein they both have to sign a transaction in order to spend their common Bitcoin.\nThe purpose of payment channels is regular execution of smaller payments and avoidance of high transaction fees. Examples of relationships ideal for LN channels are employee-employer, consumer-producer, utility provider-utility consumer, coffee drinker-coffee shop, etc. The idea is letting a customer open a payment channel with his coffee shop, regularly paying for coffee without having to wait for confirmation (10 to 60 minutes currently). How the Lightning Network Works\nLet’s explain with a step-by-step example. Our imaginary scenario is as follows:\nBob wants to pay Alice to write articles for him. The deal is 10 BTC for a total of 100 posts, or 0.1 BTC per post.\nIn a traditional Bitcoin system, that would require one hour on average with a fee of $5 to $500 per transaction, depending on how backlogged the network is. Because both Alice and Bob are bitcoin maximalists, they chose to open an LN channel rather than go with a cheaper and easier to use altcoin. Step 1: Opening a Channel\nBob creates a regular Bitcoin transaction on the main chain which defines the following: who he’s opening the channel with how much BTC he’s sending into the channel (10 BTC) after how long a period of time (one week in this case) he has the right to take the 10 BTC back if Alice does not respond.\nThe latter is actually a sub-transaction in the main transaction with a “timelock” function, which makes sure that, in spite of both parties having confirmed it, the money is not moveable for a week.\nSo, Bob sends Alice two transactions — one in which he suggests opening a payment channel with a 10 BTC deposit on a multi-sig which is opened with that transaction, and one in which he says the 10 BTC go back to him if there’s been no activity in the channel for a week. Step 2: Accepting the Opening of a Channel 1526603554alice-accepts-1024x396.jpg 1024x396 76.5 KB\nAlice receives two transactions in which she can see that Bob is offering 10 BTC on the multi-sig address with the two of them as the participating parties. She can also see he’s added the condition to return the money to him after one week of inactivity. She accepts this and signs the transactions, after which she broadcasts the transactions and they’re sent to the main blockchain, finalizing the channel’s creation. 1526603690signed-waiting-1024x609.jpg 1024x609 96.1 KB\nIt’s important to define two concepts here: signing a transaction and confirming or broadcasting a transaction. A signed transaction is merely ready for sending to the blockchain and constitutes an agreement between parties. It’s not visible on the blockchain. A broadcast or confirmed transaction is sent to the blockchain and closes the payment channel, settling balances.\nSigning the first transaction opens the channel and causes Bob’s 10 BTC to be deposited into the multi-sig address. Signing the other, despite allowing Bob to take all 10 BTC back, can only become active after a week.\nAlice and Bob now have a week to do the first bit of business. Sending the First Transaction Alice wrote an article and Bob likes it. He pays 0.1 BTC by doing the following: He generates a new transaction which states “I’m sending 0.1 BTC from the multi-sig address containing 10 BTC, and I’m sending 9.9 to myself”. Alongside it, he generates another transaction: “If the previous transaction is not broadcast within one week of signing it, then I send myself all 10 BTC from the multi-sig address”. He sends the transactions over to Alice for signing via Lightning Network nodes without sending them to the main blockchain. Remember: transactions are only finalized in the blockchain once both parties sign and broadcast them. Alice receives the transactions and checks conditions: 0.1 BTC for an article, OK, and a week to accept and get 0.1 BTC which means I have a week to send a new article in. 1526604101first-transaction-1024x886-1.jpg 1024x886 104 KB\nAlice doesn’t have to sign these new transactions. By not responding to them, she will trigger the week-long timeout which will return the money to Bob and cancel their arrangement. To keep the deal open, she needs to keep it “on the table” by just signing it and not broadcasting.\nThis “leaving on the table” is the part the Lightning Network nodes are taking care of. The software accepts and signs the transactions, but only on the LN layer, not the main Bitcoin blockchain. After a signature from Alice, the new state of the channel is the valid state. 1526604346alice-signs-1024x886.jpg 1024x886 106 KB\nThe transaction is, at any given point in time, immutable and the conditions described in it must be satisfied before any change can occur: either a week needs to expire, or the transaction needs to be broadcast by either Alice or Bob to finalize the latest distribution: 0.1 – 9.9 BTC. 4. Sending the Second Transaction\nAlice sends a new article three days later and it’s up to Bob to send a new 0.1 BTC. Seeing as it’s not possible to alter an existing transaction and Bob is unable to send another 0.1 into the same transaction as before, he generates a new one which says: “From the multi-sig address with 10 BTC I’m sending 0.2 BTC to Alice and 9.8 to me” and another “If Alice doesn’t sign and broadcast this state within a week, I get all 10 BTC”. 1526604545new-transaction-1024x886.jpg 1024x886 112 KB\nAlice now has the opportunity to either sign and broadcast the new transaction, thereby taking 0.2 BTC and finishing the work relationship, or continue with it, send more articles, and get more of such incremental transactions. She can also stay offline or idle for a week and lose it all. 1526604681alice-signs2-1024x886.jpg 1024x886 113 KB 5. Docking Pay\nIn the second article, Alice accused a competing company of plagiarism but didn’t do enough fact checking. This harmed the company’s reputation and Bob decides to dock 0.05 off her pay.\nBob generates a new transaction which says “From the multi-sig address with 10 BTC I’m sending 0.15 BTC to Alice and 9.85 BTC to myself” alongside a transaction saying “If Alice does not sign and broadcast this within a week, I get all 10 BTC”.\nAlice now has the following options: tolerate the pay cut and sign the transaction, continuing with the work broadcast the last signed transaction, the one for 0.2 BTC and get more money than Bob is currently offering, - but this would finish their relationship not respond and lose it all. 5a. Alice Cheats\nLet’s assume that because of the second article’s incident the relationship has been permanently damaged and Alice wants out but she already signed the 0.15 BTC transaction. Can she decide to sign the 0.2 BTC one instead that still on the table? 1526605499alice-older-1024x886.jpg 1024x886 133 KB\nThe LN is set up in such a way that signed (but not sent) transactions are ranked by age. Trying to send an older signed transaction is a punishable offense in the network which sends all the money from the multi-sig to the non-offending party.\nThis security system makes sure only the latest signed transaction can be broadcast, but has other implications as well: it requires the users to be constantly online to have their nodes be able to communicate with one another. To prevent users from having to be online at all times, the concept of Watchtowers was introduced, which we’ll explain in another post. 5b. Bob Cheats\nLet’s assume Bob is the cheater. Alice sent the third article, but Bob decides to punish her further by not paying at all. Alice has no idea whether or not she’ll ever be paid again, and wants to end the relationship. She can simply broadcast the last signed transaction and the 0.15 BTC will be sent to her. She’ll only lose as much money as she spent on writing a single (third) article. 1526605654latest-okay-1024x886.jpg 1024x886 131 KB\nBut what if this further offends Bob and he decides to send in another transaction in which he says “from the multi-sig address I’m sending 0 to Alice and 10 to me, and if she doesn’t sign and broadcast within a week it’s all mine anyway”.\nThis is where the aforementioned concept of signed and broadcast transactions comes into play. For an LN transaction to be valid, it needs to be signed by both parties. If it’s not signed, the last signed transaction is valid for broadcasting.\nThis makes Alice safe from ultimate fraud. 5c. All Good\nThe alternative that’s best for everyone involved is for Alice to do her job perfectly and Bob to send incremental transactions. Let’s say that Alice had another mistake or two and ended up earning 9.9 BTC, so that’s what Bob’s latest transaction says: 9.9 BTC to Alice, 0.1 BTC to him. Both are happy with this agreement and Alice signs and broadcasts this transaction.\nThe following occurs:\nAlice signs and broadcasts the transaction and it’s written to the blockchain. The transaction costs a transaction fee, docked from the total being paid out. Seeing as it’s only a single tx now, and not 100 of them, it’s only the cost of a single tx. Within ten minutes to an hour, the transaction will be finalized on the Bitcoin blockchain and the money will be transferred, the channel closed.\nIt’s important to note that, while this process sounds incredibly complex, they’re working on masking this complexity and hiding it from users. The payment channels are expected to be invisible in end-user software.\nNetwork and Routing In the example above, Alice and Bob have a clearly defined relationship with an end goal in mind. In theory, payment channels will stay open indefinitely because of routing. The idea is to connect several nodes and then route payments from one to the other, allowing payments to be sent to nodes you’re not connected with through nodes that are. The software should be able to find a way to get there.\nFor example, if Alice is working with Roko, a graphic designer, and Bob is working with him too, let’s assume Alice will need a 0.1 BTC graphic design work done. She can send this to Roko through Bob as long as Bob has at least 0.1 BTC in the channel open towards Roko, and Alice has 0.1 BTC in her balance towards Bob. Bob is running a mediator Lightning Network node in this case. 1526606417bob-to-roko-1024x367.jpg 1024x367 87.4 KB\nThe problem is that if someone already paid Roko through Bob and Bob no longer has a 0.1 BTC balance towards Roko, no one else can pay Roko through Bob; they need to find another route. This video explains it well.\nThis is an argument for keeping channels open indefinitely and permanently locking funds into the LN, because it’s assumed LN’s popularity will be so big anyone will be able to pay anyone anywhere. But all this has its own set of problems which we’ll cover in another post. Conclusion\nIn essence, the LN is a practical solution to some problems that currently don’t exist in the Bitcoin network.

In 2017, it was enormous news when China prohibited bit coin and the most recent news conveys a boycott by the Reserve Bank of India.\nThe issue is this news is horribly deceptive in light of the fact that it is essentially impractical to boycott bit coin or any cryptographic money besides.\nBit coin’s price a year ago was floating around $1,000 check while at this moment; it is in the $9,000 territory. This is regardless of the every one of the bans. This does not fit into any market rationale. However, that is the excellence of cryptographic forms of money. They don’t fit into customary administrative or managing an account structure. An alternate viewpoint is expected to see how they function and why they were made in any case.\nThis is on the grounds that bit coin and most cryptographic forms of money that keep running on Block chain innovation are decentralized. It implies they don’t keep running on one server or URL or IP address. These virtual monetary standards keep running on various hubs that can be claimed and keep running by anybody and are generally spread over the globe. There is no main issue for the administrations to assault or square.\nWhat has RBI done?\nAll in all, what is this ban? In the event that you read the RBI circular, they have never utilized the words “boycott” relating to bit coins. It has just kept any association directed by the national bank to manage organizations that have anything to do with digital forms of money. For all intents and purposes, this implies banks should stop stores and withdrawals to and from Indian rupee on digital money trades. This news spread generally and was viewed as a “prohibition on bit coin”.\nAside from this, the RBI has issued a few alerts about tricks and hazards identified with digital currencies. It had likewise said there would be a crackdown on the unlawful utilization of such cryptos.\nIn any case, dealers are as yet purchasing and offering digital currencies under a three-month notice period that was issued to all trades. Indeed, even from that point onward, the RBI or the administration can’t in fact boycott bit coin. Likewise, in the most recent occasion, the Delhi High Court has just tested this roundabout calling it “unlawful” and the peak bank needs to exhibit the premise of this limitation on banks to the court.\nDifferent nations like China and the US have effectively taken a stab at prohibiting trades, ICOs and mining of cryptographic forms of money. Despite the fact that those occasions in 2017 made the cost of bit coin fall incidentally, it went ahead to crest at $19,783 on December 17.\nBans in different nations like Japan have additionally brought about exchanges moving base to nations with friendlier large scale situations like Malta and Estonia. This has just brought about misfortune as far as charges for the legislatures of unfriendly nations.\nFor everybody who is holding bit coins, they would exchange it to a wallet or a global trade and after that offer it for USD and change over USD to INR. This fairly damages India since we won’t have the capacity to charge this salary if this is done in real money. Additionally, such a situation exists just until the point that the time fans can’t purchase much with digital money.\nHowever, there are destinations that are as of now tolerating digital currency as a method of payment. As more tokens develop and have genuine use, it will be hard to keep them under control. The purpose of making bitcoin\nA considerable measure of devotees of bitcoin considers it to be an approach to free ourselves from the control of governments and the money related framework. The fact of the matter is to dispose of the requirement for printing cash and all the more critically, banks. In this way, banks moving out of the condition is a reason for festivity in the group instead of seen as an awful thing?

The billionaire e-commerce guru said bitcoin is the bubble and not blockchain. He made these comments at the recently concluded World Intelligence Congress in Tianjin. Blockchain not Bitcoin Narrative Lives On\nDuring his address at the conference, Ma revealed that Alibaba focuses solely on blockchain implementation. According to Ma:\nBlockchain is now a hot word. First, blockchain is not a bubble, but Bitcoin is a bubble. Bitcoin is just a tiny application of blockchain. At least inside Alibaba, blockchain must be a solution that addresses the privacy and security issues in the digital era.\nThe Alibaba executive also went to say that blockchain was the true technological breakthrough that would drive the coming digital revolution . He identified the technology behind cryptos as having immense potential for all kinds of business processes. Ma also revealed that his company was exploring several blockchain applications. Alibaba is investing in data security and privacy solutions built on the blockchain. Such is the extent of the company’s activities in the arena that it presently holds the most number of blockchain-related patents in the world.\nMa is, however, dissatisfied with the current extent people are exploring the technology. According to Ma, too much emphasis is placed on blockchain as a money-making tool when it ought to be used as a value creation technology. He reiterated the need for the focus to be on improving the global business process rather than treating blockchain as a “gold mine.” Bitcoin is a Bubble\nOn the subject of bitcoin, Ma ironically called the world’s most popular and secure blockchain, i.e. Bitcoin, a bubble. In the past, the Alibaba founder had shown a lack of interest in Bitcoin. Has even previously said that he knows little about the crypto preferring only to focus on the blockchain. Most of the company’s efforts in the blockchain realm focus on e-commerce and public welfare protocols. In 2016, Alibaba launched a blockchain email repository , and in 2017, the company signed a partnership with PwC to develop a food traceability architecture based on the technology.\nWhile previously noncommittal to the Bitcoin argument, Ma’s recent comments put him with the likes of Warren Buffett , Charlie Munger, Bill Gates and many others. These notable business figures all have negative things to say about the world’s first cryptocurrency much to the chagrin of the Bitcoin enthusiasts.\nDo you agree with Jack Ma’s comments? Are you in agreement with folks who say only blockchain technology has value and not bitcoin?

The latest sign of the trend is a new television program that will begin airing next month on the Phoenix North America Chinese Channel .\nThe cryptocurrency and blockchain talk show entitled “ Bitcoin Talk Show “ will broadcast its initial episode the first week of June 2018 . Local Chinese investors and business owners will be invited to the Phoenix North America headquarters to attend the live taping where they will discuss cryptocurrency and blockchain technology with the company’s crypto analysts .\n“We believe Chinese investors are seeking cutting edge knowledge about blockchain and cryptocurrency, and this lighthearted, entertaining television program will accomplish just that. In addition, we seek to… gain recognition as a leader in Chinese language cryptocurrency and blockchain education,” says Warren Wang , CEO of ChineseInvestors.com, Inc.\nChineseInvestors.com , Inc. and Phoenix North America have worked out an arrangement for a one year contract to air the 22-minite Bitcoin Talk Show, once monthly. The pre-recorded talk show will initially be broadcast only to audiences in North America . Phoenix North America was recently included the list of free channels provided by Time Warner Cable, which means the Bitcoin Talk Show will gain exposure to over 500,000 Chinese people in North America.\n“With the upcoming launch of the Bitcoin Trading Academy and Bitcoin Talk show in June 2018 , we are implementing our strategic plan to provide Chinese investors with essential cryptocurrency investment education and trading tools,” says Wang.\n“As the Company continues its expansion into the cryptocurrency space , we anticipate a 30% increase in revenues from last year, resulting in three consecutive years of revenue growth since 2016.

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates.
