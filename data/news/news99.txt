The crowds blowing the hotel, luxury cars all over the place, the chauffeur was too busy parking too much cars. People coming from all over the world speaking languages ​​of various countries have packed the lobby of the hotel. The high-end hotel was crowed like a busy shopping mall on festival day. On the 6th floor of the hotel，here held the “International Blockchain Economic Conference” . Thousands of seats were full. People from all over the world have spent a lot of money on air tickets and hotels. Many people crowded on the aisle, as if they didn’t want to miss the wealth that would sweep the world this time. Dozens of cameras and media workers, as well as celebrities’ presence highlighted the importance of this conference. CEO of blockchain, rich Dubai businessman, JP Morgans, Citibanks and other business giants were impressive, but one of them was even more eye-catching: black hair, energetic, fluent English and talking with great confidence and power. His name is Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry. For this purpose, we made a special interview with him. Right side is Liao Wang Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry, comes from Jiangxi Province, China. He went to Dubai at 24 years old, when he was as poor as church mouse and used to sleep on corridor as he could not afford paying bed space . He founded “Atomic Properties LLC” at age 25, turning from extremely poverty to boss in a year time. Later he invested hundreds of properties in Dubai and became a self-made billionaire. He is a living legend of people becoming rich in Dubai, the famous luxury city. Now he is the CEO of Atoshi(a blockchain company ) and the initiator of International Monetary Freedom Organization. Selected below are some of Liao Wang’s speech: “China only banned exchanges and haven’t banned the legitimacy of OTC transactions and owning of Bitcoins, indicating that the government is still relatively friendly and open. The people of the world do not have to panic because of Chinese government’s ban on cryptocurrency exchanges. The Chinese government has adopted foreign exchange control policies to promote Chinese economy. If the existence of an exchange is allowed, many capitals and illegal money will flow out of China through cryptocurrency, thereby increasing the difficulty of foreign exchange control and affecting economic development. The Chinese government also controls US dollars in China. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be more restricted than what the government has done now. “Bitcoin may fall to $1 after rising $1 million per coin. Bitcoin has all the merits of gold and can be more easily easier divided into small pieces than gold, which makes it better for transactions than gold. At the same time, it also has all the advantages of the US dollar, but better than dollars. Limited at only 21million coins, Bitcoin will continue to go up to 20,000 US dollars, 100,000 US dollars, and even 1 million US dollars, but at the same time due to the rise of many new cryptocurrencies, Bitcoins dominance in all crytos will be reduced to below 5% .Because bitcoin technology was a decade ago, the rise of new cryptocurrency, technological upgrading and some mining pools have more than 51% of whole computing power, which may lead to the risk of attacking the bitcoin network. It will gradually decline, even less than 1 US dollar.” “The cryptocurrency 3.0 is still a baby in mama’s stomach. 3.0 should have a faster transaction speed, lower transaction cost, and be more decentralized. At the same time, it can run Dapp on a large scale and implement ipfs. He is leading atoshi team to do that. “Foreign reserves will gradually shift from US dollar to cryptos, because US dollar can be printed at almost 0 costs, and the wealth of countries that hold US dollar as foreign reserves is constantly diluted and devalued. People of the world are not happy with that and demand a change now. “Dubai’s blockchain business environment is very good: Dubai ruler HH Sheik Mohammad Al Maktoum himself said: “The adoption of blockchain technology will help Dubai for the future challenges.” Dubai’s Crown Prince HH Sheik Hamdan launched “Dubai Blockchain Strategy” project and established Smart Dubai Office. Dr. Aisha Bin Bashr, Director of the Smart Dubai Office, said: “A lot of countries are still arguing about the advantages and disadvantages of the blockchain. We have already embraced blockchain to make Dubai the capital of blockchain.” “Dubai has a 2020 paperless city plan. By 2020,50% of the government will adopt blockchain, saving an estimated 77 million man-hours per year and 440 million sheets of paper. Departments including the Immigration Department, the Ministry of Finance, DEWA, and Land Department must all use blockchain technology, such as real estate registration……” Liao Wang’s speech was straight to the point. He had a very eyes-opening understanding of the crypto currency. Huge applauses came like waves after his speech. We wish Liao Wang and his Atoshi blockchain a big success on the world’s stage.

The market maker and regular CNBC contributor told the network’s post-market show Fast Money yesterday that “Bitcoin is sort of becoming the new VIX, in sort of getting ahead of credit risk in the banking industry.”\nVIX, which stands for the CBOE Volatility Index, is a popular and trusted measurement of both volatility and fear in the traditional financial market. It utilizes S&P 500 stock options prices and is often referred to as the stock market’s “fear gauge.”\nStutland, however, thinks Bitcoin might be better than the VIX. He explained:\nThere is huge correlation right now between VIX and bitcoin 30 days ago, 30 trading days ago, that is starting to measure out credit risk in the market. That’s what cryptocurrency is becoming. It’s becoming a way to sort of de-risk yourself from credit risk in the banking industry.\nStutland bases his assessment on the fact that the Bitcoin and greater cryptocurrency market is still unregulated and allows for the open and easy transfer of capital, noting:\nBitcoin is a way to for investors to basically move their money off the balance sheets of banks and into their own wallets. Essentially storing their money under their pillow in the form of virtual currency.\nStutland also made note of the fact that increased credit from banks facilitates caution on the part of investors, claiming:\nAs credit risk increases we get more volatility in the market.\nAs noted by CNBC, the VIX reached highs of 18.39 yesterday, up from lows of 12.59 on Friday.\nTuesday was decidedly bearish for all three major indexes, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping almost 500 points at its lowest.\nOn the flip side, the Bitcoin market saw a bounceback from what had been a brutally bearish downtrend. The market leader is currently trading, at the time of this writing, at $7,520.49, up 5.42 percent over the last 24 hours.\nWhen Bitcoin moves, altcoins follow. Many major market players in the cryptocurrency space saw healthy gains yesterday, with Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS , Stellar, Cardano, IOTA, and TRON all up between 10 and 20 percent over the last 24 hours.\nDo you think Bitcoin is a better indicator of fear in the marketplace than the CBOE Volatility Index?

This is $100 less than where it stood yesterday afternoon, though the currency was trading for as high as $7,500 during Tuesday’s evening hours.\nThe bitcoin arena is something of a mixed bag. For example, China’s president Xi Jinping recently endorsed blockchain technology, stating that it has the potential to heal global economies. Speaking at a recent conference with the Chinese Academy of Sciences this week, Jinping said that the advantages of the blockchain are crucial to the development of the 21st century, and he’s hoping for elevated adoption in China.\n“Ever since the start of the 21st century, a new generation of industrial revolution is substantially reshaping the global economic structure with artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and blockchain constantly making application breakthroughs,” he stated.\nThis marks a serious shift in opinion, as up to this point, China has been one of the strictest countries when it comes to cryptocurrency and blockchain regulation.\nOn the other hand, popular South Korean digital currency exchange Bithumb has announced it will proceed with a trading ban in 11 countries starting in mid-June. Some of the nations included are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Ethiopia, Serbia, and Trinidad and Tobago. The exchange is eager to enforce anti-money laundering laws ever since its offices were raided in early January, and wants to ensure its customers are safe and protected.\nThese countries, along with five others, do not possess valid legislation that stands against money laundering and other illicit activities in the financial space, according to company executives. All accounts stemming from these countries will be shut down by June 21. Upbit – South Korea’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency exchange – was also raided in April on suspicious of embezzlement, while four executives from other trading platforms in South Korea have been arrested and charged with fraud.\nIt is unclear if the announcement bore any negative consequences on the price and caused the drop from yesterday’s high. The good news is that analysts say recovery is likely imminent, and investors have a lot to look forward to in the coming weeks. One source, for example, says that today’s small , but noticeable price drop, is part of a consolidation process after a significantly aggressive move that took the price up by roughly $400 yesterday from the previous day. Bitcoin has been trading with a narrowing range, but market trends still show it moving higher as the pressure from recent sell-offs finally begins to subside.\nA heavy supply zone is witnessed at the $7,600 mark, while resistance is likely to occur at $7,560. However, key support has moved up to $7,470.\nAnother source suggests that bitcoin’s newfound uptrends can be attributed to political activity in Italy and southern Europe. The country’s constitutional crisis and fears of the nation leaving the Euro-zone ultimately led to global stocks and the euro falling overnight, while the U.S. dollar and various cryptocurrencies appear to be gaining in value and substance. It is unclear if this is coincidence or correlation, but bitcoin is showing future bull behavior as Italy undergoes serious financial change, and many investors are jumping into the foray without asking questions.

Some disturbing headlines could be read during the last couple of months:\n“Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity a year than Ireland” ( The Guardian ),\n“Bitcoin Is Massively Polluting the Earth – And We Should All Be Scared” ( Global Citizen ).\nSome of the numbers stated in these articles were vastly exaggerated, and some of the headlines are just plain FUD. Yet, a kernel of truth remains.\nThe electricity used to power the Bitcoin network is produced mainly by fossil fuels. Mostly by coal. To be exact, the worldwide energy mix consists of 87 percent fossil fuels. When one network presumably consumes north of 70 TWh this year, that means a lot of pollution. This is equivalent to 168 trillion miles driven with a gasoline-fueled car.\nDigiconomist’s Alex de Vries just analyzed one bitcoin mine in China whose carbon footprint is “simply shocking,” emitting carbon dioxide at the same rate as a Boeing 747. One could read during the month that an Australian company has signed a deal to provide energy to a cryptocurrency miner by reopening a coal power plant.\nbitcoinClean is here to change this!\nbitcoinClean, a bitcoin hard fork, is the first coin mined only with renewable energy. It relies on a network that is powered by Solar, Wind, Hydro, Thermal, Biogas or Tidal energy. Every node must undergo a peer review to participate in the network.\nThe Bitcoin hard fork was successfully conducted on April 18, 2018, 5:26:13 PM (UTC), Block #518.800.\n“How does this idea work?” Well, here is the explanation.\nbitcoinClean introduces an algorithm called proof-of-greenness. PoG works like this; if Bob wants to mine bitcoinClean he has to convince other miners that he uses only renewable energy. So Bob publishes some documents and photos about his setup and a utility bill from his green-energy provider.\nAlice, John, and Mark see that and upvote his proof. At about three to five upvotes Bob can start mining. How many upvotes Bob needs depends on the Impact Alice, John and Mark have. Impact is another aspect of the proof of greenness algorithm.\nAs a miner gains impact his vote on other miners gets more weight. Impact starts with literally zero, which means your vote doesn’t count and goes up to five, meaning your vote counts five full votes. (technical detail: the tan(h) function is used here, so five can never be fully reached). Advertisement advertisement\nbitcoinClean wants people to talk to each other. It requires miners to look at the way other miners operate, and then make an educated decision if they trust this miner to use renewable energy. bitcoinClean has no moderation. No central authority. Only its miners govern what standards they deem acceptable. The Impact score each address has incentivizes miners to make a good decision about each other, because if a miners vote get rebutted too often, his impact goes back to zero, and his votes stop counting.\nbitcoinClean will help cryptocurrencies to become drivers for clean energy use and innovation. The next step in financial independence cannot come at a huge environmental cost – this is simply unacceptable. bitcoinClean Exchanges and Supporters:\nbitcoinClean is already trading on YoBit.net , on Nebula end of June and soon on Exrates .\nSupporters like Miguel Forbes ( Forbes Magazine) are pushing the project; many green miners are already mining bitcoinClean, such as Coin Factory and HydroMiner, both cutting-edge green mining operations.\nJoin the community via Telegram or visit the bitcoinClean Medium channel , Twitter , the bitcoinClean fund , and the website for more information.\nbitcoinClean’s source code can be found and contributed to at GitHub .\nWe want to make bitcoinClean the currency of the future for everyone who cares.\nThis is a paid press release.

It has already seen patients who are totally consumed with trading in the currencies - including some who were not already suffering other forms of addiction.\nDr Mark Griffiths, Professor of Behavioural Addiction at Nottingham Trent University, said the addictions were \"a subtype of online day-trading addiction. I see these as akin to a gambling addiction\".\nCastle Craig gambling therapist Chris Burn told news.com.au cryptocurrency trading was a fast growing activity.\n\"It is a form of gambling [and] people gamble on all kinds of things which makes cryptocurrency trading exciting. Compulsive gamblers like it - it's mysterious, not really regulated and you can make huge gains - and huge losses - in a single day.\"\nAnd that's where the havoc begins.\n\"People dive in because they don't want to miss out on a good thing and they start putting money in without thinking about the consequences. But the reality is [cryptocurrency] trading is a fascinating idea, but it can do a great deal of harm.\"\nIn that regard, it wasn't surprising people were taken in by the bitcoin craze.\n\"I think it's an escape from reality. People like the excitement and that you can do it 24 hours a day and [sit there] and watch the screen and watch making a profit - or not - and that goes on and on. That's what a compulsive gambler wants.\" A UK hospital has begun offering treatment specifically\nThere were parallels with pokie machines, and Mr Burn predicted there would be a rise in the number of bitcoin addicts in the months and years ahead.\n\"It provides excitement and an escape from reality...It's a classic bubble situation and the way we see that developing, it could well [get worse] quite soon.\"\nIt was relatively easy to start bitcoin trading which was dangerous for young people in particular.\n\"It's relatively easy...you go through the motions...you don't know who you are dealing with but anyone can get on and it's relatively easy.\"\nBitcoin was particularly dangerous because people were being seduced by the idea of making it rich quick online, where they believed there was a fortune to be made.\nThere are around 13 million people across the world trading in the system.\n\"A lot of people hear about something like this [and] they go for a gamble because they don't want to miss out on the next good thing - a lot of addictive behaviour comes from computers and the internet. This is another specific example that is really, really dangerous.\"\nThe situation \"just goes bad\" from there.\nThe patients he had worked with had been desperate and on the verge of suicide.\n\"They are in desperate need of help and are isolated. People don't realise if you spend 14 hours or so a day on a computer doing this sort of thing it has really negative consequences on other aspects of your life.\"\nBitcoin trading therefore was a very modern take on an old problem. That means often people had no idea they were at risk until it was too late.\n\"Anybody who is involved with cryptocurrency trading who thinks they could have a problem, chances are they probably do.\"\nThe moment of realisation was depressingly familiar.\n\"It's usually when they run out of money and realise there is no way forward. Until then, people convince themselves the next bet would make it okay. We would all do that with any sort of addictive behaviour if there were no consequences.\"\nCastle Craig has treated over 10,000 patients for various addictions since it opened in 1988, and claims the majority have gone on to achieve long-term abstinent recovery.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrew koubaridis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "castle craig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris burn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark griffiths", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nottingham trent university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "castle craig hospital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T16:50:17.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ba6d551dbb4c981efbad02af0b7dc8e42160a54b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tf47TKoCV9yiJEV54IoB_9rl.DEjJyk4nR0W3rNszK4Rwwhe0nxcXIpXp247h4vnqGu9fvDCCpFTN6NTJsfEWwXWvY4C7L..IBIWhG.nOyun7Y0DFB9o5H8wfhQ3w1BkKAA--", "site_full": "www.ccn.com", "site": "ccn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin May Not Be Around In 100 Years: Nobel Laureate Economist Robert Shiller", "title_full": "Bitcoin May Not Be Around In 100 Years: Nobel Laureate Economist Robert Shiller", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/robert-shiller.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ba6d551dbb4c981efbad02af0b7dc8e42160a54b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tf47TKoCV9yiJEV54IoB_9rl.DEjJyk4nR0W3rNszK4Rwwhe0nxcXIpXp247h4vnqGu9fvDCCpFTN6NTJsfEWwXWvY4C7L..IBIWhG.nOyun7Y0DFB9o5H8wfhQ3w1BkKAA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin May Not Be Around In 100 Years: Nobel Laureate Economist Robert Shiller", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "robert shiller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shiller", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "yale university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T20:34:27.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7f764b35a4d8bf58df1e69e1a01c4682514fe6a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQQGcQG3snF55xlPEs2jYuA7EmaB0sFZ95BYHuQQPzrxw1gmVt5Zq0O26Swxf1CjWHlpRFLr1C0rZ399cQZU9PSjxD8fll7X.VgIiTwLrInSXvlULq5dDds", "site_full": "www.bnn.ca", "site": "bnn.ca", "site_section": "https://www.bnn.ca/news-wire", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "News Wire", "title": "Bitcoin Heads Toward $7,000 as Pain Returns on Gloomy Technicals", "title_full": "Bitcoin Heads Toward $7,000 as Pain Returns on Gloomy Technicals -", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1085166!/fileimage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/photographer-chris-ratcliffe-bloomberg.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 38530, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7f764b35a4d8bf58df1e69e1a01c4682514fe6a7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQQGcQG3snF55xlPEs2jYuA7EmaB0sFZ95BYHuQQPzrxw1gmVt5Zq0O26Swxf1CjWHlpRFLr1C0rZ399cQZU9PSjxD8fll7X.VgIiTwLrInSXvlULq5dDds", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bloomberg News", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Heads Toward $7,000 as Pain Returns on Gloomy Technicals", "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin’s in a world of pain, again.\nThe biggest cryptocurrency has renewed its flirtation with the $7,000 price level. The slide has helped to also send other digital assets into retreat, with Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin all lower on Wednesday.\nSince failing to regain the psychologically important $10,000 level on May 4, it has closed lower in New York in 12 out of 17 sessions.

The investigation involves a cryptocurrency trading company which allegedly defrauded investors of R1 billion. By Telegram Another Bitcoin Trading Company Crashes\nThis could be the end for a company called Bitcaw Trading Company (BTC) as it faces the panel of the South African authorities. An investment fraud which was said to have been targeting specific individuals was traced to the company. A search for the company on the internet showed that its activities had been suspended. Well, this is BTC joining the long list of the bitcoin exchanges who are no longer with us. South Africans Lost Millions of Dollars to Cryptocurrency Scam\nCrisis looms as 28,000 people lost about $80 million which is over a billion in the South African currency. In the beginning, the investors had a good time as they were getting paid a good rate which superseded what most trading companies offer. That is the strategy which BTC used to lure its investors. CCN reported that the company presented an offer where you could make 2% per day, 14% per week and 50% interest per month. Isn’t that tempting? Not All That Glitters Is Gold Advertisement\nThe attractive returns allegedly came every Mondays until some investors suddenly stopped receiving payments. This could remind you of some Ponzi schemes which have failed in the past. You all know how Ponzi works, but you’d agree that crypto is a lot different. The common risks that come with investing in cryptocurrencies are technical failures, volatility, and competition from other currencies to mention a few. The case with the South African Crypto Firm is, however, on another level. More Woes for Investors\nAccording to a report that surfaced online in March, BTC Global was launched in September 2017 by a trader named Steven Twain. Steven Twain, who no one currently knows his whereabouts, was noted as the company’s ‘primary trader’ on BTC’s website. As we speak, the website also stated that there is nothing that can be done to help victims until Steven is found. Steven’s contact details are accessible to anyone who wants more information. However, Reuters contacted Twain’s email address but received no response. Law Enforcement Urged Victims to Open Up\nThis case would be duly investigated by the Serious Economic Offences Unit which shows just how grave the felony is. “ This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they’ve lost money,” police investigator Yolisa Matakata said. A press release stated that the police website provided a list containing contacts which people can report to. Also, all information provided to the police will be kept confidential. A Warning to Every Other Investor Out There\nBy March 2018 BTC Global had already scammed more than $50 million from cryptocurrency investors. Several reports suggested that investors “should have seen that BTC Global was a scam from a mile away.” Their unrealistically high returns is a sign seen in other cryptocurrency scams. Shouldn’t this have alerted anyone? At this point, we can say the urge of wanting something for nearly nothing is truly an epidemic.\nFollow us on Twitter | Telegram | Facebook Featured Image from Shutterstock.

Patientory Stiftung brings these industry leaders together at its Inaugural Blockchain in Healthcare Summit – North America on May 31, 2018. At that time it will also launch and make available the private, permissioned blockchain testnet network, PTOYNet.\n“Patientory Stiftung foresees an exciting future for blockchain in the healthcare industry and is thrilled to merge the benefits of the EEA and its other members with what will happen next,” said Mohsen Shafaei, Managing Director of the Patientory Stiftung. “The EEA’s resources will play an integral role in making our vision a reality and we look forward to learning about Ethereum and leveraging its technology to benefit everyone.”\nWith more than 500 member companies, the EEA membership base represents a wide variety of business sectors from every region of the world, including technology, banking, government, healthcare, energy, pharmaceuticals, marketing, and insurance. The EEA’s industry-focused, member-driven working groups are each tasked with creating and delivering specific advancements to the development and use of ethereum-based technologies.\nAbout The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance The EEA is an industry-supported, not-for-profit established to build, promote, and broadly support Ethereum-based technology best practices, open standards, and open-source reference architectures. The EEA is helping to evolve Ethereum into an enterprise-grade technology, providing research and development in a range of areas, including privacy, confidentiality, scalability, and security. The EEA is also investigating hybrid architectures that span both permissioned and public Ethereum networks as well as industry-specific application layer working groups.\nEEA will collectively develop open industry standards and facilitate collaboration with its member base and is open to any members of the Ethereum community who wish to participate. This open-source framework will enable the mass adoption at a depth and breadth otherwise unachievable in individual corporate silos and provide insight into the future of scalability, privacy, and confidentiality of the public Ethereum permissionless network. For additional information about joining EEA, please reach out to membership@entethalliance.org or visit www.entethalliance.org.\nAbout Patientory Stiftung The Patientory Stiftung, a global nonprofit healthcare blockchain organization connects healthcare industry adopters of the PTOY blockchain.

The crowds blowing the hotel, luxury cars all over the place, the chauffeur was too busy parking too much cars. People coming from all over the world speaking languages ​​of various countries have packed the lobby of the hotel. The high-end hotel was crowed like a busy shopping mall on festival day. On the 6th floor of the hotel，here held the “International Blockchain Economic Conference” . Thousands of seats were full. People from all over the world have spent a lot of money on air tickets and hotels. Many people crowded on the aisle, as if they didn’t want to miss the wealth that would sweep the world this time. Dozens of cameras and media workers, as well as celebrities’ presence highlighted the importance of this conference. CEO of blockchain, rich Dubai businessman, JP Morgans, Citibanks and other business giants were impressive, but one of them was even more eye-catching: black hair, energetic, fluent English and talking with great confidence and power. His name is Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry. For this purpose, we made a special interview with him. Right side is Liao Wang Liao Wang, the richest Chinese in Dubai Blockchain industry, comes from Jiangxi Province, China. He went to Dubai at 24 years old, when he was as poor as church mouse and used to sleep on corridor as he could not afford paying bed space . He founded “Atomic Properties LLC” at age 25, turning from extremely poverty to boss in a year time. Later he invested hundreds of properties in Dubai and became a self-made billionaire. He is a living legend of people becoming rich in Dubai, the famous luxury city. Now he is the CEO of Atoshi(a blockchain company ) and the initiator of International Monetary Freedom Organization. Selected below are some of Liao Wang’s speech: “China only banned exchanges and haven’t banned the legitimacy of OTC transactions and owning of Bitcoins, indicating that the government is still relatively friendly and open. The people of the world do not have to panic because of Chinese government’s ban on cryptocurrency exchanges. The Chinese government has adopted foreign exchange control policies to promote Chinese economy. If the existence of an exchange is allowed, many capitals and illegal money will flow out of China through cryptocurrency, thereby increasing the difficulty of foreign exchange control and affecting economic development. The Chinese government also controls US dollars in China. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be more restricted than what the government has done now. “Bitcoin may fall to $1 after rising $1 million per coin. Bitcoin has all the merits of gold and can be more easily easier divided into small pieces than gold, which makes it better for transactions than gold. At the same time, it also has all the advantages of the US dollar, but better than dollars. Limited at only 21million coins, Bitcoin will continue to go up to 20,000 US dollars, 100,000 US dollars, and even 1 million US dollars, but at the same time due to the rise of many new cryptocurrencies, Bitcoins dominance in all crytos will be reduced to below 5% .Because bitcoin technology was a decade ago, the rise of new cryptocurrency, technological upgrading and some mining pools have more than 51% of whole computing power, which may lead to the risk of attacking the bitcoin network. It will gradually decline, even less than 1 US dollar.” “The cryptocurrency 3.0 is still a baby in mama’s stomach. 3.0 should have a faster transaction speed, lower transaction cost, and be more decentralized. At the same time, it can run Dapp on a large scale and implement ipfs. He is leading atoshi team to do that. “Foreign reserves will gradually shift from US dollar to cryptos, because US dollar can be printed at almost 0 costs, and the wealth of countries that hold US dollar as foreign reserves is constantly diluted and devalued. People of the world are not happy with that and demand a change now. “Dubai’s blockchain business environment is very good: Dubai ruler HH Sheik Mohammad Al Maktoum himself said: “The adoption of blockchain technology will help Dubai for the future challenges.” Dubai’s Crown Prince HH Sheik Hamdan launched “Dubai Blockchain Strategy” project and established Smart Dubai Office. Dr. Aisha Bin Bashr, Director of the Smart Dubai Office, said: “A lot of countries are still arguing about the advantages and disadvantages of the blockchain. We have already embraced blockchain to make Dubai the capital of blockchain.” “Dubai has a 2020 paperless city plan. By 2020,50% of the government will adopt blockchain, saving an estimated 77 million man-hours per year and 440 million sheets of paper. Departments including the Immigration Department, the Ministry of Finance, DEWA, and Land Department must all use blockchain technology, such as real estate registration……” Liao Wang’s speech was straight to the point. He had a very eyes-opening understanding of the crypto currency. Huge applauses came like waves after his speech. We wish Liao Wang and his Atoshi blockchain a big success on the world’s stage.

Fees\nAs entrepreneur Alistair Milne noted this week, Bitcoin transactions fees have dropped to their lowest levels in seven years . Not since 2011 was it was so cheap to use Bitcoin, when the network was a tiny fraction of its current size and value.\nBitcoin has even started beating altcoin Bitcoin Cash on network fees – something which the latter’s proponents continue to hold up as one of its major features.\nIn future, increasing expansion of the Lightning Network is expected to drive fees below 1 satoshi per byte, keeping long-term transaction costs at a nearly negligible amount. SegWit\nPrior to Lightning’s mainstream adoption, however, 2018 saw mass uptake of Segregated Witness (‘SegWit’) technology, which for Bitcoin users also means lower fees and faster confirmation times.\nAs Bitcoinist reported earlier this month, SegWit transactions now make up a greater proportion of the total sent each week than ever before – almost 40% . Hashrate\nBitcoin’s hashrate also climbed to its largest in history in May. Data from Blockchain republished on Twitter by trader and commentator CryptoYoda impressed users, with theories including miners mining at a smaller profit in order to generate long-term holdings.\nThat theory echoes research presented last month suggesting Bitcoin could be at the start of another protracted ‘HODL’ period. in the meanwhile…\no Bitcoin Fee at its Cheapesto SegWit Adoption Rises to All-Time Higho Hashrate Steadily Climbing pic.twitter.com/DUtwJJL6PN\nhttps://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Banks\nLastly, banking failures dominate the headlines this week, with Italy and the eurozone under political pressure and Australia and New Zealand lenders both suffering mass technical outages which cut customers off from their funds.\nAs Reuters reported May 26, National Australia Bank and the Bank of New Zealand were initially unable to confirm whether the problems were related or a coincidence. The source later turned out to be a power outage.\nBy comparison, the Bitcoin network has experienced 99.9923% uptime since it was launched back on January 3rd, 2009.\nWhat do you think are the best reasons to stay bullish on Bitcoin?

While we’d expect many motherboards coming from ASUS to be aimed at gamers or mainstream PC builders, this new one is all about cryptocurrency mining. Say hello to the ASUS H370 Mining Master motherboard.\nThis is actually a follow up to the B250 Mining Expert, which was released last year. In its announcement today, ASUS said that the B250 performed well beyond expectations, with excellent sales that proved there’s a space in the market for motherboards centered around cryptocurrency mining. The H370 Mining Master, therefore, is a refinement of what ASUS started with the B250.\nWhat makes the H370 different from your usual motherboard? All you need to do is look at an image of the hardware and you’ll know right away, as its 20 PCIe-over-USB ports definitely stand out. With these, ASUS is looking to simplify the process of connecting multiple GPUs to your motherboard.\nTypically, mining rigs are built around multiple graphics cards that are connected to the motherboard using GPU risers. These risers provide external PCIe slots for your various GPUs, and many of them transfer data over a USB cable that connects to your motherboard’s PCIe x1 slot. ASUS is removing a step from that process – instead of attaching an x1 connector to the end of your riser’s USB cable, you can instead plug the cable directly into one of the PCIe-over-USB ports on the H370.\nThis change accomplishes a few things. It saves on space, allowing your motherboard to host more external PCIe connections, and it removes the need for x1 connectors entirely, cutting down on the number of parts required for your mining rig and providing a more sturdy connection between your risers and your motherboard. Have a look at the full list of specifications below.\nSize – ATX, 12”x9.1” Socket – LGA 1151 for Intel 8th Gen Core / Pentium / Celeron processors Memory – 2 x DIMMs (max. 32GB), DDR4 2666 / 2400 / 2133 MHz, Non-ECC, unbuffered memory PCIe – 1 x PCIe x16 slot Storage – 2 x Serial ATA 6.0 Gb/s connectors Networking – 1 x Intel Gigabit LAN USB GPU Riser Ports – 20 x Vertical USB ports over PCIe USB Ports – 6 x USB 3.1 Gen 1, 4 x USB 2.0 / 1.1 ports Other Ports – 1 x COM header\nASUS is also launching the H370 Mining Master with “a suite of diagnostic features designed to make your platform easier to manage.” GPU State Detection plays an important role in these diagnostic features, scanning your system on start up to determine which of those PCIe-over-USB ports are empty, which are connected to an operational GPU, and which (if any) of your GPUs are experiencing problems.\nAll in all, it sounds like this motherboard will allow you utilize a lot of horsepower while simplifying the process of building your mining rig, and that can only be a good thing. It’ll be a while longer before it arrives on shelves here in North America, as ASUS is currently targeting a Q3 2018 release. No word on pricing just yet, but we can probably expect it to be priced similarly (if not a little higher) than the B250.

This week’s highlighted important bearish trend line with resistance at $0.6000 was breached on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair is now placed nicely above the $0.6000 level and it could accelerate gains in the near term.\nRipple price started a nice upside move against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. XRP/USD is now back above $0.6000 and is currently trading with a bullish bias. Ripple Price Trend\nIt seems like there was a strong buying interest around $0.5500 in Ripple price against the US Dollar. The price started a solid upside move from the $0.5460 low and moved above the $0.5800 resistance level. There was also a break above the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $0.6105 high to $0.5460 low. It opened the doors for more gains and the price broke a key resistance at $0.6000.\nMore importantly, this week’s highlighted important bearish trend line with resistance at $0.6000 was breached on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair settled above $0.6000 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It traded as high as $0.6265 and is currently trading nicely above $0.6100. If the current bias remains intact, there could be an upside move was above the $0.6250 level in the near term. The next key resistance for buyers is near the $0.6500 level.\nLooking at the chart , if the price corrects lower, the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $0.5460 low to $0.6265 high may act as a support. However, the most important support is now at $0.6000 and the 100 hourly SMA.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is slowly moving in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now well above the 60 level.\nMajor Support Level – $0.6000 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T11:22:17.055+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "203d99311945188940c701ee1d42f5d4b7ec1235", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS1dEsn8p2t0TjN8p1zUtUnQ-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "title_full": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "203d99311945188940c701ee1d42f5d4b7ec1235", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS1dEsn8p2t0TjN8p1zUtUnQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nBecome the person, who referred the largest number of new users till the end of June 1, 2019 and we will give you 0.3 BTC.

Yes, I got the money but no satisfaction because ultimate satisfaction comes from starting a company and building it to realise the vision for which it was started,” he said.

cryptocurrencies such bitcoin and ethereum could make monetary policy changes a more effective tool, according to Bank of England research.\nThe Bank has recently released a flurry of research weighing the potential risks and benefits of central bank digital currency (CBDC), with the potential to revolutionise monetary policy.\n“A CBDC that is a close – but not perfect – substitute for bank deposits may strengthen the transmission of monetary policy changes to the real economy”, according to a blog post published today by Bank researchers Jack Meaning and Ben Dyson summarising recent research.\nRead more : BoE economists make \"material step forward\" in central bank crypto debate\nThe Bank says it is not currently planning to issue its own digital currency, which Sweden’s Riksbank is actively considering.\nNevertheless, the Bank has undertaken a significant body of work investigating how a central bank digital currency would work in practice, including a separate research paper which claimed an important “step forward” in the design of a currency which would not leave commercial bank vulnerable to a run.\nThe research on monetary policy transmission shows that a currency which pays interest on balances, alongside offering payment services, would allow the Bank of England to gain greater control over monetary policy.\nRead more : Fed official warns bitcoin could pose a threat to financial stability\n“With careful design choices, a CBDC need not be disruptive to the conduct of monetary policy,” the researchers wrote.\nCommercial banks would be forced to react more quickly than they do currently to raise or lower interest rates in line with the central bank rate to avoid losing deposits.\nThe authors said: “This would result in an increase in both the strength and speed of pass-through from the policy rate to these other interest rates, especially as technology and regulatory changes make it easier to switch balances from one account to another.”\nThe prospective currency would also greatly improve the functioning of quantitative easing, the asset purchases used by central banks to stimulate demand when interest rates cannot fall any further.\nA digital currency would remove the need for banks as an intermediary for buying the government bonds used in quantitative easing, the researchers said: “The central bank could pay for assets from non-banks directly with central bank money (CBDC), by-passing the banking sector altogether.”\nRead more : Janet Yellen: QE's day will come again\nFull story: BoE bitcoin rival would

Many of these people bought Bitcoin simply because it was suggested by those of us that understand the technology and it's power. Now, today, there are many of these same people that have both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core after the fork, and they still do not use it. They are confused by complexity of all this fork talk and are not even sure what to do. Some people are happy just sitting on their Bitcoin because it has done well for them to date and they don't see a reason or need for the change. Many know that they should switch from Bitcoin Core to Bitcoin Cash, but haven't figured out how to make the change. Yes, I believe that there is a large amount of value sitting in Bitcoin simply because moving it is a challenge. This is my experience from years of introducing people to Bitcoin, and revisiting the subject after the fork. It is my belief that Bitcoin has a perceived value of $7500, but the real cost is $1000. The attributes and real benefits of Bitcoin continue on in Bitcoin Cash. This is what the early adopters bought.\nSo...\nBitcoin is on sale today: 80\\% OFF!\nThis is a message that needs to be reiterated. The market believes Bitcoin is worth $7500 today, but the real technology, the real attributes and benefits are selling for $1000 today. People can get Bitcoin for an 80% discount. The underlying technology and economic incentives that make Bitcoin the trustless machine are on sale now.

Earlier today, Cointelegraph reported that leading Chinese cyber security company, Qihoo 360, detected a number of vulnerabilities on the EOS blockchain network to remote attacks on EOS nodes. The launch of the EOS mainnet, which was originally set for June 2, has reportedly been postponed until the vulnerability is fixed.\nLast week, blockchain venture capitalist Spencer Bogart predicted that Bitcoin will be trading “at least” above $10,000 by the end of 2018. Bogart said he would sell altcoins like Cardano, TRON, IOTA, and NEO, because he thinks they are “over-promising and under-delivering.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitcoinschannel.com/category/bitcoin/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cardano", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cointelegraph ethereum price index total", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinmarketcap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ada", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T05:04:14.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b2a2aff523ad2afb6b61df0ae8b2913e33dc0741", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zBDEauHdefDlcDL.Laxwtq23hl6tMcI8fucMDn2TdkcaTuCwwj_rvMU0NybgChNvHAVqYe0ABu7gnGxx.o2sT7I1eCS4ePnyZp2hJn4C8Ae5EByw91bdbaM6umLvi0V9k.9r1deniEo03mw7bivBTpI", "site_full": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Ahmedabad News, Latest Ahmedabad News Headlines &amp; Live Updates - Times of India", "title": "Bitconnect: Bitconnect promised 1% daily return on Bitcoin investments: CID | Ahmedabad News", "title_full": "Bitconnect: Bitconnect promised 1% daily return on Bitcoin investments: CID | Ahmedabad News - Times of India", "published": "2018-05-30T02:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.048, "main_image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-64376639,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1106883,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b2a2aff523ad2afb6b61df0ae8b2913e33dc0741", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zBDEauHdefDlcDL.Laxwtq23hl6tMcI8fucMDn2TdkcaTuCwwj_rvMU0NybgChNvHAVqYe0ABu7gnGxx.o2sT7I1eCS4ePnyZp2hJn4C8Ae5EByw91bdbaM6umLvi0V9k.9r1deniEo03mw7bivBTpI", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Parth Shastri", "published": "2018-05-30T02:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitconnect: Bitconnect promised 1% daily return on Bitcoin investments: CID | Ahmedabad News", "text": "AHMEDABAD: The state police’s CID (crime), investigating the second phase of Bitcoin case with probe against Surat-based realtor Shailesh Bhatt for extortion of 2000-plus Bitcoins from promoters of Bitconnect, has decoded the functioning of Bitconnect firm. The investigating agency has also started probe into the digital wallets and bank accounts associated with the firm.\nAccording to CID officials, questioning of Nikunj Bhatt, Shailesh Bhatt’s nephew, revealed how the cryptocurrency exchange functioned. The firm was managed in Surat by Divyesh Darji and Satish Kumbhani whereas Dhaval Mavani was looking after transactions. Bitconnect has its registered office in London in the UK. Primary probe, however, has revealed that the address was just a front and there is no office on the said address.\nCID has recovered 12 Bitcoins from Nikunj out of the 2,000-plus Bitcoin haul which, along with the Bitcoins recovered so far in first phase, will be converted into Indian rupees and will be transferred to a nationalized bank.\n“Apart from India, the firm has its presence in Indonesia, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Singapore and the US. We have identified a few accounts associated with the transactions and have intimated the respective banks about it,” said an official.\nTalking about how the firm functioned, officials said that the promoters were active in sale and purchase of cryptocurrency since 2016 where they aggressively promoted Bitcoins as a good investment option in Diamond City and elsewhere. The firm is suspected to have formalized in beginning of 2017 and soon after they started Ponzi scheme of very high returns on investment.\n“The promoters used to mention a special software that used to decide on low and high points of Bitcoin for purchase and sale respectively. The difference used to be earning and the firm had promised 365% annual return or 1% daily,” said an official.\nIf the lure was not enough, the firm also had investment slabs. If the investor gets cryptocurrency worth up to $1,000, he would get the volatility benefit. If the investment was between $1,000 and $5,000, the person would get 0.1% extra on the earning. Likewise, the investment of $5,000-$10,000 and $10,000-$100,000 would get the person 0.2% and 0.25% additional returns on volatility. For all the schemes, the person had a lock-in period of 120 days (4 months).\nLike other Ponzi schemes, where the new entrants’ money is used to pay the earlier investors, the cycle went well till beginning of 2018. However, many investors got the idea of trouble ahead in December 2017 and had started pulling back their investment. The firm slowly found it difficult to sustain the cycles after which the firm went bust.\n“Shailesh Bhatt was one such investor who dreamed of good returns after investing in 0.1% scheme. However, when the company showed inability to pay his money back, he along with eight others extorted the cryptocurrency from Mavani in a farmhouse. Bhatt was picked up by a team of Amreli police a month later from near Gandhinagar,” said an investigator.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitconnect", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "satish kumbhani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dhaval mavani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nikunj bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "divyesh darji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shailesh bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ahmedabad news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitconnect", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ahmedabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitconnect", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vietnam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nikunj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T20:30:09.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e78c1177b00f133ae9d5ccd087c56ee03a770b20", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_I6WqyKS3KtmoKfb5Gu7Nd58obgBFplqpCLCZZqAqacntwi50vw3_", "site_full": "www.youtube.com", "site": "youtube.com", "site_section": "http://bits.aihosting.com/rss", "site_categories": ["television", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "BTC News Aggregator", "title": "Bitcoin Q&A: Proof-of-work changes with Andreas Antonopoulos.

currency is in a precarious position or how the prospects of the currency are bleak. But what interests traders the most is if the recent developments have changed anything in the current outlook. And we provide you with our answer to this question. One our readers have known for some time now.\nThe media seem to have noticed that Bitcoin has depreciated. More Bitcoin-oriented outlets might even focus on market-specific events such as technical developments. In an article on CoinDesk, we read:\nBitcoin risks closing below the 50-week moving average (MA) – an important long-term support not breached for over two-and-a-half years.\nWith the bears already on the offensive following the recent sell-off, prices are likely to suffer if bitcoin closes on Sunday below the key support, currently seen at $7,611. More worryingly for the bulls, since the cryptocurrency has not traded below the 50-week MA since October 2015, acceptance below that level would only add credence to the argument that the long-term bull run has ended.\nAs of writing, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,449 on Bitfinex, having dropped below the 50-week MA on May 23.\nWe generally do not disagree with the idea that the move belong the 50-week moving average might be a bearish indication. Taking a long-term point of view, the move below the moving average based on weekly closes might be a herald of more declines to come in the next few months.\nAnd we did see a move below this level and it seems to be confirmed. Does this mean that we only have declines in the cards? Not necessarily. No move in the market is certain unless it has already occurred. So, the move down is not certain but, for the long term, the move below the moving average might be an important event.\nWhere our emphasis would go, however, is that the long-term moving average is one of the indicators that might be worth to monitor. It’s not the all-important yardstick but rather a gauge that should be looked at in conjunction with the analysis of other indicators. And we do just that.\nDouble Retracements\nOn BitStamp, we have seen a continued move down from the $10,000 level. This move down has now lasted roughly three weeks. The most recent development in the depreciation is the move down below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level based on the previous rally from around $6,500 to around $10,000. Bitcoin went down below this level last Wednesday (May 23) and, even more importantly, has stayed below this level for almost a week now and this suggests that the indication here is bearish as far as the short term is concerned.\nAt the moment of writing, the currency is closing on the 78.6% retracement, a level possibly less important than the previous one, but a bearish indication nonetheless.\nIf we take a look at other retracement levels, the ones based on the February rally, the implications are virtually unchanged. Bitcoin went below the 61.8% retracement and it’s at the 78.6% retracement. A move below this level would be bearish again. The fact that the retracement levels based on two time frames coincide and have almost identical indications suggests that any bearish indication here might be stronger that if it had been based on one set of retracements.\nArray of Support Levels\nOn the long-term Bitfinex chart, we see a development which we have described in our alerts for some time now. Bitcoin went below the 78.6% retracement level and has remained below this level for some time now. The move seems to be confirmed. The 78.6% level is not an extremely important one, but the breakdown below this level contributes to the bearish outlook, in our opinion.\nRight now, the currency is declining in line with the long-term bearish trend. The next support level is around $6,500 but it’s not an extremely strong one. Actually, we have several support levels in the $5,500-6,500. From this area, the $5,500-6,000 looks like a stronger support. If we were to narrow this down some more, $6,000 might be a trigger for the next very important move.\nSo, based on the indications we’re seeing right now, Bitcoin could potentially go down to $6,000 and if we see a move below this level, and particularly below $5,500, the decline might accelerate markedly and our current hypothetical profits might grow even further. A counter-trend rally might occur around $6,000 but any pullback could be very volatile, so it might not be easy or even possible to exit hypothetical positions and reenter them at higher prices. Consequently, it might be worth to sit out any weak correction if it occurs. Nothing of this is automatic and our approach might change as the situation unfolds. Stay tuned!\nSumming up, the decline continues and might become even deeper.\nAbout the Author Mike McAra is a quantitative analyst focused on the economic reality, not theoretical models.

A break above $8000 would be needed to change the current outlook, which is strongly bearish. Above $8000, we should anticipate a move to $8400, where we should look for resistance again. If price holds under $7800 for example, we still have downside to $7000.

You must be hearing the terms Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Monero, etc. These are all the list of cryptocurrencies based on Blockchain technology.\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be launched in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamato. In the moving industry, California Movers: Local and Long Distance Moving Company was the first to start accepting the Bitcoin and Ethereum as the payment method for their services.\nIn this post check out the seven incredible ways cryptocurrency can benefit moving company customers.\n1. Easy Transactions\nIn traditional times, business dealings involve a lot of third party agents, brokers and legal representatives that complicates the transaction process. This not only consumes a lot of time but also the waste of money. The most important benefit for the moving company customers is cryptocurrency is one to one transaction with peer to peer network. There is no third party involvement and thus transactions are clear and easy with just a few clicks away.\n2. Secured\nWhen you make the traditional transactions, there is a lot of information along with your credit card details are stored. This acts as the reference document for many credit card agencies or bank. They use the information for checking the sufficient funds in your account. Thus it acts as the pull mechanism for the customers. On the other hand, there is cryptocurrency which works on push mechanism. This means you have control over the information to be sent to the recipient during transaction maintaining security. This transaction is the unique exchange between the sender and the recipient agreed and negotiated in each case.\n3. Transaction Fees\nWhen it comes to the traditional transaction system, there are a lot of intermediary transaction fees involved. If you are the one who makes transaction frequently in the month then you will get seriously affected. There is a different scenario in the cryptocurrency where the network does the compensation and transaction fees usually don’t apply. This helps the moving company customers to prefer this payment system over the traditional exchange system. There are some people who utilize the third party such as Coinbase to maintain and create the wallet. This service is just like Paypal but it charges the fees for maintaining the wallet.\n4. Greater Access to Credit\nThis service is available to all the people who have viable data connection and cryptocurrency network. They can easily transfer the money with the basic knowledge of cryptocurrency network. It’s been estimated that currently, 2.2 billion individuals across the world have the internet connection but not have the access to the banking system or exchange. The cryptocurrency payment system holds the potential in asset transferring and transaction is available to willing customers during moving the house or office.\n5. Individual Ownership\nIn the traditional system, there is a third party involvement which has the power to control your money transactions. They close the account if they find that it is breaching the Financial Institution terms. The best advantage of cryptocurrency is that it is the sole owner unless there is a wallet of the third party for maintaining money. This makes the transaction smoother than the other payment system without revealing the other information. It also helps in preventing the identity theft as it is under the control of the sender to share the information related to transfer to the recipient. This makes the cryptocurrency the first choice for the payments to the moving company customers.\n6. Fraud Proof\nThe cryptocurrency is decentralized and neither in the control of bank or government. The public ledger records all the transactions with the encryption technology. There are charge backs in the traditional credit card payment system but the digital payments don’t get reverse arbitrarily. Thus the payments are fraud-proof having one to one transaction.\n7. Instant Settlement\nThe main benefit of cryptocurrency network is that the payment gets transfer instantly. All you need the smart device for the transfer of payment and viable internet connection to transfer the money from one account to the other. In the traditional system, there is third-party involvement which makes the transaction unnecessary lengthy. With cryptocurrencies, you can, in fact, make the transaction on the future date with less expensive as compared to other payment systems. Hence moving company customers can transfer the money instantly with the lower fees.\nThese are the seven incredible ways that can benefit the moving company customers. Utilize them and make the cryptocurrency as the first choice of payment for the money transactions during moving in.

In our country (coz I'm not sure if this exist in other countries). When you have a large amount on your account they will call you and ask you if you want to invest, minimum of 20,000 Php (or 400 USD). They will propose some investment plans where there is a choice of low, medium, or high risk investment. When you choose the high risk there is a chance to lose or gain 100% of your investment (Medium is 75% and low is 50% if I remember it right). It doesn't make sense to me, it sounds like a scam, they will invest using your money and you don't have any control to it. That is why I like bitcoin more, coz Though it is risky and it's very volatile, you have full control on your investment.\nWhat do you guys think?\nBetter to choose a well known worldwide bank, don't use your local one, and invest a large amount of money, so you can live from the dividends, this isn't that risky, because they don't pay that much annually.\nI don't have that much money so i can put them in bank and live from the dividends, and to be honest if i had the money today , knowing about bitcoin and the whole blockchain industry, i would rather invest here.\nControl of your investment at any time for me is the key factor when i choose investing in bitcoin.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-29T21:31:12.039+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b6f6f38a6f4aa04c3766a16b0bfbe9beee2e1359", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScP1WpxThAb4mX.7aYExpfCPVMOud0V9u4Pnuj0gSro6YvDZqJcc8ItIbv3_LzWJDdlDFUk3UxH1", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Bitcoin Today: Prices Come Off Weekend Lows but Remain Trapped Under $8000", "title_full": "Bitcoin Today: Prices Come Off Weekend Lows but Remain Trapped Under $8000", "published": "2018-05-30T01:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b6f6f38a6f4aa04c3766a16b0bfbe9beee2e1359", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sScP1WpxThAb4mX.7aYExpfCPVMOud0V9u4Pnuj0gSro6YvDZqJcc8ItIbv3_LzWJDdlDFUk3UxH1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-30T01:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Today: Prices Come Off Weekend Lows but Remain Trapped Under $8000", "text": "Bitcoin Today: Prices Come Off Weekend Lows but Remain Trapped Under $8000\nBitcoin Today: Prices Come Off Weekend Lows but Remain Trapped Under $8000 TheStreet.com Full coverage Google ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T01:38:56.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2ca3fc5d9ae2b48cd28c14cc09fe478e824eb0e7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2eRCTFln.i_ZKYUln37JOIYwDV_Vxfsd4hAi_5M4LaK466YXpvcIewKsowlpXNymUG.2aZ2HUw--", "site_full": "www.godlikeproductions.com", "site": "godlikeproductions.com", "site_section": "http://www.godlikeproductions.com/feeds/forums/1", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "Godlike Productions - General Discussion", "title": "Last chance to buy cheap Bitcoin", "title_full": "Last chance to buy cheap Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-30T01:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 12387, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2ca3fc5d9ae2b48cd28c14cc09fe478e824eb0e7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8O2eRCTFln.i_ZKYUln37JOIYwDV_Vxfsd4hAi_5M4LaK466YXpvcIewKsowlpXNymUG.2aZ2HUw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CC Kid (UID 75491437)", "published": "2018-05-30T01:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Last chance to buy cheap Bitcoin", "text": "Report Copyright Violation Last chance to buy cheap Bitcoin last chance kiddos. warned you a day or so ago before this latest pump (ignition pump). next week is the beginning of the next bull run but this time with massive institutional buy in. we will never seen sub $10k BTC again.

I'm trying to get familiar with crypto currency and understand 'how it works'. I've reached a block and I'm hoping someone can shed some light on a particular point.\nI understand the process of using public and private keys, back from the time when Phil Zimmermann created PGP. PGP allowed a user to encrypt a file, eg: an email/file (technically, just a bunch of ones and zeros) so that when the other user decrypted the file, they would see the words/file again. Or, to phrase it another way, the encryption was just a 'wrapper' for the content - ie, the words in my email or the file I sent.\nNow, if someone sent me a bitcoin, how would I know what I was looking at? With an encrypted email, once decrypted I would be able to see something (text/file) and realise that I had actually received something. But, if someone sent me a bitcoin, what would I be looking at when I decrypted with my private key? A file filled with ones and zeros? Or maybe a simple text file with words inside saying, \"Hey, this is 1 bitcoin!\"\nCan someone shed some light on what it I actually receive when I purchase a bitcoin and how I can verify that what I have 'in my hands', is actually a bitcoin and not just a bunch of ones and zeros? I understand that the blockchain is supposed to verify what is what but, what if I wanted to pass my bitcoin directly to you without the blockchain. Again, how would I know, what I received - was a bitcoin?\nThank you for your time and patience with my lack of understanding!\nRegards,\nStaffs Lebowski..

It is all out of control i think. If you think you will buy now you can take a risk and luckily you may gainer or loser.\nThat's correct there's no perfect timing to buy or get involve but we should know the process and risk. But when it comes to principle we should buy at low and sell at high then bitcoin is good for long term hold we need to invest our time and patience to become success.\nGeneral trend in blockchain markets is very negative at the moment and this makes people more hungry for bitcoin purchase.
