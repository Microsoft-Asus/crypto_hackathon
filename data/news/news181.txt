Bitcoin Cash outperformed other leading digital currencies, the latter of which have taken it on the chin in recent weeks.\nThe Bitcoin Cash price advanced 6% over the last month compared to declines of 5%, 9% and 11% for bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple, respectively. Kelly on CNBC made the case for Bitcoin Cash.\nKelly, the founder of investment firm BKCM, believes that Bitcoin Cash has more room to run, and he’s outlined the catalysts for the bullish outlook. “Proposed development fund” “Could give cryptocurrency more use cases” “Highlights centralization of miners”\nTo take each of the catalysts in more detail, miners of Bitcoin Cash in recent days announced a new development fund that will be comprised of a percentage of the bounty they receive from creating new coins. The funds in the new portfolio will be directed toward the development of new technology “on top of Bitcoin Cash,” Kelly explained, adding that it’s akin to an App Store for the blockchain.\n“That potentially could give value to Bitcoin Cash,” said Kelly, adding that it’s not the only blockchain project doing something like this.\nThe development fund leads to the second catalyst, which involves developers using the new blockchain technology to create more use cases for bitcoin cash. “To the extent that usefulness translates into value, that could be a positive for Bitcoin Cash,” he said.\nNext, the development fund reflects “centralization of the miners,” which Kelly admits bucks the trend for cryptocurrencies. Ultimately, this could prove to be a negative but for now, the mission behind the development fund appears to be a good one.\nAs for the market, Kelly points to an uptrend in BCH that’s strengthened by the fact that it has been able to hold support. The technicals for BCH coupled with the catalysts he outlined led to his bullish call: “For me, that’s a place that I want to buy,” he said. Source: CNBC\nNot So Fast?\nCNBC’s Fast Money took some tweets from viewers, one of which asked Kelly if he was actually early bitcoin backer Roger Ver. Ver, who is also known as “Bitcoin Jesus”, is a proponent of Bitcoin Cash over bitcoin core.\nCNBC said they get a number of tweets basically accusing the business network of performing pump-and-dump schemes. One such accusation come from a Twitter user by Samson Mow, who Mow said Kelly has since blocked – Collecting some gems for @SEC_Enforcement @SEC_News to take a closer look at @CNBCFastMoney @CNBC pumping and dumping altcoins on their viewers. Enough is enough. If you have more tweets, post below and I’ll add them to the Moment. ⚖️ https://t.co/i42MeDK91P\n— Samson Mow (@Excellion) May 22, 2018\nMeanwhile, CNBC host Melissa Lee responded on the air broadly to any accusations, saying: “That is absolutely not the case.

Bitcoin is Quote: d at $8,290 right now, lower by 4.5 percent since last Tuesday. Litecoin is trading at $133 dollars, down by 9.5 percent.\nBitcoin Still Bearish\nBitcoin is still looking bearish on the daily charts. On Friday we hit a new interim low of $7,921 but from here we got a bounce to $8,590 dollars. Right now we’re somewhat in between these two figures at $8,290 dollars.\nTo end the current downtrend the bulls will have to push us above the $8,880 swing high.Resistance higher up can be found at the $9,000 mark followed by the swing highs at $9,387 and $9,759 dollars. All of these levels are weak resistance points however. We have much stronger resistance area around the top of the previous bull run which was at $9,987 dollars. A breakout above the $10,000 round figure is needed to kick-start a new rally.\nThere’s a support area below between $7,821 and $8,000 dollars. A break of it could lead to extended losses toward the next strong support area in the $6,420 to $6,600 dollars range. This is where we bottomed out during the last major sell-off. A decisive break below here could open the door for a break of this year’s low at $5,980 dollars.\nOn the fundamental front there haven’t been any major news events during the past seven days. After the end of Consensus 2018 we are in a bit of lull in terms of scheduled news catalysts. There’s no change on the longer-term weekly and monthly charts. The weekly is looking range-bound while the monthly is still bullish.\nLitecoin Remains in Downtrend\nSimilarly to bitcoin, litecoin too remains in a downtrend. We are currently Quote: d at $133 dollars and trading just above a set of several potential support levels at $130.70, $128.57 and $125 dollars. A clearing of this support area should lead to further losses.\nThe first strong level of support after this area can be found at the $108.44 swing low. The low for 2018 is close to here at $105.55 dollars, some traders may choose to wait until that level is taken out as well. Further down the $100 round figure may also act as weak support to falling prices.\nOn the top end we have resistance at $142 dollars followed by the $150 round figure. Higher up a breakout above the $152.80 swing low would end the current bearish trend on the daily charts. A move above the $184.47 swing high is needed for a new LTC rally. On the longer-term weekly and monthly charts LTC/USD is still looking bullish.

economy”", "text": "Email\nLebanese American University professor Saifedean Ammous published a book called ‘The Bitcoin Standard’ where he calls the cryptocurrency a ‘decentralized alternative to central banking.’\nThe professor, who is also a visiting scholar at Columbia University, explores the history of currencies and how different forms of money eventually became undesirable and replaceable.\n“The most important thing that bitcoin offers is a new form of sound money outside the control of any authority of government,” Ammous said in an interview with World Crypto Network . “I think it is going to have a very large impact on how the world economy functions in the future.”\nAmmous goes on to explain that Bitcoin is immune to many of the factors that that cause typical Fiat currency to devalue and hyper-inflate.\nFederal banks cannot increase printing of the online currency and there aren’t new sources that can add onto the Bitcoin supply, Ammous said.\n“Even tiny technical changes (in Bitcoin)…these sorts of changes have been almost impossible to make,” he said. “Bitcoin as it is is going to survive.”\nWATCH: Interview with Saifedean Ammous, Author of The Bitcoin Standard\nThe book was published by the John Wiley & Sons publishing house. It is sold for about $27 on Amazon .\nTo learn more about Dr. Ammous’s book, click here to view the book’s description through the Columbia University website.

In recent weeks, there have been plenty of calls for the cryptocurrency to return to those record highs and beyond.\n“Rodrigo Marques, chief executive of Atlas Quantum, one of Brazil’s largest crypto trading platforms, said in an email to MarketWatch that the move under $8,000 was an interim low for bitcoin, adding that he expects bitcoin to reach $20,000 in six months, recapturing levels it hasn’t approached since December,” reports MarketWatch .\nSome market observers are concerned that declines for the cryptocurrency could reinvigorate bearish traders, particularly if bitcoin posts several closes below the $8,000 area. After bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrencies are Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash and EOS. Confronting Bitcoin Regulations\nIncreased regulatory scrutiny, both in the U.S. and abroad, is a factor cryptocurrency market participants must consider. While some market observers believe more regulations could potentially boost adoption of digital currencies, the asset class often sells off amid news of tighter regulations.\n“The U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, will soon provide tighter guidance on the digital currency market,” according to MarketWatch. “Speaking at the North American Securities Administrators Association Conference in Washington, Chairman Christopher Giancarlo said the agency will publish a staff advisory that will provide guidance to both exchanges and clearinghouses when listing derivative contracts based on virtual currencies.”\nThere is significant room for growth in the cryptocurrency universe. Recent data suggest a small amount of American investors own any digital currencies and, after bitcoin, the numbers of crypto ownership dwindle .\n“If bulls are able to stay in control, they could push bitcoin price up to the next potential resistance at the 38.2% extension or $9279,” reports NewBTC . “The 50% extension is near the $9700 major psychological level while the 61.8% extension lines up with the swing high around $10,000. Stronger bullish pressure could take it up to fresh highs at the 76.4% extension or $10,705 level or the full extension at $11,461.”\nFor more information on the cryptocurrency market, visit our Bitcoin category .

If you stacked the pizza boxes you can get for that many Bitcoins today, they’d rise to outer space.\nAt today’s price near $8,200 per Bitcoin, you could get about 6.5 million $12.50 pizzas. If you stacked those pizza boxes, they’d climb almost 200 miles (300 kilometers) into the air, according to data from Forex Time, a foreign exchange broker.\nIts animated infographic marks the landmarks crossed by the boxes — Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, Mount Everest, a passenger airplane — before shooting into space. Bitcoin isn’t quite getting to the moon, but close.\nAs Bitcoin’s value soared over the years, the developer who made the initial purchase, Laszlo Hanyecz, became a legend in the crypto space and beyond. He’ll forever be known as the guy who forked over assets now valued at $82 million, for pizza.\nEarlier this year Hanyecz replicated his move using the Lightning Network, a technology that runs parallel to Bitcoin’s blockchain and aims to speed up transactions. Bitcoin Pizza Day has become a reminder of how much the coin’s price has skyrocketed even after the slump from the record of almost $20,000 last year.

Today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief showcases how that promise is starting to materialize in different fields, including the future of elections and geopolitics. Also Read: Bitcoin in Brief Monday: New EU Rules Kill Another Crypto Venture Iran and Russia Consider Bitcoin to Skirt Sanctions Iranian and Russian lawmakers are jointly examining the idea of using cryptocurrency to bypass international and American sanctions. Mohammad-Reza Pourebrahimi, who chairs the Iranian Parliamentary Commission for Economic Affairs, raised the idea during a recent meeting in Moscow with Dmitry Mezentsev, the Chair of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy. He explained that the Russians “share our opinion. We said that if we manage to move this work forward, then we will be the first countries that use digital currencies in the exchange of goods.” Iran’s government-owned media Press TV reports that the country’s leadership “specifically started to look at bitcoin as an alternative monetary means to be used in trade after it became clear that European companies were failing to trade with Iran over fears that they would fall afoul of US primary sanctions.” It should be noted that the Iranian government is trying to stop its citizens from having access to global markets it seeks for itself, banning banks from dealing with crypto and even traditional foreign currency exchange shops . Still, Iranian citizens have reportedly sent more than $2.5 billion out of the country to purchase cryptocurrencies with. US Politician Raises $100k From Crypto Community Congressional candidate Brian Forde has celebrated on Monday in San Francisco his campaign raising $100,000 in cryptocurrency donations. A former head of MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative and Obama’s Senior Technology Advisor, he is considered to be a vocal supporter of cryptocurrency. Meanwhile his main Democratic opponent, a former SEC enforcement attorney, has attacked Forde for his work in cryptocurrency, referring to his donors in an ad as “bitcoin speculators that oppose cracking down on drug deals and human trafficking.” This contested race is shaping up to be a major example of cryptocurrency impact on electoral politics in America. It is also nice to see that the matter is now getting bipartisan support in the US. As we recently reported, on the other side of the country and the opposite side of the aisle , a Trump-supporting Republican and a bitcoin enthusiast is running to be the next New York Attorney General . Liberation Through Radical Decentralization Vitalik Buterin has co-written a short manifesto of sorts with the young political economist Glen Weyl, unapologetically titled “ Liberation Through Radical Decentralization .” In it they explain how the cryptocurrency ecosystem is suited for developing and testing new models for governance, voting and more, in a way that can fundamentally change how both democracy and capitalism work. They remind us that: “Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in particular emerged directly as a reaction to the perceived excesses of the traditional financial system, with ‘The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks’ carved indelibly into Bitcoin’s genesis block. That said, the decentralized technologies behind cryptocurrencies have potential applications far beyond finance.” Real Products, Real Adoption With all the recent news about so many ICOs being outright scams or just failures, it’s good to remember that there are actual projects in the cryptocurrency space that are delivering real services to real users. Two recent examples are Brave and Steemit, coincidentally two different attempts to change how online content monetisation works. The Brave browser recently passed 5 million downloads for the Android operating system and now boasts over 2.3 million monthly active users and over 14,000 verified publishers. And recently the one millionth account was created on the Steem blockchain, which now sees around 60,000 unique accounts transacting each day, and over 250,000 unique daily visitors for the site.

All of the top currencies are in the deep red right now, with some of them suffering bigger setbacks compared to others. The Bitcoin Cash price, for example, has dropped below $1,200 once again, yet it remains to be seen how long this negative trend will remain in place. The Bitcoin Cash Price Decline With all major cryptocurrencies on the decline, it is only normal Bitcoin and other altcoins will suffer from this pressure. In the case of BCH, the value has declined in the past few hours, and it seems the Bitcoin Cash price will face a big struggle to remain close to the $1,200 level first and foremost. So far, the value has dipped below $1,200 already, but it seems things may improve moving forward. Over the past seven days, the Bitcoin Cash price has dropped for over $1,400 all the way down to $1,150. Ever since that time, the value bounced back to nearly $1,300, but holding on to that momentum has proven to be far more difficult than speculators imagined at first. With the Bitcoin Cash price now dropping below $1,200, an interesting trend is forming, which may push the value down to $1,150 once again. Due to this 5.61% decline in the past 24 hours, Bitcoin Cash is one of the bigger “losers” of the day so far. There is also a 3.13% decline in the BCH/BTC ration over the past 24 hours, which is only making things worse. Recovering value in either department will be pretty difficult for Bitcoin Cash, but nothing is impossible in the world of cryptocurrency. Even the Bitcoin Cash trading volume is on the decline over the past 24 hours. With the volume dropping to just over $602m, things are not looking all that great for BCH. Even so, the overall cryptocurrency trading volume has continued to decline as well, pushing the number down to under $16bn.Turning that situation around will not be easy, as this week is off to another rocky start. Looking over the exchanges ranked by trading volume, OKEx is still clearly in a dominant position. HitBTC is not far behind, and EXX takes the third spot. Lbank and OKEx’s BTC pair complete the top five. There are no fiat currency pairs in the top five for BCH right now, which could explain why the USD value is dropping at an accelerated pace. For the time being, Bitcoin Cash speculators will have to contend with this ongoing bearish pressure. It is evident things will not necessarily improve later today, although stranger things have happened in the world of cryptocurrency. Until the Bitcoin price recovers in a significant manner, altcoins will continue to suffer. When that recovery process will take place, remains to be determined at this stage.

In short, China sees blockchain technology as an active area of innovation and expects public blockchains and decentralised applications to become significant parts of the future economy. However, confusingly, in the second half of last year the government began a mass crackdown on illegal initial coin offerings (ICOs).\nBroadly speaking, blockchain technology is a new kind of electronic database for transactions, where new information is added to the chain and then stamped and protected with a mathematical equation. It has been heralded by as the solution to problems in everything from trust in major banks to medical records and voting registers.\nAs China grows into the role of a global economic superpower, according to one expert the nation sees cryptocurrency and blockchain as an \"economic game-changer\". GETTY China is excited by the ETH blockchain If they didn’t understand its significance, they simply never would have banned it. Jacob Papageorgiou, LBX\nKevin Murcko, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange CoinMetro says that China’s message on Bitcoin looks mixed as although it “sees cryptocurrency as a threat to its financial stability”, he said: “China wants to be the front runner in the digital economy era, and as the nation readies for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it sees cryptocurrency and blockchain – a technology with enormous potential to remove pain points and inefficiencies – as an economic game-changer.”\nHoping to clear up the uncertainty, the Chinese think tank told Express.co.uk that with a global surge in blockchain hype - or in their words - in the “active innovation on the global public chain”. A spokesman added “this work will help us keep track of that innovation and other industry trends”.\nWhen questioned on the controversial methodology behind the ranking that saw Bitcoin’ s blockchain come 13th and Ethereum top, the spokesman said that a “infrastructure study of public chain” was used alongside “opinions from experts during the evaluation”.\nHowever, the think tank spokeswoman confirmed the final index score came from a “project team” in house and that “the result is objective and fair under this model”.\nJacob Papageorgiou, head of education at LBX told Express.co.uk China banned bitcoin exchanges and ICOs because of the significance they have placed on the future use of blockchain technology. He said: “If they didn’t understand its significance, they simply never would have banned it.”\nOn why the ban came first and the controversial list followed after Mr Papageorgiou said: ”It’s very difficult to influence things when adoption has come; it’s much easier to impose early restrictions and shape the direction of the disruption, and the ban is an example of this.\n\"China has always invested heavily on new technology trends, and in 2016 blockchain technology saw its first official mention in China’s 13th Five Year Plan, where it was depicted as one of the major tasks and projects for the nation.”\nThe expert says that there is still a very clear separation between digital currencies and blockchain in China at the moment, with much more of a focus on the fundamental technology and product design behind blockchain projects.\nIn the years to come, he adds: “China will likely become the world’s leading country in blockchain technology. It’s capability for rapid economic development combined with its tech-first approach, institutional backing and revolutionary designs means that when, not if, China does eventually open up ICOs and blockchain development, it will be at a phenomenal growth rate.\" Related articles", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "city & business news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ministry of industry and information technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china center for information industry development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global public chain assessment index", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T21:01:28.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "238b924b220ba1bbb6ba4243dbb18af83837f564", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSRDhplRNIt74zPy1w4umbmfKIzUOxeCXE5dCnQyZ8zLBxiN0C7lXJtLWS0cQi21soYO.MRSUwNf.", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "8 years ago, a programmer paid 10000 bitcoins for 2 Papa John's pizzas — now it's the most celebrated day in crypto", "title_full": "8 years ago, a programmer paid 10000 bitcoins for 2 Papa John's pizzas — now it's the most celebrated day in crypto", "published": "2018-05-22T17:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "238b924b220ba1bbb6ba4243dbb18af83837f564", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSRDhplRNIt74zPy1w4umbmfKIzUOxeCXE5dCnQyZ8zLBxiN0C7lXJtLWS0cQi21soYO.MRSUwNf.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-22T17:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "8 years ago, a programmer paid 10000 bitcoins for 2 Papa John's pizzas — now it's the most celebrated day in crypto", "text": "8 years ago, a programmer paid 10000 bitcoins for 2 Papa John's pizzas — now it's the most celebrated day in crypto\n8 years ago, a programmer paid 10000 bitcoins for 2 Papa John's pizzas — now it's the most celebrated day in crypto Thehour.com Full coverage Google ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T17:55:48.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aca24d447a487069fca03c099d4e4605eb045e23", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY55RHzxV67Wv_xyTRGPR3R6dntwu3BW6zx.5AntV0p_Q5.br.Zq_PTs3PNS7tRjLEw--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "What Do Free Markets Advocates Think About Bitcoin?", "title_full": "What Do Free Markets Advocates Think About Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-22T17:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aca24d447a487069fca03c099d4e4605eb045e23", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY55RHzxV67Wv_xyTRGPR3R6dntwu3BW6zx.5AntV0p_Q5.br.Zq_PTs3PNS7tRjLEw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-22T17:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "What Do Free Markets Advocates Think About Bitcoin?", "text": "What libertarians, anarcho-capitalists, and proponents of the Austrian school of economics, all have in common is their love for free markets and disdain for state intervention.\nMany evangelists of these schools of thought have thus publicly praised decentralized digital currencies, such as bitcoin , as they provide individuals with personal financial sovereignty and allows them to store their wealth in an asset whose value cannot be controlled by the actions of central banks . However, not all free market advocates believe that bitcoin should have a valid place in the economy.\nWhat are \"Free Markets?\" In economics, the term \"free markets\" refers to an economic system where prices for goods and services are determined purely by market forces – driven by consumers and the open market – without any government interference on pricing or market structure.\nA free market economy is based on a spontaneous order of arrangements where individuals decide to engage in voluntary economic activity without the control of central governing authorities. This creates unobstructed competition, which – in theory – should allow for fair pricing and the most possible wealth for the highest amount of people within this economy.\nWho Said What About Bitcoin? While bitcoin – and cryptocurrency in general – fit into the free market spirit, opinions about its validity as money differ among leading figures in the libertarian and anarcho-capitalist realm.\nRon Paul Ron Paul is an author and former politician who has established himself as the most influential libertarian thought leader in the U.S. after having run for the U.S. Presidency three times during his active political careers. He is an advocate for the Austrian school of economics and a Senior Fellow of the Mises Institute and has been very outspoken about why the Federal Reserve should be abolished, most notably in his book End the Fed .\n( Source : Wikipedia )\nRon Paul has also publicly stated his view on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies on several occasions.\nIn 2013, he told CNN : \"There will be alternatives to the dollar, and [bitcoin] might be one of them.\" If bitcoin mass adoption will take place, \"it'll go down in history as the destroyer of the dollar,\" he added.\nIn November 2017, Paul even starred in an advert for CoinIRA, where he stated: \"As a firm believer in currency competition, I'm excited to see the options that bitcoin opens up.\"\nHaving said that, Ron Paul remains skeptical about bitcoin functioning as currency effectively as he believes that money has historically always been something tangible. In January 2018, he explained that individuals should have the right to choose what currency they want to use but said that it ought to be something tangible.\nHe also considers the current valuations of cryptocurrencies to be in bubble territory. In December 2017, he told CNBC cryptocurrencies are a reflection of the disaster of the money dollar systems and that the high price of bitcoin has been partly caused by loose monetary policy, in the same way as other asset bubbles have in the recent past.\nDoug Casey Doug Casey is an anarcho-capitalist writer, an investor, and CEO of investment research firm Casey Research . While Casey was originally skeptical about decentralized digital currencies, he has since changed his mind and has become a firm believer in the value of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n( Source : Casey Research )\nIn a blog post titled \" How I Learned to Love Bitcoin ,\" Casey stated:\n\"My original objection was that Bitcoin isn't backed by anything. It's really a private fiat currency. It's very much like the Zambian Kwacha, the Argentine peso, the US dollar, or any of the other 150-plus currencies in today's world. It's a floating abstraction. Unlike state currencies, though, its acceptance isn't enforced by laws.\" Casey, therefore, believes that \"Bitcoin is well on the way to being accepted as money.

So you can definitely say it's money—for the moment. I have little confidence, however, Bitcoin will be here, say, five years from now. Buying cryptos is not like socking away gold coins,\" Casey added.\nRobert Murphy Robert Murphy is an anarcho-capitalist writer and scholar at the Mises Institute. In 2015, he co-authored the book Understanding Bitcoin: The Liberty Lover's Guide to the Mechanics & Economics of Crypto-Currencies and has been a supporter of bitcoin.\nIn an article for the Library of Economics and Liberty , Murphy wrote: \"Bitcoin is an ingenious peer-to-peer 'virtual' or 'digital currency' that challenges the way economists have traditionally thought about money. Its inbuilt scarcity provides an assurance of purchasing power arguably safer than any other system yet conceived.\" He added:\n\"Critics argue that because of its lack of commodity backing, Bitcoin is doomed to eventual failure. Yet the popular versions of these arguments either would apply just as well to gold or have already been proven wrong by the use of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange among a small (but growing) group of users.\"\n( Source : Wikipedia )\nHaving said that, like many of his \"Austrian\" peers, he also prefers gold over bitcoin.\n\"I still think that gold remains the preeminent money for humans at this stage of the globe's economic development. If governments around the world got out of the way, humanity would (I predict) once again embrace gold, not Bitcoin, as the true free-market money. But this is just a personal judgment call. We need to let the decentralized market test tell us what is the best money, or monies,\" Murphy concluded.\nKonrad Graf Konrad Graf is a writer and an economist who has written extensively on the topic of bitcoin monetary policy . He considers bitcoin to be one of the greatest inventions of our time and has shared his thoughts on the digital currency in essays such as \" On the Origins of Bitcoin: Stages of Monetary Evolution ,\" and the \" Bitcoin Decrypted Series ,\" as well as in his book Are Bitcoins Ownable? Property Rights, IP Wrongs, and Legal Theory Implications .\n( Source : Konradsgraf.com )\nIn \"On the Origins of Bitcoin,\" Graf wrote: \"Bitcoin was offered up as an invention/discovery of a new way to do something very old—transfer the control of purchasing power from one party to another. This method was offered for free to the entire human population. [Each] person remains entirely free to either ignore it or use it in some way, and only to the exact extent of each person's willing participation.\"\n\"Bitcoin is superior to any known alternative medium of exchange on just about every meaningfully relevant characteristic,\" he added.\nJeffrey Tucker Jeffrey Tucker is an Austrian school economist, author, and an anarcho-capitalist. He is the editorial director of the American Institute for Economic Research ( AIER ) and the CEO of the Atlanta Bitcoin Embassy .\nTucker has been a vocal supporter of bitcoin for several years and has spoken about the benefits of the virtual currency at numerous conferences. He is also the founder of the CryptoCurrency Conference and authored the book Bit by Bit in 2015.\n( Source : Wikipedia )\nIn a 2017 Op-Ed for Bitcoin Magazine , Tucker wrote : \"There are dramatic challenges to the status quo that are being offered up by the advent of cryptocurrency. [The] new world will be financially sound, stable, radically disintermediated, decentralized and democratized because anyone, of any financial means and access to financial institutions, can participate within it.\"\n\"We've only begun to think about what a radical change it would be if our money actually gained value over time (as crypto has for nine years, and the dollar did in the late 19th century), so that you actually grow more wealthy merely by not spending. Such a change would be huge, not only for finance but also for the culture at large,\" he added.\nKevin Dowd Kevin Dowd is a professor of finance and economics at Durham University, England. He is a long-standing free market economist with interests in private money, financial and macroeconomics and political economy. He has also co-authored the book Alchemists of Loss: How Modern Finance and Government Intervention Crashed the Financial System .\n( Source : Wikipedia )\nIn 2014, Dowd published a paper for the Institute of Economic Affairs in which he argued that governments should not stifle currency competition and provide a level playing field for private money such as bitcoin so that citizens have the ability to choose which currency they want to use.\nHe told The Guardian : \"Let's suppose that bitcoin became a very prominent currency. [To ensure a level playing field], the government itself would accept bitcoin in tax payments. So, in effect, the government should not be favoring its own currency, or any particular currency, through any of its unique powers. Nor have regulations against them.\nBryan Caplan Bryan Caplan is a professor of Economics at George Mason University and considers himself an anarcho-capitalist. He regularly contributes articles to the Library of Economics and Liberty and has authored several books including The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies and The Case Against Education: Why the Education System Is a Waste of Time and Money .\n( Source : bcaplan.com )\nIn a Reddit AMA in 2014, Caplan was asked what his thoughts on bitcoin's validity as money. His response was:\n\"It's done 10x better than I expected, but I still don't expect it to be more than a niche financial instrument. It's long been noted that people around the world continue using their national currencies even in the face of 20 or 30 [percent] inflation because national currencies are more convenient and focal. Also, I expect regulators to crack down if Bitcoin becomes much of a threat. But hopefully I'm wrong!\"\nPeter Schiff Peter Schiff is an economist, a financial commentator, and CEO of stock brokerage Euro Pacific Capital . He is also one of the most outspoken bitcoin critics among libertarian thought leaders.\nSchiff believes that bitcoin is not the money of the future because money needs to be a commodity. He has defended this view in heated discussions with bitcoin advocates such as CNBC Fast Money's Brian Kelly and Coin Center's Peter Van Valkenburgh .\n( Source : Wikipedia )\nSchiff also believes that bitcoin is the biggest bubble he has ever seen. \"[Bitcoin] a speculative asset at best, but anybody who buys it runs the risk that the price could collapse any day. Sure, it could keep going up, but eventually it's going to implode, so you really can't say it's a safe haven. It's a highly speculative asset. The underlying concept is not entirely meritless, though. I think bitcoin was born as a solution to a real problem but I think unfortunately this is not the solution,\" he told Benzinga .\nWalter Block Walter Block is another Austrian school economist and an advocate of anarcho-capitalism. He is a Senior Fellow of Mises Institute and is well-known for his book Defending the Undefendable , which he published it 1976.\n( Source : Wikipedia )\nBlock is not a fan of bitcoin. In 2011, he said : \"I'm not sure I fully understand [bitcoin]. But, I favor money based on real commodities (gold, silver, whatever the market settles upon), and, I gather, bitcoins do not qualify. So, I oppose bitcoins. I favor 100 [percent] backed (by a commodity) currency for reasons that Rothbard and Mises have written about, over and over again.\"\nGary North Gary North is an economic historian, an author, and another Austrian economist who has little love for bitcoin.\nIn an article titled \"Is Bitcoin a Ponzi Scheme\" that North wrote for LewRockwell.com , he states: \"I hereby make a prediction: Bitcoins will go down in history as the most spectacular private Ponzi scheme in history. It will dwarf anything dreamed of by Bernard Madoff.\"\n( Source : Wikipedia )\n\"Bitcoins cannot possibly fulfill their supposed purpose: to serve as an unregulated currency unit. Bitcoins are not an alternative currency. They are something you buy in the midst of a mania, and you will sell at some point in order to get back your money. You are thinking of buying Bitcoins, not because Bitcoins will serve as a means of exchange, as originally argued, but because you want to get back lots more money than you paid for them,\" North concluded.\nHans-Hermann Hoppe Hans-Hermann Hoppe is an Austrian school economist and an anarcho-capitalist philosopher. He is also a Senior Fellow at the Mises Institute and the founder of the Property and Freedom Society .\nIn 2013, Hoppe was asked by Stephan Kinsella what he thought of bitcoin. He told Kinsella that he does not consider bitcoin to be money.\n( Source : Wikipedia )\nHowever, Hoppe is strongly in favor of the decentralization that blockchain technology brings. In an interview with Polish media outlet Najwy?szy Czas! , he said: \"Don't put your trust in democracy, but neither should you trust in a dictatorship. Rather, put your hope into radical political decentralization.\"\nWhy Aren't All Free Markets Proponents in Love with Bitcoin? In may come as somewhat of a surprise that a fair share of free-market advocates are not supportive of bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general, despite the fact that it ticks so many free-market boxes.\nBitcoin acts both as a digital currency and as a store of value that cannot be censored, easily confiscated or directly influenced by a government or central banks. Its price is based purely on supply and demand market forces and anyone in the world with an Internet connection has the ability to partake in the Bitcoin network and transact in the digital currency.\nWhile governments can and, in some cases, have attempted to ban bitcoin, it is de facto impossible to do so due to the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network, which spans thousands of nodes across the globe. Hence, even if a government did manage to shut down all nodes and miners in its jurisdiction, the Bitcoin network would continue to function via the continual operation of nodes based outside the country.\nThe most common criticism of bitcoin found among libertarian thought leaders is that it is not backed by \"real\" commodities, such as gold and silver, and, thus, has no \"real\" value. Many free-market advocates are also believers in the gold standard, which is a monetary system where a currency is backed by gold reserves, and consider non-commodity backed mediums of exchange to be inferior.\nThis argument, however, can easily be refuted as bitcoin is backed by something \"real.\" Bitcoin is backed by hashing power which is provided by one of the largest networks of computers in the world.\nWhile bitcoin may be a bit more challenging to comprehend and conceptualize for some, it carries all the essential traits that free market economics, libertarians, and anarcho-capitalists look for as an alternative to fiat currency.\nAs the bitcoin ecosystem grows and its value as a spending currency (should the Lightning Network and other scaling solutions succeed) and as a digital gold-like store of value becomes increasingly more evident, it would not be a surprise for the list of bitcoin-skeptical free-market advocates to shorten significantly.\nThe post What Do Free Markets Advocates Think About Bitcoin? appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T17:54:29.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "373831105b700cda0ba952efaacd5472fbb3a3cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnyw72Qvi0TPQ_rYbWuHlXNGQYk_Y33X6S_.wvWLZErjzQ8o_MzhRMdodQ--", "site_full": "swahilipages.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://swahilipages.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Swahilipages", "title": "Bitcoin Pizza Day: 2 Pizzas Bought for 10,000 Bitcoins in 2010 Now Worth $82 Million", "title_full": "Bitcoin Pizza Day: 2 Pizzas Bought for 10,000 Bitcoins in 2010 Now Worth $82 Million", "published": "2018-05-22T17:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "373831105b700cda0ba952efaacd5472fbb3a3cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZScB35k8QjLzb0E98b7oQ04DK9.woZ7wbzGeGuW3EWyY0IkzyZOVnyw72Qvi0TPQ_rYbWuHlXNGQYk_Y33X6S_.wvWLZErjzQ8o_MzhRMdodQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Al Muntasr (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-22T17:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Pizza Day: 2 Pizzas Bought for 10,000 Bitcoins in 2010 Now Worth $82 Million", "text": "Those who try to stay tuned with the news from the crypto sphere definitely know that Bitcoin had some really crazy moments in its history. A number of them will stay forever in archived internet chat forums. There are also a lot of mysteries in its history, like the real name of its creator widely known as Satoshi Nakamoto.\nToday, May 22 is another symbolic day in Bitcoin's mythology. This day is now called Bitcoin Pizza Day. Eight years ago, on May 22, programmer Laszlo Hanyecz decided to buy some pizza. So, to get two Papa John's pizzas he paid another Bitcoin talk forum user just 10,000 BTC. At that time, it was only $25 which was quite a good price for those pizzas.\nBut in 2018 the situation is totally different. That 10,000 BTC is worth $82,078,100 (-3.33% from yesterday as it is informed by CoinMarketCap at press time) . Now it sounds really ridiculous, that's why there is no surprise that such a deal turned into one of the strongest memes of the cryptocurrency world.\nThe #Bitcoin pizza is worth $83,131,600 today. (-2% from yesterday) Today is Bitcoin pizza day!\n— Bitcoin Pizza (@bitcoin_pizza) May 22, 2018\nJust a year ago, when the crypto community was celebrating Bitcoin Pizza Day, the amount of 10,000 BTC was worth over $21 million. And already at that time it seemed to be unbelievable.\nLaszlo Hanyecz is now a well-known person in the crypto community. Giving an interview last year he explained the events of 2010 the following way: \"It wasn't like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool. No one knew it was going to get so big.\"\nAnd in general, such his position is quite understandable. Even the creators of Bitcoin were not confident about the future of this cryptocurrency. It was believed that Bitcoin would either have an enormous value, or it would be worth nothing at all.\nToday, it is possible to purchase practically anything you want with Bitcoin, though it may take some time to find a necessary app to do it and to wait for a confirmation of your transaction.\nOf course, it is also possible to buy pizza, but it is difficult to believe that today someone may want to purchase it paying an amount that could be enough to fuel between two and four ICO projects.\nBut if you think that this legendary purchase in 2010 is the only interesting thing about Hanyecz, it is not so. This year, he has made news once again: he has bought pizza through the Lightning Network that is a second layer protocol developed atop the Bitcoin's blockchain network.\nOn February 25, Hanyecz announced that he had purchased pizza having made a payment using the Lightning Network. This time he paid only 649000 satoshis, or 0.00649 bitcoins which means that he paid nearly $62 for both pizzas.\nThe post Bitcoin Pizza Day: 2 Pizzas Bought for 10,000 Bitcoins in 2010 Now Worth $82 Million appeared first on CoinSpeaker .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinmarketcap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laszlo hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "— bitcoin pizz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T17:54:29.040+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "144f9c1ffcadb58bd933bc0faaf19aac06a74079", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRu6_0JIyDBczXBd3xSpzO.SYffQLufHFOnDDkyuDOV7M1mLLk5WeJBfMAlt1DC8COF7I05TPn6iFYBrztk0RLjOVElfUteI3hix4._232og--", "site_full": "bitcoinpartner.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinpartner.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BitCoinPartner - Cryptocurrency Innovative Payment Network News", "title": "He Paid How Much?!

Bitcoin (BTC) users around the world are celebrating the eighth so-called “Bitcoin Pizza Day” today, May 22. With BTC prices circling $8,200 , the price of one of the legendary pizzas purchased on this day in 2010 is now worth $41.4 mln . Traditionally accompanied by various social media events, giveaways from cryptocurrency businesses and a considerable amount of pizza-eating, Bitcoin Pizza Day remembers May 22, 2010 – the first time a Bitcoin user purchased pizza with the cryptocurrency. On that date, Bitcoin traded at around $0.004, making the two pizzas Laszlo Hanyecz ordered from Papa John’s for 10,000 BTC cost $41. A ceremonial occurrence in Bitcoin’s history, Hanyecz’s fateful transaction has garnered more admiration than ridicule. Commentators later noted that without such pioneering usage, Bitcoin would not have scaled to the phenomenon it is in 2018. “I'll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later,” Hanyecz wrote on Bitcointalk in 2010, attempting to find support for the transaction. The famous post continues: “You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I'm aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don't have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a 'breakfast platter' at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you're happy!” Responses to the original post from November 2010 make for equally interesting reading, users asking Hanyecz what it felt like to eat pizza now worth $2,600 and wondering whether the order would ever become the “world's first million-dollar pizza.” This year, meanwhile, community infographics accompany celebrations from crypto businesses, including exchange BTCC , which noted the sliding scale of expenditure on its annual pizza delivery. It’s #Pizza #Day at #BTCC ! Fun fact: We spent 2.00 BTC on pizzas for the office in 2016, last year we spent 0.40 BTC, and this year we spent just 0.09 #BTC . Do you think #bitcoin price will be higher or lower next year? pic.twitter.com/yjVSeMskFP\nFrench hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger meanwhile released a limited edition device in honor of the occasion. ®ⓔⓢⓞⓤⓡⓒⓔⓢ : cointelegraph.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Day?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/btcc", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTCC?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pizza?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index", "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.0", "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.msg25352#msg25352", "https://bitcoinpizzaindex.net/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTC?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.msg25346#msg25346", "https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@mynameisbrian/happy-bitcoin-pizza-day-2018", "https://www.ledger.fr/2018/05/22/bitcoin-pizza-day-ledger-nano-s-limited-edition/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laszlo hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T18:49:25.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "802db499dcc093253166dbf7377dc7c07ce2bdc7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWYedrXN0FvaRG_dyKMyOErlw92Uk6B9EVuNY5MQo6LTHWpttOe1bVo_m6vCrOIWiCVVTeggGhhU8Ddd3IjoGu.ExMkZq6n.NQIvGleiK2VkMLEnXI1WN1QVw.ou0v65vMqFwRZBvo1ZdwyjIPmbxKie44QL501pc-", "site_full": "www.nation.co.ke", "site": "nation.co.ke", "site_section": "http://www.nation.co.ke/news/1998-blast-victims-to-be-paid-Sh600m-each-/-/1056/2410904/-/view/asFeed/-/vailb/-/index.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Daily Nation | News", "title": "Kidnappers demand bitcoin ransom for South African teen", "title_full": "Kidnappers demand bitcoin ransom for South African teen", "published": "2018-05-22T17:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "KE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.nation.co.ke/image/view/-/4575046/medRes/1982140/-/rljbug/-/Bitcoin.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1833, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "802db499dcc093253166dbf7377dc7c07ce2bdc7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWYedrXN0FvaRG_dyKMyOErlw92Uk6B9EVuNY5MQo6LTHWpttOe1bVo_m6vCrOIWiCVVTeggGhhU8Ddd3IjoGu.ExMkZq6n.NQIvGleiK2VkMLEnXI1WN1QVw.ou0v65vMqFwRZBvo1ZdwyjIPmbxKie44QL501pc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-22T17:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kidnappers demand bitcoin ransom for South African teen", "text": "Kidnappers demand bitcoin ransom for South African teen Tuesday May 22 2018 This case appears to be the first ransom demand in South Africa made in virtual currency. PHOTO | JENS KALAENE Advertisement More by this Author\nJOHANNESBURG\nA gang who kidnapped a South African teenager from a playground at the weekend have demanded a ransom in bitcoin cryptocurrency worth about $123,000, police said Tuesday. The 13-year-old boy was taken in the eastern province of Mpumalanga while he was playing with friends near his home and was driven away by captors in a car. \"We are investigating a case of kidnapping that happened on Sunday in Witbank (town),\" police spokesman Leonard Hlathi told AFP. \"There was a demand that was made that the parents should deposit cash in bitcoins,\" he said, declining to give further details. Local media said the ransom note was left at the scene. \"We demand ransom of 15 bitcoins to be paid into the below bitcoin wallet address to secure your child's safe release — non negotiable,\" read the reported note. This case appears to be the first ransom demand in South Africa made in virtual currency. In March, US hackers demanding a ransom payable in bitcoin attacked computers of the Atlanta city government in the southern state of Georgia. Police in South Africa, where violent crime is common, have reported a recent rise in kidnappings, although it is often wealthy business people who are targeted.

The hard fork happened following the controversy over the integration of SegWit feature with Bitcoin’s blockchain.\nA host of forks have since followed — christened by adding any random word you can imagine next to Bitcoin: Candy , Pizza , God , Faith , Diamond , Gold , Atom , etc.\nMost of the forked cryptocurrencies, however, don’t seem to have had any luck when it comes to adoption or trading volumes.\nAs per Coinmarketcap data, only four of the forks (Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Gold, and Bitcoin Private) see trading volumes of more than $100,000 per 24 hours.\nBitcoin’s software is open-sourced, and a hard fork happens when a developer clones the Bitcoin’s blockchain to make a new blockchain and cryptocurrency by modifying the original code.\nIdeally, the purpose of a hard fork is to make technical advancements in the existing blockchain, when some people still want to keep using the consensus protocol of the older blockchain.\nBut it seems that most of the hard forks are only aimed at minting quick money using Bitcoin’s name rather than bringing any significant advancements in blockchain technology.\n“Unfortunately, most fork-based projects we see today are more of a sheer money grab,” George Kimionis, CEO of Coinomi told Bloomberg at the beginning of this year predicting that 2018 will see the launch of at least 50 Bitcoin hard forks. “Looking back a few years from now we might realize that they were just mutations fostered by investors blinded by numerical price increases — rather than honest attempts to contribute to the blockchain ecosystem.”\nWith services such as Forkgen , which allow even rookie programmers to create Bitcoin hard forks, it is likely that the number will end up being a lot higher.\nLet’s see what names they’ll come up with — I am rooting for Bitcoin Butter Chicken Masala.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2018/04/28/comprehensive-guide-to-hard-forks-a-look-into-the-different-types-of-bitcoin-forks/", "https://forkgen.tech/", "https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/08/02/bitcoin-cash-is-already-the-worlds-third-largest-cryptocurrency/", "https://blog.bitmex.com/44-bitcoin-fork-coins/", "http://fortune.com/2017/08/11/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork-price-date-why/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-23/bitcoin-may-split-50-times-in-2018-as-forking-craze-accelerates", "https://thenextweb.com/topic/bitcoin/", "https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/05/22/bitcoin-hard-fork-useless/", "https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2017/09/22/everything-need-know-icos/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitmex research", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T18:02:20.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5c80f46f03d4c63f545825429f814813c313717b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFR0gNJyf9D3lE4EhudL5.T8tFFglLIaTNH58tAdNLEq2mae0jHIuQXU3X96C6mJ5GhO1Dae3XtKmI3XO8bcTCmEP787YqAdpdM-", "site_full": "forextv.com", "site": "forextv.com", "site_section": "http://forextv.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "retirement_planning", "finance"], "section_title": "ForexTV", "title": "This Bitcoin Pizza Day, Remember Not to Spend Bitcoins on Pizza", "title_full": "This Bitcoin Pizza Day, Remember Not to Spend Bitcoins on Pizza", "published": "2018-05-22T17:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5c80f46f03d4c63f545825429f814813c313717b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTqSK8yA6VG9z48jXSFWtSfxGWPNjy4dFR0gNJyf9D3lE4EhudL5.T8tFFglLIaTNH58tAdNLEq2mae0jHIuQXU3X96C6mJ5GhO1Dae3XtKmI3XO8bcTCmEP787YqAdpdM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bitcoin News Editor", "published": "2018-05-22T17:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "This Bitcoin Pizza Day, Remember Not to Spend Bitcoins on Pizza", "text": "Home / Bitcoin News Wire / This Bitcoin Pizza Day, Remember Not to Spend Bitcoins on Pizza This Bitcoin Pizza Day, Remember Not to Spend Bitcoins on Pizza Posted by: Bitcoin News Editor in Bitcoin News Wire 1 min ago\nCryptocurrency enthusiasts everywhere set aside May 22 to celebrate the anniversary of the first ever Bitcoin transaction: Two pizzas for 10,000 coins bought exactly eight years ago.

Tue 22 May 2018 14:46:11 GMT Author: Story not so great for the cryptocurrency Some recent posts on crypto include: BOJ Kuroda says that central banks are 'extremely cautious' on issuing digital currencies That is not a lot of positive for the cryptocurrency market. However, with the polarization of bitcoin/digital currency market, it can be easier to speak poorly about the product (and admittedly we don't post all the stories fit to print). So listening to the price action and tools applied to that price action, tell a story too. For Bitcoin on Coinbase, the price action is to the downside today. The price is down -$190 at 82220. The low extended to $8145. The high reached $8414.95. The tools applied to that price action shows, the price is below the 200 and 100 hour MAs (blue and green lines in the chart above). The 200 hour MA is at $8356.17 and the 100 hour MA is at $8319.83 currently. The price action has taken the price below and away from those MAs. Over the weekend, the price action did move above those lines, but could not get to the next target and the topside trend line. The news and price action, helped to send the price lower. The next target on the downside will target swing lows from March 16 at the $8103 area (see chart above) Looking more broadly at the daily chart, the price action has been able to stay below the 100 day MA for 11 straight days now (today is the 12th). That MA comes in at $8843 today. Admittedly, the price is not racing lower, but the sellers/bears still are more in control. The next targets on more selling would be swing lows at $7927 and $7822. Move below them, and the door opens for more selling potential. A trend line cuts across at $6995 (and moving higher) So the news is not that hot/bullish, and the price action and tools applied is also not that hot/bullish either. However, that sentiment can change. For Bitcoin, getting back above the 200 and 100 hour MAs would turn that bias. Until then, the sellers are more in control.

Thus, it goes hand-in-hand with propaganda and the active promotion of mis information. In Hong Kong, Roger shared that his biggest mistake was underestimating how effective censorship can be. He explained why: while established community members can easily dismiss misinformation, newcomers cannot. And since the community is a fast-growing one, the misinformed newcomers become a majority. You can read more about the history of censorship in Bitcoin here. Mindful Miners In a recent “AMA” , former Bitcoin Core developer Mike Hearn pointed out that historically, BTC miners haven’t been rational economic actors. He said they’ve been incapable of disobeying the authority of the devs. But we may be turning the corner on this. At the Coingeek conference, Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu expressed that the miners have learned from previous mistakes, and are starting to take more responsibility for understanding the protocol and making intelligent decisions. In the past, miners have followed Bitcoin Core almost unconditionally — perhaps overly fearful of “breaking” the network should their guidance not be followed to the letter. While its sensible to consult experts for their opinions, Bitcoin is not on the same order of complexity as nuclear engineering. (Incidentally, nuclear engineering has been the very metaphor used to incorrectly suggest that the community should abandon independent thinking and blindly follow developers). Bitcoin is an Economic System One of the thematic ideas presented by Dr. Wright in Hong Kong (and in previous talks) is that Bitcoin is NOT a cryptographic system. It’s an economic system that happens to use cryptography. This is the kind of revelation that’s obvious after you hear it expressed so succinctly. In my own words, it means that Bitcoin’s economic incentives are the foundation of what makes Bitcoin work. The cryptography is secondary to that. The economics are the “what” and the cryptography is the “how”. If you investigate one of Bitcoin’s predecessors, Wei Dai’s b-money , you may be surprised at how similar it is to Bitcoin. The one major element that’s missing is the set of economic incentives. Miners, Users, and the Public Discourse Miners and users have a symbiotic relationship. Users don’t have a network without miners, and miners don’t have economic incentive without users. In theory, miners are rewarded by providing the network that users want. But what if the miners don’t know what users want because the public discussion is being censored and brigaded with propaganda? What if they’re listening to the devs instead of the users, or they simply don’t understand enough about Bitcoin to make good choices? Unfortunately, miners can participate in the system and earn rewards for securing the network without understanding anything about Bitcoin. But its quite dangerous for miners to be ignorant because they’re the ones directly responsible for making the bottom line decisions about consensus rules. It’s therefore really encouraging to hear that miners are much more educated and involved than they were several years ago. The Role of Developers In the (flawed) Bitcoin Core paradigm, Bitcoin developers were the wizards and rulers. They handed down the proclamations from their ivory towers for the users and miners to follow. If you didn’t like it, you were told you could “fork off”, even as those developers denied they wielded influence over the protocol. In the actual economic model of Bitcoin, miners set the consensus rules with the ultimate consent of the users who give economic value to the system. Developers, although important, serve a tertiary role and are not directly part of the incentive model. Development Funding If developer groups need to compete (as we discussed in a previous article), then the obvious question is “what incentivizes that competition?” In the past, this has been a conundrum. How can we make sure there’s enough development resources and talent in a free, open-source software project? Yet, if we look honestly at the incentive model of Bitcoin, the answer is clear: it’s ultimately the miners’ responsibility to pay for the software they are going to run. Maybe that means mining pools directly sponsor development teams (which seems to be something that’s been irrationally shamed or presented as a conflict of interest) …Or maybe it means miners should formulate some kind of system to donate a portion of the block rewards to protocol advancement, as was proposed in a recent strategy meeting . Conclusion Bitcoin Cash is on the right track and will stay on the right track by following these 5 principles: Knowledge and education must be valued and promoted. Understanding Bitcoin is not the exclusive realm of wizards. Bitcoin (BCH) is peer to peer electronic cash. Anyone can send money to anyone else in the world, quickly, cheaply, reliably, and without permission. We can disagree on many things as long as we agree on this. We must never allow censorship, because we know propaganda and misinformation are sure to quickly follow. There needs to be multiple independent teams of developers and multiple protocol implementations. No one group should have control of the protocol. The mining community must be engaged, informed, and willing to make logical decisions that align with their own economic interests.\nWhat are your thoughts on educating the BCH community?

What does that mean? Is it again another challenge for the entrepreneur to deal with on top of everything else? Is it another opportunity? If yes, you might ask: \"How can I learn about it, use it, without getting lost in the crypto-mathematical formulae?”\nBlockchain is the technology that supports the use of bitcoin, a cryptocurrency that is making central banks and governments nervous, and it is true that the latter are not sure whether to ban bitcoin, or embrace it, or hope it will vanish as another ephemeral hype. But blockchain is nowadays more than the technology that ensures the authenticity of bitcoin. It did start that way, but it has acquired new uses, opened new opportunities and charted new vistas.\nLet's start with the beginnings, which always fascinate as they seem to tell the origin of the idea, the initial thinking behind the spark of genius, before the invention takes a life of its own and flourishes into an infinity of uses. These \"foundational moments\", as cultural critics would call them, can show us the intent behind the invention of bitcoin. Simply put, bitcoin is a digital currency set up to function without a central bank or entity to regulate it. The transactions are validated by nodal points spread over a network of computers called \"miners,\" using crypto-mathematical formulas, which once solved will allow the \"miners\" to win more bitcoins. In just a few words, individuals (using computers) solve complex mathematical questions to validate the currency, and are related to each other via a secured and unchangeable chain of blocks, which makes tampering with the authenticity of the currency almost impossible.\nThe system, which was put together by a person or a group of people called Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to sustain and secure bitcoin, is blockchain. The blocks in blockchain are knots containing encrypted information, as well as a reference to the date of the creation, and the name of the previous block to which the current block is related in a chained manner. Any change to the chain will not overwrite the existing information, but will be added as a new block, after it has been validated by all the other blocks in the network.\nBut there was another beginning. As in all beginnings, the beginning keeps receding since with revolutionary ideas, like blockchain, there is no perfect beginning- in fact, all beginnings are perfect (or imperfect) in their own way. In 1997, way before the advent of bitcoin, Nick Szabo, an American computer scientist, legal scholar and cryptographer, set up the technological and legal basis for \"smart contracts\"- the contracts that can be authenticated and validated through secure protocols without a need for lawyers or notaries or other third parties. \"Smart contracts\" got a kickstart after the development of blockchain technology a dozen years later.\nWhy should an entrepreneur be concerned with all of this? Isn't this all \"tech hype,\" as evanescent as the various daydreams about flying cars, medical labs on your smartphone, or microchips cleaning your body from malevolent cells? Future Thinkers don't think so: in fact, they have compiled a list of about 19 industries that blockchain will disrupt. These include banking and payments, cyber security, supply chain, forecasting, internet of things, insurance, transport, government, clouding, voting, and so on. Each of these sectors is already witnessing different uses of technology by burgeoning startups that seek to innovate, or be competitive, or improve the way things have been done so far. The circle is widening day by the day, and only few years after the beginning, it's not about bitcoin only anymore.\nEntrepreneurs need an answer to the following questions: \"What is it in it for me? Why should I use blockchain technology?\" The answers are simple too- blockchain is highly secure, especially with regards to contracts and financial transactions. This technology cuts out the middleman, and therefore significantly reduces costs. It is distributed (decentralized) and therefore non-regulated by a central entity, which could be at the mercy of political or other considerations. It is efficient, faster, democratic, participatory and transparent. And what should entrepreneurs and governments do to be prepared for or take advantage of blockchain? It's true that there is a lot of hype about blockchain, but the truth is that some sectors are already feeling the change. The savvy entrepreneur should jump on the bandwagon, rather than wait and see.\nHow to Get Organized With the Google Tasks App\nFirstly, governments should understand that blockchain technology could bring a set of opportunities with regard to storing data, contracts, titles, and official documents. But those on the vanguard of change -like the UAE, Singapore, Georgia, UK, Estonia- should set the example by designing laws and policies to help set the right environment for the use of this revolutionary technology.\nEntrepreneurs should also be ready to get involved and see an opportunity to do better, reduce cost, and be more effective. Banks and financial institutions could use it to speed up transactions; cybersecurity firms could rely on the participatory and cryptographic aspects to ensure improved safety and security; participatory transportation could, with blockchain, function without middlemen; startups in this field could help set up systems that become autonomous once the users become knowledgeable of how to use it; distribution of energy could cut the huge cost related to distribution and centralized management. Hence, small businesses and cooperatives could be created to teach and train users on how to buy from producers and distribute to users.\nBlockchain is neither a new monster in the zoo, nor a trend that will deflate before we know it. It is a serious technological development that will revolutionize so many sectors, provided governments and entrepreneurs invest in it now, before it becomes a reality that imposes itself when the others will have already reaped the benefit of having been pioneers. And that reality will dawn on everyone soon- probably sooner than we think.\nALL comments are In My Own OPINION.

Today I will proffer two more: censorship and propaganda were allowed to run rampant; miners didn't understand their power and responsibility. Last Friday, Coingeek.com held a fantastic conference in Hong Kong on the topic of blockchain commerce. The conference concluded with a panel discussion featuring 3 of the most well-known thought leaders in the Bitcoin Cash community: Roger Ver, Dr. Craig Wright, and Jihan Wu. Each of them said something important that pertains to these topics.\nAlso read: How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid the Same Mistakes as Bitcoin Core, Part 3\nBitcoin Cash Avoiding Censorship Censorship is an obvious barrier to an educated community and is motivated by a desire to control the narrative. Thus, it goes hand-in-hand with propaganda and the active promotion of mis information.\nIn Hong Kong, Roger shared that his biggest mistake was underestimating how effective censorship can be. He explained why: while established community members can easily dismiss misinformation, newcomers cannot. And since the community is a fast-growing one, the misinformed newcomers become a majority.\nYou can read more about the history of censorship in Bitcoin here.\nMindful Miners In a recent \"AMA\" , former Bitcoin Core developer Mike Hearn pointed out that historically, BTC miners haven't been rational economic actors. He said they've been incapable of disobeying the authority of the devs.\nBut we may be turning the corner on this. At the Coingeek conference, Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu expressed that the miners have learned from previous mistakes, and are starting to take more responsibility for understanding the protocol and making intelligent decisions.\nIn the past, miners have followed Bitcoin Core almost unconditionally — perhaps overly fearful of \"breaking\" the network should their guidance not be followed to the letter. While its sensible to consult experts for their opinions, Bitcoin is not on the same order of complexity as nuclear engineering.\n(Incidentally, nuclear engineering has been the very metaphor used to incorrectly suggest that the community should abandon independent thinking and blindly follow developers).\nBitcoin is an Economic System One of the thematic ideas presented by Dr. Wright in Hong Kong (and in previous talks) is that Bitcoin is NOT a cryptographic system. It's an economic system that happens to use cryptography.\nThis is the kind of revelation that's obvious after you hear it expressed so succinctly. In my own words, it means that Bitcoin's economic incentives are the foundation of what makes Bitcoin work. The cryptography is secondary to that. The economics are the \"what\" and the cryptography is the \"how\".\nIf you investigate one of Bitcoin's predecessors, Wei Dai's b-money , you may be surprised at how similar it is to Bitcoin. The one major element that's missing is the set of economic incentives.\nMiners, Users, and the Public Discourse Miners and users have a symbiotic relationship. Users don't have a network without miners, and miners don't have economic incentive without users.\nIn theory, miners are rewarded by providing the network that users want.\nBut what if the miners don't know what users want because the public discussion is being censored and brigaded with propaganda? What if they're listening to the devs instead of the users, or they simply don't understand enough about Bitcoin to make good choices?\nUnfortunately, miners can participate in the system and earn rewards for securing the network without understanding anything about Bitcoin. But its quite dangerous for miners to be ignorant because they're the ones directly responsible for making the bottom line decisions about consensus rules.\nIt's therefore really encouraging to hear that miners are much more educated and involved than they were several years ago.\nThe Role of Developers In the (flawed) Bitcoin Core paradigm, Bitcoin developers were the wizards and rulers. They handed down the proclamations from their ivory towers for the users and miners to follow. If you didn't like it, you were told you could \"fork off\", even as those developers denied they wielded influence over the protocol.\nIn the actual economic model of Bitcoin, miners set the consensus rules with the ultimate consent of the users who give economic value to the system.\nDevelopers, although important, serve a tertiary role and are not directly part of the incentive model.\nDevelopment Funding If developer groups need to compete (as we discussed in a previous article), then the obvious question is \"what incentivizes that competition?\"\nIn the past, this has been a conundrum. How can we make sure there's enough development resources and talent in a free, open-source software project?\nYet, if we look honestly at the incentive model of Bitcoin, the answer is clear: it's ultimately the miners' responsibility to pay for the software they are going to run.\nMaybe that means mining pools directly sponsor development teams (which seems to be something that's been irrationally shamed or presented as a conflict of interest)\n…Or maybe it means miners should formulate some kind of system to donate a portion of the block rewards to protocol advancement, as was proposed in a recent strategy meeting .\nConclusion\nBitcoin Cash is on the right track and will stay on the right track by following these 5 principles:\nKnowledge and education must be valued and promoted. Understanding Bitcoin is not the exclusive realm of wizards. Bitcoin (BCH) is peer to peer electronic cash. Anyone can send money to anyone else in the world, quickly, cheaply, reliably, and without permission. We can disagree on many things as long as we agree on this.

Today I will proffer two more: censorship and propaganda were allowed to run rampant; miners didn’t understand their power and responsibility. Last Friday, Coingeek.com held a fantastic conference in Hong Kong on the topic of blockchain commerce. The conference concluded with a panel discussion featuring 3 of the most well-known thought leaders in the Bitcoin Cash community: Roger Ver, Dr. Craig Wright, and Jihan Wu. Each of them said something important that pertains to these topics.\nAlso read: How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid the Same Mistakes as Bitcoin Core, Part 3 Bitcoin Cash Avoiding Censorship Censorship is an obvious barrier to an educated community and is motivated by a desire to control the narrative. Thus, it goes hand-in-hand with propaganda and the active promotion of mis information. In Hong Kong, Roger shared that his biggest mistake was underestimating how effective censorship can be. He explained why: while established community members can easily dismiss misinformation, newcomers cannot. And since the community is a fast-growing one, the misinformed newcomers become a majority. You can read more about the history of censorship in Bitcoin here. Mindful Miners In a recent “AMA” , former Bitcoin Core developer Mike Hearn pointed out that historically, BTC miners haven’t been rational economic actors. He said they’ve been incapable of disobeying the authority of the devs. But we may be turning the corner on this. At the Coingeek conference, Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu expressed that the miners have learned from previous mistakes, and are starting to take more responsibility for understanding the protocol and making intelligent decisions. In the past, miners have followed Bitcoin Core almost unconditionally—perhaps overly fearful of “breaking” the network should their guidance not be followed to the letter. While its sensible to consult experts for their opinions, Bitcoin is not on the same order of complexity as nuclear engineering. (Incidentally, nuclear engineering has been the very metaphor used to incorrectly suggest that the community should abandon independent thinking and blindly follow developers). Bitcoin is an Economic System One of the thematic ideas presented by Dr. Wright in Hong Kong (and in previous talks) is that Bitcoin is NOT a cryptographic system. It’s an economic system that happens to use cryptography. This is the kind of revelation that’s obvious after you hear it expressed so succinctly. In my own words, it means that Bitcoin’s economic incentives are the foundation of what makes Bitcoin work. The cryptography is secondary to that. The economics are the “what” and the cryptography is the “how”. If you investigate one of Bitcoin’s predecessors, Wei Dai’s b-money , you may be surprised at how similar it is to Bitcoin. The one major element that’s missing is the set of economic incentives. Miners, Users, and the Public Discourse Miners and users have a symbiotic relationship. Users don’t have a network without miners, and miners don’t have economic incentive without users. In theory, miners are rewarded by providing the network that users want. But what if the miners don’t know what users want because the public discussion is being censored and brigaded with propaganda? What if they’re listening to the devs instead of the users, or they simply don’t understand enough about Bitcoin to make good choices? Unfortunately, miners can participate in the system and earn rewards for securing the network without understanding anything about Bitcoin. But its quite dangerous for miners to be ignorant because they’re the ones directly responsible for making the bottom line decisions about consensus rules. It’s therefore really encouraging to hear that miners are much more educated and involved than they were several years ago. The Role of Developers In the (flawed) Bitcoin Core paradigm, Bitcoin developers were the wizards and rulers. They handed down the proclamations from their ivory towers for the users and miners to follow. If you didn’t like it, you were told you could “fork off”, even as those developers denied they wielded influence over the protocol. In the actual economic model of Bitcoin, miners set the consensus rules with the ultimate consent of the users who give economic value to the system. Developers, although important, serve a tertiary role and are not directly part of the incentive model. Development Funding If developer groups need to compete (as we discussed in a previous article), then the obvious question is “what incentivizes that competition?” In the past, this has been a conundrum. How can we make sure there’s enough development resources and talent in a free, open-source software project? Yet, if we look honestly at the incentive model of Bitcoin, the answer is clear: it’s ultimately the miners’ responsibility to pay for the software they are going to run. Maybe that means mining pools directly sponsor development teams (which seems to be something that’s been irrationally shamed or presented as a conflict of interest) …Or maybe it means miners should formulate some kind of system to donate a portion of the block rewards to protocol advancement, as was proposed in a recent strategy meeting . Conclusion Bitcoin Cash is on the right track and will stay on the right track by following these 5 principles: Knowledge and education must be valued and promoted. Understanding Bitcoin is not the exclusive realm of wizards. Bitcoin (BCH) is peer to peer electronic cash. Anyone can send money to anyone else in the world, quickly, cheaply, reliably, and without permission. We can disagree on many things as long as we agree on this. We must never allow censorship, because we know propaganda and misinformation are sure to quickly follow. There needs to be multiple independent teams of developers and multiple protocol implementations. No one group should have control of the protocol. The mining community must be engaged, informed, and willing to make logical decisions that align with their own economic interests.\nWhat are your thoughts on educating the BCH community?

Doch seit geraumer Zeit hat sich der Neukauf eines Rechners zu einem ganz besonders kostspieligen Unterfangen entwickelt. Der Grund: Die Preise für Grafikkarten befinden sich im Höhenflug und übersteigen bei vielen Modellen den ursprünglichen Kostenpunkt mittlerweile um das Zwei- bis Vierfache.\nMartin Fischer vom Fachportal „Heise Online” hat vor allem einen Grund für die Preisspirale identifiziert: Kryptomining, also das Erzeugen von Kryptowährungen wie Ethereum oder Bitcoin, die zeitweise schon wertvoller als Gold waren.\n„Weil man diese wertvolle Kryptowährung mit eigener Hardware schürfen kann, haben sich viele Menschen dazu entschieden, genau das zu tun”, erklärt Fischer. Alles, was man dazu braucht, sind Grafikkarten.\nVor allem in Ostasien haben sich Fischer zufolge industrieartige Anlagen gebildet, die Tausende Grafikkarten schürfen lassen. Schnell lernen die sogenannten Kryptofarmen, dass einige Modelle besser geeignet sind als andere.\nAktuelle Club-Events Dienstag, 05.06.18, 12:30 Berlin: Curry & Politics Dienstag, Donnerstag, Donnerstag, Montag, Mittwoch, „Ideale Grafikkarten müssen eine gewisse Rechenleistung bieten, damit die Kryptoeinheiten relativ flott erzeugt werden können”, sagt der Experte. „Gleichzeitig dürfen sie keine allzu hohe Leistungsaufnahme haben, weil das den Stromverbrauch hochtreibt, wenn viele Grafikkarten zusammengeschaltet werden.”\nimage Chaos bei ICO : Krypto-Start-up Envion sucht nach verschwundenen Millionen\nDas führt dazu, dass Farmen mit ihren Großeinkäufen für Engpässe auf dem Markt sorgen und die Preise steigen können. „Das Problem dabei ist natürlich, dass es nur eine endliche Zahl von Grafikkarten und Chips gibt, die auf dem Markt sind”, führt Fischer aus. „Die Hersteller AMD und Nvidia produzieren festgelegte Mengen, die vorher genau kalkuliert und an der Nachfrage orientiert werden.” Die riesige Nachfrage habe dazu geführt, dass die Karten teurer wurden und ihre Verfügbarkeit deutlich abnahm.\nDoch Kryptomining trägt nicht die alleinige Schuld an der Verteuerung. Wie Fischer erklärt, habe sich zudem einer der beiden größten Grafikkarten-Hersteller quasi selbst ein Bein gestellt: „AMD veröffentlichte im August 2017 eine neue Grafikkartenserie namens Radeon RX Vega. Diese Karten haben eine besondere Speichertechnik namens High Bandwith Memory (HBM), die die Speicherchips nicht mehr nebeneinander anordnet, sondern übereinander stapelt, was die Leistung der Karten erhört.”\nDas sei zwar eine spannende Technik, aber die Hersteller von HBM-Speicher konnten nicht so schnell produzieren, wie es für die Massenproduktion dieser AMD-Grafikkarten notwendig gewesen wäre, erklärt Fischer. „Insgesamt hatte das zur Folge, dass beispielsweise die Grafikkarte Radeon RX Vega 56 für einen Preis von 400 Euro angesetzt wurde.” Tatsächlich liegt der Einstiegspreis nun aber bei 620 Euro - 55 Prozent mehr also. „Und da ist auch nicht absehbar, dass das deutlich billiger wird”, so Fischer weiter.\nNeue Computerspiele stellen höhere Anforderungen Dass es zu einfach wäre, die Gründe für die Verteuerung der Grafikkarten allein aufs Kryptomining zu schieben, denkt auch Alan Priestly vom Marktforschungsunternehmen Gartner. Er verweist etwa auf die Weiterentwicklung von Computerspielen, die zunehmend höhere Anforderungen stellen: „Die Auflösungen steigen, die Bildschirme werden größer, die angezeigten Bilder pro Sekunde schießen in die Höhe. Um das ordentlich darzustellen, braucht man leistungsfähige Grafikkarten — und die sind nun mal teurer als die alten Modelle.”\nMultimedia-Special : Bauen Sie Ihre eigene Blockchain\nWenn das Kryptomining an seine unweigerliche Grenze stößt, könnten die Preise der Grafikkarten aber auch wieder sinken. „Die Frage ist, wie es mit dem Ethereum-Kurs weitergeht\", so Martin Fischer. „Bei Bitcoin war der Schürfenthusiasmus anfangs sehr hoch, und irgendwann hat die Leistung der Grafikkarten nicht mehr ausgereicht, damit man lohnend Bitcoins schürfen konnte, weil die Berechnungen immer komplexer werden mussten, um neue Einheiten zu finden. Das wird bei Etherium ähnlich sein.”\nBis es so weit ist, rät Marktforscher Priestly: „Greifen Sie wenn möglich tief in die Tasche und kaufen Sie direkt das leistungsfähigste Modell, das Sie sich leisten können. Das ist zwar teuer, so haben Sie aber auch eine Grafikkarte mit möglichst hoher Halbwertszeit.”\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://ssl-handelsblatt.met.vgwort.de/na/1702629f78a046658b21161daded1db5"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wie kryptowährungen ressourcen", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kryptowährungen", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "preis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "der grund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin fischer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fischer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kryptowährung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erzeugen von kryptowährungen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grafikkarten", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ripple & co.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "grafikkarten bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ostasien", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T00:16:11.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6ffdd5f9ce9284d4feadeefff2fca7562b3e0478", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DsoWwvdICsaGE0XNMkmhKPmQ8Wk.1lv6JkaPzO7weCYFVlfou1ixKOGa7MJzP8V57wIInIiOuCjMtCOM0.QCjnt52rWNqwCD8H6HN3Q1Cn6jB8FzsoAOreOv7HD.TGyWlNNImzfqAHE1xfuSPhoEtxorxiVnNnjY-", "site_full": "www.themountainherald.com", "site": "themountainherald.com", "site_section": "http://www.themountainherald.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Mountain Herald", "title": "Bitcoin Market Expected to Generate Surprising Revenues in Upcoming Years", "title_full": "Bitcoin Market Expected to Generate Surprising Revenues in Upcoming Years", "published": "2018-05-22T17:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6ffdd5f9ce9284d4feadeefff2fca7562b3e0478", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DsoWwvdICsaGE0XNMkmhKPmQ8Wk.1lv6JkaPzO7weCYFVlfou1ixKOGa7MJzP8V57wIInIiOuCjMtCOM0.QCjnt52rWNqwCD8H6HN3Q1Cn6jB8FzsoAOreOv7HD.TGyWlNNImzfqAHE1xfuSPhoEtxorxiVnNnjY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-22T17:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Market Expected to Generate Surprising Revenues in Upcoming Years", "text": "Bitcoin Market Expected to Generate Surprising Revenues in Upcoming Years May 22 Print This Article Share it With Friends HTF MI published a new industry research that focuses on Bitcoin market and delivers in-depth market analysis and future prospects of Global and United States Bitcoin market.

ANON coin was developed to address the demand for a cryptocurrency that provides truly anonymous transactions. A list of participating exchanges is expected by August 15, 2018, and the remainder of the BTCA testnet will take place up to the snapshot on September 9, 2018. ANON will officially be available on September 10, 2018 at a 1:1 ratio to holders of Bitcoin (BTC) and ZClassic (ZCL).\nAs it is a co-fork of BTC and ZCL, one must hold BTC or ZCL prior to the fork to acquire ANON. The maximum amount of ANON will be 31.5 million, with 24 million ANON available when the fork occurs. BTCA intends to set ANON apart from other forks by succeeding where previous forks did not. The team cites lack of anonymous transactions, high transactions fees, and lengthy transaction times as some of the failures their coin will circumvent.\nThe ability to anonymously transact draws many to cryptocurrency. BTC, the most prominent cryptocurrency, does not facilitate anonymous transactions. ANON draws from the privacy protocol of ZCL to provide anonymous transactions by using the same MIT-developed zkSNARKs privacy protocol. The zkSNARKs protocol allows for verifiable transactions without requiring interaction between the prover and verifier. As such, transactions are both secure and completely anonymous.\nWhile previous forks, like ZCL, have succeeded in providing anonymous transactions, they have fallen short in other ways that deterred widespread market adoption of the currency. The BTCA team includes several crypto and Fintech veterans who have observed other forks and what the crypto community wants to see. Increased block size and incorporation of masternodes are two features the BTCA team integrated into ANON in response to crypto market demand. Developers increased block size to support faster transaction times. Masternodes provide an opportunity for return on investment for holders of a minimum required amount of a particular coin. Through masternodes, holders of ANON can stake the currency. Staking incentivizes holding the coin for extended periods of time.\nThe BTCA team intends that ANON is accessible and appealing to both those who have never used crypto and existing crypto users. As such, a community presence and transparent development are core principles for BTCA. BTCA has a social media presence, through which they communicate with their public. Videos of the forking process, frequent updates, and Q&A events allow anyone to follow the forking process.

Mining them is 60 percent less profitable than it was in 2017. Even retailers of hobbyist mining rigs say they are seeing fewer customers.\nWhy, then, is Canaan Inc, a leading cryptocurrency mining rig supplier, looking to raise up to $2 billion, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal, in the world’s biggest bitcoin-focused initial public offering to date? Canaan is expected to present itself to investors not so much as a bitcoin company, but as a chip designer focused on developing other markets in artificial intelligence and blockchain, the electronic ledger that underpins bitcoin.“Their customers happen to be bitcoin miners. But they are a chip company, not a bitcoin company,” said one of the sources. Both declined to be named because information about the IPO has not yet been made public. The offering for Canaan, which claims to be the world’s second-largest bitcoin mining hardware supplier, is scheduled for July, the sources said. Canaan declined to comment. The Beijing-based company’s profits rose seven-fold last year to 361 million yuan ($56.67 million), according to its prospectus, as bitcoin’s soaring price drove a surge in demand for its products, sold under the AvalonMiner brand. But the effects of bitcoin’s volatility and rising mining costs can be seen in the shops of Sham Shui Po, just a few kilometres from Hong Kong’s central business district, where the IPO has been filed. Businesses selling mining rigs there said demand - especially for high-end machines - was limping along. Alvin Wong said the only rig in his Hong Kong electronics store this week was plugged in underneath the cash register, busily crunching numbers in search of profit.“Since we weren’t selling the miner, we thought we might as well use it,” said Wong, a sales representative at Centralfield, in the Sham Shui Po computer district. The change has come suddenly. Just a few months ago, demand for bitcoin mining gear in Sham Shui Po was booming. [nL4N1PY242] Bitcoin prices have fallen 40 percent this year, hurting margins for miners. The cryptocurrency rose from $1,000 in January last year to more than $19,000 in December. Currently, one bitcoin is worth about $8,400. PROMISED LAND To some, the IPO presents a rare opportunity to buy into in a cryptocurrency supply company. They point to the old investing adage that the surest way to make money in a gold rush is to sell mining equipment.“Investors are always looking for crypto ‘picks and shovels’, and that’s what this is,” said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Kenetic Capital, a Hong Kong based blockchain and crypto currency investment firm. Canaan produces mining machines containing application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which are chips designed for a single purpose. Its customers are mostly large-scale miners with facilities holding thousands of machines working around the clock. However, the rules governing bitcoin limit the amount that can be mined at one time. This means that the more computers there are mining, the more work and electricity are needed to earn the tokens. Fast-rising capacity in the industry has hit profits hard: combined with the fall in bitcoin prices, analysts at Bernstein estimate that mining revenues are just 37 percent of their 2017 peak at roughly $17 million per day. Last month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), the world’s largest chip manufacturer, cited uncertainty in the crypto market as a reason it was cutting its full-year sales target. TSMC is a major producer for Canaan Creative and its larger rival, Bitmain. Cryptocurrency mining is under pressure in China. But last month, China Securities Regulatory Commission vice-chairman Jiang Yang gave Canaan the regulator’s apparent approval. Visiting its factory, he said: “no matter what the chip is used for, fundamentally you’re still a chip company, and I hope you list in China,” according to mainland media reports. MARKET TEST Bitcoin-related companies have to date largely avoided diving directly into the public market - a fact illustrated by the pricing range suggested for Canaan’s deal. Although the two sources were confident the IPO could raise $2 billion, others with knowledge of the deal said it was more likely to raise between $500 million and $1 billion. A lack of comparable companies makes it harder to price. In Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014. Eighteen months later, however, the company changed its name to DigitalX and switched its focus to fintech software. Last year in Canada, listed miner Leeta Gold became HIVE Blockchain.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [],

To accomplish this, the attacker manipulated a bug in the Verge code that allows malicious miners to set false timestamps on blocks and then rapidly mine new ones in quick succession. $XVG @vergecurrency is once again under attack, someone is 51%’ing the chain and invalidating all legit blocks. All pools and miners suffer from this, the attacker is getting all blocks currently.\n— supr nova *no giveaways* (@SuprnovaPools) May 22, 2018\nThe Verge protocol uses a rotation of five mining algorithms, and an image supplied by ocminer suggests that the attacker gained control of two of them — scrypt and lyra2re — mined them at virtually no difficulty, and used false timestamps to trick the network into accepting them into the main chain. Source: ocminer/BitcoinTalk\nThe attack appears to have been carried out between blocks 2155850 and 2206272, enabling the attacker to abscond with approximately 35 million XVG — worth $1.75 million at the current exchange rate — in just a few hours. The attack had subsided by the time of writing, though there does not appear to be anything that would prevent an attacker from resuming it again in the future. The attacker managed to gain control of two XVG algorithms and mine them at almost no difficulty. | Source: verge-blockchain.info\nThe response from Verge’s developers, meanwhile, has been less from reassuring. The project acknowledged a mining-related issue in a Monday afternoon tweet but attributed it to a DDoS attack directed at several XVG mining pools. The account has not tweeted since. it appears some mining pools are under ddos attack, and we are experiencing a delay in our blocks, we are working to resolve this.\n— vergecurrency (@vergecurrency) May 22, 2018\nThe attack appears similar to the one experienced by the Verge network less than two months ago when a malicious miner acquired 20 million XVG, worth more than $1.1 million at the time. Then, as now, Verge developers downplayed the severity of the exploit, drawing criticism from many in the community.\nVerge activated an emergency hard fork intended to address the bug, but critics including ocminer argued that the upgrade was merely a “band-aid” and did not eliminate the underlying vulnerability.\nThe XVG price has declined approximately seven percent over the past 24 hours, which is moderately worse than the market as a whole. XVG currently ranks as the 31st-largest cryptocurrency and has a circulating market cap of about $752 million.\nAs CCN reported, Verge recently inked a high-profile partnership with the owner of the world’s largest adult entertainment sites to enable users to purchase premium content using XVG.\n“Well clearly @mindgeek made the right decision and chose a secure, robust cryptocurrency to implement,” concluded Riccardo Spagni, lead maintainer for privacy-centric cryptocurrency Monero, in a Tuesday tweet .\nVerge did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/vergecurrency/status/998764810698358786?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/fluffypony/status/998926597364371456", "https://twitter.com/search?q=%24XVG&src=ctag&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/vergecurrency?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/SuprnovaPools/status/998833670311088128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T02:50:57.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "73e22d5f66896dd5b9f221d5c013457e629eb65a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhEyWq5ZjFOQ7Z2EuP3sQUKo-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-22T17:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "73e22d5f66896dd5b9f221d5c013457e629eb65a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhEyWq5ZjFOQ7Z2EuP3sQUKo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-22T17:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 22, 2018 NEWS Bitcoin Is For Agile Companies Forbes Time and again you will hear that Bitcoin is magic money that has no use or purpose and has no intrinsic value.

CFO (bitcoin)", "text": "The bitcoin price is too volatile to make it a useful payment tool for merchants, PayPal CFO John Rainey claimed in a recent interview. Bitcoin Price Too Volatile for Merchants Rainey made this claim during a recent episode of “ Mad Money ,” explaining that merchant margins are too thin to make bitcoin a viable payment medium. You have a “10 percent margin on a product that you sell and you accept bitcoin, for example, and the very next day it moves 15 percent, you’re now underwater on that transaction,” he said. Admittedly, itcoin and cryptocurrency prices are a lot more volatile than their fiat counterparts. A 1% or 2% swing in forex is considered a major move, whereas a 15% bitcoin price movement is not extraordinary, although it has swung upwards just as quickly in recent years. Rainey did go on to suggest that if merchant demand increased in the future, they would look at their bitcoin policy again. When talking about the possibility of accepting crypto in the future, Rainey went on to say: “You could have something that appeals to consumers, but if merchants don’t accept it, it’s of little value. Right now, we don’t see a lot of interest from our merchants. But if it’s something that stabilizes in the future and is a better currency, then we’ll certainly support that.” PayPal’s Cryptocurrency Plans\nPayPal CEO John Rainey says the bitcoin price is too volatile for merchants, but the company has won a patent for a cryptocurrency payment system.\nDespite Rainey’s comments, an increasing number of companies accept bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a payment method, primarily through third-party payment processors that convert the funds to local fiat currency at the point of sale to shelter merchants from price volatility. Overstock was the first major retailer to accept crypto, and it continues to do so today. Expedia enables users to pay for hotels and holidays with bitcoin, and some Subway locations also accept the largest cryptocurrency. Many smaller stores accept bitcoin, as well, and the number of outlets, both digital and real-world, accepting additional cryptocurrencies like litecoin and ethereum also continues to grow. Some PayPal founders and executives haven’t pulled their punches when talking about Bitcoin in the past. Founding CEO Bill Harris described Bitcoin as “ the greatest scam in history ” before claiming that it cost valuable natural resources, that almost nobody accepts it as a payment method, and that it has no intrinsic worth — arguments that the Bitcoin community have had to field for many years now. Despite the bearish outlook of some executives, the online payment processor filed a patent in March this year for a system that would enable cryptocurrency users to swap private keys off-chain, rather than having to send coins over the network. The company is clearly keeping a keen eye on the sector, as it develops. https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-price-too-volatile-for-merchants-says-paypal-cfo/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john ra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rainey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "paypal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin price too volatile for merchants", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T17:06:44.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "689eb15a7ef3a0b38e237e3b3c4b76d835247743", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQWz8AHCkWPliMWNWEi2fRpyqc2HsE24mujiOalz2bMFgadLo05pQPcHWhcikNRg1749nthYJKvcndvC7aKznUN5H0LGmwSp.sZoyiq49setA--", "site_full": "normanhafizi.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://normanhafizi.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Mencari Keredhaan-Mu, Ya Allah, Ya Tuhanku...", "title": "www.ccn.com : Don’t Tell Jamie!

JPMorgan May Help Its Clients Invest in Cryptocurrency (bitcoin)", "text": "\nJPMorgan, the largest bank in the US with a $384 billion market valuation, has tasked Fintech and In-Residence programme head Oliver Harris to create various strategies the corporation could utilize to help its clients to invest in the cryptocurrency market. Motivation In 2017, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who is often described as one of the most powerful figures in the global finance industry, heavily condemned bitcoin by calling the dominant cryptocurrency a fraud. In January of this year, CCN reported that Dimon regretted offering a premature criticism of bitcoin. Dimon stated that he regret making comments such as “bitcoin is a fraud” and “bitcoin is worse than the tulip bubble.” Dimon said: “The bitcoin to me was always what the governments are gonna feel about bitcoin as it gets really big, and I just have a different opinion than other people. I’m not interested that much in the subject at all. The blockchain is real. You can have crypto yen and dollars and stuff like that. ICO’s you have to look at individually.” JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin a “fraud” that is “worth nothing,” though he has walked back those comments in recent months.\nSeveral experts and large-scale investors in the cryptocurrency sector such as Blocktower Capital founder Ari Paul, a cryptocurrency hedge fund founded and operated by former Goldman Sachs executives, have previously stated that they do not believe Dimon lacks knowledge in the cryptocurrency sector. Rather, Dimon perceives bitcoin as a threat to the offshore banking services JPMorgan offers, as cryptocurrencies can transfer large sums of money in orders of magnitude better than banks. In an interview with Business Insider, Paul explained: “So most of the financial luminaries, I think genuinely don’t understand what it’s trying to be. Jamie Dimon’s an exception. By all accounts, I know people who spoke to him about cryptocurrency four years ago. He gets it, he understands it, probably better than me and he views it, I think, as a brand new competitor to JPMorgan. So he understands that JPMorgan collects a lot of fees for providing a storage of wealth in a secure way that’s judgement resistant to clients, and bitcoin does it an order of magnitude better.” Entering the Cryptocurrency Market Although JPMorgan acknowledges and considers bitcoin as a threat to its business model, it has started to prepare strategies and products the bank could use to facilitate the demand from its clients because the cryptocurrency market has become more difficult to dismiss and the demand from investors in the public market has drastically increased over the past year. Moving forward, Harris, who was appointed as the head of the firm’s new cryptocurrency department, will report into JPMorgan blockchain initiatives head Umar Farooq and work with the bank’s blockchain analysts and developers to serve clients that are seeking to invest in cryptocurrencies as a long-term investment. Already, other major banks like Morgan Stanley have started to create products that allow investors to invest in the cryptocurrency market with minimal risks. Given that Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, NYSE, and JPMorgan have all started to develop cryptocurrency trading products in a similar time frame, it is likely that the finance sector will see public cryptocurrency instruments by the end of this year by these major banks. https://www.ccn.com/dont-tell-jamie-jpmorgan-may-help-its-clients-invest-in-cryptocurrency/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jamie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oliver harris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie dimon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jpmorgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cryptocurrency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T17:05:15.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ce986f6a53fbce6974bb37be11d4d3eeb0a5af0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSaMU5e985FKloqYuGazzexM6XEMoqVA3eLltmjWrJchZDGit1ofq3fUB1dmDQTdnIMwSE3QVE6dQ6I1HqSXB45OIE.RimgHUdtITzFVK2OqeQHsMPzm4JBg--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "r/CryptoMarkets", "title": "Craig Wright: Bitcoin Cash Will Make All Others Sidechains", "title_full": "Craig Wright: Bitcoin Cash Will Make All Others Sidechains : CryptoMarkets", "published": "2018-05-22T17:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.028, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ce986f6a53fbce6974bb37be11d4d3eeb0a5af0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSaMU5e985FKloqYuGazzexM6XEMoqVA3eLltmjWrJchZDGit1ofq3fUB1dmDQTdnIMwSE3QVE6dQ6I1HqSXB45OIE.RimgHUdtITzFVK2OqeQHsMPzm4JBg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Proof_Chip", "published": "2018-05-22T17:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Craig Wright: Bitcoin Cash Will Make All Others Sidechains", "text": "submitted by /u/Proof_Chip\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cryptocomes.com/craig-wright-bitcoin-cash-will-make-all-others-sidechains"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T13:01:28.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "552525cb73a7099c6737519f3e9f47d00782ac63", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJVDZ1QK.O8Pn7w9T0Kw2sABGBr19dPZnukigQ3H6jz9RUy_bMfRNQu4yJ70WckiE7VXcVgJfZj9UxGnQAq2E1mA1zkFkCQZ.a.ocUOm6Q6Vo0vFJxfYa_AxYDoYVN0qeZQpSY0mtG1_ecq7oiaYBrtoE9S76DbKrxa17YnWu0KN8yl8.juUJDd9qe1pmavlea2mhwZEqlTAyuXfzFiqrG4OsfMBTIj0dRFSuXoYwxeD5FQP82SNN7mGCHPgKNQHAwpCQFJ6fSdVIFWT03rkxQ0HTFnPEU4B12ngNmYL0WGtWl6J6evOUzPPKTPQHPz0z.tNlQztRCxLjpjla.IB0RdCOozyXKgaB8Q.eLJ4XqQbrA--", "site_full": "news.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "http://www.nigeriatoday.ng/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Nigeria Today", "title": "8 years ago, a programmer paid 10000 bitcoins for 2 Papa John’s pizzas — now it’s the most celebrated day in crypto – Business Insider", "title_full": "8 years ago, a programmer paid 10000 bitcoins for 2 Papa John’s pizzas — now it’s the most celebrated day in crypto – Business Insider", "published": "2018-05-22T17:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "NG", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "552525cb73a7099c6737519f3e9f47d00782ac63", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJVDZ1QK.O8Pn7w9T0Kw2sABGBr19dPZnukigQ3H6jz9RUy_bMfRNQu4yJ70WckiE7VXcVgJfZj9UxGnQAq2E1mA1zkFkCQZ.a.ocUOm6Q6Vo0vFJxfYa_AxYDoYVN0qeZQpSY0mtG1_ecq7oiaYBrtoE9S76DbKrxa17YnWu0KN8yl8.juUJDd9qe1pmavlea2mhwZEqlTAyuXfzFiqrG4OsfMBTIj0dRFSuXoYwxeD5FQP82SNN7mGCHPgKNQHAwpCQFJ6fSdVIFWT03rkxQ0HTFnPEU4B12ngNmYL0WGtWl6J6evOUzPPKTPQHPz0z.tNlQztRCxLjpjla.IB0RdCOozyXKgaB8Q.eLJ4XqQbrA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Business - Google News", "published": "2018-05-22T17:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "8 years ago, a programmer paid 10000 bitcoins for 2 Papa John’s pizzas — now it’s the most celebrated day in crypto – Business Insider", "text": "8 years ago, a programmer paid 10000 bitcoins for 2 Papa John's pizzas — now it's the most celebrated day in crypto Business Insider Happy Bitcoin Pizza Day!
