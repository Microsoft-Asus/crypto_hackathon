As we get ready for the 5/14 (Monday) session, price has rebounded to almost $8800. If we look at the daily and the 1H chart, we are seeing a different picture, and this divergence might translate into some choppiness before BTC/USD settles on a directional swing.\nBTC/USD 1H Chart\n(click to enlarge) In the 1H chart, we can see that the most recent recovery is still within the context of the recent bearish trend. As of 8:00PM ET, price has stalled under $8800 and the 100-hour SMA. The 1H RSI is still mostly under 60, which reflects maintenance of the prevailing bearish momentum. So, while we might are seeing a recovery, the prevailing bearish trend is still alive. Looking at the daily chart below, we can see that the RSI has tagged 70 and is still holding above 40. In that sense, the bullish momentum since April is still alive. The 1H chart looks bearish, while the daily chart has a slight bullish sign. But, I think BTC/USD is mainly bearish, and could fall below $8000 after resolving some choppiness in the short-term. The fact that price has been holding under the 200-day MSA since March suggests we are still in a bearish market. If price can hold above $8000 and climb back above $9000, I would put the bearish outlook on the shelf. We will reassess if that happens. Otherwise, we should anticipate a slide towards the $7400-$7600 area.\nBTC/USD Daily Chart", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T05:01:41.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ea767f22b8b963d051713015391bbf90097a1d2f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSaMU5e985FKloqYuGazzexM6XEMoqVA3eYxLRE2IAhxFqdn6mq9.gAMZdpgLF.FHijsI.RvHVFWnitW_gBMB9sC7UjlwaXY1VAdYN.oYsSgwPTeESG_gVLeynFckykihD", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "r/CryptoMarkets", "title": "Bitcoin Blacklisted: Why You Should Ditch Medium.com", "title_full": "Bitcoin Blacklisted: Why You Should Ditch Medium.com : CryptoMarkets", "published": "2018-05-14T04:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.033, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ea767f22b8b963d051713015391bbf90097a1d2f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSaMU5e985FKloqYuGazzexM6XEMoqVA3eYxLRE2IAhxFqdn6mq9.gAMZdpgLF.FHijsI.RvHVFWnitW_gBMB9sC7UjlwaXY1VAdYN.oYsSgwPTeESG_gVLeynFckykihD", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MalcolmRoseGaming", "published": "2018-05-14T04:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Blacklisted: Why You Should Ditch Medium.com", "text": "submitted by /u/MalcolmRoseGaming\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T00:53:19.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b34f9f5178a4a33a58a145e7db62b270ce39c333", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdc_.vC256dNeL25q5clyxQ6e8Vq3LXInYyJ26bWydPSQXLKqUQykPTU0P2lC_2kOCZ5HJbGaObBsnI9avY1mDmzb0X2NxNwFtH_ltQPJ_4cFX0V3BBD5k4", "site_full": "canadianstocktrader.ca", "site": "canadianstocktrader.ca", "site_section": "http://canadianstocktrader.ca/feed", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Canadian Stock Trader", "title": "Generate Bitcoin 0.02 – 0.5 Bitcoin Daily (Update 2018) – paccoin", "title_full": "Generate Bitcoin 0.02 – 0.5 Bitcoin Daily (Update 2018) – paccoin", "published": "2018-05-14T04:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://canadianstocktrader.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hqdefault-984.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b34f9f5178a4a33a58a145e7db62b270ce39c333", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdc_.vC256dNeL25q5clyxQ6e8Vq3LXInYyJ26bWydPSQXLKqUQykPTU0P2lC_2kOCZ5HJbGaObBsnI9avY1mDmzb0X2NxNwFtH_ltQPJ_4cFX0V3BBD5k4", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Canadian Stock Trader", "published": "2018-05-14T04:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Generate Bitcoin 0.02 – 0.5 Bitcoin Daily (Update 2018) – paccoin", "text": "laurance zvahl oh no she didnt taurus tarot reading january 2018 nabila gardena youtube doing english podcast episode 2 बिसमा फिलम.?

I chose to host my content on Medium.com. Unfortunately, it seems like they are very hostile to crypto; indeed, crypto-related accounts on this platform have been vanishing left and right for totally frivolous reasons (hi, /u/Jarunik !).\nWell, it finally happened to me. They didn't give me any warning so I could move my work elsewhere or resolve whatever TOS issue they had with my content. They didn't even bother to let me know that I had been \"suspended\" - or really, blacklisted/deleted. Indeed, as long as I was logged into my account it looked like my articles were still online! On top of this, once I figured out what was going on, they wouldn't even tell me what rule they thought I violated. Crazy, right?\nWell, my understanding is that the community likes to keep abreast of banks, companies, platforms, and so on that are hostile to cryptocurrency.

Per Wikipedia it is a Worldwide payment system. That alone shall leave you with a great deal of questions. Lord knows I have been confused by it all. But let’s try together to make some sense of Bitcoin.\nSince Bitcoin is an online currency, it can be easily transferred from one person or another, to another. Unlike traditional currency, it is not controlled by any institution or government. The Federal Reserve has no place in the world of Bitcoin – instead this is a peer to peer transaction that operates by computer and users. A digital address identifies the owners of the currency although the identify of the owner is not revealed due to encryption.\nHere’s where it can easily become confusing – Bitcoins are created through mining which is the process of adding records of a new transaction to the Blockchain – the public ledger of all transactions that have ever taken place in the Bitcoin network. New transactions are added in batches called “blocks” approximately every 10 minutes. The ledger is needed to always be able to confirm valid transactions.\nTo begin you need to set up a wallet and fill it up with Bitcoin through the Bitcoin exchange. Through the exchange you try to buy Bitcoin at the lowest possible prices while sellers try to sell Bitcoin at the highest possible price. Once you have Bitcoin in your wallet – you can make purchases through stores that accept it as a form of payment. When you make a purchase to a vendors unique address the transaction is processed through miners. Mark Dukas can help you make sense of all the Bitcoin cents!\nNow I want to be clear – there is more than one type of virtual currency. So when someone in conversation refers to virtual currency, it is not synonymous with Bitcoin. Think of mayonnaise – yeah I know strange comparison. Mayonnaise is like virtual currency and Hellmans is like Bitcoin. But there is also Kraft, Miracle Whip and so many others. What other types of virtual currency are there? Well as the moment there are: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, Dogecoin and Peercoin – though Bitcoin is the most popular and most widely accepted. I believe the list may be even larger but those are the virtual currencies that I have heard of.\nWhat are some places you can use Bitcoin? Places like TigerDirect, Overstock.com, Shopify, Gyft, Expedia and more.

This seems extremely bullish for bitcoin.\nAt the Consensus event - Wednesday 16th at 9:10am Microsoft will be presenting the following:\n\"DECENTRALIZED IDENTITY FOR A DECENTRALIZED WORLD\nEmpower users to own and control their Identity. In this session Microsoft, along with Sovrin, Blockstack and uPort will share why we need Decentralized Identity. We will share proof of concept from first set of proposed standards and challenges ahead with a decentralized identity experience for everyone and everything.\"\nThe idea behind this is for people to own their own identity (and property) information rather than having corporations holding your details and having to verify every user. This is an extremely big industry and costs user and corporations heaps in security, verification processes, customer service etc..\nI believe this is going to be built [primarily] on the bitcoin lightning network. Microsoft have already released the following:\n\"To support a vast world of users, organizations, and devices, the underlying technology must be capable of scale and performance on par with traditional systems. Some public blockchains (Bitcoin [BTC], [E TH], [L TC], to name a select few) provide a solid foundation for rooting DIDs, recording DPKI operations, and anchoring attestations. While some blockchain communities have increased on-chain transaction capacity (e.g. blocksize increases), this approach generally degrades the decentralized state of the network and cannot reach the millions of transactions per second the system would generate at world-scale. To overcome these technical barriers, we are collaborating on decentralized Layer 2 protocols that run atop these public blockchains to achieve global scale, while preserving the attributes of a world class DID system.\"\nSource: https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2018/02/12/decentralized-digital-identities-and-blockchain-the-future-as-we-see-it/\nClearly bitcoin is way ahead with second layer solutions (lightning network) and will therefore be the strongest candidate to run this system.\nVerifying this, the lead microsoft developer, Daniel Buchner, tweeted this morning;\n\"I was intro'd to Bitcoin in early 2011 by a good friend at Mozilla.

The price declined sharply and moved below the $9,000 and $8,500 support levels. The decline was such that the price traded towards the $8,200 level. It also broke a connecting bullish trend line at $9,000. A low was formed at $8,226 before buyers appeared. Later, the price started consolidating losses above $8,200 and is currently stable. \\n\nIt tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $9,479 high to $8,226 low. It seems like the price is finding it hard to move above the $8,500 level, which is also a pivot level. Above the $8,500 level, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $9,479 high to $8,226 low is at $8,850. There is also a significant bearish trend line forming with resistance at $8,900 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC\\/USD pair. Therefore, the price is likely to face sellers near the $8,500 and $8,900 levels. Once there is a proper close above $8,900 and $9,000, there could be more gains towards $9,500. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the current price action is slightly bearish below $8,900.

I chose to host my content on Medium.com. Unfortunately, it seems like they are very hostile to crypto; indeed, crypto-related accounts on this platform have been vanishing left and right for totally frivolous reasons (hi, /u/Jarunik !).\nWell, it finally happened to me. They didn't give me any warning so I could move my work elsewhere or resolve whatever TOS issue they had with my content. They didn't even bother to let me know that I had been \"suspended\" - or really, blacklisted/deleted. Indeed, as long as I was logged into my account it looked like my articles were still online! On top of this, once I figured out what was going on, they wouldn't even tell me what rule they thought I violated. Crazy, right?\nWell, my understanding is that the community likes to keep abreast of banks, companies, platforms, and so on that are hostile to cryptocurrency. My opinion is that Medium is one of these companies. Thankfully, I am a computer scientist, so I was able to quickly spool up my own site. This is the first article I've written since the changeover, and I hope you find it interesting.

One shoe can't fit everyone. Therefore, we are going to talk about different ways of getting Bitcoins for free. You may be wondering if you can get Bitcoins for free. It's possible. In this article, we are going to talk about 6 ways to achieve this purpose. Let's talk about them.\nGetting paid in Bitcoin Gambling and scams Falling for scams\nDon't fall for scams or you will lose all your money. So, if you avoid a scam, you can use any other method to make money. You can't earn digital currency through these scams. For instance, if an offer asks you to pay a certain amount and you have no idea what you are going to get in exchange, know that it's a scam.\nSince cryptocurrencies are quite expensive, it's not a good idea to take risks and fall for a scam. After all, you don't want to end up losing your hard earned money in a second.\nBitcoin games\nThere are some games out there that will pay you a small amount of this digital currency if you play it for a while. Typically, these games have a lot of ads attached to them.\nAll you need to do is keep playing the game and viewing the ads. This way the developers can earn through the ads and pay you a portion of their earnings.\nIf you don't have a problem viewing the ads, you can play these games and earn some digital money in return.\nMining\nA couple of years back, it was possible to earn tons of Bitcoins through the process of mining. Nowadays, it has become a lot more difficult. Today, the market is dominated by big guns that have special equipment for mining.\nIf you want to mine the currency, we suggest that you invest in lots of powerful hardware. You can't just use your computer for this purpose.\nUse Affiliate programs\nAs far as my opinion is concerned, this is the easiest way of earning Bitcoins for free. It's worth it. Affiliate programs work in all industries and cryptocurrency is no exception. For instance, you can choose to refer a friend in order to earn a discount or get paid in Bitcoins.\nGet paid in Bitcoin\nActually, it's not 100% free. However, technically it can be called \"free\". Again, it's like a game reward. You can do this in many ways. For instance, you can ask for donations in Bitcoins on your site. You can work with someone who pays in digital currency. You may also ask your employers to release your pay in digital currency. This is possible if your employers already pay in cryptocurrency.\nIf you are pretty hopeful that Bitcoin is going to go up in value, we suggest that you go ahead and pay cash to buy it. This is the safest method so far. But if this is not possible for you, then you can choose any of the methods give above. Hopefully, one or two of the methods will work for you.\nDo you want to know more about how to get free Bitcoins ?

Bitbond uses cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to bypass the Swift international transfer system to lend money across the globe rapidly and at low cost. “Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,” Albrecht told Reuters TV in his office in Berlin’s fashionable neighborhood Prenzlauer Berg. “With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.” Clients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates. Bitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally. Albrecht’s service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013. His office employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month. Most clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don’t exceed 50,000 dollars. In 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since. Adoption of Bitcoin has been rapid in Germany.

(Nasdaq: FB ) is generating buzz, because it might launch its own cryptocurrency in the future. Financial outlet Cheddar reported today that the company is holding high-level discussions about how to implement blockchain technology into its platform. It’s also considering launching its own cryptocurrency. The team leader of Facebook’s blockchain research group is also a board member of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. Some people aren’t too thrilled about Goldman Sachs Group’s (NYSE: GS ) decision to launch a Bitcoin desk. A professor at Warwick Business School in England said that Goldman’s decision will “open the box” for pure speculation in the global cryptocurrency markets. Of course, many speculate Goldman just wants to manipulate the market. Despite today’s downturn in the broader cryptocurrency market, there was a bright spot. Augur popped more than 10% after the coin was listed on Binance. Augur was the only coin in the top 100 by market capitalization to show a gain north of 10% on the day.

If anything, the State Bank has barred commercial banks and financial firms from dealing in cryptocurrency which, of course, makes life harder for local exchanges. Individual traders, however, are finding alternative ways to acquire or sell cryptocurrencies, defying the warnings and the prohibitions.\nAlso read: India’s Supreme Court Keeps Ban on Banks’ Crypto Services, For Now\nCentral Bank Can’t Ban Cryptocurrency in Pakistan\nPakistan’s experience with cryptocurrencies offers another example of how ineffective financial authorities can be when trying to fill a legal vacuum with prohibitive administrative measures. Central banks often forget they are neither parliaments, nor governments, and their regulatory overreach cannot legitimately substitute the normal legal process. The recent decision of the State Bank of Pakistan to ban crypto-related activities proves that observation.\nIn early April, the SBP issued a circular on the “prohibition of dealing in virtual currencies”, right after a similar measure by the Reserve Bank of India, the regional rival. Unlike their Indian colleagues, who gave banks and traders three months to comply, Pakistani central bankers imposed the ban with immediate effect. SBP said virtual currencies and tokens were not legal tender and reminded it had not authorized any individual or entity to issue, sell, purchase, or exchange any such coins in Pakistan. All banks, microfinance entities, payment system operators and service providers were “advised to refrain” from dealing in cryptocurrencies.\nThe local market is by no means comparable to India’s booming crypto sector. According to Danyal Manzar, CEO of Pakistan’s first bitcoin exchange Urdubit, about 100 different digital coins were being traded daily across all mediums before the ban. His trading platform decided to close down permanently following the prohibition. “The decision was made in haste. Ample time should always be provided for a proper shutdown. But we respect the SBP’s decision,” he told The Express Tribune .\nImmediately after the ban, Urdubit warned its clients to withdraw both their fiat and their crypto funds. A month later, however, some of its users still have bitcoins in their accounts on the platform.

He promptly forgot about them until widespread media coverage of the anonymous, decentralised, peer-to-peer digital currency in April 2013 jogged his memory.\nBitcoins are stored in encrypted wallets secured with a private key, something Koch had forgotten. After eventually working out what the password could be, Koch got a pleasant surprise:\n“It said I had 5,000 bitcoins in there. Measuring that in today’s rates it’s about NOK5m ($886,000),” Koch told NRK.\nIn April 2013, the value of bitcoin peaked at $266 before crashing to a low of $50 soon after. Since then, bitcoin has seen large fluctuations in its value, most recently following the seizure of online drugs marketplace Silk Road, plummeting before jumping $30 in one day to a high of $197 in October.

The recent decision of the State Bank of Pakistan to ban crypto-related activities proves that observation.\nIn early April, the SBP issued a circular on the “prohibition of dealing in virtual currencies”, right after a similar measure by the Reserve Bank of India, the regional rival. Unlike their Indian colleagues, who gave banks and traders three months to comply, Pakistani central bankers imposed the ban with immediate effect. SBP said virtual currencies and tokens were not legal tender and reminded it had not authorized any individual or entity to issue, sell, purchase, or exchange any such coins in Pakistan. All banks, microfinance entities, payment system operators and service providers were “advised to refrain” from dealing in cryptocurrencies.\nThe local market is by no means comparable to India’s booming crypto sector. According to Danyal Manzar, CEO of Pakistan’s first bitcoin exchange Urdubit, about 100 different digital coins were being traded daily across all mediums before the ban. His trading platform decided to close down permanently following the prohibition. “The decision was made in haste. Ample time should always be provided for a proper shutdown. But we respect the SBP’s decision,” he told The Express Tribune .\nImmediately after the ban, Urdubit warned its clients to withdraw both their fiat and their crypto funds.

The cryptocurrency market and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) still dominate discussions about the technology and billions of dollars continue to flow into the space, but the focus has mainly been directed towards blockchain’s use as a money-making technology. People tend to gloss over the possible applications for the public good from deploying blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT). And, to quote George Washington, the first President of the United States (U.S.) and one of the nation’s Founding Fathers: “I have no other view than to promote the public good, and am unambitious of honors not founded in the approbation of my Country.”\nNow this could be viewed as quite unfortunate when considering that the security, transparency and immutability that blockchain technology provides makes it a prime tool for such efforts. While Bitcoin was conceived in reaction to the financial crisis of the late noughties (2000s) and slated to be a digital currency free from the influence of financial institutions, not many today are familiar with these roots.\nSo, it should be seen positively that a number of projects are pursuing this “for-the-people” viewpoint and offering mechanisms to promote fairness and equality. To this end a number of initiatives in the space have sprung and appear now to be gaining some traction. And, it all starts by offering an amazing product or service to gain traction.\nPioneering blockchain-based platform Horizon State , for example, recently announced several partnerships where its voting mechanisms will be put to use in an effort to encourage public engagement. And, decentralized social media platform Sapien secured $11 million from its ICO, which is allowing it to pursue its goal of providing equitable means for content creators to publish content.\nElsewhere, projects like Substratum , a U.S.-based software development firm that has architected, developed and deployed software solutions for Fortune 100 companies such as Apple, Disney Facebook and HP amongst others, and the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), which is building an open source decentralized identity ecosystem for people, organizations, apps and devices, aim to provide decentralization to network infrastructures and digital identity, respectively.\nSo, with this in mind here are three areas where these projects are helping address modern societal problems and promote the public good.\n1. Consensus Building\nDespite the growth of democracy worldwide, the mechanisms used to facilitate the democratic process are far from perfect. For example, it is only lately that governments have adopted electronic voting to facilitate elections.\nIn electronic voting, often called “e-voting”, voters use an electronic device to make and record their ballot choices. Voting choices are recorded on the machine itself or the machine generates a token on which the choices are recorded.\nElectronic voting gained popularity in Estonia back in 2001 with the “e-minded” coalition government. The country became the first in the world to hold legally binding general elections over the Internet with their pilot project for the municipal elections in 2005 and in 2014 became the first state to provide e-residency . Further, the Estonian parliamentary election in 2007 also used Internet voting - another world first.\nEven the likes of U.S. President Donald Trump - prior to his Presidential election victory - applied for and was granted Estonian e-residency . Trump’s interest in the e-residency was said to be sparked following a successful covert operation by the Estonian secret service ESSAD.\nTrump was quoted in early 2016 by Estonian World, an online English-language media channel about the country, saying he liked the e-residency as he “likes big ideas”. He added: “I don’t like losers. If you’re going to be thinking, you may as well think big. It is not ripping us off like China or Japan or Mexico.”\nMany countries and localities though still rely on manual paper-based methods, which are vulnerable to manipulation. However, even with the adoption of electronic methods, problems can still arise where software or hardware errors can lead to disastrous results and undermine the integrity of the process.\nHorizon State, for example, promotes the use of blockchain for consensus-building. The venture’s platform enables organizations to vote on matters securely through digital ballot boxes. Votes are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain ensuring permanence and immutability. Voter identity is also kept anonymous and confidential to prevent potential coercion.\nAfter holding a successful ICO last year, Horizon State is now focused on securing more partners that will use its platform. The platform recently made waves in Indonesia where it has formed partnerships including with economist Dr. Marzuki Usman and socio-religious group Nahdlatul Ulama.\nThe platform is also slated to be used in social reform and citizen involvement efforts. It will be used to empower citizens to securely vote on certain campaigns or policies. And, with the underprivileged in developing countries often disenfranchised in the decision-making processes, this gives them the opportunity to be more involved in their civic duties.\nOren Alazraki, CEO of Horizon State with some twenty years of executive experience within the IT sector, commenting late this March said: “We are already seeing a rapid surge of interest in our platform by organizations for engaging members in meaningful dialogue to improve organizational performance through improved decision-making and accountability.”\nHorizon State.

Free Speech\nDemocracy is also under threat today due to the growing influence of certain centralized platforms over free speech and the rampant use of disinformation campaigns on social media. These not only limit what kinds of viewpoints are made accessible to the public but also affect constituent opinion and behavior.\nCentralized social media often exerts authority over the content published on their sites and services. Content producers can even feel exploited since these platforms readily obtain perpetual licenses to user-generated content, which they can monetize solely for their gain. They can also choose to arbitrarily censor and disallow certain content on their platform. Yet, fake news still proliferates throughout these platforms.\nIn response, blockchain-based platforms like Sapien provide alternatives to these centralized platforms. As a social media platform, it encourages free speech and the creation and sharing of high-quality content while discouraging fake news in the process.\nAdditionally, Sapien allows users to switch between public and private browsing to ensure the safety of private data. All chat and personal data are encrypted to prevent leaks.\nAnkit Bhatia, CEO of Sapien, remarking last November stated : “Free speech is undoubtedly one of the most fundamental rights we have as humans. It grants us the ability to express our opinions, critique one another, and have meaningful discourse.”\nHe added: “Speech enables us reflect on the quality of our thoughts and actions. And when we are exposed to contrary evidence, we are given an opportunity to reassess our morals and even amend our understanding of reality.”\nFintechSv.com Ankit Bhatia, CEO and Co-Founder of Sapien at Ankit Bhatia, CEO & Cofounder Sapien making a pitch at a Blockchain Technology panel. (Image credit: Fintech Silicon Valley).\nContent creators can also make premium content available on the platform through a content marketplace. By offering transparency and an inherent rewards mechanism, Sapien seeks to inspire users to focus on quality and interact with each other fairly.\n3. Privacy and Data Ownership\nPrivacy has also become a major issue among users today. Some governments even go as far as monitoring and regulating Internet activities, which limit what citizens can do online. But what can even be more disconcerting is that, when it comes to protecting data, many also failed to display the same zeal they bring to policing user activity. Governments and others have put users and citizens at risk by exposing personal information to cyber-attacks.\nBlockchain projects are touted as seeking to correct this. Substratum, for instance, provides a respite for territories that have repressive Internet access policies. As an open-source network that uses blockchain this venture’s technology allows users to use a distributed infrastructure.\nTheir mission is touted as bringing forth the free and fair Internet of the future by combining what is described as “proven technological building blocks with emergent technologies in an innovative and holistic way to help solve many of the problems that plague the modern Internet.”\nUsers will be able to host and access websites and applications without the need to rely on centralized data centers or use virtual private networks, privacy browsers and onion routers.\nCommenting in relation to Internet censorship, Christian Pope, chief marketing officer (CMO) at Substratum, has posited in relation to Internet censorship: “We will not reach an acceptable outcome through government censorship. Success lies in individual verification, not in government overlap.”\nPope, who has served as VP of Marketing, CMO and a consultant with a key emphasis on B2B Fortune 1,000 and B2C start-ups, added: “What is needed is the ability for the individual to assure their network is trusted as well as the networks of his/her peers. A kind of verified armor carried from network to network ensuring safety and productivity. To maintain a free Internet, we cannot run to Internet censorship like a lamb to slaughter.”\nAside from governments, commercial services are also quite guilty of being quite invasive when it comes to user data. Google and Facebook, for example, rely heavily on the personas they have derived from user activity to fuel their advertising engine.\nAt times, enterprises could even be irresponsible. The massive hack on Equifax that compromised 147.9 million Americans’ personal and financial information underscored the weakness of relying on centralized authorities to comprehensively store and hold such data.\nIndeed, issues surrounding privacy have ratcheted-up and dominated the headlines and consumer interest of late. The recent data scandal that embroiled Facebook through Cambridge Analytica’s clandestine activities may have impacted as many as 87 million Facebook users.\nWith privacy being more important than ever before, users are seeking the utmost anonymity. One cryptocurrency, CloakCoin, has embarked on providing owners with “innate financial freedom” in a simple, practical, economical and virtually instantaneous manner.\nTheir private, secure and untraceable payment system called ENIGMA, ensures users can transmit Cloak privately and securely to each other - with what it has claimed is reduced worry of “unwanted parties spying or hacking.”\nProjects like Decentralized Identity Foundation aim to give users better control over their personal information. Towards that end, DIF is creating a universal verification system that would allow users, applications and devices to validate identities without the need for a centralized party.\nDIF’s initiative allows users to register self-sovereign identifiers (i.e. lifetime portable identities for any person, organization or thing), store identity data securely and choose what information they share to others.\nHaving a self-sovereign identity, which is a smart identity, enables the holder to present verifiable credentials in a privacy-safe way. These credentials can represent things as diverse as an airline ticket or a driver's license.\nDIF’s use of blockchain and Zero-Trust data stores help mitigate breach risks and prevent other parties from exploiting user data for their own gain. The project has now gained strong following even from enterprise blockchain players like IBM as well as the Hyperledger project and various groups in the crypto space.\nIn essence, Zero Trust is a security concept, which is based on the belief that organizations should not automatically trust anything inside or outside its perimeters. They must instead verify anything and everything that seeks to connect to its systems prior to granting access.\nDoing the Right Thing\nThe growth and success of these aforementioned projects should help spread awareness that blockchain is not really just about cryptocurrencies, but it is a tool for public good as well. Blockchain projects continue to challenge the power centralized authorities have over other facets of human activity and ensure the democratic process prevails.\nBlockchain-based voting mechanisms can encourage citizens to participate in elections and the decision-making processes. Even those typically disenfranchised can now confidently participate knowing that their votes count. And, by encouraging decentralization and data ownership, these blockchain platforms also minimize the influence governments and large enterprises typically have over users and citizens. The upshot is that users are given back control over their data, privacy and intellectual properties.\nBlockchain also encourages parties to be accountable for their actions. Transparency and immutability enable concerned parties to readily know the status and history of transactions, making sure that any dubious activities can be monitored and challenged. And, participants are ultimately compelled to do the right thing in their choices.

The cryptocurrency market and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) still dominate discussions about the technology and billions of dollars continue to flow into the space, but the focus has mainly been directed towards blockchain’s use as a money-making technology. People tend to gloss over the possible applications for the public good from deploying blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT). And, to quote George Washington, the first President of the United States (U.S.) and one of the nation’s Founding Fathers: “I have no other view than to promote the public good, and am unambitious of honors not founded in the approbation of my Country.”\nNow this could be viewed as quite unfortunate when considering that the security, transparency and immutability that blockchain technology provides makes it a prime tool for such efforts. While Bitcoin was conceived in reaction to the financial crisis of the late noughties (2000s) and slated to be a digital currency free from the influence of financial institutions, not many today are familiar with these roots.\nSo, it should be seen positively that a number of projects are pursuing this “for-the-people” viewpoint and offering mechanisms to promote fairness and equality. To this end a number of initiatives in the space have sprung and appear now to be gaining some traction. And, it all starts by offering an amazing product or service to gain traction.\nPioneering blockchain-based platform Horizon State , for example, recently announced several partnerships where its voting mechanisms will be put to use in an effort to encourage public engagement. And, decentralized social media platform Sapien secured $11 million from its ICO, which is allowing it to pursue its goal of providing equitable means for content creators to publish content.\nElsewhere, projects like Substratum , a U.S.-based software development firm that has architected, developed and deployed software solutions for Fortune 100 companies such as Apple, Disney Facebook and HP amongst others, and the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), which is building an open source decentralized identity ecosystem for people, organizations, apps and devices, aim to provide decentralization to network infrastructures and digital identity, respectively.\nSo, with this in mind here are three areas where these projects are helping address modern societal problems and promote the public good.\n1. Consensus Building\nDespite the growth of democracy worldwide, the mechanisms used to facilitate the democratic process are far from perfect. For example, it is only lately that governments have adopted electronic voting to facilitate elections.\nIn electronic voting, often called “e-voting”, voters use an electronic device to make and record their ballot choices. Voting choices are recorded on the machine itself or the machine generates a token on which the choices are recorded.\nElectronic voting gained popularity in Estonia back in 2001 with the “e-minded” coalition government. The country became the first in the world to hold legally binding general elections over the Internet with their pilot project for the municipal elections in 2005 and in 2014 became the first state to provide e-residency . Further, the Estonian parliamentary election in 2007 also used Internet voting - another world first.\nEven the likes of U.S. President Donald Trump - prior to his Presidential election victory - applied for and was granted Estonian e-residency . Trump’s interest in the e-residency was said to be sparked following a successful covert operation by the Estonian secret service ESSAD.\nTrump was quoted in early 2016 by Estonian World, an online English-language media channel about the country, saying he liked the e-residency as he “likes big ideas”. He added: “I don’t like losers. If you’re going to be thinking, you may as well think big. It is not ripping us off like China or Japan or Mexico.”\nMany countries and localities though still rely on manual paper-based methods, which are vulnerable to manipulation. However, even with the adoption of electronic methods, problems can still arise where software or hardware errors can lead to disastrous results and undermine the integrity of the process.\nHorizon State, for example, promotes the use of blockchain for consensus-building. The venture’s platform enables organizations to vote on matters securely through digital ballot boxes. Votes are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain ensuring permanence and immutability. Voter identity is also kept anonymous and confidential to prevent potential coercion.\nAfter holding a successful ICO last year, Horizon State is now focused on securing more partners that will use its platform. The platform recently made waves in Indonesia where it has formed partnerships including with economist Dr. Marzuki Usman and socio-religious group Nahdlatul Ulama.\nThe platform is also slated to be used in social reform and citizen involvement efforts. It will be used to empower citizens to securely vote on certain campaigns or policies. And, with the underprivileged in developing countries often disenfranchised in the decision-making processes, this gives them the opportunity to be more involved in their civic duties.\nOren Alazraki, CEO of Horizon State with some twenty years of executive experience within the IT sector, commenting late this March said: “We are already seeing a rapid surge of interest in our platform by organizations for engaging members in meaningful dialogue to improve organizational performance through improved decision-making and accountability.”\nHorizon State.

Free Speech\nDemocracy is also under threat today due to the growing influence of certain centralized platforms over free speech and the rampant use of disinformation campaigns on social media. These not only limit what kinds of viewpoints are made accessible to the public but also affect constituent opinion and behavior.\nCentralized social media often exerts authority over the content published on their sites and services. Content producers can even feel exploited since these platforms readily obtain perpetual licenses to user-generated content, which they can monetize solely for their gain. They can also choose to arbitrarily censor and disallow certain content on their platform. Yet, fake news still proliferates throughout these platforms.\nIn response, blockchain-based platforms like Sapien provide alternatives to these centralized platforms. As a social media platform, it encourages free speech and the creation and sharing of high-quality content while discouraging fake news in the process.\nAdditionally, Sapien allows users to switch between public and private browsing to ensure the safety of private data. All chat and personal data are encrypted to prevent leaks.\nAnkit Bhatia, CEO of Sapien, remarking last November stated : “Free speech is undoubtedly one of the most fundamental rights we have as humans. It grants us the ability to express our opinions, critique one another, and have meaningful discourse.”\nHe added: “Speech enables us reflect on the quality of our thoughts and actions. And when we are exposed to contrary evidence, we are given an opportunity to reassess our morals and even amend our understanding of reality.”\nFintechSv.com Ankit Bhatia, CEO and Co-Founder of Sapien at Ankit Bhatia, CEO & Cofounder Sapien making a pitch at a Blockchain Technology panel.

By offering transparency and an inherent rewards mechanism, Sapien seeks to inspire users to focus on quality and interact with each other fairly.\n3. Privacy and Data Ownership\nPrivacy has also become a major issue among users today. Some governments even go as far as monitoring and regulating Internet activities, which limit what citizens can do online. But what can even be more disconcerting is that, when it comes to protecting data, many also failed to display the same zeal they bring to policing user activity. Governments and others have put users and citizens at risk by exposing personal information to cyber-attacks.\nBlockchain projects are touted as seeking to correct this. Substratum, for instance, provides a respite for territories that have repressive Internet access policies. As an open-source network that uses blockchain this venture’s technology allows users to use a distributed infrastructure.\nTheir mission is touted as bringing forth the free and fair Internet of the future by combining what is described as “proven technological building blocks with emergent technologies in an innovative and holistic way to help solve many of the problems that plague the modern Internet.”\nUsers will be able to host and access websites and applications without the need to rely on centralized data centers or use virtual private networks, privacy browsers and onion routers.\nCommenting in relation to Internet censorship, Christian Pope, chief marketing officer (CMO) at Substratum, has posited in relation to Internet censorship: “We will not reach an acceptable outcome through government censorship. Success lies in individual verification, not in government overlap.”\nPope, who has served as VP of Marketing, CMO and a consultant with a key emphasis on B2B Fortune 1,000 and B2C start-ups, added: “What is needed is the ability for the individual to assure their network is trusted as well as the networks of his/her peers. A kind of verified armor carried from network to network ensuring safety and productivity. To maintain a free Internet, we cannot run to Internet censorship like a lamb to slaughter.”\nAside from governments, commercial services are also quite guilty of being quite invasive when it comes to user data. Google and Facebook, for example, rely heavily on the personas they have derived from user activity to fuel their advertising engine.\nAt times, enterprises could even be irresponsible. The massive hack on Equifax that compromised 147.9 million Americans’ personal and financial information underscored the weakness of relying on centralized authorities to comprehensively store and hold such data.\nIndeed, issues surrounding privacy have ratcheted-up and dominated the headlines and consumer interest of late. The recent data scandal that embroiled Facebook through Cambridge Analytica’s clandestine activities may have impacted as many as 87 million Facebook users.\nWith privacy being more important than ever before, users are seeking the utmost anonymity. One cryptocurrency, CloakCoin, has embarked on providing owners with “innate financial freedom” in a simple, practical, economical and virtually instantaneous manner.\nTheir private, secure and untraceable payment system called ENIGMA, ensures users can transmit Cloak privately and securely to each other - with what it has claimed is reduced worry of “unwanted parties spying or hacking.”\nProjects like Decentralized Identity Foundation aim to give users better control over their personal information. Towards that end, DIF is creating a universal verification system that would allow users, applications and devices to validate identities without the need for a centralized party.\nDIF’s initiative allows users to register self-sovereign identifiers (i.e. lifetime portable identities for any person, organization or thing), store identity data securely and choose what information they share to others.\nHaving a self-sovereign identity, which is a smart identity, enables the holder to present verifiable credentials in a privacy-safe way. These credentials can represent things as diverse as an airline ticket or a driver's license.\nDIF’s use of blockchain and Zero-Trust data stores help mitigate breach risks and prevent other parties from exploiting user data for their own gain. The project has now gained strong following even from enterprise blockchain players like IBM as well as the Hyperledger project and various groups in the crypto space.\nIn essence, Zero Trust is a security concept, which is based on the belief that organizations should not automatically trust anything inside or outside its perimeters. They must instead verify anything and everything that seeks to connect to its systems prior to granting access.\nDoing the Right Thing\nThe growth and success of these aforementioned projects should help spread awareness that blockchain is not really just about cryptocurrencies, but it is a tool for public good as well.

that they will change the world whilst generating exorbitant returns for investors, it can be highly informative to sometimes get a bird’s eye view of longer-term altcoin performance by digging through the annals of Coinmarketcap’s historic snapshots. When looking at a historic snapshot from May 12th, 2013, by far the best cryptocurrency purchase one could have made was bitcoin. Also Read: Markets Update: Cryptocurrencies Lose Steam During the Weekend BTC Top Performing Market Since May 12th, 2013 According to the snapshot , bitcoin had a market capitalization of just 1.293 billion on the 12th of May, 2012. Back then, the circulating supply was just over half of it maximum total, with approximately 11.14 million coins in circulation. The price was just $116.07 USD, however, had just gained by approximately 40% in ten days – with the bounce comprising a recovering rally following the fallout from the early-2013 bubble that saw many Cypriots charge into the bitcoin markets seeking refuge from the harsh structural adjustment policies imposed by the European Union and International Monetary Fund. Of all fourteen cryptocurrency markets listed on Coinmarketcap on May 12, 2013, bitcoin has since far outperformed its rivals, gaining by approximately 7175% in the last five years. LTC Only Altcoin Still Ranked in Top Ten by Market Capitalization Of the markets listed on the 2013 snapshot, Litecoin is by far the altcoin with the largest market capitalization today (approximately $7.94 billion as of this writing). At the time of the snapshot, the then second largest cryptocurrency had a total market capitalization of just $59.1 million, and a circulating supply of roughly 17.5 million. At the current prices of roughly $140.55, LTC has made gains of 4,083% during five years. Whilst Litecoin’s market dominance has since eroded, LTC is still the sixth largest cryptocurrency by market cap – making it the best performing altcoin from May 12, 2013. Only 50% of Crypto Markets Are More Valuable Today Than They Were 5 Years Ago The third highest performing crypto market since the snapshot is the then twelfth largest by market cap, Ixcoin . At the time of the snapshot, Ixcoin was priced at approximately $0.015. With IXC current trading for $0.193096, Ixcoin’s value has inflated by 1177% in the last 5 years. IXC’s capitalization has grown from $191,294 to approximately $4 million, ranking it 677th by market cap. At the time of the snapshot, Peercoin was the third largest market by capitalization (approximately $4.72 million), with PPC trading for roughly $0.25. Currently priced at $2.56, PPC has since gained 924%. Peercoin has been among the most enduring of May 2013’s crypto markets, currently comprising the 198th largest market with a capitalization of $63.3 million. The then fourth largest cryptocurrency, Namecoin , has offered investors a modest return of approximately 130% since the snapshot, gaining in price from $0.853 to $1.96. NMC’s is now the 309th largest market, having grown from a capitalization of $4.70 million to $28.8 million today. Feathercoin , the then ninth largest cryptocurrency market, has gained from $0.1256 to $0.169727 – a meager 35.1% increase in five years. Feathercoin is now the 278th largest market, with FTC’s capitalization growing from to $821,341 to $34 million. The then seventh largest market, Novacoin , has gained by only 15.5% in five years, increasing in value from $3.54 to $4.09. NVC is now the 550th largest market with a capitalization, growing from almost $1 million to roughly $8.5 million. 46% of Altcoins Have Lost More Than 80% of Their Value Nearly half of the altcoins included in the snapshot – many of which promised that they would change the world whilst making investors rich – have since lost more than 80% of their value. The then fifth largest cryptocurrency market, Terracoin , has dropped nearly 81% from $0.4 to 0.164. It is ranked 694th by market cap, after gaining from approximately $1 million to $3.74 million. At the time of the snapshot, Freicoin was the eighth largest crypto market with a capitalization of $882,374. Since then, FRC’s capitalization has actually shrunk to a meager $203,719 (approximately 24 BTC) – ranking it 1,152nd by market cap. The price has also decreased by 84.5%, falling from $0.0424 to $0.00658. The market cap of the then eleventh ranked market, Mincoin , has also shrunk – dropping from $230,012 to $169,379 (approximately 20 BTC). Now ranked 1,170th, MNC has also shed nearly 83% of its value, with prices falling from $0.220779 to $0.037906. 23% of Altcoins Trading on the 12th of May, 2013 Now Appear Dead Nearly a quarter of the altcoins included in the snapshot now appear dormant. Data for the then sixth largest crypto market, Devcoin , stops on November 24th, 2017 – with the last recorded price of $0.000023 comprising an approximately 90% drop from $0.000223. The most recent price for then tenth ranked market, CHNCoin , was recorded on boxing day last year – CHNCoin having then dropped by nearly 99% in five years, falling from $0.1 to just $0.001222. And lastly, but certainly not least, data for then thirteenth ranked market, BBQCoin , also ended on the 24th of November – with BBQ’s final price of $0.000458 comprising a 95% loss in value from $0.0091.

This is the first time BTC’s been allowed for transferring credit internationally. Also see: Tokyo Bitcoin Cash Meetup Organizers Continue Search for More Venues Subscribe to the Bitsonline YouTube channel for more great interviews featuring industry insiders & experts Bypass the SWIFT Founded by Radoslav Albrecht, Bitbond now lets clients, specifically small businesses, transfer loans internationally using BTC. The most interesting dynamic at play? Bitbond is making use of bitcoin as opposed to the SWIFT international transfer system due to the cryptocurrency’s quick transfers and low fees. Albrecht noted to Reuters TV : “Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days. With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.” Bitbond clients do not have to worry about BTC price fluctuations as the online bank only holds the loan in bitcoin for minutes and thereafter exchanges it for the desired fiat currency. The exchange duration is short and therefore BTC price swings do not subvert the process. Peer-to-Peer Loans Using Bitcoin Bitbond’s use of bitcoin is just one clear example of how cryptocurrencies can be employed in traditional financial institutions and credit businesses around the world. Many banks globally are piloting projects dealing with the blockchain , the underpinning technology of cryptocurrency, but none hitherto have made direct use of cryptocurrencies. The German online bank has gained a fair amount of popularity and facilitates loans for over 100 clients equating to $ 1 million USD monthly. As reported by Reuters , a large percentage of clients are freelancers and small businesses owners. Bitbond’s loan amounts are typically small and usually do not exceed $50,000. The standard loan period is from six weeks to three years. Moreover, willing individuals can also offer loans to borrowers resulting in lower interest rates for borrowers and higher interest rates for the lender as compared to conventional loans.

Bitbond uses cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to bypass the Swift international transfer system to lend money across the globe rapidly and at low cost.\n“Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,” Albrecht told Reuters TV in his office in Berlin’s fashionable neighbourhood Prenzlauer Berg. “With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via Internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.”\nClients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the cryptocurrencies’ fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally.\nAlbrecht’s service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013. His office employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month.\nMost clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don’t exceed $50,000. In 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since.\nAdoption of Bitcoin has been rapid in Germany.

Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The value of currencies may fluctuate and investors may lose all or more than their original investments. Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices.

In addition, now there are a lot of varieties of different bank cards that are accepted for payment all over the world.\nEven if the funds in some people are in gold, they can be converted through the bank into any currency and transferred to any country, where again, if desired, can be turned into gold.

While bitcoin's potential may not be fully realized by first world speculators, citizens of countries with weak economic systems have much to fear when their authorities decide to ban the peer-to-peer payment protocol.\nZimbabweans Face Unfortunate Ban The citizens of Zimbabwe were in for a grave shock on May 11, 2018, as the country's central bank placed a blanket ban on the possession, trading, and transfer of bitcoin . While the move would hardly make an impact on the cryptocurrency trading markets regarding price action, a much deeper wound is inflicted on unfortunate Zimbabweans, whose highly-inflated currency can make buying bread a trillion (Zimbabwean) dollar affair.\nSource: CNN\nAccording to a report by NewsDay , the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe ( RBZ ) has also placed a mandatory shutdown in services meted by financial institutions to bitcoin businesses, stating that the institutions \"must exit\" any such relations in the next 60 days.\nNorman Mataruka, RBZ's Chief Registrar, said in a circular:\n\"As monetary authorities, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is the custodian of public trust and has an obligation to safeguard the integrity of payment systems.\"\nThe circular further stated that the move was taken in \"public interest,\" in order to protect and safeguard the integrity of the country's sound financial system.\nTo eradicate any allegations, Mataruka said that the 60-day period would be used by banks to clear any collateral arrangements, remittances, registrations, trading, and loans sought against digital currencies.\nMataruka further stated that cryptocurrencies operate on the same platform as traditional banking models, having \"strong linkages and interconnectedness\" to serve their trading and payment platforms, relying on the financial systems that serve the economy.\nA separate statement was issued by central bank governor John Mangudya, stating:\n\"The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has not authorized or licensed any person or entity or exchange for the issuance, sale, purchase, exchange or investment in any virtual currencies/coins/tokens in Zimbabwe. Exchanges such as Bitfinance (Private) Limited (Golix) and Styx24 are not licensed or regulated by the Reserve Bank.\"\nThe RBZ's move also follows a recent warning against cryptocurrencies from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), which issued a circular last month on the risks associated with crypto trading, such as fraud, hacking, and loss of data.\nThe Bitcoin Ban Irony: A BTCManager Take Against the backdrop of a global financial crisis in 2009, far away from the bustling streets of Harare, an anonymous creator/s mysteriously introduced the world to a digital, cryptographic form of money; Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer payments network that operated without the need of a central authority.\nAdding to the protocol's decentralized ethos was its deflationary nature, that aimed to precede over the inflationary characteristics of fiat money.\nAfter countries like Zimbabwe, South Sudan, and Venezuela quickly adopted the use of bitcoin, whose payment method proved to be highly beneficial and surprisingly less volatile than the native fiat, corrupt regulators and authorities viewed the digital money with suspicion, presumably due to realizing that bitcoin may restore monetary power to the average person.\nZimbabwe's bitcoin ban comes across as humorous for anyone remotely following global news, as the country's citizens are victim to an extreme instance of hyperinflation since the year 2000.\nReportedly, walking around with billion dollar wads of cash in the local currency means little to locals, as the purchase of basic supplies can run into several trillions of Zimbabwean dollars. Hence, RBZ's claim of a \"sound and secure\" financial system is completely unsubstantiated.\nIn great economic irony, bitcoin's popularity in the country shot up as citizens found new avenues to store their money and savings, as the volatile fiat currency in bank accounts was no longer a significant store-of-value.\nAs a result of this, bitcoin traded at a massive premium in Zimbabwe, compared to the rest of the world, as the demand of the digital asset surged to unimaginable heights. The Zimbabwean premium even superseded the famous \" kimchi premium \" by a longshot, with the price of bitcoin reaching $30,000 on the country's crypto exchanges while the world rejoiced on the $20,000 mark.\nThe digital currency proved to remain out of the clutches of the local government until the ban of May 2018 and provided the citizens a respite from the economic and political turmoil. While the cryptocurrency market is still viewed with cynicism from global authorities and banks, the digital money sector for Zimbabweans is a far safer bet than most of their other options.\nThe post Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Bans the Country's Only Monetary Hope: Bitcoin appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "reserve bank of zimbabwe bans the country", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reserve bank of zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newsday", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rbz", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T03:09:25.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "166b8c1de0e6bf8adc49d08633bcd47e5a647776", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY1yfFtVd3J8bMJdxMXxfETrZPEyi7FDyLDWrf7aMag6g7BkTHJUbZvLCkGN4LaJyQ-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Explain why BCH = Bitcoin", "title_full": "Explain why BCH = Bitcoin : btc", "published": "2018-05-14T03:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 12, "participants_count": 11, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "166b8c1de0e6bf8adc49d08633bcd47e5a647776", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY1yfFtVd3J8bMJdxMXxfETrZPEyi7FDyLDWrf7aMag6g7BkTHJUbZvLCkGN4LaJyQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Teejinator147", "published": "2018-05-14T03:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Explain why BCH = Bitcoin", "text": "Title says it all, I've been hearing about the debate, but I don't have the full reasoning.

Bitcoin came under significant pressure on Friday after reports emerged stating that South Korean prosecutors had conducted a search and seizure against the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, UPbit, on allegations of fraud.\nThe Ethereum (ETH) price has jumped over 9% during the last 24 hours to US$741.31 per token. This increased Ethereum’s market capitalisation to US$73.7 billion.\nThe Ripple (XRP) price has rocketed 9.6% higher over the last 24 hours to 75.6 U.S. cents, lifting its market capitalisation to over US$29.7 billion. Ripple was given a boost last week when its xRapid money transfer product successfully completed its first pilots. The product was able to complete an international money transfer in just two minutes and was as much as 70% cheaper than ordinary transfers.\nThe Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price has risen 3.8% since this time yesterday to US$1,505.06 per token. This gives Bitcoin Cash a market capitalisation of US$25.8 billion. On Tuesday Bitcoin Cash is expected to complete the Bitcoin ABC update which will increase its block size fourfold. Developers hope that this new and improved technology will lead to its use in the real world.\nThe EOS (EOS) price has bounced 9% higher over the last 24 hours to US$15.22. This has increased its market capitalisation to US$13 billion.\nOutside the top five the gains were just as strong over the period. Litecoin (LTC) is up 4.3%, Cardano (ADA) is 8% higher, Stellar (XLM) has climbed 11.5%, IOTA (MIOTA) is 8% higher, and TRON (TRX) is the biggest mover with a 12.6% gain.\nIt certainly will be interesting to see if the market can build on this today. I can’t help but feel that last week’s meltdown will have spooked many traders and reminded them just how risky cryptocurrencies can be.\nSo if they are too high risk for you then look at the hot tech stocks with enormous growth potential.\nThe Disruptors: 3 Revolutionary Aussie Companies to Back for 2018\nWe're living in one of the most exciting times in investing history.

And on platforms such as the crypto-friendly Telegram, it’s true that you can meet avatars who become acquaintances who become best mates. But the most useful accounts you’ll interact with on Telegram are arguably those devoid of humanity together. That’s because the best accounts are those operated by bots.\nAlso read: Zimbabwe Bans All Cryptocurrency Activity, Businesses Have 2 Month Grace Period There’s a Crypto Bot for Every Occasion\nChatbots are not particularly new, nor are they unique to Telegram. But it is on the Russian messaging platform that they’ve gained the most utility, which owes something to the data-driven nature of the cryptocurrency space. Ordering your pizza via chatbot on Facebook Messenger is less efficient than conventional methods. Being alerted to market movements, on the other hand, is a job that’s best left to Telegram bots.\nPrice analytics are the most obvious implementation for Telegram crypto bots, and there is no shortage of candidates to choose from. Bitcoinpriceanalyticsbot lets you set an upper and lower limit; when bitcoin hits that threshold, you’ll be the first to know. Rocket Coin bot is another; type in a command such as /global and you’ll be shown the current cryptocurrency market capitalization including bitcoin dominance. Deposit Notifications, New Token Listings, and More\nIf you’ve ever found yourself waiting for a cryptocurrency payment, you’ll know the frustration of refreshing a blockchain explorer in search of a sign. Tracktxbot is one of many Telegram bots promising to do away with manual checks. Enter your wallet address, give it a name if you like and you’ll be notified the moment you receive a deposit of BTC, BCH, ETH, or ERC20 tokens, as well as hundreds of other cryptocurrencies. This service can also alert you of funds leaving your wallet, allowing you to act fast in the event of unauthorized access.\nThe Tokenstats bot is another simple but extremely useful tool that will prove invaluable to ICO investors. Type in /ROI followed by the token abbreviation and you’ll be shown the return it’s made in ETH, BTC, and USD. Not all Telegram bots require manual setup and configuration using a series of commands: others simply require you to join the channel and follow along. Tokenstats Announcements will notify you of new tokens, while Crypto Exchange Listing “aims to accurately predict the listing of a new token on an exchange before the official announcement”. Its record, which is based on token deposits to known exchange wallets, is surprisingly good. You name it, there’s a bot for it.\nWhat other Telegram bots do you use?

The local crypto community has recently announced developments reflecting this trend – a new exchange and a new token have been presented, both labeled “Made in Moldova”. Add to that an indirect permission from the central bank.\nAlso read: Another Post-Soviet Jurisdiction Welcomes Crypto Miners 10 Cryptos, 8 Currencies\nDrachmae Market will be trading 10 digital coins initially, including leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Core (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Ethereum (ETH), as well as a couple of Moldovan tokens like Zozo coin and Drachmae’s own DTMI token. The trading platform also supports transactions of eight fiat currencies, among which euros, dollars, rubles, and of course, Moldovan leu (MDL). Drachmae Market, set up with the help of the local Digital & Distributed Technology Moldova Association (DTMA), has been announced as the country’s first crypto exchange. It is already accepting subscriptions.\nDTMA was created in the beginning of this year to facilitate the implementation of distributed ledger technologies in the country’s economy. It is also closely working with Moldovan authorities and regulators on a proposal to establish a special tech zone with tax breaks and incentives for blockchain startups. A similar project has been realized successfully in another former Soviet republic – Belarus , where a growing number of fintech companies are now taking advantage of their membership of the Hi-Tech Park in Minsk.\nThe news about the launch of Drachmae Market , which came out from a major blockchain and cryptocurrency event hosted by the Moldovan capital, was covered by both local and foreign crypto media. On Friday, the World Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Summit in Chisinau welcomed participants and speakers representing communities from countries across Europe and Asia, from Lithuania to India, according to Cryptovest . Founder and president of DTMA Lee Gibson Grant announced at the conference that the exchange had received a notice from the central bank, which could be interpreted as an indirect permission to operate legally.\nIn the letter presented at the summit, the National Bank of Moldova basically says that as there is currently no legal framework regulating cryptocurrencies in the country, no authorization is needed to provide crypto trading services, Mybusiness .md reports. At the same time, Drachmae Market will have to comply with the country’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws because it offers trading pairs with fiat currencies. This means its operator is required to share financial data about money flows and processed transactions. Central Bank Softens Stance\nThe correspondence also indicates some softening of the central bank’s position on cryptocurrencies. Last fall NBM released a statement to clarify its stance warning that cryptos are neither issued nor guaranteed by a central bank or a government agency. The bank acknowledged that the “virtual currency represents digital value” and is “used by individuals or legal entities as an alternative to cash,” but stressed that “it is not tied to the national currency.”\n“The use of virtual money is not regulated in Moldova. [Cryptocurrency] is not a form of electronic money in the context of the Law on Payment Services and Electronic Money, and the activities of issuing [digital coins] and executing transactions with them are not controlled by the competent authorities,” NBM pointed out.\nThe financial authority listed a number of risks, to which crypto users are exposed, including fraud, high commissions, loss of funds, market volatility, and last but not least – no guarantees that merchants would accept cryptocurrencies. Cryptos in Moldova, however, are becoming more popular with both users and merchants. For example, a large furniture store in Chisinau announced in December that it had introduced bitcoin payments.\nMoldova still has to catch up with strong regional competitors. Ukraine has a rapidly developing crypto sector whose expansion recently prompted the country’s securities commission chief to state: “The point of no return has been passed.” Moldova’s own separatist region, the unrecognized republic of Transnistria , has adopted crypto friendly legislation that legalizes mining and provides incentives for foreign investors in the sector. Pro-crypto sentiments are also strong in Moldova’s closest neighbor, Romania .\nDo you expect Moldova to quickly catch up with its neighbors in its crypto development?

The BTC/USD pair broke an ascending channel with support at $8,450 on the hourly chart (data feed from Kraken). The pair must stay above the $8,300 support level to avoid any further declines in the short term.\nBitcoin price recovered from $8,220 against the US Dollar. However, BTC/USD is finding it difficult to break the $8,800-9,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Analysis\nThis past week, we saw a downside reaction from well above $9,000 in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The price broke many support levels such as $9,000, $8,500 and $8,400 to trade close to $8,200. A low was formed at $8,226 before the price started an upside correction. It moved above the $8,400 resistance and even cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $9,391 high to $9,225 swing low.\nHowever, the upside move was capped by the $8,800 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It was rejected from the 100 hourly SMA and declined back below $8,600. The BTC/USD pair broke an ascending channel with support at $8,450 on the hourly chart. The recent downside break indicates that the pair was rejected from the $8,800 resistance zone. It is currently trading below the $8,500 support with a bearish angle . However, there is a major support forming near $8,300. As long as the price is above the stated $8,300 support, it is likely to move higher in the near term.\nLooking at the chart , the price seems to be consolidating above $8,300. Once the current consolidation phase is over, BTC price may either move above $8,500 or break $8,200 for more losses.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is now back in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently well below the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $8,300\nMajor Resistance Level – $8,600 Bitcoin Price Watch: BTC/USD’s Upside Capped By 100 SMA was last modified: May 14th, 2018 by Aayush Jindal ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitco", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T11:56:18.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8161e0c681416217ea6327671496202dab0f42c1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTXew77WJHR.20xMVczVXHyvHMbFSUjWI11xmkBB5ZBCkGEsONQzEN5TbNo4biyw5JZHrZCV7KvPmfFhGgtf2QMxAKev_VE8BMvkJrfKHvl3A--", "site_full": "okas.info", "site": "okas.info", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "BitGo Courts Wall Street With New Bitcoin Custody Products 2018 – Crypto Addict", "title_full": "BitGo Courts Wall Street With New Bitcoin Custody Products 2018 – Crypto Addict", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.01, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8161e0c681416217ea6327671496202dab0f42c1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTXew77WJHR.20xMVczVXHyvHMbFSUjWI11xmkBB5ZBCkGEsONQzEN5TbNo4biyw5JZHrZCV7KvPmfFhGgtf2QMxAKev_VE8BMvkJrfKHvl3A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "BitGo Courts Wall Street With New Bitcoin Custody Products 2018 – Crypto Addict", "text": "BitGo Courts Wall Street With New Bitcoin Custody Products By okas Posted on May 14, 2018\nBig Wall Street firms now have new options for storing bitcoin.\nAnnounced Sunday, Palo Alto-based startup BitGo has unveiled a new suite of custodial services aimed at institutional investors who may be eying the market with interest.\nThe product launch notably builds on BitGo’s move to buy Kingdom Trust, a US qualified custodian of traditional financial assets, in January. But while that acquisition is still awaiting regulatory approval, that isn’t stopping BitGo from bolstering its offerings.\nBitGo head of product Tracy Olson indicated that the launch – which finds BitGo stratifying its service into three offering tiers – is about framing the company as a full spectrum provider of security solutions, one that can now scale from consumer to institutional needs.\nOlson told CoinDesk:\n“We’re definitely seeing a lot of bigger names interested in digital currencies. But there are other customers like smaller hedge funds, they just don’t want to have to hold custody themselves. They’re looking to have the security and compliance and storage solutions that they can outsource to, and that’s what BitGo is really delivering.”\nThe three services tiers include “qualified custody,” in which BitGo offers secure storage and custody through Kingdom Trust; “institutional custody,” a solution that enables clients to manage wallets connected and disconnected from the Internet; and self-managed custody.\nAs such, Olson positioned the full offering as one that can appeal to the risk-tolerance of all types of clients, from those who want to set up and manage wallets themselves, to those that want others to manage the sensitive cryptographic keys required to access funds. RELATED : Imperfect Pictures: Bitcoin Lightning Images Aren't What They Seem\n“These are really targeted at different market segments. The market is really demanding these three different solutions,” Olson continued.\nAs for customer details, Olsen indicated that BitGo would not reveal the total value of the assets it helps custody, though she said 15 percent of bitcoin transactions now occur through the company’s wallet offerings. Multi-asset upgrade\nStill, that’s not to say there isn’t work to be done on BitGo’s offering.\nOlsen indicated that BitGo now provides its custody solutions to over 20 cryptocurrencies, but that the company is “absolutely” looking to increase that number in 2018.\n“We see a lot of demand of customers for a wide variety of coins. We evaluate each of them for viability in the market and then we prioritize them accordingly,” he said.\nWhile BitGo primarily started as a bitcoin-only firm, it steadily increased the number of coins it supported over 2017 in line with a jump in the number of crypto hedge funds, as well as wallet and exchange providers that began moving to support multiple protocols.\nNotably, however, Olsen hinted that interest at larger institutional firms mirrors this trend, with many indicating an interest in the wide variety of crypto assets on the market today.\n“They see it as a compelling asset class and want to diversify their portfolios with ethereum, ripple and other digital currencies,” she said. Wall Street ambitions\nOverall, the announcement also serves to potentially recast BitGo as a rare cryptocurrency startup ready to appeal to those seeking to do business on Wall Street. RELATED : Coinbase In Talks to Purchase Bitcoin Startup Earn.com\nPropelled by announcements such as Goldman Sachs’ coming launch of a dedicated crypto trading desk, others are entering the market. Still, investment in security and custody has arguably lagged over the years, as evidenced by the fact that there are only a handful of such providers today.\nAmong them are Ledger and Coinbase, two companies that have also sought to raise big funding rounds to serve custody products to an institutional clientele.\nHowever, as Olsen indicated, the nascent state of the market today means that all entrants are competing against the sometimes negative perception of the technology.\nOlsen concluded:\n“There’s a reputation out there for digital currencies that they may be associated to the underworld, but I believe they are coming around and are seeing the value in investing in this asset class.”\nBank deposit boxes via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

May 2018 , 0 comments\nBanks wanting to trade in digital currencies should make sure those activities are clearly \"segregated\" from their other operations, a top ECB official cautioned Monday, as ever more financial institutions mull jumping on the bitcoin bandwagon.\n\"Due to the high volatility of VCs (virtual currencies) it might seem appropriate to require any VC trading to be backed by adequate levels of capital, and segregated from other trading and investment activities,\" European Central Bank board member Yves Mersch said in a speech in Turkey.\nThe warning comes as regulators worldwide grapple with how to respond to the boom in so-called cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, which lure investors with the promise of high returns but are not backed by any central banks and can fall prey to scams.\nVirtual currencies \"are not money\" and their influence on the real economy remains limited, Mersch insisted.\n\"But this can change,\" he admitted.\nUS banking giant Goldman Sachs announced plans in March to start trading bitcoin futures, in what could be a step towards giving the notoriously opaque cryptocurrency market more legitimacy.\nSeveral smaller financial players have already taken the plunge.\nIn Switzerland, Falcon Private Bank offers asset management services for a range of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ethereum, while financial and trading services group Swissquote offers trading in five virtual currencies.\nUnderscoring the high risk that comes with betting on virtual currencies, Mersch noted that the price of bitcoin had plunged from almost $20,000 (16,700 euros) to below $7,000 between December and February.\nBitcoin trading is still in its infancy, Mersch said, with some 200,000 bitcoin transactions carried out globally each day compared with 330 million retail payments in the euro area.\nBut if the use of cryptocurrencies spreads, \"a crash could affect the stability of the wider financial system if big banks were to hold huge unhedged exposures to VCs\", he warned.\n© 2018 AFP ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yves mersch",

The state's Department of Financial Services said it also approved Gemini to offer custody services and trading of Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin in the future. Zcash's market value was roughly $1.3 billion on Monday, according to CoinMarketCap.com, while Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin's respective values were $25 billion and $8.3 billion. Bitcoin's market value was about $150.1 billion. \"With smart and thorough regulatory oversight, the development and long-term growth of the industry will remain thriving,\" Financial Services Superintendent Maria Vullo said in a statement. Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens that use encryption techniques to secure transactions. Industry critics say the market is opaque and vulnerable to risks such as money laundering. Last month, then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman asked Gemini and 12 other cryptocurrency trading platforms to provide details about their operations and safety measures. Zcash incorporates the technology \"zk-snark,\" short for zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge, which lets people trade with each other in anonymity. Gemini said it expects to begin accepting Zcash deposits on Saturday, May 19, with trading to begin three days later. \"We are proud be the first licensed exchange in the world to offer Zcash trading and custody services and look forward to providing customers with a safe, secure, and regulated place to buy, sell, and store Zcash,\" Gemini Chief Executive Tyler Winklevoss said in a statement provided by Vullo's office. The Winklevosses, who are 36-year-old twins, in 2008 reached a $65 million settlement with Facebook Inc and founder Mark Zuckerberg over who had the idea for the social media website. They also competed in the men's rowing competition at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

Some want to build wealth for the amenities and the trophies it provides: nice houses, luxury cars, elegant yachts, pricey clothes, dining extravaganzas, and exotic traveling.\nOthers want to build wealth for financial freedom, independence, and the security wealth offers. There are several investment vehicles for building wealth these days: real estate, stocks, bonds, gold, and Bitcoin.\nA recent Gallup survey, for instance, finds that more Americans think that real estate is a better vehicle for building wealth compared to other vehicles for the fifth year in a row. Specifically, over a third of those surveyed thinks real estate beats other investments as wealth building vehicle, while roughly a quarter thinks stocks or mutual funds best serves the said purpose.\nGold, cited by 17%, roughly ties “savings accounts or CDs” at 15%, while only a few Americans, 6%, cited bonds (Bitcoin wasn’t included in the survey—see Table 1. Survey: What American Think About Real Estate, Stocks, Bonds, Gold, And CDs, as Wealth Building Vehicles But market performance numbers provide a different answer.\nReal estate is lagging far behind stocks, gold, and Bitcoin in the last twelve months.

The Winklevoss twin’s trading platform will begin accepting deposits in Zcash on May 19 with the same being extended to Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum Classic at a later, undisclosed date. Gemini to be the First Fully Licensed Exchange Offering Zcash\nThe inclusion of Zcash to the platform has been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services. This makes it the first regulated exchange that will allow the trading of the privacy-focused cryptocurrency. According to a report in Forbes , the first day that Gemini users will be able to buy and sell Zcash will be May 22.\nOne half of the founding team behind the Gemini exchange, Cameron Winklevoss, wrote in a letter that the inclusion of new cryptos was the result of close collaboration with the NYDFS. In his own words:\n“Our approval makes Gemini the first licensed Zcash exchange in the world. It also makes the NYDFS the first regulatory agency in the world to supervise Zcash.”\nAlso during the letter, Winklevoss acknowledged Zcash’s privacy features. He claimed that these were some of the reasons behind the coin’s appeal. To achieve such anonymity Zcash uses a combination of unshielded and shielded addresses. Initially, Gemini will allow deposits from both forms of addresses but only unshielded withdrawals will be permitted. This will keep the offering compliant with regulations. Cameron did state that they planned to offer support for shielded withdrawals too:\n“We are working to support withdrawals to shielded addresses in the future.”\nAs well as adding support for Zcash, it was announced earlier today that Gemini would also include Litecoin, Ethereum Classic, and Bitcoin Cash. Since all these new additions are forks of either Bitcoin or Ethereum, it should not be difficult from a technical standpoint to integrate them to the platform whilst maintaining the level of security the Gemini exchange prides itself on. Winklevoss actually refers to Bitcoin Cash, Zcash, and Litecoin as being part of the ‘Nakamoto Family Tree’ thanks to their origins stemming from the original Bitcoin code base.\nThe last time we reported on either of the Winklevoss twins it was in relation to Cameron’s brother Tyler who put out a rather amusing tweet aimed at Microsoft founder Bill Gates. The billionaire had just appeared alongside Charlie Munger and Warren Buffet in a completely one-sided interview for CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ segment. During the chat, Gates stated that if there was a way to short Bitcoin, he would do that. Tyler quickly took to Twitter to remind Gates that he could indeed bet on the price of Bitcoin declining by using the Cboe’s Bitcoin futures contracts for which the Gemini exchange’s price is used for settlement purposes. Dear @BillGates there is an easy way to short bitcoin. You can short #XBT , the @CBOE Bitcoin (USD) Futures contract, and put your money where your mouth is! cc @CNBC @WarrenBuffett https://t.co/4JIhF5vWsZ\n— Tyler Winklevoss (@tylerwinklevoss) May 7, 2018 Featured image from Shutterstock.

There was a break below a short-term contracting triangle pattern with support at $1,450 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).

BCH/USD could decline once again if buyers lose control in the short term. Bitcoin Cash Price Resistance\nThere was a decent recovery over the weekend as bitcoin cash price moved above the $1,450 resistance against the US Dollar. However, the price struggled to break the $1,500 resistance, which was also a support earlier. Moreover, the 100 hourly simple moving average, which is currently at $1,490 also acted as a major hurdle for buyers. The price is currently moving down and it broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,266 low to $1,505 high.\nDuring the decline, there was a break below a short-term contracting triangle pattern with support at $1,450 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. It seems like the $1,500 barrier acted as a crucial resistance and prevented declines. It may decline further and trade towards the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,266 low to $1,505 high. Therefore, the next major support is around the $1,400 and $1,380 levels.\nLooking at the chart , the price is currently under a minor bearish pressure below $1,480 and the 100 hourly SMA. If buyers succeed in gaining momentum above $1,500 and 100 hourly SMA, there could be more gains. The next resistance in the mentioned case could be $1,620.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is slowly moving in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD has just moved below the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $1,380 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "best new - bitcoin cash price technical analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin cash price technical analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cash price technical analysis", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T07:11:04.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c9fbc0d74f37dfdf7db7193fe44a730faa10abad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4b9fHXfdSoVkXHh5oJhg9lOIS9LCFriV8AFZejMJ7c7pMxZ9UMf3WGgcvTiwLyWiF2.AECDRL8._i20KI7UNZNnVjcuyGjugKaRQTZgVjJF4gSn.AEMJ_", "site_full": "xmr.press", "site": "xmr.press", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "BLACK--Bitcoin Miner USB ASIC Block Erupter USB SHA-256 333mh", "title_full": "BLACK--Bitcoin Miner USB ASIC Block Erupter USB SHA-256 333mh", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.362, "main_image": "https://xmr.press/upload/news/image_1526252343_1428082.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c9fbc0d74f37dfdf7db7193fe44a730faa10abad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4b9fHXfdSoVkXHh5oJhg9lOIS9LCFriV8AFZejMJ7c7pMxZ9UMf3WGgcvTiwLyWiF2.AECDRL8._i20KI7UNZNnVjcuyGjugKaRQTZgVjJF4gSn.AEMJ_", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "BLACK--Bitcoin Miner USB ASIC Block Erupter USB SHA-256 333mh", "text": "Let's Talk Bitcoin! #365 El Petro and Money...

Tom Lee, the co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors and a longtime bitcoin advocate, fits that bill nicely. Now, Lee's team of financial researchers has revealed a dramatically bullish prediction for the price of the world's leading digital currency by market cap . Fundstrat's Sam Doctor wrote late last week that the price of one BTC could climb to at least $20,000 and might soar as high as $64,000 sometime in 2019. Prediction Related to Mining\nFundstrat's bullish call is related to the process of mining bitcoin as the cryptocurrency approaches its maximum supply of 21 million coins, according to newsbtc.com . The team believes that the cost of mining a single bitcoin has proved to be a solid support in the past; as the difficulty of mining increases while we approach the last bitcoin's to be mined, this level of strong support will also increase. Bitcoin recently passed the landmark of 17 million coins in supply, meaning that miners are getting relatively close to the pre-set maximum circulation .\nFundstrat's note suggested that \"bitcoin miners verify and process transactions, supporting the network in exchange for mining rewards and transaction fees ... we argue that the Price/Miner's Breakeven Cost multiple has proven a reliable long-term support level , and further, that the likely trajectory of future mining infrastructure growth should underpin bitcoin price appreciation into year-end 2019.\" Lee Also Predicted a Rally\nJust days before Doctor's note, Tom Lee himself predicted a short-term rally for bitcoin. Lee believes that the annual Consensus conference set to take place this week could prompt gains that would place the coin above $10,000.\nThe 2018 Consensus conference will take place in Manhattan from May 14 to 16, and roughly 7,000 cryptocurrency proponents will be in attendance. Lee suggested that the previous four Consensus events have all pushed the price of BTC up by anywhere from 10% to 70%. Given that Lee believes the price of BTC heading into the conference is down anyway, the rally might be even more potent.\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICOs\") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or ICOs.

How can one deny access to an essential service when I am not doing anything illegal? You have not declared VCs (virtual currencies) illegal in the country,” said one of the petitioners requesting anonymity.\nA mail sent to RBI seeking comment remained unanswered.\nThe RBI on April 6 directed banks, e-wallets and payment gateway providers to withdraw support for cryptocurrency exchanges and other businesses dealing with virtual currencies in India.\nIt had set a three-month deadline or by July 5 for financial institutions to comply with its notice, putting the cryptocurrency businesses in India in a disarray.\nSince then trading on crypto exchanges have dropped by more than half from its peak in December. Bitcoin is the most popular virtual currency but there are others such as Etherum also being traded.\nThe writ petition filed by a group of 11 different representatives from various crypto-related businesses challenges the constitutional validity of the RBI’s decision. The Supreme Court has issued notices to the RBI and Union of India after hearing the petition on May 11.\nThe writ petition - Rajdeep Singh v Reserve Bank of India - is the fourth such petition against the banking regulator for blocking off banking services to cryptocurrency exchanges in India. The Delhi High Court will hear on May 24 two petitions - Kali Digital Eco-systems and moneytradecoin, both cryptocurrency exchanges who have opposed the RBI circular on similar grounds.\nOn May 8, another joint writ petition was filed by four cryptocurrency exchanges in the Supreme Court against the RBI circular. Earlier this year, the government set up a committee under Subhash Chandra Garg, secretary, Department of Economic Affairs , that is currently working on a framework to regulate cryptocurrencies. The committee is yet to come out with its decision. “The RBI has given an affidavit saying that there is a committee at the highest level in the finance ministry examining virtual currencies.. Coming up with a circular while awaiting a decision has a chilling effect on any kind of business dealing with virtual currencies,” the petitioner said.\nThe move by RBI has already resulted in the flight of many Indian blockchain startups and cryptocurrency exchanges to Australia and Estonia.\n0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Bitcoin", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/bitcoin-traders-move-sc-say-nothing-illegal-about-crypto-cash/articleshow/64153917.cms&title=Bitcoin"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "sc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "res", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bank of india", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-14T06:46:55.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6ecd64d98bc79e5ddd011aa95c868a7fef001c50", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSDAcJIStjdfDkxWnrppft1EtgMt7bhTjU0d8LJIVxpgrfTXcaw.nVvnVLZC5Hne_UpeD6rp4RLFapmutNvbcWqKKX3VxDK801AINEZaOMHLOlYYT9_6TZJ", "site_full": "cointelegraph.com", "site": "cointelegraph.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Is there a viable solution for the future? - Bitpoint - cryptocurrency news, bitcoin, altcoin", "title_full": "Is there a viable solution for the future? - Bitpoint - cryptocurrency news, bitcoin, altcoin", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.bitpoint.se/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/is-there-a-viable-solution-for-the-future.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45237, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6ecd64d98bc79e5ddd011aa95c868a7fef001c50", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSDAcJIStjdfDkxWnrppft1EtgMt7bhTjU0d8LJIVxpgrfTXcaw.nVvnVLZC5Hne_UpeD6rp4RLFapmutNvbcWqKKX3VxDK801AINEZaOMHLOlYYT9_6TZJ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is there a viable solution for the future? - Bitpoint - cryptocurrency news, bitcoin, altcoin", "text": "Is there a viable solution for the future?\nBy Comment The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

In a 2013 paper published by David Yernack, the professor of finance at New York University stated that, for any currency to be useful to society, it should be able to function as a medium of exchange, a store of value and a unit of account. At the time, he was using these three criteria to discredit Bitcoin as a feasible currency for everyday use. And there is some merit to this. Although popular cryptocurrencies can be used as a medium of exchange on a small scale and in certain ecosystems, it struggles as a store of value or a unit of account. The reason for this is the inherent instability of cryptocurrencies. Possible price fluctuations of 20% or more on any given day make it unsuited to comply with the latter two functions of a usable currency. To address this price volatility, a certain subset of cryptocurrencies started to emerge, i.e. stable coins. Being defined by Brigitte Luginbühl, CEO of SwissRealCoin: “Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, which are highly volatile, stable coins provide people with the pragmatic, helpful benefits of a cryptocurrency, without having to worry about distressing price changes since they are grounded in the real world.” A stable coin is designed to have a stable price or value over a period of time, therefore, less volatile. These coins aim to mimic the relative price stability of fiat currencies on one hand, but still keep the core values of cryptocurrencies such as decentralization and security, on the other hand. Why do we need stable coins? Without price stability, cryptocurrencies may struggle to achieve mass adoption, widespread circulation and, ultimately, everyday use. While volatility is fine for speculation, it’s not great for everyday payments. Nobody wants to be exposed to that sort of risk on a daily basis. Imagine your salary is paid exclusively in crypto. If the price of said crypto drops overnight by 20%, everything will have effectively become a fifth more expensive by the time you wake up the next morning. As Rafael Cosman, CEO of TrustToken puts it: “Stable coins are one of the keys to bringing the benefits of cryptocurrencies to everyday people, both in terms of price stability and decentralization of capital.” It’s not just for payments. Price stability is a fundamental requirement if you want to bring traditional financial products, such as loans and reliable savings options, onto the blockchain. So an ultimate goal of a functioning stable coin, which does not compromise on the key characteristics of a cryptocurrency, is to ease widespread adoption among everyday users. There are a number of so-called stable coins on the market trying to achieve this, with varying degrees of success. All of them will fall under one of three, broad categories: Fiat collateralized Crypto collateralized Non-collateralized\nThis is perhaps the easiest to implement and functions like a basic IOU system. Each and every token is collateralized by an equal amount of fiat currency held by a central custodian (such as a bank). Holders are guaranteed to redeem their token at any point for the stable value denominated in fiat, say $1. Tether is perhaps the most famous example. For every issued Tether token (USDT), an equal amount of US dollars is deposited with a custodian, meaning Tether should always trade 1:1 (1USDT = 1USD). Despite the stable value, Tether has come under a lot of scrutiny. Many believe the token is not sufficiently collateralized and its issuance of hundreds of millions of new tokens without having its reserves being officially audited is only casting more doubt on the token’s validity. TrueUSD – built on top of the tokenization platform TrustToken – is another fiat collateralized token (pegged to USD), similar to Tether. As such it was received with some skepticism by the crypto community. However, in an effort to increase transparency, reserves are held in escrow accounts which offer daily auditing and legal protection for holders. The foundation platform, TrustToken, actually collaborated with different law firms (Cooley and WilmerHale) to develop a legal framework for TrueUSD. A similar concept but backed by a different asset is Digix. In an effort to create a stable coin, the token is collateralized by gold. Every DGX token is equal to 1 gram of 99.99% LBMA approved gold. It’s therefore stable in respect to 1 gram of gold, but as the value of gold can still fluctuate, the price of with respect to USD or any other fiat currency is not necessarily stable. Also, the gold standard is an outdated monetary system that was foregone in the US in the early 1970’s as the government realized that the production of gold could not keep up with the pace of growth of economies. There is also the first ever national, oil-backed token, Petro, launched by the Venezuelan government. Each Petro is backed by a barrel of Venezuelan crude oil, to a total issuing cost of $6 billion. However, many believe this to be an outright scam. Even Venezuela’s own congress declared the Petro token illegal with one legislature, Jorge Millan, commenting “This is not a cryptocurrency; this is a forward sale of Venezuelan oil. It is tailor-made for corruption.” Although fiat collateralized tokens (or commodity backed tokens for that matter) do bring a degree of stability, it’s unlikely to become an everyday token of choice for two main reasons. One, it’s not scalable – you will need fasts amounts of capital to serve as collateral if you want to mint enough tokens to have the ability of mass adoption (for example, the value of all the money on earth is around $90 trillion). And two, a central authority or custodian will have to be trusted with keeping the collateral (e.g. banks). This is counterintuitive as the possibility of a central influence is exactly what cryptocurrencies want to safeguard against. Crypto collateralized stable coins\nCrypto collateralized stable coins are backed by reserves of another cryptocurrency. This is done to address the centralization aspect of fiat collateralized tokens and achieve price stability in a completely decentralized ecosystem. The biggest flaw is quite obvious here: the coin is backed by a potentially equally unstable cryptocurrency. To counteract this, crypto collateralized coins are often over-collateralized to absorb price fluctuations with the excess reserves. The concept works by issuing one $1 dollar stable coin, you deposit $2 worth of the collateral coin. That means the stable coin is 200% collateralized, creating a lot of leeway should the collateral coin drop in value. Depositors of the chosen collateral would normally be incentivized to do so through interest payments. The first cryptocurrency to use this form of collateralization was BitShares, which uses their native network currency (bitshares) as collateral to create market pegged assets such as BitUSD, BitCNY and BitGold. These market pegged assets can then be traded like futures (derivative contracts) to effectively increase the collateral. Another coin that uses this mechanism is Dai, developed by MakerDAO. Dai is pegged to USD but collateralized by Ethereum. A Dai user could therefore generate the stable coin by locking up an excess amount of ETH in a smart contract. Smart contracts are completely autonomous and trustless environments which mean if the user wants to access their collateral, they simply have to pay back the Dai debt (no reliance on third-party institutions). Alternatively, the reserves will be sold automatically if the collateral dips below a specified threshold. On the other hand, Havven uses a dual token system to achieve stability. The Haven token acts as collateral for the Havven platform while the stable coin, nUSD, are issued against the value of the collateral. Stability is achieved through user incentives (network transaction fees) to stake Havven tokens as collateral for nUSD Crypto collateralized stable coins are more decentralized and more liquid than their fiat collateralized counterparts, but again, unlikely to work as a stable, everyday token. The reliance on a cryptocurrency as collateral makes them less stable and also requires over-collateralization (read huge amounts of capital) to absorb inevitable price fluctuations. But maybe more importantly, they rely on very complex mechanisms to ensure stability which is likely to scare off many potential users. Non-collateralized stable coins Non-collateralized stable coins aim to closely mimic fiat currencies by not having any asset-backed collateral. Instead, price stability is achieved through an approach called seigniorage shares, a processed that was conceived by Robert Sams, founder and CEO of Clearmatics Technologies LTD. Through this approach, smart contracts can be programmed to resemble a reserve bank, enabling it to increase and decrease the supply of money in order for the value to remain as close as possible to the value of a pegged asset, such as USD. It works on a foundational economic principle called supply and demand. If the coin is trading too high, the smart contract will mint more tokens to increase supply and therefore reduce the value of the coin. The excess profits now lying in the smart contract is called the seigniorage. If the coins are trading below its market pegged asset, it will buy up some of the circulating supply with the excess profits, therefore decreasing supply and increasing the value through excess demand. But if the seigniorage is too low to buy enough tokens to increase the value to an adequate level, shares can be issued which gives the holder rights to future seigniorage (excess profits in the smart contract). The biggest problem here is that if the token platform does not continue growing with new users, it will be impossible to maintain its market peg. There’s also only a specific limit of downward pressure such a system can take before investors lose faith in the coin’s ability to pay out future seigniorage shares. There are a number of stable coins using this concept with the most noteworthy being Basis (formerly known as Basecoin) and Saga. Basis will peg to the US dollar in the short term but eventually aims to peg to a consumer price index (CPI) as holders use the coin to purchase goods and services. Saga, on the other hand, will be backed by variable fractional reserves pegged to the International Monetary Fund’s SDR (special drawing rights). Non-collateralized stable coins will be the most viable option as an “everyday-token”, purely because it mimics the stability mechanisms used by traditional reserve banks with fiat currencies, while still staying completely decentralized and independent. It’s not perfect though as it requires continual growth from the platform for the stability mechanisms to work. This, in turn, makes it particularly vulnerable to a crash in the overall market or decline in interest from investors. Achieving stability can also be a complex process and safety parameters for upward and downward pressure is difficult to determine with reasonable certainty. How will stable coins work in the perfect future?\nAs Fran Strajnar, head of analysis firm, Brave New Coin, puts it: “Stable coins are set to climb the ladder as some of the most in-demand crypto assets as the industry matures and more institutional participants enter the marketplace.” We mentioned in the beginning that price stability is necessary to achieve cryptocurrency mass adoption and everyday use. So stable coins are deemed to be the future of cryptocurrencies and the perfect stable coin will use some variation of non-collateralized tokens. But in order to achieve this, platforms need to develop tokens with the potential to scale to global proportions while still being able to guarantee privacy. A completely transparent Blockchain ledger is not ideal to keep business interests and relationships safe. For truly decentralized stable coins to work, there must also be a system in place that can reliably obtain the exchange rate between the stable coin and the pegged asset, without leaning on third-party institutions that can be manipulated. At the moment, stable coins are seen as highly ambitious and highly experimental. As such, there is not one perfect stable coin out there with 100% successful implementation. But if we are to see the displacement of fiat currencies that contain damaging monetary policies, stable coins will be the way to get there. The ideal stable coin with robust stability mechanisms that can effectively deal with any price fluctuation and run on par with traditional fiat currencies, will undoubtedly signal the beginning of the end to hyperinflation, central government interference, fraud and mismanagement that most economies suffer from to some degree. “Are stable-value assets necessary? Given the high level of interest in “blockchain technology” coupled with disinterest in “Bitcoin the currency” that we see among so many in the mainstream world, perhaps the time is ripe for stable-currency or multi-currency systems to take over.” These are the words of Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum founder.

The local crypto community has recently announced developments reflecting this trend – a new exchange and a new token have been presented, both labeled “Made in Moldova”. Add to that an indirect permission from the central bank.\nAlso read: Another Post-Soviet Jurisdiction Welcomes Crypto Miners 10 Cryptos, 8 Currencies\nDrachmae Market will be trading 10 digital coins initially, including leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Core (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Ethereum (ETH), as well as a couple of Moldovan tokens like Zozo coin and Drachmae’s own DTMI token. The trading platform also supports transactions of eight fiat currencies, among which euros, dollars, rubles, and of course, Moldovan leu (MDL). Drachmae Market, set up with the help of the local Digital & Distributed Technology Moldova Association (DTMA), has been announced as the country’s first crypto exchange. It is already accepting subscriptions.\nDTMA was created in the beginning of this year to facilitate the implementation of distributed ledger technologies in the country’s economy. It is also closely working with Moldovan authorities and regulators on a proposal to establish a special tech zone with tax breaks and incentives for blockchain startups. A similar project has been realized successfully in another former Soviet republic – Belarus, where a growing number of fintech companies are now taking advantage of their membership of the Hi-Tech Park in Minsk.\nThe news about the launch of Drachmae Market, which came out from a major blockchain and cryptocurrency event hosted by the Moldovan capital, was covered by both local and foreign crypto media. On Friday, the World Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Summit in Chisinau welcomed participants and speakers representing communities from countries across Europe and Asia, from Lithuania to India, according to Cryptovest . Founder and president of DTMA Lee Gibson Grant announced at the conference that the exchange had received a notice from the central bank, which could be interpreted as an indirect permission to operate legally.\nIn the letter presented at the summit, the National Bank of Moldova basically says that as there is currently no legal framework regulating cryptocurrencies in the country, no authorization is needed to provide crypto trading services, Mybusiness .md reports. At the same time, Drachmae Market will have to comply with the country’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws because it offers trading pairs with fiat currencies. This means its operator is required to share financial data about money flows and processed transactions. Central Bank Softens Stance\nThe correspondence also indicates some softening of the central bank’s position on cryptocurrencies. Last fall NBM released a statement to clarify its stance warning that cryptos are neither issued nor guaranteed by a central bank or a government agency. The bank acknowledged that the “virtual currency represents digital value” and is “used by individuals or legal entities as an alternative to cash,” but stressed that “it is not tied to the national currency.”\n“The use of virtual money is not regulated in Moldova. [Cryptocurrency] is not a form of electronic money in the context of the Law on Payment Services and Electronic Money, and the activities of issuing [digital coins] and executing transactions with them are not controlled by the competent authorities,” NBM pointed out.\nThe financial authority listed a number of risks, to which crypto users are exposed, including fraud, high commissions, loss of funds, market volatility, and last but not least – no guarantees that merchants would accept cryptocurrencies. Cryptos in Moldova, however, are becoming more popular with both users and merchants. For example, a large furniture store in Chisinau announced in December that it had introduced bitcoin payments.\nMoldova still has to catch up with strong regional competitors. Ukraine has a rapidly developing crypto sector whose expansion recently prompted the country’s securities commission chief to state: “The point of no return has been passed.” Moldova’s own separatist region, the unrecognized republic of Transnistria, has adopted crypto friendly legislation that legalizes mining and provides incentives for foreign investors in the sector. Pro-crypto sentiments are also strong in Moldova’s closest neighbor, Romania.\nDo you expect Moldova to quickly catch up with its neighbors in its crypto development?

By not going more in-depth in their investigation and calling bitcoin an abstraction, Wired squandered a hefty sum of money. “Lost Coins Only Make Everyone Else’s Coins Worth Slightly More”\nIn 2013, the technology-focused online publication started an experiment with the intent of promoting the then-new Butterfly Labs ASIC miner. Wired agreed to set up one of these Butterfly miners at its office and with that take part in a mining experiment while advertising the product at the same time. Little did they know that the amount of bitcoin gathered with that experiment would be worth a small fortune five years later.\nThis was just a test and an advertisement contract taking place to produce later an article that would bring a lot more information on bitcoin mining to the public. Wired joined a bitcoin mining group called the Eclipse Mining Consortium and mined solo as well, and with only 4.86 GH/s to 6.15 GH/s worth of hashing power, they were able to recoil a sheer amount of coins in a few weeks. Advertisement advertisement\nThe experience was set in the online magazine office and even recorded live using a ‘BitCam’ to show the readers the performance of the new mining hardware. The article begins by explaining the type of energy consumption the device has and what is its sole purpose. It then goes through a simple explanation of the rewards given to the miners when a block is found and how the whole process works.\nAfter that, the article describes the device and its capabilities in comparison to the old hardware for mining bitcoin such as CPU mining or GPU and FPGA hardware. Lack of Foresight\nWired also wanted to give its readers a closer look at how mining was done and how the incentives for mining were distributed. Back then, bitcoin was still on the shady side of the financial world and as so the online magazine disregarded its real potential.\nAt the end of the experiment, Wired didn’t quite know what to do with the amount of bitcoin gathered. Back then two bitcoins would be worth around $220 and a few options to get rid of it were set upon the table; either use it for beer or charity , but neither was picked. Instead Wired decided to destroy the private key used for the wallet where the bitcoin gathered throughout the experiment was stored.\nThe article concluded:\n“The world’s most popular digital currency is really nothing more than an abstraction. So we’re destroying the private key used by our Bitcoin wallet. That leaves our growing pile of Bitcoin lucre locked away in a digital vault for all eternity — or at least until someone cracks the SHA-256 encryption that secures it.”\nAt the end of the day, even if the coins are locked, the squandered bits ends up being like a reward for the community as the loss only contributes to bitcoin’s scarcity.
