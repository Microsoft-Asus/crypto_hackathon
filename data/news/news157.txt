Federal prosecutors are working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a financial regulator that oversees derivatives tied to Bitcoin, the people said.\nAuthorities worry that virtual currencies are susceptible to fraud for multiple reasons: scepticism that all exchanges are actively pursuing cheaters, wild price swings that could make it easy to push valuations around and a lack of regulations like the ones that govern stocks and other assets.\nBitcoin extended its Thursday declines after Bloomberg News reported the investigation, and was down 3 per cent to $7,409 as of 9:32am. London time. It’s down more than 20 per cent since a May 4 peak.\nSuch concerns have prompted China to ban cryptocurrency exchanges and nations including Japan and the Philippines to regulate them, contributing to a slump that has sent Bitcoin below $8,000 this year. Still, digital coins continue to be a global investment craze, drawing legions of loyalists to industry conferences, generating celebrity endorsements and increasingly attracting the attention of Wall Street.\nTraders Colluding?\nThe illicit tactics that the Justice Department is looking into include spoofing and wash trading — forms of cheating that regulators have spent years trying to root out of futures and equities markets, the people said. In spoofing, a trader submits a spate of orders and then cancels them once prices move in a desired direction. Wash trades involve a cheater trading with herself to give a false impression of market demand that lures other to dive in too. Coins prosecutors are examining include Bitcoin and Ether, the people said.\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment and CFTC officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nThe investigation, which the people said is in its early stages, is the U.S.’s latest effort to crack down on an industry that was initially embraced by those who were distrustful of banks and government control over monetary policy.\nBut Bitcoin’s meteoric rise — it surged to almost $20,000 in 2017 after starting the year below $1,000 — has been a lure for mom-and-pop investors. That’s prompted regulators to grow concerned that people are jumping into cryptocurrencies without knowing the risks. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened dozens of investigations into initial coin offerings, in which companies sell digital tokens that can be redeemed for goods and services, due to suspicions that many are scams.\nCryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe, and many aren’t registered with the CFTC or SEC. As a derivatives watchdog, the CFTC doesn’t regulate what’s known as the spot market for digital tokens — which is the trading of actual coins rather than futures linked to them. But if the agency finds fraud in spot markets, it does have authority to impose sanctions.\nFraud Target\nThe limited oversight of crypto trading makes it a target for crooks, said John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied manipulation, including in digital-coin markets.\n“There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading,” Griffin said. “It would be easy to spoof this market.”\nSigns are emerging that some crypto exchanges realise the industry’s growth could be constrained if large swaths of investors conclude that trading platforms have a “buyer beware” approach to oversight.\nThe Winklevoss twins, who are known for getting rich off Facebook Inc., hired Nasdaq Inc. last month to conduct surveillance of digital coins trading on their exchange, Gemini Trust Co. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have also urged trading platforms to band together to form a group that would serve as a self regulator for the industry. Some market participants have alleged that crypto manipulation is rampant. Last year, a blogger flagged the actions of “Spoofy,” a nickname for a trader or group of traders that have allegedly placed $1 million orders without executing them.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T14:32:31.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "efa71bd69170c028a759e8435a7ec3b876b27fe6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHI.N.yiFxQzghls5NWrFOklE_LMEW.skbV1KTlT7IvmRQ4KEujUyNUHB4pW9lQw1m7UVg9o7KD2ephgOmzfzl59", "site_full": "wegobusiness.com", "site": "wegobusiness.com", "site_section": "http://wegobusiness.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "WeGoBusiness – Top business stories from around the internet", "title": "Bitcoin – American Express Explores Blockchain to Protect User Idenitity", "title_full": "Bitcoin – American Express Explores Blockchain to Protect User Idenitity", "published": "2018-05-24T13:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://abitco.in/", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "efa71bd69170c028a759e8435a7ec3b876b27fe6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHI.N.yiFxQzghls5NWrFOklE_LMEW.skbV1KTlT7IvmRQ4KEujUyNUHB4pW9lQw1m7UVg9o7KD2ephgOmzfzl59", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "WeGoBusiness - Digital Business Academy", "published": "2018-05-24T13:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin – American Express Explores Blockchain to Protect User Idenitity", "text": "Bitcoin – American Express Explores Blockchain to Protect User Idenitity 24 May 2018 6\nAmerican Express is exploring ways of using blockchain technology to increase security for both users and merchants according to an executive at the credit company.

She described a visit to one of the companys research and development labs saying;“They were working on blockchain specifically for financial transactions, but we were starting to explore what would an identity wallet look like, and could blockchain be used to help serve as, both internal, but also external card members and merchants.” Adding that in her opinion “American Express is a very innovative company,” Kastel’s speech at the conference was focused on how blockchain would play a significant part in the future development of the services American Express offers. Her talk coincided with American Expresses announcement that it will use hyperledger blockchain technology to allow merchants to create their own rewards programs tailor-made for individual cardholders.

So, I suspect we are probably going to look towards the bottom here at about 6,500, possibly 6,000. I look at this as more of a range zone. At this point, if we can break through 6,000 it will be a very negative sign. It would unwind this market to at least 5,000. There is a downward trendline that continues to hold. You can even go as far to make a descending wedge or triangle. So, at this point, I think at least in the next few days it will be negative and could be a very negative. If we get a little bit of a push, the US dollar being one of the strongest fiat currencies right now, it makes sense.\nBitcoin/JPY — We have seen the same thing against the yen. We have gone back and forth over the last several months. But this last rally, we did not reach the top of the range that normally precedes a breakdown. We have broken through 900,000. It looks like we may go to 800,000, and then 700,000. If we break 700,000, this market would unwind rather rapidly. I think short-term rallies are to be sold, but I will of course keep an eye on the daily candles , and keep you abreast as to whether I see any type of bottoming.\n© Prabhu for Forex Videos , 2018. | Permalink | No comment | Add to del.icio.us\nPost tags: Bitcoin , Cryptocurrency , technical analysis\nFeed enhanced by Better Feed from Ozh ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoi", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T13:28:40.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f80bde47a1cbbd4928b66c56a23877bd8e0856b6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbKWhhW5.TXALzxfA1U0Q3M-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "payment using Bitcoin", "title_full": "payment using Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-24T13:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.087, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f80bde47a1cbbd4928b66c56a23877bd8e0856b6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbKWhhW5.TXALzxfA1U0Q3M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Djbeats", "published": "2018-05-24T13:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "payment using Bitcoin", "text": "To pay for goods and services for WebMoney it is not necessary to be a registered member of the system.

Because the cost is high, the attacker can only profit if they can quickly get something of high value from a fake deposit,\" the Bitcoin Gold team explained. \"A party like an Exchange may accept large deposits automatically, allow the user to trade into a different coin quickly, and then withdraw automatically. This is why they are targeting Exchanges.\"\nFor the last few days, the attacker has been doing just this. He's been depositing large amounts of BTG coins at exchanges, but also sending the same funds to his own wallet.\nBy the time exchanges realize the blockchain has been tampered with and that the transaction is invalid, the hacker has already withdrawn funds from the exchange and doubled his original funds.\nTo counteract attacks, exchanges have been raising the threshold needed to confirm a BTG transaction in the past few days, but the hacker has continued to deploy more and more mining power to take over more than half of the Bitcoin Gold network and carry out the double-spend attack anyway.\nHacker made over $18 million so far The Bitcoin Gold team says it tracked the funds stolen from exchanges to a BTG address located at GTNjvCGssb2rbLnDV1xxsHmunQdvXnY2Ft .\nMore than 388,000 BTG coins have passed through this account, suggesting the hacker has made over $18 million from his attacks.\nTo be clear, the hacker hasn't been stealing money from users, but from the exchanges. While no user has lost money, the attacks are still dangerous because they might destabilize an exchange's backup funds, or may lead to its insolvency, which in turn may prevent users from withdrawing funds.\nUsers may not be losing money right now, but if the attacks continue, some exchanges may go bankrupt and won't be able to refund users still keeping funds with the exchange.\nHacker has attacked the original Bitcoin network in the past According to one of the exchange portals who collaborated with the Bitcoin Gold team to get to the bottom of these attacks, they also believe the person/group behind this past week's events has also attempted the same attack on the original Bitcoin network in the past.\nBitcoin Gold is a very popular cryptocurrency created by forking the original Bitcoin currency in November 2017, currently ranked #27 based on total market cap.\nUPDATE: The Bitcoin Gold team has published an official response , promising network updates.\nRelated Articles: Hacker Steals $1.35 Million From Cryptocurrency Trading App Taylor\nBitcoin Wallet App Caught Stealing Seed Keys\nOld JavaScript Crypto Flaw Puts Bitcoin Funds at Risk\nTicketfly Temporarily Shuts Down to Investigate Hack\nMisconfigured EOS Blockchain Nodes Under Attack", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://btgexplorer.com/address/GTNjvCGssb2rbLnDV1xxsHmunQdvXnY2Ft", "https://forum.bitcoingold.org/t/double-spend-attack-on-exchanges/1362"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin gold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "double-spend", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T13:44:05.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4a7dc50abf27cf61072e8f100425f0b049f09cf8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApu.hVYzrlqKXGv1Rrn4ivnkUuyIQKgyY27mObAXu2.icyvs7SLyYiTHRj_MICGUoq_Y4LOQwTJe0e63sa7b4Y56rGfa_SLswE0-", "site_full": "mypr.co.za", "site": "mypr.co.za", "site_section": "http://mypr.co.za/feed", "site_categories": ["media", "travel", "africa"], "section_title": "MyPR", "title": "Beginners Guide To Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Trading-Part 5", "title_full": "Beginners Guide To Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Trading-Part 5", "published": "2018-05-24T13:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img.youtube.com/vi/YgqF0JIAc1U/0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4a7dc50abf27cf61072e8f100425f0b049f09cf8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApu.hVYzrlqKXGv1Rrn4ivnkUuyIQKgyY27mObAXu2.icyvs7SLyYiTHRj_MICGUoq_Y4LOQwTJe0e63sa7b4Y56rGfa_SLswE0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "clydethorburn", "published": "2018-05-24T13:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Beginners Guide To Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Trading-Part 5", "text": " Banking and Financial Services / Beginners Guide To Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Trading-Part 5 Beginners Guide To Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency Trading-Part 5 (MyPR.co.za) By clydethorburn Filed Under: Banking and Financial Services\nIf you want to purchase Bitcoin as an investment and you want to join the BitClub Network Company, so that BitClub can mine Bitcoin and other Crypto Currency on your behalf to grow a stable and increasing investment for you, please join BitClub for free at http://bitclub.network/clydethorburn .

With fiat currency like US Dollars, you can store them at the bank or in your wallet. It’s pretty straightforward. But with digital currencies, there are a few wrinkles that you need to get your head around, but the idea is similar. Let’s take a look at how cryptocurrency storage works. You store your cryptocurrencies on the blockchain in a “wallet.” This is simply an address on the blockchain. It’s like how the website address tradingheroes.com directs you to my website, on the internet. Each wallet has a public address and a private address. The public address is the address that people send funds to. The private address is the “password” that you use to access and send your funds. Never expose your private key until you are ready to spend your funds, otherwise you will probably lose all the money in your wallet. Here’s an example from a Bitcoin paper wallet at https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/. Now that you understand the basics of cryptocurrency wallets, let’s look at the different wallet options out there. Here are the different ways that you can store your loot. Online wallet: This is probably the easiest way to store your money. But it is also the least secure. So it’s not a good long term storage solution, but it is fine for buying things and funding your trading accounts. Exchanges like Coinbase also have their own wallets built in.\nMobile wallet: You can download a mobile app like Mycelium at https://wallet.mycelium.com/index.html to store your spending money. It is more secure than an online wallet, but if your phone ever breaks or it gets hacked, everything in your wallet will be gone. Desktop wallet: Similar to a mobile app but just for desktop computers. Hardware device wallet: These are hardware devices at http://amzn.to/2qwtIP7 that are built especially for storing cryptocurrency keys. They are safer than the options above, but they are still susceptible to the things that can damage all electronic devices. Paper wallet: You can also store your private key on paper, like in the picture above. This is the most hacker proof, but it is also the least convenient. If you are going to go this route, be sure to store them in a safe place (like a safety deposit box) and don’t actually use paper. Use something like this at http://amzn.to/2sfPcAj to make sure that your money isn’t lost to something as simple as a spilled beer. Cryptocurrency Tracking Apps. Before I wrap it up, you will probably need an app to track cryptocurrency prices on your phone. So here are a couple of apps that might work for you. Blockfolio at https://blockfolio.com/. A simple app that allows you to add a watch list and add trades so you can track your portfolio, ala stock trading apps. The most useful thing about this app is that it displays all currencies on your watch list in the currency of your choice. Some apps insist on displaying the value in Bitcoin, which is annoying.\nCoincap at https://coincap.io/. This app allows you to display currencies by market capitalization, volume and other ranking factors. They also have cool charts. Very useful for seeing what is being actively traded. Also displays prices in your currency of choice. These apps are not for storing or trading currency. They are just to check the markets. What Can Affect the Price of a Cryptocurrency? There are many things that can affect the price of a cryptocurrency…sometimes very quickly. Here is what you need to be aware of when you trade cryptocurrencies. Of course, there is no guarantee that these things will move the market. But based on what we have seen so far. Exchange Listing. This is a big one. When Coinbase at https://www.tradingheroes.com/coinbase added Litecoin to their already limited list of cryptocurrencies that can be bought, they made it easily accessible to the average person. Their interface is the best I’ve seen so far. It makes it so easy for the non-technical person to buy Litecoin. Soon after the Coinbase launch (marked with the arrow, in the chart below), the price of Litecoin started to skyrocket and it has never looked back. Now, you might be thinking that this could simply be a coincidence. …and it could. But it is very, very likely that exposing Litecoin to Coinbase’s user base helped boost the price. So when a large exchange announces that they will start listing a cryptocurrency that you are trading, take notice.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network at https://mypr.co.za/beginners-guide-to-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-trading-part-4/ .\nFrom: Clyde Thorburn", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://wallet.mycelium.com/index.html", "http://amzn.to/2sfPcAj", "https://www.tradingheroes.com/coinbase", "http://amzn.to/2qwtIP7", "https://coincap.io/.", "https://blockfolio.com/.", "https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/.", "http://bitclub.network/clydethorburn"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hugh kimura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "banking and financial services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T04:40:09.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bf92909e365441c92860fc22114c36f4e8cc2b9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa4gtsWeCxLPHO9WGyxvu6XG6yf4rDY6RZTiql.bkPV_7nSltYJpffN1IFloz9DoeOSd0xvWz1CE.serWxAxKipyYIfiFiAVLE", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "John McAfee Confirms He Will Lead BITCOIN PRIVATE! : CryptoCurrency", "title_full": "John McAfee Confirms He Will Lead BITCOIN PRIVATE! : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-24T13:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.156, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bf92909e365441c92860fc22114c36f4e8cc2b9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqa4gtsWeCxLPHO9WGyxvu6XG6yf4rDY6RZTiql.bkPV_7nSltYJpffN1IFloz9DoeOSd0xvWz1CE.serWxAxKipyYIfiFiAVLE", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cameltoe66", "published": "2018-05-24T13:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "John McAfee Confirms He Will Lead BITCOIN PRIVATE! : CryptoCurrency", "text": "submitted by /u/cameltoe66\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/999467446192017408"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T09:19:42.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d07079bd162fd9beff7bcc55a25193b653fef3c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSX9hzo2IzPtUr2gIeUhbCfPWRueM2ThDM_BNfF4b3fRGoFAo9KCroh3CqKY9hNyM9jJGQ5M4M4RP", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Tech Giant GMO to Roll Out World's First 7nm Bitcoin Miner", "title_full": "Tech Giant GMO to Roll Out World's First 7nm Bitcoin Miner", "published": "2018-05-24T13:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d07079bd162fd9beff7bcc55a25193b653fef3c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSX9hzo2IzPtUr2gIeUhbCfPWRueM2ThDM_BNfF4b3fRGoFAo9KCroh3CqKY9hNyM9jJGQ5M4M4RP", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-24T13:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "Tech Giant GMO to Roll Out World's First 7nm Bitcoin Miner", "text": "Tech Giant GMO to Roll Out World's First 7nm Bitcoin Miner\nWolfie Zhao\nJapanese IT giant GMO Internet says it will ship the world's first bitcoin mining device based on 7nm chips before November.

The addition of XRP and Bitcoin Cash follows surging demand for the Ripple-backed coin and bitcoin spin-off as investors seek to diversify their holdings and spot the next big earner. Revolut reckons the new facility will help it to steal a march on traditional crypto exchange like Coinbase, which continue to shy away from the newer market entrants.Vlad Yatsenko, co-founder & CTO of Revolut says: “We’ve been asking the Revolut community which cryptocurrencies they would like to see next, and the demand for both XRP and Bitcoin Cash has been absolutely overwhelming. After months of negotiations and development work, we’re incredibly excited to offer exposure to these two digital currencies to the UK market.”Revolut claims it is currently conducting 100,000 cryptocurrency transactions per day, for which it charges a 1.5% exchange fee.Last week, the company also launched a new savings feature called Vaults, which allows customer to round up their card payments to the nearest whole number and save up their spare change in cryptocurrencies.

Since then, more than 50,000 customers have set up a Cryptocurrency Vault.\nThe addition of XRP and Bitcoin Cash stems from overwhelming demand from the Revolut community and the fact that major Cryptocurrency exchanges are yet to support these digital currencies.\nVlad Yatsenko, Co-Founder & CTO of Revolut said: “We launched this world-first feature in order to offer frictionless exposure of Cryptocurrencies to the mainstream population. The idea of exchanges, private keys and cold storage is a complete turn off for some people, so we wanted to offer a simple way for consumers to get exposure in this area.”\n“We’ve been asking the Revolut community which Cryptocurrencies they would like to see next, and the demand for both XRP and Bitcoin Cash has been absolutely overwhelming.

The clerics of the mosque have taken the decision to accept another popular cryptocurrency Ethereum to get repaired out at the mosque in Shacklewell Lane. Cryptocurrency donations It announced to raise at least $10,000 cryptocurrency in donations for Ramadan through currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Muslims are requesting to pay 2.5 percent of their wealth during 30-day festival as a part of Zakat. The annual donation is obligation for all the Muslims over the world. The official Hackney Gazette says that they are trying to appeal to a wider audience with new currency, it is big in the Islamic world and have set up a platform for affluent Muslims to encourage and contribute to the welfare of society. Recently, Mohammad Abu-Bakar of Blossom Finance in Indonesia probed the performance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It is useful to determine whether these currencies fit with Islam’s strict interpretation of money. CEO of Blossom Finance CEO of Blossom Finance says that several recent fatawah have issued by outstanding Muslim Scholars provided incomplete or contrary opinions on the topic. The confusion have been clearing with the guidelines that endorses by solid research. However it benefits both laypeople and practitioners of Islamic finance. The founder of Blockchain startup Combo Innovation helped to advise mosque on setting up the bitcoin wallet for enhanicng donations . The Bitcoin wallet address is utilizes by the mosque to gain cryptocurrency and receive the donations worth £100 at prices. The Donations contributed on mosque’s website is transfers on the bank’s crypto-currency hard wallet. These donations will be trading for stunning currency exchange like LocalBitcoin UK. Different aspects of Cryptocurrency Mr Singh says that “If Muslim make quarter of world’s population and hold 1pc of Bitcoin or £1.04bn and £26 million for Zakat contributions”. It is the actual figure of the contribution. There are few mosques or Muslims charities who receive Zakat in form of crypto currency. Zayd al Khair has given several opinions on the emerging currency from Islamic scholars all over the world. He says that Bitcoin is a new phenomenon and scholars are apart. Few clerics have taken a practical approach and others have encircled it. The team has also taken a position to enhance the usage of digital currencies . Well it is quite interesting to know that Dalston mosque have come up with new idea to encourage cryptocurrencies in London. Share your reviews through Twitter and Telegram .

It will, however, feature a variant of the Proof of Authority consensus protocol called Proof of Ambassador instead.\nThe Proof of Ambassador protocol will be a combination of two major consensus methods - Proof of Stake and Proof of Authority, and will enable a high transactional throughput of 15,000 transactions per second on the blockchain.\n\"The existing Proof of Work cryptocurrency model is not sustainable, environmentally speaking, with energy consumption rising exponentially. Generating new coins requires dedicated hardware which is expensive and consumes a lot of energy. An eventual switch to another consensus method is inevitable,\" said Greg van der Spuy, CEO of Bitcoin Origin.\n\"What we are doing with Bitcoin Origin is introducing energy-efficient and highly secure variants of popular cryptocurrencies with an exponentially higher transactional throughput than what's in practice right now. As the Proof of Ambassador consensus does away with cryptographic puzzles, our system is also energy-efficient, scalable and sustainable.\"\nBitcoin Origin will also make use of ground-breaking, innovative blockchain protocols like multi-state engines (MSE), cross-chain, multi-layering and namespace sharding to let users of any technical skill implement their own native, serverless blockchains. And in turn solve the problem of economic abstraction. Moreover, the use of an Ethereum Token Bridge will allow for dApp fees to be paid in native tokens.\nThe board of advisors for the project includes Cyber Security Expert and Consultant, Andrew Henwood, renowned Researchers and Developers, Schalk Dormehl and Afri Schoedon and serial entrepreneur, Thomas van der Spuy.\nThe testnet launch for the project is scheduled for Q3 of 2018 with a mainnet launch planned in Q4.

This was the digital coin’s lowest price level since April 12. The virtual currency eventually finished the day at $7,557.82, down from its opening level of $8,037.08.\nBitcoin had a promising start to today’s trading, as it made an attempt to recoup some of the losses incurred on Wednesday. However, after reaching an intraday high of $7,735.42, the cryptocurrency experienced a significant pullback, which sent its price below the $7,500 level. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price was hovering around $7,375, according to data from cryptocurrency tracker Coinmarketcap.\nDespite the latest slump, Fundstrat’s head of research Tom Lee is sticking to his earlier forecast that Bitcoin will reach $25,000 by the end of the year, CNBC has reported . Attributing the losses to “typical crypto volatility”, Lee identifies three factors that make him believe that the Bitcoin price will reach new all-time highs this year.\nThe first of those was the cost of producing and replicating Bitcoin. On Tuesday, when Bitcoin was trading at around $8,000, Lee said on the network’s “Futures Now” TV programme that the digital currency was “trading at cost” because the price of production was roughly equal to the trading price. However, on Wednesday he wrote that the price the cost of production for the coin was $6,000, meaning that despite the plunge, Bitcoin was worth more than its cost of production.\nAnother key factor, according to Lee, is the increased interest from institutional investors.\n“I think institutional investors have gained a lot of interest, and they haven't really come into crypto yet because there is still some regulatory uncertainty,” Lee said on “Futures Now”. “But that sort of ultimate allocation into crypto as an asset class is going to be a powerful reason why bitcoin rallies.”\nLastly, Lee pointed to data compiled by Fundstrat, showing a historical trend that he deems to be favourable to Bitcoin holders.\n“Historically, 10 days comprise all the performance in any single year of bitcoin's price,\" he said, as quoted by CNBC. \"If you just took out those 10 days, bitcoin's down 25 percent a year.\"\n\"So as miserable as it feels holding bitcoin at $8,000, the move from $8,000 to $25,000 will happen in a handful of days,\" Lee added.\nIn today’s trading, the Bitcoin price stood at $7,376.17, as of 10:45 BST. The digital coin has lost 6.5% of its value in the past 24 hours.\nFor further information on how to buy and trade Bitcoin, see our comprehensive Bitcoin guide.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/23/as-bitcoin-plunges-mega-bull-tom-lee-stands-by-his-25000-target.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinmarketcap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimitar bogdanov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T17:49:41.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e4019a40ad32faa13ddbea2ed9c30b0d66724d60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgXsSOUHoyxd1SXY1BT8d91FMDCGZWYdfqhQCJo4QLJvOi5P1vHMWuR.r3hZ5Bpw9vU6XSKB8KWf51D9bBsdAvfbizgTBynPFU", "site_full": "internetdo.com", "site": "internetdo.com", "site_section": "http://internetdo.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Internet Do", "title": "U.S. Launches Criminal Probe into Bitcoin Price Manipulation", "title_full": "U.S. Launches Criminal Probe into Bitcoin Price Manipulation", "published": "2018-05-24T12:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e4019a40ad32faa13ddbea2ed9c30b0d66724d60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxpRFwXwQr28IT_2RPAg9pgXsSOUHoyxd1SXY1BT8d91FMDCGZWYdfqhQCJo4QLJvOi5P1vHMWuR.r3hZ5Bpw9vU6XSKB8KWf51D9bBsdAvfbizgTBynPFU", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-24T12:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "U.S. Launches Criminal Probe into Bitcoin Price Manipulation", "text": "The Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into whether traders are manipulating the price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies, dramatically ratcheting up U.S. scrutiny of red-hot markets that critics say are rife with misconduct, according to four people familiar with the matter.

We just didn’t know it’d be so early when the US Department of Justice (DOJ) would open a criminal probe into potential Bitcoin price manipulation. The Bloomberg reports the DOJ is working with Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (FTC) , which oversees cryptocurrency derivatives, to investigate potential Bitcoin price manipulation . Investigators will focus on illegal moves, such as: 1. “spoofing” where false orders are placed on exchanges and then withdrawn with the aim to manipulate prices in an attempt to lure naïve consumers into buying or selling, and 2. “wash trading” where market participants trade with themselves to create the illusion of bustling market activity. Such activities may have provided bad actors the opportunity to manipulate Bitcoin price. Spooking and wash trading are considered illegal in mainstream regulated markets such as equities and futures. A Business Insider investigation last year found that “pump and dump” scams are common in cryptocurrency markets. In pump and dump scams, bad actors pump a price of a certain cryptocurrency by bidding up the price before “dumping” it on unsuspecting traders who are lured into the market by pumpers who say the value is only going to increase. In April, a group of cryptocurrency influencers was reported to the FBI and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC ) for orchestrating these pump and dump schemes. An anonymous Twitter account Bitfinex’ed , which has over 38,000 followers, has repeatedly drawn attention to alleged instances of spoofing and wash trading, calling for actions from US regulators. Bitfinex’ed claims “Spoofy,” a single entity is dominating Bitcoin’s price. Bitfinex, the largest Bitcoin exchange program, has also tried to stifle Bitfinex'ed on Twitter by hiring bots to mass report his tweets and accounts. It's hard to believe that the world's first most popular cryptocurrency may go down in the history books as the hotbed of nefarious activities. The criminal probe, which is in its early stages, will focus on Bitcoin, Ether, Ripple, and other major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin enthusiasts have long believed that its price is actively being manipulated. According to CryptoCompare , Bitcoin has fallen from $20,000 an all-time high in mid-December to $7,399 at press time. Critics claim Bitcoin’s bearish period, which has seen its various odd patterns, is evidence of price manipulation.

Katlego Marite, 13, was dragged into a car while playing with two friends near his home in Witbank, a town in the eastern province of Mpumalanga, on Sunday afternoon, police spokesman Leonard Hlathi said. South African schoolboy Katlego Marite, 13, was snatched by a gang in the eastern province of Mpumalanga on Sunday. The kidnappers are demanding a ransom be paid in bitcoin. “They demanded that the family should deposit a sum of 15 bitcoins, not in rands,” he told news channel eNCA. “(The parents) don’t even know what these bitcoins are. They are not dealing in those things. They are in tatters as we speak.” Although police in South Africa have reported a recent rise in kidnappings, the ransom demand in cryptocurrency appears to be a first.

They are illegal in mainstream financial markets.A BI investigation last year found \"pump and dump\" scamswhere groups falsely ramp up the price of assets for profitare rife in cryptocurrency markets.LONDONThe US Justice Department has reportedly opened a criminal probe into potential market manipulation of bitcoin prices, according to a Bloomberg report.Bloomberg reported that the Justice Department is working with the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which oversees cryptocurrency derivatives, to investigate potential market manipulation.The investigation is said to focus on \"spoofing\"where false orders are placed on exchanges and then withdrawn to manipulate pricesin an attempt to lure other people into buying or selling and \"wash trading,\" where market participants trade with themselves to create the illusion of market activity.These kinds of activities allow bad actors to manipulate the price of assets in their favour. Spoofing and wash trading are illegal in mainstream regulated markets such as equities and futures.There are around 26 different ways to manipulate a market, according to a study last year.A Business Insider investigation last year found so-called \"pump and dump\" scams are rife in cryptocurrency markets. This is where people \"pump\" a price of a certain crypto by bidding up the price before \"dumping\" it on unsuspecting traders who are lured into the market by the pumpers who say the price is only going up.The US Securities and Exchange Commission subsequently cited Business Insider's investigation in a report highlighting concerns about cryptocurrency markets.Anonymous Twitter account Bitfinex'ed, which has over 38,000 followers, has also repeatedly drawn attention to alleged instances of wash trading and spoofing, calling for action from regulators.Bloomberg reports that the US regulators' investigation, which is in its early stages, focuses on bitcoin, ether, and other major cryptocurrencies.Business Insider interviewed an alleged \"pump and dump\" ringleader last year who claimed to have been involved in bitcoin price manipulation in the past but said the size of the market made it too hard to manipulate today.\"We did manipulate these but now it's too hard with big market capitalization,\" the trader, who went by the name Nico, claimed. \"Our biggest power ever has been around $5 million...

Police spokesperson, Leonard Hlathi said Katlego Marite, 13, was dragged into a car while playing with two friends near his home in Witbank. The town is located in the eastern province of Mpumalanga in South Africa. “They demanded that the family should deposit a sum of 15 bitcoins, not in rands,” he told news channel eNCA. “(The parents) don’t even know what these bitcoins are. They are not dealing in those things. They are in tatters as we speak,” he said. Although police in South Africa have reported a recent rise in kidnappings, the ransom demand in cryptocurrency appears to be a first in the country and possibly on the continent.

After peaking at close to $20,000 in December, bitcoin's value fell to below $10,000 within a matter of weeks. This precipitated a market-wide crash that saw the price of ethereum, ripple and other leading cryptocurrencies tumble. More recently, bitcoin has shown signs of recovery but its price remains volatile. Its price is expected to continue to fluctuate unpredictably, and this live blog will be regularly updated with the latest news and significant changes. :: The Independent’s bitcoin group is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

After hitting a record high of more than $19,850 (£14,214) in mid-December, bitcoin’s value tumbled to $12,000 (£8,630) within days . It then surged again, before plummeting in mid-January amid reports that trading was about to be banned in several countries around the world.

Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) has dropped close to the oversold region (30.00), but is holding well above the lows seen yesterday, indicating there is enough room for a drop to $7,000. Daily chart\nBTC closed (as per UTC) yesterday below $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement) in a convincing manner, signaling a bullish-to-bearish trend change. Note that a break below the 61.8 percent Fib is widely considered a final confirmation of a bearish trend reversal.\nThe chart also shows a bearish downside break of the falling channel, while the 5-day and 10-day MAs are trending south, also in favor of the bears.\nThe relative strength index is holding below 50.00 – well above 30.00 (oversold zone), signaling scope for further losses. View BTC will likely find acceptance below the immediate support seen at $7,188 (78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement seen in the daily chart) and drop to the $7,000 mark in the next 24 hours. By then, the RSI in the hourly and 4-hour chart will likely have dropped below 30.00, indicating oversold conditions, meaning BTC may defend the psychological support level of $7,000. On the higher side, only a daily close above the 10-day MA, currently seen at $8,111, would abort the bearish view. Only a daily close above $8,644 (May 21 high) would signal a bearish-to-bullish trend change.\nChart image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

There are two important bearish trend lines in place with resistance at $7,700 and $7,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is currently moving higher, but it is likely to face a strong selling interest just below $8,000. Bitcoin price nosedived towards $7,500 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD is currently recovering ground towards a few key barriers like $7,800 and $8,000.\nBitcoin Price Analysis The past 5-6 sessions were mostly bearish as bitcoin price tumbled below the $8,000 support against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair declined sharply and even broke the $7,600 support level. It traded towards the $7,400 level before finding buyers. A low was formed near $7,440 from where a fresh upward correction was initiated and the price moved above $7,600.\nThe price managed to move above the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,970 high to $7,443 low. However, there are many hurdles for buyers around the $8,000 level. At the moment, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $7,970 high to $7,443 low is acting as a resistance near $7,700. There are also two important bearish trend lines in place with resistance at $7,700 and $7,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The second trend line is significant since it is formed via connecting the $8,300 swing high.\nLooking at the chart , the price is showing a few positive signs above $7,500. Having said that, a break above the $8,000 barrier is must for buyers to gain control. On the other, if buyers fail to push the price above $8,000, there is a risk of yet another slide back to $7,500.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is slowly moving in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is struggling to move back above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $7,500\nMajor Resistance Level – $8,000\nThe post

In spoofing, a trader submits a spate of orders and then cancels them once prices move in a desired direction.\nWash trades involve a cheater trading with herself to give a false impression of market demand that lures other to dive in too. Coins prosecutors are examining include Bitcoin and Ether, the people said.\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment and CFTC officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nThe investigation, which the people said is in its early stages, is the US’s latest effort to crack down on an industry that was initially embraced by those who were distrustful of banks and government control over monetary policy.\nBut Bitcoin’s meteoric rise -- it surged to almost US$20,000 in 2017 after starting the year below US$1,000 -- has been a lure for mom-and-pop investors.\nThat’s prompted regulators to grow concerned that people are jumping into cryptocurrencies without knowing the risks.\nFor instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened dozens of investigations into initial coin offerings, in which companies sell digital tokens that can be redeemed for goods and services, due to suspicions that many are scams.\nCryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe, and many aren’t registered with the CFTC or SEC.\nAs a derivatives watchdog, the CFTC doesn’t regulate what’s known as the spot market for digital tokens -- which is the trading of actual coins rather than futures linked to them. But if the agency finds fraud in spot markets, it does have authority to impose sanctions.\nFraud Target\nThe limited oversight of crypto trading makes it a target for crooks, said John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied manipulation, including in digital-coin markets.\n“There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading,” Griffin said. “It would be easy to spoof this market.”\nSigns are emerging that some crypto exchanges realize the industry’s growth could be constrained if large swaths of investors conclude that trading platforms have a “buyer beware” approach to oversight.\nThe Winklevoss twins, who are known for getting rich off Facebook Inc, hired Nasdaq Inc last month to conduct surveillance of digital coins trading on their exchange, Gemini Trust Co.\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss have also urged trading platforms to band together to form a group that would serve as a self regulator for the industry.\nSome market participants have alleged that crypto manipulation is rampant.\nLast year, a blogger flagged the actions of “Spoofy,” a nickname for a trader or group of traders that have allegedly placed US$1mil orders without executing them. - Bloomberg", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodity futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T17:22:17.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a72c35ed35cb6fb10c0da284da16f2755384f796", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRhOisY3knPnLsIKSksmcpv07oKLyM0f1iN_yXRhWSNrCcwk1nc6o4FiRzHYOC4ngWwhYieXGgB6g--", "site_full": "www.ptt.cc", "site": "ptt.cc", "site_section": "https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/DigiCurrency/index.html", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "看板 DigiCurrency 文章列表 - 批踢踢實業坊", "title": "[新聞] Bitcoin Gold Hit by Double Spend Attac", "title_full": "[新聞] Bitcoin Gold Hit by Double Spend Attac", "published": "2018-05-24T12:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 13, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "TW", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1347, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a72c35ed35cb6fb10c0da284da16f2755384f796", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRhOisY3knPnLsIKSksmcpv07oKLyM0f1iN_yXRhWSNrCcwk1nc6o4FiRzHYOC4ngWwhYieXGgB6g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "e12518166339 (小肥宅)", "published": "2018-05-24T12:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "[新聞] Bitcoin Gold Hit by Double Spend Attac", "text": "新聞來源連結： https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-gold-hit-by-double-spend-attack-exchanges-lose-millions/ 新聞本文： Join our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month. A malicious miner successfully executed a double spend attack on the Bitcoin Gold network last week, making BTG at least the third altcoin to succumb to a network attack during that timespan. Bitcoin Gold director of communications Edward Iskra first warned users about the attack on May 18, explaining that a malicious miner was using the exploit to steal funds from cryptocurrency exchanges. To execute the attack, the miner acquired at least 51 percent of the network’ s total hashpower, which provided them with temporary control of the blockchain. Obtaining this much hashpower is incredibly expensive — even on a smaller network like bitcoin gold — but it can be monetized by using it in tandem with a double spend attack. After gaining control of the network, the attacker began depositing BTG at cryptocurrency exchanges while also attempting to send those same coins to a wallet under their control. Ordinarily, the blockchain would resolve this by including only the first transaction in the block, but the attacker was able to reverse transactions since they had majority control of the network. Consequently, they were able to deposit funds on exchanges and quickly withdraw them again, after which they reversed the initial transaction so that they could send the coins they had originally deposited to another wallet. bitcoin gold Source: BTG Explorer A bitcoin gold address implicated in the attack has received more than 388,200 BTG since May 16 (mostly from transactions it sent to itself). Assuming all of those transactions were associated with the double spend exploit, the attacker could have stolen as much as $18.6 million worth of funds from exchanges. The last transaction was sent on May 18, but the attacker could theoretically attempt to resume it if they still have access to enough hashpower to gain control of the blockchain. Bitcoin gold’s developers advised exchanges to address the attack by increasing the number of confirmations required before they credit deposits to customer accounts. Blockchain data indicates that the attacker successfully reversed transactions as far back as 22 blocks, leading developers to advise raising confirmation requirements to 50 blocks. At present, bitcoin gold ranks as the 26th-largest cryptocurrency, with a circulating market cap of $827 million. Bitcoin gold is at least the third cryptocurrency network hit with a major attack in the past week alone. As CCN reported, a miner manipulated two of privacy coin verge’s five hashing algorithms to maliciously mine more than 35 million XVG — worth ~$1.75 million — in just a few hours. Previously, Japanese cryptocurrency monacoin was hit by an apparent block withholding attack after a miner gained as much as 57 percent of the network’s hashrate.

REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji\nLONDON — The US Justice Department has reportedly opened a criminal probe into potential market manipulation of bitcoin prices, according to a Bloomberg report.\nBloomberg reported that the Justice Department is working with the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which oversees cryptocurrency derivatives, to investigate potential market manipulation.\nThe investigation is said to focus on “spoofing” — where false orders are placed on exchanges and then withdrawn to manipulate prices — in an attempt to lure other people into buying or selling and “wash trading,” where market participants trade with themselves to create the illusion of market activity.\nThese kinds of activities allow bad actors to manipulate the price of assets in their favour. Spoofing and wash trading are illegal in mainstream regulated markets such as equities and futures.\nAdvertisement\nThere are around 26 different ways to manipulate a market, according to a study last year.\nA Business Insider investigation last year found so-called “pump and dump” scams are rife in cryptocurrency markets. This is where people “pump” a price of a certain crypto by bidding up the price before “dumping” it on unsuspecting traders who are lured into the market by the pumpers who say the price is only going up.\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission subsequently cited Business Insider’s investigation in a report highlighting concerns about cryptocurrency markets.\nAnonymous Twitter account Bitfinex’ed, which has over 38,000 followers, has also repeatedly drawn attention to alleged instances of wash trading and spoofing, calling for action from regulators.\nBloomberg reports that the US regulators’ investigation, which is in its early stages, focuses on bitcoin, ether, and other major cryptocurrencies.\nAdvertisement\nBusiness Insider interviewed an alleged “pump and dump” ringleader last year who claimed to have been involved in bitcoin price manipulation in the past but said the size of the market made it too hard to manipulate today.\n“We did manipulate these but now it’s too hard with big market capitalization,” the trader, who went by the name Nico, claimed. “Our biggest power ever has been around $5 million… [for] one of the groups.” Page 1 of 2", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eoh kyung-hoon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodities and futures trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T12:24:17.034+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7611e5638b901bcd6b40edc2c50e832098e2ab8c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg._QsXKpwKCS0y9GeS6C8D9YNJGj68c2KdaqVWjHIN51z0oKZvRTR5BPkPcHM5CdEu.BIo5Uwvn56Zgo4m995Xc", "site_full": "www.moneygrows.net", "site": "moneygrows.net", "site_section": "http://www.moneygrows.net/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Moneygrows", "title": "Bitcoin analysis for May 24, 2018", "title_full": "Bitcoin analysis for May 24, 2018", "published": "2018-05-24T12:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7611e5638b901bcd6b40edc2c50e832098e2ab8c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg._QsXKpwKCS0y9GeS6C8D9YNJGj68c2KdaqVWjHIN51z0oKZvRTR5BPkPcHM5CdEu.BIo5Uwvn56Zgo4m995Xc", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MG Network (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-24T12:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin analysis for May 24, 2018", "text": "Bitcoin analysis for May 24, 2018\nTrading recommendations:\nAccording to the H1 time - frame, I found that price did successful breakout of bearish flag, which is sign that sellers are in control.

In April, the Reserve Bank of India formally prohibited the operation of cryptocurrency enterprises to domestic institutions, which has not stopped the creation of new exchanges so far. If the taxation system comes into effect, it would mean a move towards the legality of the industry with a constant lack of iron regulations. If the buyers and sellers are in India, the transaction will be treated as a software delivery and the location of the buyer will be the place of delivery. [...] Transactions outside India will be subject to an integrated GST and will be treated as import or export of goods. IGST will be imposed on cross-border deliveries.\nLet's now take a look at the Bitcoin technical picture at the H4 time frame. The Double ZigZag corrective structure has hit the projected target at the level of $7,441 and established a bottom for the corrective wave 2/B. In order to continue the bounce, the price should now move up towards the level of $7,712 and then $7,890. The golden trend line dynamic resistance is still the key line for bulls as any breakout through it will likely trigger a rally higher.

Anonymous Bitcoin Available September 2018 Tol Bayo 16\nANON coin features anonymous transactions, increased block size, and masternodes The Anonymous Bitcoin (ANON) team will debut their cryptocurrency, ANON, in September 2018. ANON coin was developed to address the demand for a cryptocurrency that provides truly anonymous transactions. A list of participating exchanges is expected by August 15, 2018, and the remainder of the BTCA testnet will take place up to the snapshot on September 9, 2018. ANON will officially be available on September 10, 2018 at a 1:1 ratio to holders of Bitcoin (BTC) and ZClassic (ZCL). As it is a co-fork of BTC and ZCL, one must hold BTC or ZCL prior to the fork to acquire ANON. The maximum amount of ANON will be 31.5 million, with 24 million ANON available when the fork occurs. BTCA intends to set ANON apart from other forks by succeeding where previous forks did not. The team cites lack of anonymous transactions, high transactions fees, and lengthy transaction times as some of the failures their coin will circumvent. The ability to anonymously transact draws many to cryptocurrency. BTC, the most prominent cryptocurrency, does not facilitate anonymous transactions. ANON draws from the privacy protocol of ZCL to provide anonymous transactions by using the same MIT-developed zkSNARKs privacy protocol. The zkSNARKs protocol allows for verifiable transactions without requiring interaction between the prover and verifier. As such, transactions are both secure and completely anonymous. While previous forks, like ZCL, have succeeded in providing anonymous transactions, they have fallen short in other ways that deterred widespread market adoption of the currency. The BTCA team includes several crypto and Fintech veterans who have observed other forks and what the crypto community wants to see. Increased block size and incorporation of masternodes are two features the BTCA team integrated into ANON in response to crypto market demand. Developers increased block size to support faster transaction times. Masternodes provide an opportunity for return on investment for holders of a minimum required amount of a particular coin. Through masternodes, holders of ANON can stake the currency. Staking incentivizes holding the coin for extended periods of time. The BTCA team intends that ANON is accessible and appealing to both those who have never used crypto and existing crypto users. As such, a community presence and transparent development are core principles for BTCA. BTCA has a social media presence, through which they communicate with their public. Videos of the forking process, frequent updates, and Q&A events allow anyone to follow the forking process. The team wants to tell their forking story in such a way that those unfamiliar with crypto are interested and informed, thus overcoming what was a challenge for previous forks in terms of effectively connecting with those new to crypto.

Since then, more than 50,000 customers have set up a Cryptocurrency Vault.\nThe addition of XRP and Bitcoin Cash stems from overwhelming demand from the Revolut community and the fact that major Cryptocurrency exchanges are yet to support these digital currencies.\nVlad Yatsenko, Co-Founder & CTO of Revolut stated: “We launched this world-first feature in order to offer frictionless exposure of Cryptocurrencies to the mainstream population. The idea of exchanges, private keys and cold storage is a complete turn off for some people, so we wanted to offer a simple way for consumers to get exposure in this area.”\nHe continued: “We’ve been asking the Revolut community which Cryptocurrencies they would like to see next, and the demand for both XRP and Bitcoin Cash has been absolutely overwhelming. After months of negotiations and development work, we’re incredibly excited to offer exposure to these two digital currencies to the UK market.”\nRevolut was founded in 2015 and is headquartered in London. In April of this year this fast-growing mobile bank has raised an additional $250 million in funding – which saw the the fintech startup increase its valuation 5x in less than a year to $1.7 billion.

ANON coin was developed to address the demand for a cryptocurrency that provides truly anonymous transactions. A list of participating exchanges is expected by August 15, 2018, and the remainder of the BTCA testnet will take place up to the snapshot on September 9, 2018. ANON will officially be available on September 10, 2018 at a 1:1 ratio to holders of Bitcoin (BTC) and ZClassic (ZCL).\nAs it is a co-fork of BTC and ZCL, one must hold BTC or ZCL prior to the fork to acquire ANON. The maximum amount of ANON will be 31.5 million, with 24 million ANON available when the fork occurs. BTCA intends to set ANON apart from other forks by succeeding where previous forks did not. The team cites lack of anonymous transactions, high transactions fees, and lengthy transaction times as some of the failures their coin will circumvent.\nThe ability to anonymously transact draws many to cryptocurrency. BTC, the most prominent cryptocurrency, does not facilitate anonymous transactions. ANON draws from the privacy protocol of ZCL to provide anonymous transactions by using the same MIT-developed zkSNARKs privacy protocol. The zkSNARKs protocol allows for verifiable transactions without requiring interaction between the prover and verifier. As such, transactions are both secure and completely anonymous.\nWhile previous forks, like ZCL, have succeeded in providing anonymous transactions, they have fallen short in other ways that deterred widespread market adoption of the currency. The BTCA team includes several crypto and Fintech veterans who have observed other forks and what the crypto community wants to see. Increased block size and incorporation of masternodes are two features the BTCA team integrated into ANON in response to crypto market demand. Developers increased block size to support faster transaction times. Masternodes provide an opportunity for return on investment for holders of a minimum required amount of a particular coin. Through masternodes, holders of ANON can stake the currency. Staking incentivizes holding the coin for extended periods of time.\nThe BTCA team intends that ANON is accessible and appealing to both those who have never used crypto and existing crypto users. As such, a community presence and transparent development are core principles for BTCA. BTCA has a social media presence, through which they communicate with their public.

Joost van der Burgt, author of the publication and fintech policy advisor at the Federal Reserve’s San Francisco branch, confirms what many have already said: that bitcoin straddles the properties of all three asset classes. However, he draws interesting points over properties that make bitcoin fit into one category better over others. Burgt also shows historical evidence that suggests bitcoin is in a bubble, without saying firmly whether it is or not. Bitcoin Price Chart Though the price volatility would be an obvious reason why bitcoin struggles as a real-world currency, Burgt looks more closely at the ways it is currently used in the market place alongside central banking structures. His conclusion comes as no surprise: bitcoin is not traded for goods much at all. In additional to increasingly unfavorable global regulations , he says that bitcoin lacks a corresponding real value, which is a key part in exchange for goods. He writes: “…the exchange rate between two currencies can be regarded as a broad measure of the prices of one country’s goods and services relative to another country. When looking at the Bitcoin ‘exchange rate,’ this category of determinants seems to be inapplicable – there is no current native Bitcoin economy with native Bitcoin prices for goods and services.” As a security, bitcoin fares better in the current framework, though not great. Securities are either purchases of debt or stakes in a company. Bitcoin doesn’t fit into either of these categories since it does not generate interest, dividends or capital gains. As a commodity and an oft-mentioned “ store of value “, however, bitcoin behaves much like entrenched commodities like gold and oil, at least according to Burgt. Though he argues that bitcoin lacks intrinsic value, he points to mining as the key form of placing value on the asset — a value, he says, that approximates to roughly $1,800 per coin. He writes: “Although Bitcoins do not possess any real intrinsic value, from a commodity valuation perspective, we can estimate a hypothetical value based on its production costs. Recent estimates regarding the energy involved in mining a single Bitcoin by professional energy-efficient mining rigs put it at about $1,800 when mined in China (where 80% of the currently mined Bitcoins originate). The hypothetical value of $1,800 is far lower than bitcoin’s current price. Burgt only strikes the bubble fear home with a look at the stages of bitcoin’s FOMO and euphoria cycles that pattern previous bubbles in the market place (such as the 2007 financial crisis). In a unique development, however, Burgt mentions John McAfee’s $1 million bitcoin price target as a counterpoint.

While the device should provide high-levels of hashing power with lower electricity demands, the firm said it will provide details of the B2's price and performance at the June launch.\nAccording to the announcement, in addition to selling the B2 to other miners, GMO also plans to utilize the new product at its existing mining facilities.\nAs previously reported by CoinDesk, the publicly listed Japanese firm made a notable leap into bitcoin mining business last year with a $90-million budget to back explorations in the space, including chip making and its own mining farms.\nGMO's mining facilities have been up running since the end of 2017 and, as per a report released earlier this month, the firm has already mined 906 bitcoin and 537 bitcoin cash as of last month.\nWhile the cost of production remains unknown, the total value of those mining rewards amounts to nearly $8 million based on the latest CoinDesk prices .\nMeanwhile, GMO isn't the only one major tech firm planning to carve out a slice of the bitcoin mining industry by introducing more advanced mining chips. Notably, Samsung is also starting a \"risk production\" of 7nm chips in 2018, according to a report by CoinDesk in February.\nIn addition, GMO announced in October of last year that it would sell its bitcoin mining equipment in 2018 via an initial coin offering.

Bitcoin Sheds Nearly 5%; Will Norway Introduce A Crypto Currency? Facebook\nBTC/USD had a torrid day on Wednesday, dragging cryptomarkets down with it, as the digital space seemed to suffer from stocks and risk appetite like the rest of the market on what was a poor day for most riskier assets. Of course, Bitcoin might have just been following the trend or its technicals, as the break once more below $8000 is a very clear indicator that the downtrend may sadly be continuing. As is always the case, picking a reason for the sell-off is not particularly easy, but as we have been discussing for some time, the extremely low volumes are a big problem as they reduce liquidity and make the prospect of putting on large long positions rather difficult due to slippage. For an investor desperate to cash out, selling might be more attractive in low volumes than buying if they just want to be out of the marketplace. It’s not apparent what increase the amount of speculation in Bitcoin once more, but the fever of 2017 appears to have been followed by a powerful hangover/lull. Crypto Krone a possibility but probably not yet\nA number of the more forward-thinking and developed Central Bank’s in the world are starting to talk about the possibility of introducing a state-issued cryptocurrency. Due to the declining use of cash, the Norges Bank in Norway is one of these Banks. In their report released this week, they find that there are some grounds under which a digital currency would be useful in improving the effectiveness of Norway’s monetary systems,\n“Based on the assumption that a CBDC can have an interest rate below zero, some have concluded that it would be advantageous to eliminate physical cash and replace it with a digital currency. “\nIt is largely the opportunity for more flexibility in monetary policy which might generate this point of view, and as such the Norges Bank believe that by reducing the amount of cash in circulation they could more effectively introduce the benefits of loose monetary policy,\n“The unavailability of cash is a critical factor in the removal of the lower key policy rate threshold. Accordingly, to the extent that a CBDC would help eliminate cash as a real payment and investment alternative, increased monetary policy space may be an argument for introducing a CBDC.”\nUnfortunately for Crypto-enthusiasts, it does not appear there is much appetite just yet for a digital NOK as one conclusion drawn was that this did not appear to be sparking the imaginations of the group much,\n“In the working group’s view, however, this argument provides insufficient support for a change as radical as introducing a CBDC.”\nSo maybe not yet, but the increasing discussion is definitely noteworthy. The problem for Bitcoin developers is that the idea of a centralised digital currency is diametrically opposed to the spirit it was created in and thus does not really solve the problem it was invented to deal with. For this reason, there is unlikely to be any support from the community for such a development. François Auré Traded Forex for 6 years.
