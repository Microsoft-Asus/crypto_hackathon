GPlay is GameCredits’ very own games store powered by Gnation, which rewards game developers with a 90 percent payout per sale, more than any other gaming store. In April and May 2017, GameCredits launched an initial coin offering (ICO) for sister token MobileGo (MGO) during which it managed to raise $53 million for its “decentralized mobile gaming platform and store for in-game purchases.”.The GAME token enables players to conduct anonymous payments within the global online gaming ecosystem, which is an improvement to the current model of centralized in-game virtual currencies that are generally not interoperable with other games or gaming platforms. In a push to fulfill its mission to become the go-to blockchain solutions provider for the gaming industry, GameCredits entered into a partnership with Unity Technologies, a market-leading game development tools provider, in October 2017. This partnership has the potential to position GameCredits into the forefront of the online gaming world, which, in turn, could lead to a significant increase in the value of its digital token in the future.Therefore, should the GameCredits team manage to complete their mission of becoming the universal digital currency for gamers, the value of the GAME token will likely skyrocket. Also, game developers want gamers to spend their in-game virtual currency in their games as opposed to cashing it out for fiat currency or other digital currencies outside the gaming ecosystem. If you are an avid gamer or someone who understands the online gaming industry and see the value in GAME tokens, you should consider adding them to your crypto asset holdings.

In other words, boom and bust cycles are natural occurrences, and the incumbent financial system is the best humans can do, if only the sluggish economies could just get it together.\nSkidelsky argues: The fact is that human societies have discovered no better way to keep the value of money roughly constant than by relying on central banks to exercise control over its issue and to act directly or indirectly on the volume of credit created by the commercial banking system. But let’s leave the Keynes versus Hayek debate for another article. Instead, what stands out like a sore thumb is not only the complacency and the knee-jerk reaction to defend the status quo, but doing so through ignorance of Bitcoin’s fundamental properties. Amusingly, Skidelsky even acknowledges that “the technical details of the new cash-generation systems are difficult to grasp; their inspiration is not.” A person from the early 20th century might have also said that “the technical details of the airplane are difficult to grasp; their inspiration is not.” Hence, the mere attempt to improve money is rebuked because all previous attempts have failed to come up with anything better than the paper mill that is today’s financial system. Skidelsky dismisses Bitcoin as merely the latest attempt to use new technology “to stop money from going bad.” Let’s take a look at some examples of the erroneous statements made by the emeritus of political economy. Lie 1: It’s Created Out of Nothing Paradoxically, although it is created out of nothing, it will offer no possibility of money ‘creation.’ First, bitcoins aren’t created out of “nothing.” Second, since it’s already being accepted as a medium of exchange in many places online and across the globe for goods or services, then it’s de facto money. Furthermore, energy, coding skills, resources, and time spent on software and hardware development and production are just some of the components required to run and maintain the Bitcoin network. It is also underpinned by a globally distributed network of users who all agree to play by the rules of the network for their own benefit. The more users in this network, the greater the value of Bitcoin will become, according to Metcalfe’s law . Lie 2: No Elasticity Bitcoin will be ‘mined’ in diminishing quantities until it is exhausted in 2040, having delivered 21 million digital coins. In other words, there is no elasticity in the currency… [T]he currency will run into the same problem as the gold standard: not providing enough money to support a growing economy and population. First, Skidelsky is off by a century as the last bitcoin will be mined in 2140 , though most will enter the supply by 2030. Second, the problem was never with gold itself but the debasement of gold and thus the distortion of value. For example, most scholars believe it was the “clipping” of gold coins that was largely responsible for the fall of the Roman Empire . The publicly verifiable and immutable ledger of bitcoin ensures that this monetary network can’t be tampered with, unlike with fiat. Third, unlike gold, a bitcoin is merely the name of a digital unit (whose value is determined by the market). This makes it highly divisible. In fact, the smallest possible unit is one hundred millionth of a single bitcoin (0. 1 BTC) — called a ‘satoshi’— making it possible to send tiny fractions of a penny at current market prices. This can’t be done even with digital fiat today, let alone physical cash or metal coins. This, in fact, makes Bitcoin the most elastic form of money ever created as the 21 billion digital units equal to roughly 2,099,999,997,690,000 (over 2 quadrillion) satoshis according to the calculations presented here . What’s more, new layer-2 applications built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain , such as the Lightning Network , will enable the ability to send even smaller amounts off-chain. Lie 3: Deflation Will Lead to ‘Hoarding’ This [lack of money supply] would be exacerbated by any tendency to hoard bitcoins. Hoarding is a pejorative term for saving. If there is no saving, then there is no capital. And there can be no capitalism without capital. The “deflationary death spiral” argument against sound money is an overblown theory perpetuated by Keynesian economists, which is refuted here . In fact, some argue that saving actually leads to greater consumption in the long-run. Saifedean Ammous explains this concept in his book, The Bitcoin Standard , stating: A society which constantly defers consumption will actually end up being a society that consumes more in the long-run than a low savings society, since the low time-preference society invests more, thus producing more income for its members. Even with a larger percentage of their income going to savings, the low time-preference societies will end up having higher levels of consumption in the long-run, as well as a larger capital stock.\nYou can also read more about the advantages of having a capped supply in a new report from BitMex Research here . Lie 4: Inflation Cryptocurrencies provide no security against inflation. Skidelsky doesn’t specify which inflation he’s actually referring to – monetary supply inflation vs. price inflation. Though the two are correlated, the latter is an integral feature of fiat currencies whose value is guaranteed to depreciate over time as more money is printed. Sooner or later, the incentive for governments and central banks to print more money becomes irresistible to the detriment of the population. Inflation is also sometimes referred to as a “hidden tax” that is much easier to impose on citizens as opposed to direct taxation.\nOn the other hand, Bitcoin’s monetary supply is not only controlled but is fully transparent and known to all. Even the gold supply cannot be as accurately predicted. Whereas the 21 million digital units that will ever exist are a key property of the Bitcoin protocol that cements its digital scarcity .\nPut differently, the millions of people around the world who use Bitcoin today know the supply is capped, which results in more accurate price discovery for goods and services. It is also important to note that people who use bitcoin are doing so voluntarily to store their wealth and move their money. Bitcoin Is a Revolutionary Idea\nWith the advent of cryptocurrencies, for the first time in history, humans now have the option to choose their money. This is nothing short of revolutionary since throughout history there was always some central authority, be it the state, the church, or a banking cartel, maintaining a monopoly over money by decree, and ultimately, by force.\nComparatively, it is fiat currencies that provide no security against inflation. In fact, fiat currency supply is specifically designed to grow indefinitely as emission rate is controlled by a handful of unelected bankers through the artificial setting of interest rates.\nRubber will meet the road as more people realize they can now opt out of this system by buying Bitcoin. The good news is that people now have a choice between trusting bankers or a voluntary decentralized monetary network with no one in charge.\nWhat other myths have you heard about Bitcoin?

Learning how to securely archive records that hold private keys like a JSON file or exporting, importing, and sweeping can provide people with the basic steps towards really owning bitcoin.\nAlso read: Localbitcoincash.org Revamps Website and Adds New P2P Features\nPrivate Key Ownership Provides Financial Sovereignty\nEvery day someone new is learning about the fantastic benefits of bitcoin and cryptocurrency solutions. Many people will have acquired their first digital asset from an exchange like Coinbase or Circle Invest, but have yet to learn how to secure their private keys so they can really own those precious cryptocurrencies. The first and foremost lesson to digital currency ownership is a statement said over and over again by veteran bitcoiners.\nIf you don’t possess your private key, you don’t own bitcoins.\nPrivate Keys and the Different Ways to Obtain Them\nA private key is the secret alphanumeric code that is mathematically paired with your public key — the alphanumeric address you use to receive payments. Private keys allow you to spend your cryptocurrencies and ensure you maintain ownership over them as long as the 256-bit alphanumeric code is kept a secret.\nIf you happen to own cryptocurrencies because maybe you purchased some on an exchange, or someone loaded up a wallet for you or gave you a paper wallet, you may want to know how to obtain full ownership of your private keys. The thing about private keys is they can be stored in various ways and it’s good to gain knowledge on the differences between each method.\nMnemonic Phrase\nIf someone gave you a wallet you may have to find out the mnemonic phrase or mnemonic seed associated with the cryptocurrency. For instance, if someone gave you some bitcoin cash (BCH) using a software client like the Bitcoin.com Wallet you could set up your and find your mnemonic recovery phrase easily. An example of a phrase would be twelve random words given to you by the software client in order which you must back up by writing down the phrase in the exact same order. The twelve words (some wallets use 24) can be used to recover your bitcoin cash either using the same Bitcoin.com Wallet or another wallet that supports the mnemonic phrase backup restoration process. These words should be guarded with maximum security and you should never take a screenshot of them or type the words online. If someone else knows the twelve-word mnemonic seed tethered to your coins this means someone can have full access to your cryptocurrency holdings.\nAn example of a private key tied to a twelve-word mnemonic phrase within an Electrum wallet. The QR code to the right is also a private key.\nA Backup Keyfile or JSON File\nThere are other ways you can be given a private key like, for instance, in a keyfile or JSON file. A JSON file (JavaScript Object Notation) is simply a file with a lightweight data format that allows it to be easily read and written by humans or machines. Sometimes browser wallets will give you a backup JSON file that contains your coins’ private keys. These types of files need to be imported into a supporting wallet to gain access to the funds associated with the keys. These files need to be secured in a safe manner and users can hide them and encrypt them in folders so intruders can’t gain access to the file. Just like the mnemonic seed, someone with access to a keyfile or JSON has full access to the funds associated with those keys.\nThe Fundamental Difference Between Importing and Sweeping\nImport\nThere are also two different ways people can obtain their keys — importing and sweeping. These two distinct ways of gaining full ownership of keys are separate actions within the cryptocurrency-import process. Importing a private key means you are simply tethering the funds that belong to the private key to an existing set of keys in your software wallet. This means the coins are still tied to the private key that may be tied to a paper wallet for example. Both wallets now have access to the funds tethered to the private key until they are spent. If you are planning to import keys make sure that both areas of ownership remain 100 percent secure from other individuals, otherwise you may want to sweep the keys.\nSweep\nEssentially sweeping private keys is a form of importing them but when you sweep them they are sent to an entirely different address and the older imported key set is no longer valid. So if you take the Bitcoin.com Wallet and sweep the paper wallet someone gave you, the paper wallet will be emptied. Anytime you sweep a source wallet the funds will be moved to an entirely different location with another public and private key pair. Lots of wallets allow users to sweep a QR code that contains a private key in order to gain access to the funds. Note that if you have a QR code tethered to a private key on a paper wallet or stored somewhere and it is exposed it can be easily swept away if it’s not kept hidden.\nBitcoin: Be Your Own Bank\nAs we mentioned above, keys can be kept in QR codes, keyfiles, JSON files, and mnemonic phrases and knowing how to access them for full ownership is a must for every cryptocurrency enthusiast. If you hold your money on an exchange you are allowing a third party to have ownership of your coins and if something happened to that exchange like a hack that resulted in a huge loss you may lose your bitcoins. Gaining access to your cryptocurrency’s keys means you own them and you maintain full ownership. The fundamental benefit of bitcoin means you get to be your own bank.\nAre you sure you own your private keys?

The major crypto exchange is thinking about opening an office in Uganda and we have covered the story in today’s Bitcoin in Brief. Also, online trade with cryptos spikes in Bahrain, while in Georgia, luxury real estate is being sold for bitcoin. All this has been happening in an otherwise bearish May. Binance to Open Office in Uganda\nBinance is considering the possibility of opening a new office in Uganda , company CEO Changpeng Zhao revealed at The Africa Blockchain Conference 2018, which took place at the end of May in Kampala, the country’s capital. The move is part of the trading platform’s plans to support the economic transformation of the African nation and increase youth employment through blockchain technology implementation. The leading cryptocurrency exchange has offices in Japan, Hong Kong, Malta , and intends to establish a global compliance center in Bermuda .\nWith the help of companies like Binance, “Uganda will be able to join the 4th Industrial Revolution, subsequently a lot of new jobs will open and the flow of investment into the country will increase,” Zhao said. “Watching this conference I was very impressed by the enthusiasm of Africans to introduce cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. It was surprising to see that cryptocurrencies enjoy not only an increased interest from the people, but also the active support of many representatives of African banks and government officials,” he stated.\nIn April, Binance’ CEO announced a partnership with Crypto Savannah, an African blockchain innovation hub, Msingi, an organization working to build the East African industries of the future, and the “Made in Africa” Initiative. In a post on Twitter, Changpeng Zhao promised “thousands of jobs and bringing investments to Uganda.” “Expect more news on Africa!” he added in the comments.\nIn a statement during the conference in Kampala, Zhao noted that most banks in Europe, the US, and China criticize cryptocurrencies and do everything possible to crush them, and added: “It seems to me that Africa has real chances of becoming one of the leading regions in the implementation of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.” Bearish May Brings Down Trading Volumes\nMore than $606 billion in cryptocurrencies have been traded last month through over 1,600 different cryptocurrencies, according to Coinmarketcap . The total is less than half the $1.4 trillion in more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies traded during the previous monthly period, 24/7 Wall St reports. The data shows a bearish May following a rather bullish April. With a 30-day volume of $184.31 billion, bitcoin (BTC) is the most traded cryptocurrency.\nThe last several months have seen another negative trend – in futures trading. Since March, the contracts have dropped by a third. Nymex bitcoin futures have lost more than 51% since trading began in January. Bitcoin June futures on Cboe traded down about 1.9% at noon on Wednesday. The expiration of CME bitcoin futures on May 25 also influenced cryptocurrency prices. Crypto Trade Booming in Bahrain\nIn some parts of the world, however, things do not look so bleak. Since the beginning of this year, more jurisdictions have begun to legally recognize cryptocurrencies, one way or another. These include the US, Canada, many members of the European Union, and several African and Asian nations.\nBahrain , a country credited for building the first post-oil economy in the Persian Gulf, has recently enjoyed a spike in online trade using cryptocurrency, according to local media. In the absence of official regulations, bitcoin transactions have been booming on Bahraini websites and social media. A shop selling crypto-priced items is set to open soon in the Riffa area, Albawaba Business reported.\nThe island nation has also indicated it may soon emerge as a global cryptocurrency exchange hub. In March, the government in Manama set up a “regulatory sandbox” for that purpose. “As long as the business qualifies as fintech, we will welcome it,” said Khalid Saad, CEO of Bahrain Fintech Bay, quoted by Business Line . At least four crypto trading platforms are already registered there.\nThe sector, however, is still awaiting a final decision on the legal tender status of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. It is supposed to come from the Central Bank of Bahrain, which is the country’s financial regulator. Real Estate Sold for Bitcoin in Georgia\nA luxurious apartment has been put on sale for 25 bitcoins (~$190,000) in Georgia . According to local realtors, the owner has explicitly asked the price to be announced in cryptocurrency, Geomigrant reports. The current legislation does not mention crypto payments. Despite the lack of a regulatory framework, cryptocurrencies are gaining popularity as a means of exchange and trade among Georgians.\nThe Caucasian country is known as a major crypto mining hub in Eurasia thanks to some tax incentives and low electricity rates. According to a recently published study by the World Bank, around 5% of Georgian households participate in cryptocurrency trading and investing. Blockchain technologies have also spread in Georgia.\nWhat are your thoughts on the topics in today’s Bitcoin in Brief?

Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy. News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system . Do not post your Bitcoin address unless someone explicitly asks you to. Be aware that Twitter, etc. is full of impersonation.

Robert Sluymer told CNBC’s Futures Now :\nWhen we step back, we see the first phase starting to happen. We think Bitcoin is starting to bottom off some very key support around $7,000 and we think it’s going to start a recovery process here.\nSluymer’s statements come after the first and foremost cryptocurrency has found support at key support levels around the psychologically-significant level of $7,000 multiple times. In each instance, Bitcoin went on to recover — as it did earlier this week. Sluymer explained:\nThat’s certainly the first step in a bottoming process – to see some sort of consolidation or a basing taking hold. Technical Indicators\nAdding to the belief that Bitcoin has bottomed out is the market leader’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), a popular momentum indicator that compares the magnitude of recent gains and losses over a specified time period in an effort to measure speed and change of price movements. According to Sluymer, the RSI supports Fundstrat’s belief that Bitcoin is ready to rally. He stated:\nThat RSI indicator in the bottom of the chart is very oversold and starting to bottom so that’s really part of that bottoming phase taking hold.\nHowever, one should always exercise caution when following the advice of anyone analyzing the cryptocurrency market — which itself is prone to high levels of volatility and unregulated price manipulation . Because of this, there are some other indicators which may help confirm a reversal. Fundstrat’s head of technical strategy explained:\nThe next thing that has to happen is to see Bitcoin actually rally through the downtrend and we use the 15-day moving average, it’s very simplistic, but it’s a pretty good proxy across most markets.\nThat 15-day moving average is roughly $7,800. Should Bitcoin manage to hold a level above said price, it is likely that buyers will enter the market with increased confidence. ‘The Setup is Very Attractive Here’\nIt has been over one week since Bitcoin last traded above $7,800, but Sluymer believes we’re currently in a prime buying opportunity. He told CNBC:\nWe think the setup is very attractive here. If you’re short we think you should be very careful and reducing your short exposure. I think if you’re looking to be long this is where you start adding here to your long exposure.\nAt the time of this writing, Bitcoin is currently trading at $7,591.31, up 0.32 percent over the last 24 hours.\nDo you think Bitcoin has bottomed? Do you agree with Fundstrat’s analysis that the market leader is already beginning to rally?

Lightning Payments Meet Android\nThe release, called simply Lightning Wallet , incorporates a fully operational Lightning node, providing for both on-chain Bitcoin and off-chain Lightning Network transactions.\nUsers will be able to take advantage of the increasingly well-populated network, benefits including near-instant sending and receiving of Bitcoin via dedicated channels for fees of less than one satoshi ($0.0000755141) – Bitcoin’s smallest unit. The app has received six positive 5-star user reviews so far.\n“It is crucial to understand that Lightning Wallet is a completely standalone app, it is not a thin client to some centralized service,” the wallet’s description to potential users reads.\nThis most importantly means that your money is stored right on your phone and nowhere else which gives you a ultimate censorship resistance : no one can ‘freeze your account’ or cancel your transactions, but at the same time this makes you the only one responsible for securing your funds. Mitigating Funds Loss Concerns\nAs Bitcoinist has reported throughout 2018 since Lightning’s mainnet release went live, both support and adoption have been brisk, despite the underlying technology remaining in an experimental phase.\nWhile the potential for funds to go missing due to technical inconsistencies remains, Lightning Wallet developers claim they have mitigated such risks using a mnemonic passphrase setup.\n“This is [the] first Lightning wallet on [the] market which offers off-chain data loss protection: in case of emergencies such as phone loss you will only need a mnemonic phrase to recover both on-chain Bitcoin balance and off-chain Lightning balance,” its Google Play description confirms.\nIn April, Lightning passed the symbolic adoption mark of 2000 nodes, with over 6000 channels currently open, handling a total network capacity of over $160,000.\nVarious consumer tools have gone live, while payment processor CoinGate recently announced it had also pivoted to add compatibility for merchants.\n“Although still in its early stages and more suited to advanced, technical users, LN is, without doubt, the most awaited upgrade to the Bitcoin network,” the company wrote in a statement.\nWhat do you think about Lightning Wallet?

The $1 billion fund setup by Binance will be used to back cryptocurrency and blockchain startups. Binance Looks to Strengthen the Blockchain Space with Investments and Incubation of Startups\nThe fund will be known as the ‘Community Influence Fund.’ It was announced in an online broadcast by the Binance Labs CEO Ella Zhang. The fund will be largely based around the exchange platform’s native cryptocoin BNB.\nYesterday’s broadcast was the first made by the team behind Binance Labs. As well as Ella Zhang, other team members in attendance included Chloe Zhang, Christy Choi, Benjamin Rameau, and Teck Chia. Ti He, the co-founder of Binance, hosted the conference which also included the participation of over 600 investors.\nAs well as the Community Influence Fund, the exchange is also creating the Binance Ecosystem Fund with the collaboration of around 20 partners. This news was broken to Tech Crunch by a spokesperson for the company. The representative told the publication that further details would be released soon.\nDuring the conference, the team also spoke about the first project that would be ‘incubated’ by Binance Labs. Dache Chain is a ride hailing platform that has been founded by Weixing Chen and Jun Yang – both successful entrepreneurs in similar fields. NewsBTC reported on Dache Chain and its founders earlier this week.\nBinance Labs defined themselves as comprising of the following three wings: Institute: A research division focusing on blockchain tech and the cryptocurrency economy. Ecological Fund: An influence fund that favours an approach that serves the blockchain ecosystem rather than strictly returns on investments. Incubator: With a focus on nurturing young startups and providing funding. This, they say, will ’empower top blockchain and cryptocurrency talent.’\nFinally, Binance Labs stated that they have already invested in four projects. These are: the cryptocurrency MobileCoin, a high-performance public blockchain by Oasis Labs, verification platform known as Certik, and a crowdfunding platform called Republic.\nThe Binance exchange platform was formed less than one year ago. They have quickly established themselves as the leading trading venue in terms of daily volume according to cryptocurrency price website CoinMarketCap. The company is currently based in Hong Kong, but is currently in the process of relocating to Malta . The small European island nation’s government has been particularly keen to embrace blockchain technology. This has made the country an attract place for startups in the industry, Binance included.

After hitting all-time highs in early January, all markets have lost a lot of value. Despite this negative market pressure, startups are still of great interest. Paxos, a blockchain and cryptocurrency startup, recently raised $65m from various VC investors. The interest in cryptocurrency firms is not slowing down, by the look of things. The Success of Paxos\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, Paxos has become a relatively big name. The company specializes in bringing Bitcoin and other currencies to the mainstream. This is mainly made possible thanks to the firm obtaining a trust company charter in New York state. That particular region of the US is not too cryptocurrency-friendly, mainly because of its BitLicense implementation.\nConsidering how the company initially started out as a Bitcoin exchange, a lot of things have changed. Providing services using blockchain is their main objective under the current business model. Even so, the company is looking to enter the cryptocurrency industry once again. To do so, Paxos team members have dedicated a lot of time and resources into exploring new trading options.\nIt seems this latest venture has attracted the attention of VC firms. Paxos recently closed a $65m funding with the help of RRE Ventures and Liberty City Ventures, among others. With this new funding, the company will expand its operation and further develop its cryptocurrency exchange operations. More competition in the cryptocurrency trading ecosystem can only be a good thing. VCs Remain Charmed by Cryptocurrency\nEven though 2018 hasn’t been the year of Bitcoin, the overall expectations remain positive. Consumers and enthusiasts are confident things will turn around for this industry later this year. This new funding round by Paxos seemingly confirms interesting things could be on the horizon.\nThe past few years have seen many VCs invest in Bitcoin companies. It appears that trend has also come to a halt in recent months, albeit this latest development shows the interest is still there. Cryptocurrency trading still remains attractive, albeit the increased volatility an cause gains and losses in equal fashion these days.\nWith this new funding, Paxos will have to live up the expectations. Enhancing the company’s position in the cryptocurrency industry will be challenging. With regulatory measures being introduced all over the world, companies will have to adhere to a new set of rules. Whether or not that will hinder Paxos’ chances of success, remains to be determined.

Ethereum price seems to be preparing for an upside break above USD 600. IOTA, VERI, HT, Ontology and BNB are trading higher with solid gains.\nBitcoin price stayed above the USD 7,400 support area during the past three sessions and it mostly consolidated in a range. However, BTC/USD seems to be facing a tough challenge near the USD 7,600 and USD 7,650 resistance levels. On the other hand, altcoins are slowly moving higher and many major cryptocurrencies are poised to break key resistance levels, including Ethereum and ADA.\nBitcoin Bitcoin price remained confined in a range below the USD 7,600 and USD 7,650 resistance levels (GMT 09:00). A successful break and close above USD 7,620 - USD 7,650 is needed for additional gains towards USD 8,000 in the near term. On the downside, the USD 7,400 level is a crucial support. As long as BTC/USD is above USD 7,400, the pair remains in an uptrend. Should there be a downside break below USD 7,400, the price may move back in a bearish zone to test the USD 7,250 and USD 7,000 support levels.\nEthereum Ethereum is grinding higher and is currently up around 2.8% to USD 585. It seems like the ETH/USD pair may continue to move higher and it could accelerate gains above the USD 600 barrier. On the flip side, if there is no upside break above USD 600, the price could correct lower. Supports on the downside are seen near USD 560 and USD 550.\nBitcoin Cash and Ripple Bitcoin cash is flirting with the USD 1,000 handle. The BCH/USD pair struggled to move above the USD 1,040 resistance, but at the same time, it held the USD 960 support. It seems like the pair might trade in a range for a few more hours before the next break either above USD 1,040 or below USD 960.\nRipple price is gaining upside momentum and is currently up 1.5% to USD 0.615. On the upside, XRP/USD is facing resistances near USD 0.62 and USD 0.625.

He also famously said, “Bitcoin: we tried this with our eCommerce store years back. Didn’t see much. Would love to see a digital currency thrive,” in a tweet last year.\nAnd according to Bloomberg, Square’s shares have also surged 25 percent since the company announced it was buying website builder Weebly, which provides tools to easily build a professional website or online store.\nSquare will pay with a combination of cash and stock of approximately $365 million, which includes restricted stock units for Weebly’s founders and employees that will vest over four years after closing. This is Square’s biggest acquisition to date.\n“Square and Weebly share a passion for empowering and celebrating entrepreneurs,” said Dorsey. “Square began its journey with in-person solutions, while Weebly began its journey online. Since then, we’ve both been building services to bridge these channels, and we can go even further and faster together.”\nThe deal builds Square’s online and eCommerce offerings for small and medium-size businesses, while also giving it a recurring revenue stream and new customers.\nSquare’s stock closed on Thursday (May 31) at $58.25, a new record high, shortly before the company raised its annual revenue forecast to reflect the impact of it latest acquisition.\nSquare’s gross payment volume could reach $409 billion in 2026, or 4.1 percent of total U.S. payment volume, RBC Capital Markets analyst Daniel Perlin predicted in a recent note to clients.\n“Square’s integrated hardware, software and services solutions position the company to benefit from ongoing card acceptance penetration at smaller merchants, while gaining share against existing solutions that lag from a technological or efficiency basis,” wrote Perlin.\n.

Citing that these coins belong to the customers, the group seeks to change the business practices of crypto exchanges and obtain the forked coins for the plaintiffs.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Class Action Lawsuit Over Forked Coins\nA group of lawyers is preparing a class action lawsuit against the majority of crypto exchanges in Japan for withholding customers’ forked cryptocurrencies. They have formed a litigation counsel seeking to represent crypto holders nationwide in obtaining their forked cryptocurrencies from exchanges. The group announced on Thursday, May 31:\nThis is to bring back the virtual currency (hard fork coins) that most exchanges do not grant to the original owners.\n“The virtual currency you deposit at an exchange should not belong to the exchange, but to the user,” the lawyers explained on their website created for traders to join the lawsuit, emphasizing that the exchanges currently judge for themselves whether to give these coins to customers.\nIf they decide not to grant these coins to customers, then these “forked coins will be that of the exchanges, [and] the exchanges will be free to use them and make them profitable,” the group detailed.\nIn addition, if they decide to grant these coins to customers after a considerable amount of time, then users cannot benefit during that period, but “the exchanges can raise their operating profits [with the coins] during that period.”\nCiting that there is no legal basis for handling hard forks, the lawyers stated that it is “unhealthy” how the exchanges currently judge whether to grant customers their forked coins, adding:\nIf you deposit a virtual currency at an exchange, your contract with the exchange will be similar to a bank deposit. Therefore, [when] the deposited virtual currency is hard forked, the forked coins generated by the division are considered to belong to you, not to the exchange. In other words, it is a natural interpretation that exchanges have an obligation to grant this.\nAccording to Forkdrop.io , there have been 110 forked coins; BTC has been forked 70 times. Examples of forked coins. Participating Lawyers\nFive lawyers are participating in this lawsuit: Masaki Yoshida, Miki Fukuda, Kenzo Nakamura, Taiji Jonnouchi, and Koizumi Makoto. Their website also states, without further elaboration, that “Participation from overseas is also possible.” Five participating lawyers.\nThe lawyers say that they have received requests regarding forked coins from a group of plaintiffs. After investigating the situation, they found a considerable legal problem in dealing with exchanges over obtaining forked coins.\nThis is not the group’s first legal case concerning cryptocurrencies. Their announcement reveals that they previously filed a lawsuit against Coincheck in the Tokyo district court after it was hacked in January.\nFor the hard fork lawsuit, the group’s fee is 20% of the forked coins if there is a winning judgment or settlement, the website detailed and quoted Yoshida saying (loosely translated):\nWe formed this lawyer [group] to pursue changes of business practices pertaining to virtual currency trading.\nWhat do you think of this lawsuit? Do you think it will be successful? Let us know in the comments section below.\nImages courtesy of Shutterstock and the Hard fork litigation counsel.\nNeed to calculate your bitcoin holdings?

Being the first currency to utilize blockchain technology, and remaining that way for some years has led to it gaining a solid foothold in the market in terms of users and overall value and market share. This has not remained a constant however, as the development of the first public Alternatives to Bitcoins or “Altcoins” in 2011 has given buyers other options from what was a limiting framework and non-liquid currency in Bitcoin.\nWith the advent of Altcoins such as DasCoin entering the public market in the years leading to the present, Bitcoin has slowly relinquished the front stage, relegating itself to a placeholder role, wherein it remains as a non-liquid but value-stable cryptocurrency. However, it is undeniable that it is becoming impractical to use it as a day-to-day payment method, which is where Altcoins come in.\nThe Potential Of Altcoins & DasCoin\nCryptocurrency has seen a general upward trend in value, as any product in its early years with a growing user base will tend to do. But a growing userbase isn’t the only determinant of success and value in this industry. In a world where the very framework of Cryptocurrencies is based off of cutting edge technology, innovation and development drives value and popularity as much as anything.\nIt is here where Altcoins such as DasCoin shine, as they are situated in the beneficial position of garnering the advantages of the existing foundations of Bitcoin and blockchain technology, but also being able to develop their own unique features, and adjust the existing framework to adapt to the needs of the cryptocurrency market. It is this flexibility that lends Altcoins a bright future in the industry, and also gives an insight into the possibility that Bitcoin’s position at the top could be a precarious one.\nCryptocurrencies: Looking Forward\nWith the significant scope of analysis and interpretation that goes into the monitoring of trends in the cryptocurrency industry, predicting its future is not as complex as one might think. But past the numbers and the upward trends, one must take into account variables that cannot be quantified. Going forward, the people who use blockchain technology will be looking towards efficiency, stability, transparency, and security when searching for the ideal cryptocurrency option, and as innovation drives the development of Altcoins forward, there is a distinct possibility that Bitcoin may lag behind.\nWhile it is far from a foregone conclusion that Bitcoin will no longer be a key player in the industry, it may not be so unlikely to imagine Altcoins taking center stage, as options such as DasCoin lead cryptocurrencies in customer satisfaction and trust, and continue to place the user at the center of its ethos, delivering that high standard through the implementation of intuitive frameworks and innovative use of blockchain technology.\nIn conclusion, a clear case could be made for the marked rise of Altcoins in comparison to that of Bitcoin, such that it may come to a point where Altcoins are no longer the alternative to Bitcoin, but the preferred option.\nhttps://netleaders.com/ref/Oldsol30", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://netleaders.com/ref/Oldsol30"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T15:42:15.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "48937b25ca2fb8524053890f248e37f18aa6b479", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSzGdGjZ1rxN9GxLiYVLCGsM-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn free Bitcoin!

After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

The cryptocurrency has been trading around this level throughout most of the week, finally settling down after weeks of gradual decline.\nHowever, the market may be due for a reversal. Yesterday, Dan Morehead, founder of Pantera Capital Management, said in an interview with CNBC that “Bitcoin may have reached its bottom this year, so now is a good time to buy,” Morehead continued: “As a whole, cryptocurrencies have declined about 65% from their highs this year. It’s much cheaper to buy now and participate in the rally as it goes”. BTC/USD Testing Resistance\nBitcoin price is currently forming a bullish trend line that’s looking to test a major resistance level at $7,500. A break above that seems likely, given the steady gains experienced over the past few hours. In that case, the next critical level would be $7,800. This is regarded as a key barrier for BTC/USD to return above $8,000.\nOn the other hand, a struggle to break the resistance level could result in a minor downside reaction to test a major support level at $7,350. A break below that price may send BTC/USD down further to a retracement level of $7,200.\nSource: Tradingview\nIn the chart above, the MACD is showing a neutral signal, while the RSI indicator puts Bitcoin on the oversold side.

The firm kicked off its own bitcoin mining operations in December 2017, and has also slated in August as the deadline for the launch of its cloud mining service.\nThe tech giant said in the announcement that the hope is to encourage the public to become familiar with cryptocurrencies via the new app, since users will need to use their own digital wallets to receive and use the bitcoin.\nGMO indicated that, moving forward, it may include support for more cryptocurrencies within the app and also expand its integrations across other mobile games.\nThe new service comes just a week after GMO announced that it is launching the world’s first 7nm bitcoin mining chip, with a target shipment deadline set for the end of October 2018.\nMobile game image via Shutterstock\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

Listings are a big deal to cryptocurrency teams, representing a validation of their coin, and they’re also a big deal to investors, who can profit off the price boost that invariably ensues. Lately though, those pumps have been diminishing due to trader fatigue exacerbated by an increase in frequency of new listings.\nAlso read: Bitcoin Ownership: Your Private Keys to Financial Sovereignty The Unbouncing of Binance\nWhile any new coin added to Binance can expect an immediate jump in price, the extent of the Binance bounce appears to be waning. It’s common practice for Binance to commence trading four hours after announcing a new listing. Up until recently, a coin could expect to soar in price off the news and then keep rising for hours or even days after trading commenced on the platform. Over the past month, the trajectory taken by new coins has changed, however. The price is still sure to soar, but now its appreciation is typically short-lived, and more akin to that of a classic pump and dump.\nBinance has no desire to pump coin prices; it’s merely an unavoidable side-effect of adding new assets. Traders, on the other hand, who have had little to crow about in a lengthy bear market, tend to be very fond of the resultant spike, which provides an opportunity to make – or lose – a lot of crypto in very little time. The reason why Binance coin listings have gone from “sustained price increase” to “flash pump” are likely to be two-fold, and mirror those which occurred at Kucoin earlier this year. More Frequency, More Predictability\nIn April, Binance listed just four coins: Golem, Cloak, Cardano, and Groestlcoin. On April 4, Groestlcoin tripled in price, and then doubled again in the space of 10 days, eventually doing a 5x. Cardano, which already had high liquidity on other major exchanges, grew by a third after its Binance listing. Cloak rose by 25%, and Golem by 40% within five days of listing.\nThen, in May, Binance doubled its monthly listing ratio from four to eight. In total it added Theta, Civic, Skycoin, Zencash, Trueusd, Augur, Bytecoin, and Loom. All of these coins pumped in price – even supposed stablecoin Trueusd – but often the effects were short-lived. By the time Civic opened for trading, for instance, it had almost returned to its pre-announcement price.\nIt is the prerogative of exchanges to decide which coins they should list and how often. In the case of platforms such as Kucoin and Binance, however, the novelty of a weekly listing has turned into the normality of an often daily listing. Even the bots seem to be getting tired of pumping the price of new Binance coins. On June 1, the exchange announced the listing of IOTX. Once again, its chart followed the same pattern as other recent additions such as Civic, with a drop-off as fast as its ascent. Binance listings are good for a lot of things, but sustaining a new price floor for digital assets is not necessarily one of them.\nDo you think Binance is losing its ability to inflate newly listed coins?

With Winding Tree, which is a blockchain-based travel distribution platform, the intention is to see how Swissport’s travel services and new offers can be distributed, with any provider able to tap into its inventory.\nThe company said that while the focus will initially be on distributing classic ancillary travel services to independent travelers, like airport lounge access, it expects to use blockchain to efficiently distribute additional services to individuals and corporate clients in the longer term. Winding Tree has a number of travel industry partners on the airline and hotel side, but Swissport will be the platform’s launch partner for ancillary ground travel services.\n“Blockchain allows us to reimagine how we work with our partners in the complex aviation and logistics ecosystem,” says Florian Eggenschwiler, Head of Swissport’s innovation unit. “We expect to see lasting benefits from this technology for fragmented global industries like aviation services and supply chain. It will likely change how service providers, clients and partners will transact with each other. We want to get familiar with such technologies early in the innovation cycle and partner with technology leaders to explore its potential in our business for a variety of use cases.” advertisement\nIn respect of its cargo handling business, where tracking and documentation are important, Swissport said it will start a pilot phase with Olam, a non-profit foundation, dedicated to developing an open-source platform for supply chain partners. This platform is intended to allow partners to collaborate in a decentralized, but secure and trust-enabled environment.\n“Thinking beyond traditional messaging, blockchain could eventually become the new standard allowing us to overcome the chronic lack of transparency, which is typical for fragmented supply chains,” said Hendrik Leyssens, Head of Global Cargo Operations. “Blockchain could speed up transactions, enhance transaction security and at the same time unlock cost savings.” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "swissport explores blockchain potential for airport services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockchain news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swissport international", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-01T20:41:42.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "45a99bcafdf68ca32e06b5e37aaca47987ef935f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTQe9Wr1weoy4CFnDOP.SZ00R.W5S5rzmJBfwEZ13diHlg4oCxNC_K4AAg1udwlM79aoBBvht.QTEXolNGV0WfrTrQDCA_6Mqm2HAPhxmYqV0lK3fpuipFeMQCAL31ljYk0vT6WLNLyo.Q5IcSX0utb", "site_full": "shiirts.com", "site": "shiirts.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["real_estate", "buying_selling_homes"], "section_title": "", "title": "Womens Beer, Babes, And Bitcoin Funny Digital Coin Humor T-Shirt Medium Black – T Shirts", "title_full": "Womens Beer, Babes, And Bitcoin Funny Digital Coin Humor T-Shirt Medium Black – T Shirts", "published": "2018-06-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.379, "main_image": "https://shiirts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Womens-Beer-Babes-And-Bitcoin-Funny-Digital-Coin-Humor-T-Shirt-Medium-Black-0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "45a99bcafdf68ca32e06b5e37aaca47987ef935f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTQe9Wr1weoy4CFnDOP.SZ00R.W5S5rzmJBfwEZ13diHlg4oCxNC_K4AAg1udwlM79aoBBvht.QTEXolNGV0WfrTrQDCA_6Mqm2HAPhxmYqV0lK3fpuipFeMQCAL31ljYk0vT6WLNLyo.Q5IcSX0utb", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Womens Beer, Babes, And Bitcoin Funny Digital Coin Humor T-Shirt Medium Black – T Shirts", "text": "Reviews (0)\nBeer, Babes, And Bitcoin Funny Digital Coin Humor T-Shirt – Bitcoin Crypto Blockchain Cryptocurrency HODL Digital Currency Coin Cool Humor Tee.
