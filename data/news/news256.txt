maker of bitcoin mining hardware, has submitted an application for a Hong Kong initial public offering that could raise about $1 billion, people with knowledge of the matter said.\nThe Chinese company aims to start trading as soon as July, one of the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.\nA listing of Canaan would be the first Hong Kong IPO from the cryptocurrency industry. The company has about 15 per cent share of the global market for bitcoin mining chips and computer equipment, trailing Chinese rival Bitmain, according to a February report from Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.\nCanaan, founded in 2013, sells computer equipment under the “Avalon” brand with fast customised chips that win digital coins by solving complex math problems. The company’s hardware often ends up in remote locales housing large mining pools that depend on cheap electricity, Co-Chairman Jianping Kong said in an April interview.\nThe company also announced last year it was developing dedicated chips for use in artificial intelligence applications.\nNo final decisions have been made, and details of the offering could change, the people said. Kong, the Canaan co-chairman, declined to comment on details of the IPO preparations.\nCanaan was preparing last year to list on China’s National Equities Exchange and Quotations, an over-the-counter market known as the New Third Board, before opting to pursue a Hong Kong IPO.\nIn 2016, electrical equipment manufacturer Shandong Luyitong Intelligent Electric Plc attempted to acquire Canaan, according to filings at the time. The deal didn’t go through due to the “great uncertainties” surrounding China’s securities environment and regulatory policies, Shandong Luyitong said in a September 2016 statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jianping kong", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ipo hong kong canaan creative", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sanford c. bernstein & co", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canaan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T20:09:14.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "663fd37ff27c2e23f1634b52b33957b0646c366d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8V3hjtiEsopV6zGBPUxx3d.KmK79uBZy8ze4TXntE836hJkwKLXvaq3Ppvvr4GTWozl7TXvY3xfQqokr7dK4ExAMMRQJH81X3rA_.XtHjtV.DAHQxxqfxNuy11wg8rUJA5iNlXg1D3nS02I9S0rezDjL6ejqnGuFUYtD804qLQHw--", "site_full": "www.montpelierjournal.com", "site": "montpelierjournal.com", "site_section": "http://www.montpelierjournal.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Montpelier Journal", "title": "Grabbing Unlimited Opportunities through Advert and Bitcoin Based Product Marketing", "title_full": "Grabbing Unlimited Opportunities through Advert and Bitcoin Based Product Marketing", "published": "2018-05-15T23:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "663fd37ff27c2e23f1634b52b33957b0646c366d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8V3hjtiEsopV6zGBPUxx3d.KmK79uBZy8ze4TXntE836hJkwKLXvaq3Ppvvr4GTWozl7TXvY3xfQqokr7dK4ExAMMRQJH81X3rA_.XtHjtV.DAHQxxqfxNuy11wg8rUJA5iNlXg1D3nS02I9S0rezDjL6ejqnGuFUYtD804qLQHw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-15T23:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "Grabbing Unlimited Opportunities through Advert and Bitcoin Based Product Marketing", "text": "Grabbing Unlimited Opportunities through Advert and Bitcoin Based Product Marketing May 15 20:07 2018 The changing world of technology had ushered in a generation of digital revolution which as Don Tapscott described, occurred in two phases; the first which brought to the world of man “the internet of information” and the second “powered by block chain technology… bringing to man the internet of value: a new platform to reshape the world of business and transform the old order of human affairs for the better.” Despite the numerous opportunities that accompany this new world of online business conduct, limited information and risk factors are reasons the medium lack of full exploitation.

A recovery attempted on weekend, failed to get the digital currency No.1 above $9,000 threshold. BTC/USD is trading at $8,346 at the time of writing, off the Asian high of $8,712. The coin has lost 4.5% since the start of the day and reversed all Sunday and Saturday gains. Meanwhile, crypto enthusiasts are flocking to New York for one of the largest crypto event of the year – CoinDesk’s Consensus conference. Fundstrat’s managing director and technical strategist Robert Sluymer expect that the event will serve as a good bullish trigger for Bitcoin and other coins, dispelling pessimism about regulatory risks. “The regulatory risk, the fundamental risk around what’s happening with cryptos has hit a bottom and now we’re in a state of general recovery,” he said on CNBC’s “Fast Money” Thursday . He explained that Bitcoin increased each year after Consensus, though it remains to be seen if the market follows the tradition this year. Bitcoin’s technical picture On the longer-term scale, Bitcoin is jammed between 100-DMA and 50-DMA ($8,826 and $8,263 respectively). A sustainable break in either direction will trigger a strong movement with the next upside target seen at psychological $9,000 and support at $8,000. Both levels are critical for Bitcoin, as move below $8,000 will signal that a recovery from April’s low at $6,400 is over.

These have been almost completely replaced by P2PKH, although sometimes mining rewards are still paid out to P2PK. Input: 114 B Output: 44 B (compressed), 76 B (uncompressed)\nMultisig transactions were possible by using the corresponding OP_CODE directly even before P2SH was introduced. Most multisig transactions today are done with P2SH transactions today, though. Input: variable (depends on m-of-n) Output: variable (must include all pubkeys)\nPay to Public Key Hash (P2PKH) is today the most commonly used address format. A P2PKH output signs over funds directly to an address derived from a single recipient key. Input: 148 B Output: 34 B\nPay to Script Hash (P2SH) was in the past foremost used for multisignature transactions, but any valid redeemscript is allowed. Creative use of P2SH allowed the introduction of backwards-compatible segwit addresses: \"Nested Pay to Witness Public Key Hash\" (P2SH-PWPKH or NP2WPKH) and \"Nested Pay to Script Hash\" (P2SH-P2WSH or NP2WSH) can be sent to by any client that can send to P2SH. Input: variable (2-of-3: 295 B, NP2PKH: 91 vBytes, NP2WSH 2-of-3: 138 vBytes) Output: 32 B\nPay to Witness Public Key Hash (P2WPKH) is the corresponding native segwit format to P2PKH, making use of a witness program rather than a signature script. P2WPKH addresses are encoded with bech32 instead of base58 meaning that only clients that understand the native segwit format can send to them. Input: 68 vBytes Output: 31 B\nPay to Witness Script Hash (P2WSH) is the corresponding native segwit format to P2SH, making use of a witness program rather than a redeemscript. P2WSH addresses are encoded with bech32 rather than base58, only updated clients can send to them. Input: variable (2-of-3: 106(?) vBytes) Output: 43 B\nNull Data (OP_RETURN) transactions are allowed to have a single ouptut that writes up to 80 bytes of data to the blockchain. Input: N/A Output: <= 80 + 11(?) bytes\nNon-standard transactions encompass any other transactions that don't fit one of the above template. Non-standard transactions will not be relayed by most nodes in the network.\nAdditionally, transaction overhead adds 10 bytes for non-segwit transactions and 10.5 vbytes for segwit transactons (for numInputs, numOutputs < 256). overhead = version + numInputs + numOutputs + nLocktime = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10 bytes segwit overhead = version + numInputs + numOutputs + nLocktime + marker + flag = 16 + 4 + 4 + 16 + 1 + 1 [weight units] = 42 weight units = 10.5 vbytes\nAll size data is provided on a best-effort basis, corrections welcome.

Obviously, our cautious view came a bit early but the last 5-10% of any rally are always the most dangerous ones. At that stage, everybody is getting very bullish and weak hands are finally buying while the underlying market moves further into an overbought setup and risk is increasing dramatically.\nAs Bitcoin moved towards $10,000, many of the small highly speculative coins started to move as well. But the resistance at the round psychological number was obvious and it is no wonder that Bitcoin did correct hard reaching $8,200 last Saturday. Today, it has already retraced nearly one-third of this recent pullback as an intraday high was reached at $8,825. As usual, the crypto markets are moving so fast that you cannot even finish your written analysis before the situation might have changed significantly…\nOverall, the big question remains whether the strong recovery from the lows in early April around $6,500 is just a counter-trend bounce within the larger downtrend or whether the crypto sector indeed has bottomed, and we are in a new up-leg already. Recent price action is not helpful yet to answer this question. But let's look at the chart to determine the situation and potential scenarios.\nBitcoin Technical Analysis\nOver the last four months, Bitcoin seems to be running into a large triangle.

Though as Fundstrat market strategists have pointed out, much of the gains in the bitcoin price tend to unfold over just a handful of days each year.\nEven at the start of the new year, when the bitcoin price was trading in the doldrums, Hayes wasn’t phased, though he pointed out “it’s [his] job to make predictions” whether or not they come true.\nHayes, a Citigroup alum, explained that he is a volatility trader, and he makes his money on the volatility in the bitcoin price, which there has been no shortage of year-to-date. “If it goes up, if it goes down, if you have Bill Gates calling it a fraud … Short it, I don’t care. If you think it’s going to be $1 million in a few months, great, buy it. I still don’t care. We just match trades,” Hayes said.\nAsia-focused BitMEX is geared toward retail investors but instead of spot trading, it has some of the advanced features that you might expect to see on an institutional trading platform, including derivatives, margin trading and up to 100x leverage (which is more of a “headline number” and not something most traders take advantage of). The exchange supports short trading in perpetual contracts .\nMarket Dynamics Hayes also addressed the cultural differences that affect cryptocurrency market dynamics in the Western world and Asia, the latter of which is where some suggest two-thirds of the market originates from.\n“I think Asia dominates crypto because they’re very used to trading digital assets,” said Hayes, pointing to South Korea, where locals are accustomed to trading virtual goods in video games and where the culture is easily transferred to cryptocurrency trading.\nAnd it’s individuals, not institutions, that are driving most of the volume.\n“There’s really not too much institutional presence right now in crypto. It is a retail phenomenon,” Hayes told CNBC.\nBut many are expecting that institutional investors that have been sidelined are on the brink of a shift where they too will enter the space, especially with traditional Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs launching a trading desk and the NYSE also jumping in. When that happens, Hayes said BitMEX is prepared to support them, pointing to the exchange’s API.\nHayes got the Twitter-sphere talking when he claimed in a tweet to show up at Consensus 2018, which is unfolding in midtown Manhattan this week, in one of those famous crypto Lamborghinis –\nDid you see my ride today at #Consensus2018 ? pic.twitter.com/qGznsNMgWo\n— Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) May 14, 2018\nIf Hayes is correct and the bitcoin price attains $50,000 as he predicts, there could be a lot more Lambos on the road in the not-too-distant future.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post Bullish Call: BitMEX Chief Predicts Bitcoin Price to Hit $50,000 in 2018 appeared first on CCN .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.bitmex.com/app/tradingOverview&quot;", "https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/5b904cf69e9d15880388fa1d2c673637", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cv7fgpLqR8R8ySQHBkgjyA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/5b904cf69e9d15880388fa1d2c673637);", "https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/05/14/bitcoin-to-hit-50000-by-year-end-says-ceo-of-largest-bitcoin-exchange.html?play=1", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cv7fgpLqR8R8ySQHBkgjyA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/5b904cf69e9d15880388fa1d2c673637", "https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/5b904cf69e9d15880388fa1d2c673637&quot;", "https://www.ccn.com/bullish-call-bitmex-chief-predicts-50000-btc-by-year-end/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Consensus2018?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rvQGe90CIyv9VSJzIGVdJg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/cd5353de1c3d1a97acf4c2812f1a77e5", "https://www.bitmex.com/app/tradingOverview", "https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes/status/996074905782423552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.ccn.com/bullish-call-bitmex-chief-predicts-50000-btc-by-year-end/&quot;", "https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/05/14/bitcoin-to-hit-50000-by-year-end-says-ceo-of-largest-bitcoin-exchange.html?play=1&quot;", "https://t.co/qGznsNMgWo"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "arthur hayes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hayes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "citigroup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T03:38:31.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "62be78b1caf3cb6296133c07dc6b0c232ca96a99", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6jsyG1oTKZayas3RoV2K2HztFD.SdkrLA3chnYtxO1pBW_SiilaMBL5ChPsaPVNE-", "site_full": "www.johnpatrick.com", "site": "johnpatrick.com", "site_section": "http://www.attitudellc.org/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "johnpatrick.com", "title": "Bitcoin: Is It For Real?", "title_full": "Bitcoin: Is It For Real?", "published": "2018-05-15T22:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://johnpatrick.com/images/clipart.com/2018_sun_surf_page1.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "62be78b1caf3cb6296133c07dc6b0c232ca96a99", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR6jsyG1oTKZayas3RoV2K2HztFD.SdkrLA3chnYtxO1pBW_SiilaMBL5ChPsaPVNE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "John Patrick", "published": "2018-05-15T22:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin: Is It For Real?", "text": "Home › Bitcoin › Bitcoin: Is It For Real?

PUBLISHED: 07:03, Wed, May 16, 2018 | UPDATED: 07:03, Wed, May 16, 2018 0\nThe former Citigroup trader said his price prediction for bitcoin is “$50,000 by the end of the year”.\nWhen asked by CNBC ’s Melissa Lee if he was a “little wobbly about that position” when bitcoin price plunged in January, Mr Hayes responded: “No. It’s my job to make predictions – whether or not they are right or wrong – it doesn’t really matter to me.”\nHe added: “I’m a volatility trader at the end of the day. We make our money if it is volatile. If it goes up, if it goes down, if you have Bill Gates calling it a fraud or whatever it is – great. Short it. I don’t care.\n“Or if you think it is going to be a million dollars in a few months, great, buy it. We just match trades.” Getty•CNBC Bitcoin price: Arthur Hayes predicts bitcoin will reach $50,000 by the end of 2018 I predict $50,000 by the end of the year Arthur Hayes\nThe cryptocurrency expert said Asia “dominates” cryptocurrency market because it is so used to trading digital assets.\nMr Hayes said the US retail presence in crypto should look at adapting Asia’s trading of digital assets in an effort to welcome more investors to the market.\nHe said: “I think Asia dominates crypto because they are very used to trading digital assets.\n“So take South Korea, for example, they have been trading digital goods related to video games for almost two decades. So, when you move to a purely money-based digital currency, they understand that culturally so they get on board quickly.\n“Take that to the West where you have a very established picking system and things work pretty well. Why do you need to go out and find a new way to trade or new way to do things when you have a broker who offers you options, futures, all sorts of different products?\n“So, you move that into the developing market where you don’t have these type of products and you see people who are a lot more interested in it.”\nBitcoin price is at $8,478.92 at 20:20 (GMT) on Tuesday, according to CoinDesk. It hit its highest value before Christmas when the token reached the monumental price of just under $20,000.\nThe digital currency has faced criticism by banks and finance experts, with billionaire Bill Gates telling CNBC he would bet against the cryptocurrency and short bitcoin if he could.

By June 2017, they managed to set up a working implementation of the project on the Bitcoin testnet and invited peer review.\nThe concept was designed by Zcash advisor and developer Andrew Miller. The project contributors also include Giulia Fanti, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University, and other University of Illinois researchers.\nHow does Dandelion Improve Transaction Privacy? Dandelion is best described by the proposal's wiki on Github, which goes on to explain that the system works in two distinct phases, called the \"stem\" and \"fluff\" stages respectively. In essence, it is a routing protocol that overcomes deanonymization techniques that have been demonstrated in the past to uncover the identity of bitcoin users.\n\"During the stem phase, each node relays the transaction to a single peer. After a random number of hops along the stem, the transaction enters the fluff phase, which behaves just like ordinary flooding/diffusion. Even when an attacker can identify the location of the fluff phase, it is much more difficult to identify the source of the stem.\"\nSource: GitHub\nIn simpler words, the 'stem' refers to the data unique to a transaction, whereas 'fluff' is the process through which the sender's IP address is hidden. By preventing nodes from 'listening' and finding out where a transaction originated, user privacy is improved by virtue of reducing the effectiveness adversaries can de-anonymize the network.\nDispelling Concerns When first revealed, some speculated that while the Dandelion Project will bring a much-needed boost to the privacy and security capabilities of bitcoin , its effect may be somewhat short-lived and akin to a band-aid on a larger problem. Well-known Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell alluded to this issue himself in his reply to the mailing list in 2017, stating that malicious actors could still cross-check transaction patterns to identify the origin of the transaction.\nA year after concerns revolving around a deanonymization attack initially cropped up though, it appears as if the project's authors finally have a solution. In another email sent to the bitcoin developer (bitcoin-dev) mailing list, the team suggested a feature to combat the issue, dubbed the \"per-inbound-edge.\" With the measure, transactions would be hopped through different nodes to prevent tracing attempts.\nBitcoin Network Upgrades Any update to the Bitcoin protocol, including the one proposed by the Dandelion Project, needs to be approved by a majority of all nodes on the network. The last major update to the Bitcoin network was the launch of Segregated Witness (SegWit) in late August 2017, codenamed BIP-141.\nThe term BIP is shorthand for a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal . Any new change to the network must be drafted thoroughly in the document for anyone to audit and review. The Dandelion BIP was first submitted to the bitcoin developer mailing list in June 2017 for feedback when it attracted the attention of Greg Maxwell.\nOnce the Dandelion project is ready to be launched, a BIP number will be assigned. Post that, it will be up to nodes on the network, the metaphorical guardians of any cryptocurrency , to accept the change.\nThe post Dandelion Bitcoin Improvement Proposal Submitted in a Bid to Improve Privacy appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "giulia fanti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew miller", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "carnegie mellon university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of illinois", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "github", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T22:44:44.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9c67e70616843d9c8607bf97eb34a87d448a2b01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeWZRmxH1VpJGXBgyPhlFig-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "what is making bitcoin grow faster than other cryptoccurencies ??", "title_full": "what is making bitcoin grow faster than other cryptoccurencies ??", "published": "2018-05-15T22:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.017, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9c67e70616843d9c8607bf97eb34a87d448a2b01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeWZRmxH1VpJGXBgyPhlFig-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "give", "published": "2018-05-15T22:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "what is making bitcoin grow faster than other cryptoccurencies ??", "text": "what is making BTC growing faster than other cryptoccurency??", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T03:57:50.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ef17e37484731133cb5d7dd025d1ecd1fdc157c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY1yfFtVd3J8RwP5np8Qe.C7IWOilLfgbnek2.mDWUyvlPI3KIWexCqB7_xRxhmtOk2kkQCq9dRQZG8WyVACZnM", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Why bitcoin cash is a terrible idea", "title_full": "Why bitcoin cash is a terrible idea : btc", "published": "2018-05-15T22:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1ef17e37484731133cb5d7dd025d1ecd1fdc157c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY1yfFtVd3J8RwP5np8Qe.C7IWOilLfgbnek2.mDWUyvlPI3KIWexCqB7_xRxhmtOk2kkQCq9dRQZG8WyVACZnM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "redditLibertariansuk", "published": "2018-05-15T22:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why bitcoin cash is a terrible idea", "text": "Bitcoin Cash is a terrible idea because it allows the rich to exploit the poor.

Led by China-based mining outfit Bitmain, the round includes support from Accel, Blockchain Capital, Breyer, Digital Currency Group, General Catalyst, IDG, Pantera and Tusk Ventures.\nWith the funding, the company is also revealing an ambitious plan to bolster its products and services by launching a \"US dollar coin,\" or a blockchain native asset that would be both regulated and backed by real government currency, through its affiliate CENTRE project .\nIn this way, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire framed the round as one that helps it position itself as a true conglomerate of cryptocurrency services, as opposed to just an exchange or payment startup, both characterizations having been given to the company in the past.\nAllaire told CoinDesk:\n\"A core part of vision is open-protocols that would enable the free movement of value. A real critical piece is there has to be open, interoperable standards for our how fiat money can move over blockchains. That's where fiat stablecoins and payment protocols come into play.\"\nMore than a technical novelty, Allaire positioned the stablecoin project as essential to Circle's maturation and continued expansion, painting it as integral for its mobile payments application, its over-the-counter (OTC) trading business and its exchange service.\nThe launch also comes at a time when Silicon Valley investors have shown a preference for investments in such products, owing to the massive role stablecoins play in facilitating global cryptocurrency exchange and the perceived issues with today's market leaders.\nIt's this vision, Allaire said, that made Bitmain, the controversial cryptocurrency mining giant, a natural fit to lead the funding round.\nAs recently as March, Bitmain co-CEO Jihan Wu had made appearances at major U.S. conferences where he vowed to back high-tech alternatives to central banking.\n\"Jihan is a visionary and he is a visionary for changing the global financial order,\" Allaire said. \"They believe in the long-term potential of Circle.\"\nAll told, the funding will also help boost staffing at Circle, which today employs more than 200 employees globally in locations including Boston, San Francisco, Dublin, London, Paris, Madrid, Hong Kong, Beijing and Shenzhen. A new twist on stablecoins\nBut while Circle's funding round and valuation are likely to grab a majority of headlines, it's perhaps its launch of a US dollar cryptocurrency initiative with participation from Bitmain that may most impact the crypto market.\nAs noted by Allaire, the play is a strategic one that finds Circle taking aim at one of the most important elements of the crypto economy.\n\"It's a big piece, as we acquired Poloniex and Poloniex was a crypto-only exchange,\" Allaire explained. \"The way people have handled fiat on an exchange like that has been through something like Tether, and we see a lot of weaknesses and challenges with Tether.\"\nIndeed, Allaire isn't alone, as many commentators have sought to position Tether as a systemic weakness that, through its affiliation with the troubled exchange provider Bitfinex, a company that has struggled with regulatory issues, threatens the integrity of the market.\nYet, it's important to note that Circle will be seeking to take an open approach to its USD-C token, framing it as an open-source project with a more robust governance model.\nThe vision is that regulated financial institutions, whether they're a crypto exchange or a money transmitter, would be authorized by CENTRE to become issuers of stablecoins, and that many issuers could offer and manage different fiat-backed cryptocurrencies.\n\"Circle can be an issuer of US dollar coin, Square could be an issuer. If I got US dollar coins from Circle, I could transmit those to another digital wallet for an issuer,\" he explained. A foundation for payments\nBut if all the conversation about exchanges and crypto-plumbing lead to perceptions that Circle is straying from its more consumer-focused products, Allaire was quick to push back.\nRather, Allaire suggested that bolstering the exchange and fiat cryptocurrency ecosystems globally only strengthens products like its original mobile money application, enabling that product to work more effectively at scale in accordance with its original vision.\n\"To realize the vision for ubiquitous payments, we need there to be currencies that can be stored, settled and used,\" Allaire continued.\nWith the funding, the company is also publishing a new white paper on its stablecoin work, as well as an FAQ that will seek to educate others on they can engage in this new market Circle hopes to steward.\nOf note in these materials is that all USD-C tokens will be issued on ethereum, a notable detail given the platform's issues in scaling to support its current diversity of users. (The company said more announcements on the project are expected this summer).\nStill, the overall message was that this is an effort to bring an opaque offshore market back into the regulated cryptocurrency economy, as Allaire said CENTRE will require members to undergo compliance and balance sheet audits to ensure assets are properly backed.\nIn this way, Allaire summed up his message succinctly, dismissing existing market alternatives as nothing more than clever \"regulatory hacks.\"\nHe concluded:\n\"The CENTRE model is out in the open in a regulated context with real banking connectivity and that's really based on an open standard.\"\nCircle image via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

Blog updates about the Bitcoin Cash hard fork remain optimistic that the upgrade will reduce transaction fees, but critics allege that there are potential downsides to quadrupling the block size, as concerns over the security of large block sizes still loom.\nNevertheless, as CCN reported, the block size debate could be over-blown and harks more to ideals about Bitcoin purity. Bitcoin core developers (who favor a more conservative approach) and Bitcoin Cash developers have a long history of disagreements over technical specs.\nThe May 15 Bitcoin Cash hard fork raises the block size to 32 MB Amaury Séchet, lead developer for Bitcoin ABC, has been a strong advocate of larger block sizes also. A February 2017 blog post highlights his belief:\n“People do not want bigger blocks for the sake of bigger blocks, but for the value they bring to users just like people do not want bigger car for the sake of bigger car but because they can transport more people or stuff in it.”\nBitcoin ABC recommends all node operators should update to version 0.17.1. Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin XT have also released updated clients that support the hard fork.\nAdditional OP Codes and Smart Contracts In addition to increasing the data carrier limit for OP_Return to 220 bytes, the fork introduces new smart contract capabilities, often incorrectly believed to be exclusive to Ethereum. Smart contracts allow transactions to occur on a conditional basis, allowing developers to create dynamic payment agreements.\nSatoshi Nakamoto removed smart contract abilities early in the development of the Bitcoin protocol. This Bitcoin Cash hard fork will add back the OP codes that make smart contracts possible.\nThe codes were removed from the Bitcoin protocol in June 2010 largely because they provided an attack surface that developers did not want to spend more time on, as nChain developer Steve Shadders describes in a technical update about the feature. Despite Bitcoin Cash developers’ long-standing enthusiasm, the project is rolling out the OP code features gradually, since there are still security concerns that have not been fully addressed.\nGoing forward, security will be the wildcard that everyone watches closely as Bitcoin Cash hits a historical milestone with today’s fork.\nImages from Shutterstock\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitco", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "utc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T22:35:11.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4e2474a98b3d599862c263758866cf4e409b7243", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZRsQJxaq9uoJar9czLhkGOodz5tSI6d4t6SslVe6GTOlQ5fCWM60XLpMTbfYIjjNV0-", "site_full": "www.merkle.press", "site": "merkle.press", "site_section": "https://www.merkle.press/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Merkle News", "title": "Bing Hops On Anti-Bitcoin Bandwagon, Bans Cryptocurrency Ads", "title_full": "Bing Hops On Anti-Bitcoin Bandwagon, Bans Cryptocurrency Ads", "published": "2018-05-15T22:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4e2474a98b3d599862c263758866cf4e409b7243", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ59LWge_ONhKiPHYXLPKBVmDi5FS0CFZRsQJxaq9uoJar9czLhkGOodz5tSI6d4t6SslVe6GTOlQ5fCWM60XLpMTbfYIjjNV0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Satoshi (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-15T22:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bing Hops On Anti-Bitcoin Bandwagon, Bans Cryptocurrency Ads", "text": "Advertisement Join our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nSearch engine Bing has joined social media giants Google, Twitter, and Facebook in banning cryptocurrency advertising, citing the need to protect users from scams.\nBing made the announcement on its website May 14, saying it’s banning crypto ads because the virtual currency market is unregulated and therefore could enable the exploitation of unwitting consumers by con artists.\n“Because cryptocurrency and related products are not regulated, we have found them to present a possible elevated risk to our users with the potential for bad actors to participate in predatory behaviors, or otherwise scam consumers,” Bing said. “To help protect our users from this risk, we have made the decision to disallow advertising for cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency related products, and unregulated binary options.”\nBing Joins Twitter, Facebook and Google The new policy takes effect in June 2018, with enforcement slated for late-June to early-July.

Though as Fundstrat market strategists have pointed out, much of the gains in the bitcoin price tend to unfold over just a handful of days each year.\nEven at the start of the new year, when the bitcoin price was trading in the doldrums, Hayes wasn’t phased, though he pointed out “it’s [his] job to make predictions” whether or not they come true.\nHayes, a Citigroup alum, explained that he is a volatility trader, and he makes his money on the volatility in the bitcoin price, which there has been no shortage of year-to-date. “If it goes up, if it goes down, if you have Bill Gates calling it a fraud … Short it, I don’t care. If you think it’s going to be $1 million in a few months, great, buy it. I still don’t care. We just match trades,” Hayes said.\nAsia-focused BitMEX is geared toward retail investors but instead of spot trading, it has some of the advanced features that you might expect to see on an institutional trading platform, including derivatives, margin trading and up to 100x leverage (which is more of a “headline number” and not something most traders take advantage of). The exchange supports short trading in perpetual contracts.\nMarket Dynamics Hayes also addressed the cultural differences that affect cryptocurrency market dynamics in the Western world and Asia, the latter of which is where some suggest two-thirds of the market originates from.\n“I think Asia dominates crypto because they’re very used to trading digital assets,” said Hayes, pointing to South Korea, where locals are accustomed to trading virtual goods in video games and where the culture is easily transferred to cryptocurrency trading.\nAnd it’s individuals, not institutions, that are driving most of the volume.\n“There’s really not too much institutional presence right now in crypto. It is a retail phenomenon,” Hayes told CNBC.\nBut many are expecting that institutional investors that have been sidelined are on the brink of a shift where they too will enter the space, especially with traditional Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs launching a trading desk and the NYSE also jumping in. When that happens, Hayes said BitMEX is prepared to support them, pointing to the exchange’s API.\nHayes got the Twitter-sphere talking when he claimed in a tweet to show up at Consensus 2018, which is unfolding in midtown Manhattan this week, in one of those famous crypto Lamborghinis –\nIf Hayes is correct and the bitcoin price attains $50,000 as he predicts, there could be a lot more Lambos on the road in the not-too-distant future.\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "arthur hayes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hayes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "citigroup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T22:35:10.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a970594e16fca0d3ad6f12a27a8c54e06ab62a59", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va73bodwBHSrAyvcu3T36kdQj9Bim.A.RhqtIUjf2nXLngfYqyuoe6cjDVvhc9T2mkABnAf.3RQngr", "site_full": "bitcoin.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Bitcoin Stack Exchange", "title": "Wants to send my bitcoin to another wallet", "title_full": "Wants to send my bitcoin to another wallet", "published": "2018-05-15T22:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/bitcoin/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=462e8b9b382b", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 179, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 9}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a970594e16fca0d3ad6f12a27a8c54e06ab62a59", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va73bodwBHSrAyvcu3T36kdQj9Bim.A.RhqtIUjf2nXLngfYqyuoe6cjDVvhc9T2mkABnAf.3RQngr", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "user78438", "published": "2018-05-15T22:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Wants to send my bitcoin to another wallet", "text": "The address you have is a watch-only address, meaning you can only watch it, but not send it without the private key.

Investors chase digital coins in the hopes of a repeat 1849 California gold rush. Developers scramble to build sound money that acts as both a secure store of value and a worldwide medium of exchange. Miners compete for hash power with the goal of generating profits on every transaction. Governments issue sweeping measures to prevent fraud while simultaneously saving face on their fiat currencies. It's the wild west of a new forex, a bit-sized pay dirt, and a technological marvel holding the potential for life-changing outcomes.\nAs cryptocurrency adoption has become increasingly accepted, one might wonder if there is an opportunity for investment. Surely, there are different avenues to gain exposure, but each approach carries with it varying risk, depending on the method. For example, Bitcoin Core ( BTC-USD ) ( COIN ) is the original coin that was born out of Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper . Then, there's Grayscale's Bitcoin Investment Trust ( OTCQX:GBTC ) that has returned 482% in the past twelve months. Or, one could invest in Ethereum and its smart contract approach. Litecoin represents another cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin, but it is worth noting founder Charlie Lee liquidated his entire stake last December. Each has opportunity, but with so much information available, the problem becomes choice. Which one is best? Which one will last? Which one is real?\nFinally, we come to Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ). Spawned from the Bitcoin hard fork on August 1st, 2017. Although the crypto has been embattled since its inception, there are technological, scientific, and monetary reasons to believe an investment in Bitcoin Cash is warranted. The May \"hard fork\" upgrade (as well as other planned forks down the road) will increase the block size to 32MB, allowing another step toward competition with global pay merchants like Visa ( V ) and MasterCard ( MA ). The addition of \" Colored Coins \" into the Bitcoin Cash protocol will help it compete with the Ethereum blockchain project that uses smart contracts. Lastly, Bitcoin Cash more closely represents the founding concept of a \"peer-to-peer electronic cash system\" than the original Bitcoin Core. Put it all together, and Bitcoin Cash represents the best opportunity for obtaining direct cryptocurrency exposure and achieving investment returns while participating in the advancement of a new asset class.\nBrief Background Even though the hard fork in Bitcoin that occurred on August 1st, 2017, went smoothly, the battle between the two cryptos is hardly over. Samson Mow, Chief Strategy Officer at Blockstream, once described the creation of Bitcoin Cash as an \"orchestrated scheme, rushed to the point of engendering significant safety risks\". At the time, Mow inferred that BCH's value would drop below $100. However, it currently trades over $1,000. Before the fork, BCH developer Amaury Sechet described a possibility that BCH could overtake BTC. But he was also quoted as saying that anyone who thinks they know where both coins will go in the future is downright foolish:\n\"What if I'm wrong?\" That's a question I'm asking myself all the time. In fact, this is the very reason I think it is misguided to bake economic constants, such as the 1 megabyte limit or the weight system, into the protocol. Not only do I know I may be wrong, but I'm also convinced that most people don't know any better than I do. Figuring out what the market wants is a fool's errand. You got to try to do what you think is best and adapt as the situation changes.\nI think it is pretty much inevitable that [Bitcoin Cash] starts as a minority coin. But longer term, it will either overtake Bitcoin or it will create an incentive for Bitcoin to scale. In either case, that'd be a win.\nAs an allegorical aside, I often wonder what it was like to live in California during the gold rush circa 1848. And then, I think about how some people probably risked all they owned to find a few nuggets and get rich, while others conceivably lost everything digging up fool's gold. So here we are, over 150 years later, and history is repeating itself, only with a lot more choices, incredible amounts of information, and more likely than not \"most people don't know any better than I do\". That said, I'll do my best to highlight some key differences among Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin in order to achieve a base understanding of each crypto.\nBitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash have a limited amount of coins that will ever be in existence (~21 million coins for each of them). Proponents of each coin believe their respective currency can serve as both a store of value (like gold) and a medium of exchange for goods and services (like cash). Bitcoin Core has a block size limit of 1MB, while Bitcoin Cash will increase the block size limit to 32MB this month. Similarly, developers of Bitcoin Core have a vision of 2-layer sound money, like the gold standard. Imagine it's the year 1970, before President Nixon changed the dollar/gold relationship to $38/ounce and prevented the Federal Reserve from redeeming dollars with gold. The U.S. dollar being pegged to the illustrious metal means anything you buy is attached to a piece of Fort Knox gold. Every transaction is trusted, backed by the U.S. government and bolstered by gold reserves. Fast-forward to the present day and, in crypto terms, the Lightning Network serves as the dollar while the Bitcoin Core network represents the gold. You can buy a coffee on the Lightning Network, and every transaction will be backed by Bitcoins. On the other hand, proponents of Bitcoin Cash want the crypto to be exchanged millions of times each day, regardless of what you're buying or selling. Some will hold it as an investment, and others will buy coffee - like gold being freely traded across borders (no U.S. dollar, British pound, Chinese Yuan, or Japanese Yen necessary).\nFor the time being, I'll add that Litecoin is similar to Bitcoin Core & Bitcoin Cash, as it is a finite cryptocurrency (Ethereum has an infinite supply) that will have four times as many coins as Bitcoin (except with a slightly different proof of work). Many consider Litecoin as the silver to Bitcoin's digital gold.\nMoving on, if Bitcoin is digital gold, then Ethereum must be digital oil. The protocol includes computer-programming language that can enable \"smart contracts\" that only execute through given instructions. A simple example might be paying rent. Suppose that you rent an apartment for $500 a month, yet both you and your landlord have Ethereum wallets. Well, instead of writing a check you write a small program that continually pays your rent on the last day of every month. Here's what a small If-then program loop might look like:\nIf I have $500 in my ETH wallet on the last day of the month\nthen transfer $500 in ETH to my landlord.\nElse If I don't have $500 in ETH, send me an alert\nIt's not unlike setting up automatic payments from your bank account to your landlord, except in the case of Ethereum, no middleman (the bank) is required. It is a simple example yet serves its demonstrative purpose - trusted monetary transfer for all, no bank required (in fact, JPMorgan ( JPM ) recently stated in the \"risks\" section of their annual report that \"both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payment processing and other services could be disrupted by technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, that require no intermediation\"). A Blockgeeks article entitled \"Smart Contracts: The Blockchain Technology that will Replace Lawyers\" provides more detailed examples for those who want to learn more. Despite the novel idea, there are some issues with the Ethereum smart-contract protocol. In our rudimentary example, both you and the landlord must have the same crypto-tokens. Second, those tokens must have some ascribed value to them (i.e., ETH is currently trading at about $700). Third, anyone on the Ethereum blockchain can create his or her own token. This adds a layer of complexity to Ethereum making it useful but possibly harder to understand. For example, we could envision the landlord accepting only \"Rentcoins\" instead of ETH. While certainly a technological innovation on money, it is also likely the cause of so many risky - almost downright dangerous - Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) that duped some investors into donating ETH hoping to find the next big thing (investors lost $350 million in the OneCoin offering ). Similarly, the boom-and-bust ICO culture quickly drew attention from governments worldwide as regulators continue to crack down on crypto in an effort to protect users and investors alike.\nBitcoin Cash Investment Point - Block Size Now that the truncated background is established, it is time to move on to points that might set Bitcoin Cash apart from other cryptocurrencies as a productive investment. The first and most obvious factor that differentiates Bitcoin Cash is the block size. Towards the end of 2017, at the height of Bitcoin prices, the Bitcoin Core network experienced a massive increase in fees, costing users amounts in upwards of $40 per transaction (it's not exactly practical to pay $2 for a coffee and $40 in fees). But in perhaps counterintuitive fashion, the fees were not altogether correlated with price. The block size was also a factor, as scores of transactions effectively clogged the network. Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, experienced spikes greater than Bitcoin Core's 1 MB block limit, and despite fluctuations in block size and price, the fees have remained minimal over the past 6 months. That said, even though Bitcoin Core prices appreciated (and so did fees), it appears that the block size was responsible for congesting the system with inexorable costs. To demonstrate, below are three six-month charts of BTC and BCH, showing average transaction fee (in USD), block size (in MB), and price (in USD).\nChart 1 - BTC, BCH Transaction Fees (USD)\nChart 2 - BTC, BCH Block Size (in megabytes)\nChart 3 - BTC, BCH price (in USD)\n(Source: Bitinfo Charts )\nOnce again, notice the stark differences in block size between the two cryptos. On first glance, there doesn't seem to be definitive relationships among the transaction fees, block size, and price of Bitcoin Core, but we can infer that a block size greater than 1 MB does not adversely affect Bitcoin Cash fees. This was the primary intention involved with the Bitcoin hard fork. Similarly, one would think that if transaction fees increased, so would mining profitability. However, the chart below shows that mining profitability between the two currencies remained in relative unison over the past six months at a few dollars per day per hash rate:\nChart 4 - Mining Profitability (USD/Day, for 1 THash/sec)\nBringing it all back to block size and transaction fees, Bitcoin Cash developers plan to increase the block size limit to 32 MB this month and are scheduled to upgrade the protocol again six months down the road. Why increase the block size in the first place? Well, at size 1 MB, the Bitcoin Core network handles about 7 transactions per second. At size 32 MB, the Bitcoin Cash network can handle 224 transactions per second. Comparatively, Visa's network can handle 24,000 transactions per second. Some elementary math reveals that, given full scale adoption across the globe, a cryptocurrency network would have two options: achieve a block size limit of over 3.4 GB (Bitcoin Cash's future protocol) or find some other way to transact (Bitcoin Core's future Lightning Network).\nBitcoin Cash Investment Point - On-chain technological upgrades Interestingly, in a comprehensive blockchain study performed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology at the U.S. Department of Commerce, entitled \"Blockchain Technology Overview\", researchers commented that, after the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, BCH more closely resembled the original bitcoin peer-to-peer electronic currency initiative. The report drew praise from BCH supporters and criticism from BTC proponents, driving a wedge even further between the two factions. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning what U.S. scientists published regarding Bitcoin Cash:\nIn July 2017, approximately 80 to 90 percent of the Bitcoin computing power voted to incorporate Segregated Witness (SegWit, where transactions are split into two segments: transactional data, and signature data), which made it possible to reduce the amount of data being verified in each block. Signature data can account for up to 65 percent of a transaction block, so a change in how signatures are implemented could be useful. When SegWit was activated, it caused a hard fork, and all the mining nodes and users who did not want to change started calling the original Bitcoin blockchain Bitcoin Cash (BCC). Technically, Bitcoin is a hard fork and Bitcoin Cash is the original blockchain. When the hard fork occurred, people had access to the same amount of coins on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. (Blockchain Technology Overview pp. 41 )\nWhile probably only aesthetic in nature, the statements add credence to the viability of Bitcoin Cash as a peer-to-peer electronic currency. Furthermore, Bitcoin Cash developers are seeking to improve the protocol at a fundamental level by including smart contract capability. Some of the scripting features present in the original Bitcoin programming language were disabled several years ago, but are now being considered for reactivation in the most recent protocol upgrade. Now, Bitcoin Cash users & developers should be able to create a layer of smart contracts that can be executed on the blockchain, effectively putting Bitcoin Cash on a path to compete with Ethereum (recall our paying the landlord example). Stated another way, Bitcoin Cash scripting will now be enabled, and users will be able to write programs to execute on the protocol. Proponents of the additional scripting layer have also hinted at the idea of using \"colored coins\" - a way to develop your own Bitcoin Cash colored coin - similar to creating a token using the ETH protocol, except that you are still using a Bitcoin Cash coin. So, instead of our landlord demanding \"Rentcoins\" with no tangible ascribed value, he'll request payment via a BHC colored coin that can be summarily converted back to BCH.\nWe're getting a little deep into the complexity of crypto protocols, so circling back to the potential upside of an investment, it is sufficient to say that Bitcoin Cash will continue its on-chain scaling (note that the May upgrade is actually not a hard fork, and end users will not get additional coins like they did when Bitcoin Cash was first created), and its developers are working toward scaling the currency to a level of global acceptance.\nRisks: Not A Conclusion, But A Continuation Investors know by now that delving into the crypto space is fraught with potential dangers. All of the currencies discussed here are highly volatile. The discussion here has also revolved less around price and more on technological catalysts. Granted, cryptocurrency is a new asset class, but that also means that the coins could be misunderstood, rejected by the general public, destroyed by adoption failure, or all of the above. A collapse in the network would lead to catastrophic losses. One of the goals here was to present Bitcoin Cash as a viable crypto investment, yet from an investment perspective, there are also multiple avenues for participation.\nAlthough, on a personal level, I only own Bitcoin Cash, as a matter of risk management, one might consider two ways to mitigate downside when incorporating cryptocurrency into an investment portfolio: sizing and diversification. On the one hand, putting 1-2% of the portfolio into cryptocurrencies allows for taking part in a new wave of technology that has the potential to scale on a global level, while at the same time limiting the maximum loss. On the other hand, taking a full position in a \"best of breed\" cryptocurrency can lead to outsized return on investment. But rather than putting all the crypto nuts in one basket, being wrong and losing everything, one could own multiple currencies and diversify, and still achieve investment success even as other currencies crumble.\nWhile Bitcoin Cash represents an interesting investment and carries with it the potential for generating outperforming returns, the crypto asset class as a whole is both complex and in its fledgling state; now is perhaps the riskiest time of all to invest. However, it is only the beginning in terms of research and technological innovation, and whatever comes next will make for a monumental investment venture, regardless of the outcome.\nDisclosure: I am/we are long BCH-USD.\nI wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

The appetite for bitcoin and other digital currencies has grown exponentially in recent years as they’ve gained legitimacy across the world.\nAnd while digital currency is still not widely used or understood by many average consumers, Chicago’s two main exchanges, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, became the first traditional exchanges to trade the financial products late last year, lending credibility to bitcoin and its lesser-known digital brethren. Coinbase is already one of the largest digital currency exchanges around the world.\nCoinbase’s Chicago office will serve as a central hub for some back-office technology behind the company’s products, said Paul Bauerschmidt, a former CME executive, who is leading the Chicago office. “It’s similar to an exchange that you’d see with ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) or CME or CBOE,” he said.\nRecruiting people who are able to build and maintain these complicated systems, especially with financial experience, is difficult in other cities, Bauerschmidt said. “The talent that’s here in Chicago, you can’t find anywhere else,” he said.\n“And especially getting as many of the key staff as we need. It’s really exciting to be able to build it here.” The Chicago office also will focus on courting institutional investors, which manage assets on others’ behalf, like banks, hedge funds, mutual funds or pension funds, Bauerschmidt said.

From Bitcoin's inception in 2009 through mid-2017, its price remained under $4,000. In the second half of 2017, it climbed dramatically to nearly $20,000, but descended rapidly starting in mid-December. The peak price coincided with the introduction of bitcoin futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence. Rather, it is consistent with trading behavior that typically accompanies the introduction of futures markets for an asset. This is from Galina Hale, Arvind Krishnamurthy, Marianna Kudlyak, and Patrick Shultz, \" How Futures Trading Changed Bitcoin Prices ,\" FRBSF Economic Letter , May 7, 2018.\nAnd: The peak bitcoin price coincided with the day bitcoin futures started trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). In this Economic Letter , we argue that these price dynamics are consistent with the rise and collapse of the home financing market in the 2000s, as explained in Fostel and Geanakoplos (2012). They suggested that the mortgage boom was driven by financial innovations in securitization and groupings of bonds that attracted optimistic investors; the subsequent bust was driven by the creation of instruments that allowed pessimistic investors to bet against the housing market. Similarly, the advent of blockchain introduced a new financial instrument, bitcoin, which optimistic investors bid up, until the launch of bitcoin futures allowed pessimists to enter the market, which contributed to the reversal of the bitcoin price dynamics.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2018/may/how-futures-trading-changed-bitcoin-prices/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david henderson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "marianna kudlyak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arvind krishnamurthy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick shultz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "galina hale", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "chicago mercantile exchange", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T21:01:56.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b49bebb635be592745d4a8fc947374143e7b5760", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWAkegs2rOArl4j6Ro4WRcQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=240.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Tokens (Altcoins)", "title": "🔥🚀🚀[ANN][Pre-ICO] Bitcoin Crown - Cryptocurrency for online game lovers🔥🚀🚀", "title_full": "🔥🚀🚀[ANN][Pre-ICO] Bitcoin Crown - Cryptocurrency for online game lovers🔥🚀🚀", "published": "2018-05-15T21:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.023, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b49bebb635be592745d4a8fc947374143e7b5760", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWAkegs2rOArl4j6Ro4WRcQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mondy922801", "published": "2018-05-15T21:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "🔥🚀🚀[ANN][Pre-ICO] Bitcoin Crown - Cryptocurrency for online game lovers🔥🚀🚀", "text": "hope the project will be successHope this project have signature campaign Happy to take part and trying to spread the word as much as I can.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T21:46:04.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "89f265ab5bbdc4761698ecf2069e6e2ee5c2cee9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSFIg88syIzq6XlfF.w4oGcYWHStBr2wOhFrEbVrrZzO__CWBi2f.K5GhAvKbtfAzPsS7OtN1xqPK01vbT8five9J0Px2HrPkvtcuX_neS9Xjets4.B7tLky0uW2KO4V6GbkaD7uDlugA--", "site_full": "manscorner.com", "site": "manscorner.com", "site_section": "https://manscorner.com/feed/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The Man's Corner", "title": "Samourai Wallet Creates App for Transactions Over Mesh Networks – Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Samourai Wallet Creates App for Transactions Over Mesh Networks – Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-15T21:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "89f265ab5bbdc4761698ecf2069e6e2ee5c2cee9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSFIg88syIzq6XlfF.w4oGcYWHStBr2wOhFrEbVrrZzO__CWBi2f.K5GhAvKbtfAzPsS7OtN1xqPK01vbT8five9J0Px2HrPkvtcuX_neS9Xjets4.B7tLky0uW2KO4V6GbkaD7uDlugA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MidKnightt", "published": "2018-05-15T21:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Samourai Wallet Creates App for Transactions Over Mesh Networks – Bitcoin News", "text": "by MidKnightt The Txtenna app is meant to enable a more resilient, censorship-resistant and decentralized network for bitcoin transactions based on mesh communications.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "samourai", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T22:08:39.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "15b2c0fdce4b0676f7bc68cbe93b7995467af5f0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8xUoK8VfudwrXN0pjYFVEJlO.qBq.m5VSgC1ryRR1WRdbxeXlPPrUSObg4u60cuMz9dFuwZcV1cZ2RVxRCxNaqEX5bnsr_3zRhM.6fzxaY1F1PSpPsEotz", "site_full": "www.casino-crush.com", "site": "casino-crush.com", "site_section": "http://www.casino-crush.com/bb2/new-existing-depositor-casino-bonuses-and-promos-vf37.html", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "New &amp;

Further, the 50-day MA also acted as strong support on Monday. Meanwhile, on both occasions, the rebound from the 50-day MA ran out of steam around the 100-day MA hurdle.\nThe rangebound action seen in the last three days has established the 50-day MA as a major support and the 100-day MA as a formidable resistance and the breakout of this zone will likely set the tone for the next big move in BTC.\nDaily chart On Monday, BTC created a doji Â â a candlestick pattern, which indicates indecision in the marketplace. However, when viewed against the backdrop of the sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990, the doji signals indecision among the bears (or bearish exhaustion).Â So, the immediate bearish outlook has been neutralized.\nBitcoin Faces Drop to $7K as Bull Defense Crumbles\nA close today (as per UTC) above the 100-day MA of $8,837 would signal bullish doji reversal and upside break of the trading range. Meanwhile, a close below the 50-day MA of $8,287 would confirm downside break of the trading range and bearish doji continuation pattern, i.e. sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 has resumed.\nThat said, the odds of the bullish breakout (or bull doji reversal) still appear low, as the bulls face an uphill task as seen in the chart below.\n4-hour chart On the above chart, the falling trendline resistance is seen around $8,810 and is immediately followed by hurdle at $8,910 (expanding channel resistance).\nWith major moving averages (50, 100 and 200) trending south (bearish), BTC bulls will likely struggle to cut through resistance at $8,900 in a convincing manner.\nNote, the bears are about to score another brownie point by pushing the 50-candle MA below the 200-candle MA (bearish crossover).\nThe 5-day MA and the 10-day MA (seen in the daily chart) are also biased bearish.\nView Another rejection at the descending trendline seen in the 4-hour chart will likely yield a drop to 50-day MA located at $8,287.\nThat said, only a daily close (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA would signal a revival of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 and would allow a deeper drop to $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to the May 5 high) or even as low as $7,698 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July 2015 low to the December 2017 high).\nOn the other hand, a convincing move above $8,910 (expanding channel hurdle) would expose resistance lined up at $9,390.\nChalk arrows image via Tech

Further, the 50-day MA also acted as strong support on Monday. Meanwhile, on both occasions, the rebound from the 50-day MA ran out of steam around the 100-day MA hurdle.\nThe rangebound action seen in the last three days has established the 50-day MA as a major support and the 100-day MA as a formidable resistance and the breakout of this zone will likely set the tone for the next big move in BTC.\nDaily chart On Monday, BTC created a doji Â - a candlestick pattern, which indicates indecision in the marketplace. However, when viewed against the backdrop of the sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990, the doji signals indecision among the bears (or bearish exhaustion).Â So, the immediate bearish outlook has been neutralized.\nFirst Bitcoin Smart Contracts Sidechain Now Secured By 1 in 10 Miners\nA close today (as per UTC) above the 100-day MA of $8,837 would signal bullish doji reversal and upside break of the trading range. Meanwhile, a close below the 50-day MA of $8,287 would confirm downside break of the trading range and bearish doji continuation pattern, i.e. sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 has resumed.\nThat said, the odds of the bullish breakout (or bull doji reversal) still appear low, as the bulls face an uphill task as seen in the chart below.\n4-hour chart On the above chart, the falling trendline resistance is seen around $8,810 and is immediately followed by hurdle at $8,910 (expanding channel resistance).\nWith major moving averages (50, 100 and 200) trending south (bearish), BTC bulls will likely struggle to cut through resistance at $8,900 in a convincing manner.\nNote, the bears are about to score another brownie point by pushing the 50-candle MA below the 200-candle MA (bearish crossover).\nThe 5-day MA and the 10-day MA (seen in the daily chart) are also biased bearish.\nView Another rejection at the descending trendline seen in the 4-hour chart will likely yield a drop to 50-day MA located at $8,287.\nThat said, only a daily close (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA would signal a revival of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 and would allow a deeper drop to $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to the May 5 high) or even as low as $7,698 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July 2015 low to the December 2017 high).\nOn the other hand, a convincing move above $8,910 (expanding channel hurdle) would expose resistance lined up at $9,390.\nChalk arrows Most Big Cryptos Dropped this Week - These Two Bucked the Trend Maximalist for Hire: Bitcoin Believer Pierre Rochard Starts Advisory Firm", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/h4VSosk6YtxSbWRnvFZQ7Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/coindesk_75/391be5628ac5a8fa0e150328056c3680);", "https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-risks-drop-toward-8k-after-3-week-low/", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RqFIgC1fFq6IMvaBg2CnQg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/coindesk_75/0fe91a8adc296ae38a708ff22d08eb97", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/gk0YAafiQMB3SrOhWKjWvg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/coindesk_75/5edb31ffca9a562556b1ae6b94c6bcd9);", "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doji.asp", "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doji.asp&quot;", "https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-risks-drop-toward-8k-after-3-week-low/&quot;", "https://www.coindesk.com/maximalist-for-hire-bitcoin-believer-pierre-rochard-starts-advisory-firm/", "https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/hand-drawing-green-red-chalk-down-731185384?src=fiGVPImLJL1r-hLFPyzTow-1-10&quot;", "https://www.coindesk.com/first-bitcoin-smart-contracts-sidechain-now-secured-1-10-miners/", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/gk0YAafiQMB3SrOhWKjWvg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/coindesk_75/5edb31ffca9a562556b1ae6b94c6bcd9", "https://www.coindesk.com/first-bitcoin-smart-contracts-sidechain-now-secured-1-10-miners/&quot;", "https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/hand-drawing-green-red-chalk-down-731185384?src=fiGVPImLJL1r-hLFPyzTow-1-10", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RqFIgC1fFq6IMvaBg2CnQg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/coindesk_75/0fe91a8adc296ae38a708ff22d08eb97);", "https://www.coindesk.com/most-big-cryptos-dropped-this-week-these-two-bucked-the-trend/", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/h4VSosk6YtxSbWRnvFZQ7Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/coindesk_75/391be5628ac5a8fa0e150328056c3680"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T17:44:37.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a297a5a20f5bb93bfe69ace7e322e0365b220804", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY1yfFtVd3J8YR_ECihLgYEMbJh3HY_vwJ4_ikv3sR9cxcmQ2Toy4TLAu.RwNLmQnSxHhCe18weLj1uvhiO.mDf.AaicJSkM_I-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "If Bitcoin (BTC) went to larger blocks, what would BCH holders do?", "title_full": "If Bitcoin (BTC) went to larger blocks, what would BCH holders do?

Here's how to incorporate it.\nThe basis for all business is supply and demand, but recent events have shown that supply can be more fragile than we might expect. For example, KFC's chicken shortages in the U.K. forced two-thirds of its 900 restaurants to close while the company worked to repair its delivery, via DHL. (And this was then followed by a gravy shortage.)\nUltimately, it turned out that those U.K. events were because of human error, not any lack of chicken. And that revelation only reinforced how critical excellent record-keeping and accountability are for maintaining supply chain integrity. But help is on the way: Fortunately, the supply world will soon be revolutionized by the innovative solution of blockchain .\nThe most promising approach to robust supply-chain data is likely blockchain technology, a relatively new approach to digital record-keeping most famously associated with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin but applicable to many domains.\nSharing is the secret to blockchain's robustness against tampering: Because everyone has a record of the information, there is no way any one person can alter data in the chain. The technology's distributed nature also means there is no central authority, so no one group controls that data. Data Readiness Levels: Turning Data from Palid to Vivid\nThese attractive features, of database security and distributed storage, are what's motivating the incorporation of blockchain into business operations. They're also the reasons blockchain will come to have the ring of trustworthiness in consumers' perceptions. That trust is critical to competing in today's marketplace.\nCompanies that lead in adopting blockchain will enjoy building that trust early in the process of its global adoption. So, are you in? Following are a few simple steps to move your company toward incorporating blockchain into your own operations:\nNew technologies tend to stir up excitement, but that can also create a bandwagon effect in which companies wind up wasting resources on new tech just because they can.\nI'm seeing this pattern with blockchain, and it reminds me -- and others -- of the dotcom era. That thinking goes something like this: \"We're going to store data about transactions in the blockchain. Why? Because that's what's cool.\"\nBut that's never a good business reason. Instead, commit to adopting blockchain only if you need to ensure trust in your transactions through a verifiable and incorruptible system. Trust is ultimately about proof. Ask yourself, what exactly do you need to prove, and to whom do you need to prove it? The Digital Power Values for The New C-Suite: The Modern Mindset of the CEO, CIO, CMO, CDO, CCO\nFor example, if you have a massively long list of transactions that relate to your supply chain, is verifying every entry on that list important to your business? Or are you actually trying to prove just a fraction of that? To know exactly where you'll need provable data, do some thinking about supply chain issues and what blockchain can do for them.\nFortunately, there is no shortage of great resources to develop your understanding of blockchain.

Bigger Blocks\nInitially announced November 2017, the upgrade began at 12:00:00 UTC when the hard fork was initialized.\nAs CCN reported back in April, the fork includes the addition of OP codes, which allow smart contract capabilities.\nHowever, the whopping increase in block size has drawn the most attention. Blog updates about the Bitcoin Cash hard fork remain optimistic that the upgrade will reduce transaction fees, but critics allege that there are potential downsides to quadrupling the block size, as concerns over the security of large block sizes still loom.\nNevertheless, as CCN reported , the block size debate could be over-blown and harks more to ideals about Bitcoin purity. Bitcoin core developers (who favor a more conservative approach) and Bitcoin Cash developers have a long history of disagreements over technical specs. The May 15 Bitcoin Cash hard fork raises the block size to 32 MB\nAmaury Séchet, lead developer for Bitcoin ABC, has been a strong advocate of larger block sizes also. A February 2017 blog post highlights his belief:\n“People do not want bigger blocks for the sake of bigger blocks, but for the value they bring to users just like people do not want bigger car for the sake of bigger car but because they can transport more people or stuff in it.”\nBitcoin ABC recommends all node operators should update to version 0.17.1. Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin XT have also released updated clients that support the hard fork. Additional OP Codes and Smart Contracts\nIn addition to increasing the data carrier limit for OP_Return to 220 bytes, the fork introduces new smart contract capabilities, often incorrectly believed to be exclusive to Ethereum. Smart contracts allow transactions to occur on a conditional basis, allowing developers to create dynamic payment agreements.\nSatoshi Nakamoto removed smart contract abilities early in the development of the Bitcoin protocol. This Bitcoin Cash hard fork will add back the OP codes that make smart contracts possible.\nThe codes were removed from the Bitcoin protocol in June 2010 largely because they provided an attack surface that developers did not want to spend more time on, as nChain developer Steve Shadders describes in a technical update about the feature. Despite Bitcoin Cash developers’ long-standing enthusiasm, the project is rolling out the OP code features gradually, since there are still security concerns that have not been fully addressed.\nGoing forward, security will be the wildcard that everyone watches closely as Bitcoin Cash hits a historical milestone with today’s fork.\nImages from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.deadalnix.me/", "https://www.bitcoinabc.org/2018-04-01-upgrade/", "https://www.yours.org/content/use-cases-for-re-enabled-op-codes-8b150b6a0deb"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "utc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T22:28:08.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "152204a163f8b07fcec1c230e24bd51e60386499", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRBfb_j7fCeiZn1UMTcDVgdLSJyyc3wHaiGhPpnJQRi4EnSUw9jKTtcyzPCynrlNeXq_ovJOQjey8cj.ldW6O7Z8_gwWEg8rm4QgMgTABx2IQ--", "site_full": "mrtopstep.com", "site": "mrtopstep.com", "site_section": "http://mrtopstep.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance", "financial_news"], "section_title": "MrTopStep.com", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Upgrade Milestone Complete: 32MB and New Features", "title_full": "Bitcoin Cash Upgrade Milestone Complete: 32MB and New Features", "published": "2018-05-15T21:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "152204a163f8b07fcec1c230e24bd51e60386499", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRBfb_j7fCeiZn1UMTcDVgdLSJyyc3wHaiGhPpnJQRi4EnSUw9jKTtcyzPCynrlNeXq_ovJOQjey8cj.ldW6O7Z8_gwWEg8rm4QgMgTABx2IQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Contributor", "published": "2018-05-15T21:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Cash Upgrade Milestone Complete: 32MB and New Features", "text": "Contributor Forex , stream\nThe Bitcoin Cash network has officially upgraded the blockchain protocol at approximately 1:54 EDT by extending the current block size fourfold from 8MB to 32MB. The consensus change is one of the largest block size increases in blockchain history, and the upgrade also adds the great knowledge of understanding Satoshi’s OP_Codes – which could add the ability to code colored coins and binary contracts.\nAlso Read: Steve Eisman of ‘The Big Short’ Fame: What Value Does Cryptocurrency Actually Add? The Bitcoin Cash Network Has Successfully Upgraded its Block Size to 32MB\nThe wait is over as the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network has upgraded its base block size from 8MB to 32MB. The implementation of the new consensus rules went into effect at block height 530356, and so far the transition has been smooth as the community awaits the next concession of blocks. Miners and other full BCH nodes had already upgraded their clients to the latest Bitcoin ABC 0.17.1 and other supported implementations like Bitcoin Unlimited, and XT over the past few week as the community prepared for the change. Among some minor updates, three notable changes have been enforced throughout the network which includes a 32MB block size, an increased default data-carrier-size to 220 bytes, and re-enabling previously disabled Satoshi OP_Codes. The Bitcoin Cash block size is increasing from 8MB to 32MB. The increase should allow for massive amounts of transaction throughput for years to come.\nThe first and biggest change to the Bitcoin Cash consensus rules is obviously the fourfold block size increase. Raising the block size to 32MB will allow vast amounts of transactions to pass through the network with consistent inexpensive transaction fees. Right now the amount of BCH transactions per day has been steadily increasing , and because the base block size has increased by four times its original size, blocks will not fill up for a very long time. The capability of this mechanism has been proven multiple times as there have been many BCH blocks between 2-8MB processed over the course of the past nine months. For instance, just sixteen days after the fork on August 1 the mining pool Viabtc processed an 8MB BCH block which cleared over 37,000 transactions in one fell swoop. Upgrading the Default Data-Carrier-Size to 220 Bytes\nAnother notable Bitcoin Cash network change is the blockchain’s default data-carrier-size being raised from 80-bytes to 220-bytes. This enables a robust OP_Return feature which is a relatively inexpensive way to embed data into the BCH chain. Essentially the OP_Return is a script code that is used to mark transactions as invalid but many cryptocurrency enthusiasts believe the OP_Return feature is meant to record a rich set of data and not just financial transactions. However, back in 2014, BTC developers believed “storing arbitrary data in the blockchain is a bad idea” and recommended users store “non-currency data elsewhere.” OP_Return has been in the Bitcoin codebase since it was launched, and in February 2014 the 80-byte OP_Return was reduced to 40-bytes , but it was later increased merged back to 80 bytes in 2015. Basically, the developers at the time considered this type of blockchain usage as spam and would end up bloating the network. Photo source: Massimo Bartoletti and Livio Pompianu’s An Analysis of Bitcoin OP_Return Metadata\nHowever, even as developers warned that the use of OP_Return was a ‘bad idea,’ individuals and organizations continued to use it to embed arbitrary data. Two organizations, specifically Omni layer, and Counterparty, showed that using OP_Return for arbitrary data could be innovative towards building meta-protocols over a secure blockchain — although when blocks are full and the network is congested these types of layer systems find the blockchain’s network fees unsustainable. The BCH chain upgrading to 32MB and increasing the default data-carrier-size to 220 bytes will allow all kinds of innovations, like added creativity in applications such as Memo, Counterparty Cash, Blockpress, and many other platforms. This Upgrade Will Help the Cryptocurrency Community Learn to Understand the Original Satoshi OP_Codes Programming languages like Bitcoin’s Script and Forth are considered the ‘hackers programming languages.’\nLast but not least is the re-enabling of disabled Satoshi OP_Codes — which are essentially codes that perform specific operations using an internal stack language called Script . Many people consider Script to be extremely similar to the programming language Forth — another stack-based language and software environment. In the original Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin client, the creator added OP_Codes to the software which can perform operations like simple math and string handling processes. Most of the original OP_Codes were disabled in earlier clients and many people believe this language could bring new functionalities to the Bitcoin Cash network.\nThe OP_Codes implemented on the BCH network will improve our understanding of these codes Satoshi originally added. If all goes well with gaining knowledge from these codes then developers can enhance binary operations and contracts using the OP_Datasigverify code, and possibly OP_Group in the future. Further BCH proponents believe all of the OP_Codes will bring forth many innovative features such as multi-signature operations, colored coins or representative tokens, smart contract compilers, and 0-confirmation sending techniques. A list of OP_Codes Satoshi Nakamoto created long ago. Each has its own operation or function. Not the Last Upgrade\nToday’s upgrade is the first step towards many of these innovations and visions BCH proponents have been talking about for months. And there’s a bunch of other developments being discussed, such as double spend notifications — which notify nodes when a double spend takes place and a new Proof-of-Work (PoW) target called Bobtail . Additionally, programmers are looking into the Graphene protocol and other concepts that could add a rich feature set to the BCH chain. Today’s 32MB upgrade was a successful fork for the BCH community, and very likely there will be many more other upgrades in the future.\nWhat do you think about the Bitcoin Cash upgrade?

Escape will cancel and close the window.\nBitcoin has already hit its lowest price of the year, according to one analyst Bitcoin has recovered from its recent price slump, mirroring an annual trend that sees the cryptocurrency surge in value following a major conference in May. The price of bitcoin has risen by 5 per cent in the 24 hours since the Consensus conference kicked off in New York, as the fourth annual blockchain technology summit once again provided a boost to the volatile cryptocurrency.\nAnalysts predicted the price rally earlier this week, after bitcoin had fallen to a three-week low. “We expect the Consensus rally to be even larger than past years,” Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said in a note to clients ahead of the conference.\nBitcoin has already hit its lowest price point of the year, according to Mr Lee, having fallen to around $6,500 in early February. “In general, we see 2018 being a strong year, but we see the larger and more established blockchains growing in dominance in 2018,” the research note said, highlighting ethereum as one of the other cryptocurrencies set to benefit.\n“Bottom line: We expect bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to behave similarly to prior years and rally during Consensus.” The turn-around in fortunes has been reflected across cryptocurrency markets, with ethereum, bitcoin cash and ripple all seeing significant gains since early April.

The consensus change is one of the largest block size increases in blockchain history, and the upgrade also adds the great knowledge of understanding Satoshi’s OP_Codes – which could add the ability to code colored coins and binary contracts.\nAlso Read: Steve Eisman of ‘The Big Short’ Fame: What Value Does Cryptocurrency Actually Add? The Bitcoin Cash Network Has Successfully Upgraded its Block Size to 32MB\nThe wait is over as the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network has upgraded its base block size from 8MB to 32MB. The implementation of the new consensus rules went into effect at block height 530356, and so far the transition has been smooth as the community awaits the next concession of blocks. Miners and other full BCH nodes had already upgraded their clients to the latest Bitcoin ABC 0.17.1 and other supported implementations like Bitcoin Unlimited, and XT over the past few week as the community prepared for the change. Among some minor updates, three notable changes have been enforced throughout the network which includes a 32MB block size, an increased default data-carrier-size to 220 bytes, and re-enabling previously disabled Satoshi OP_Codes. The Bitcoin Cash block size is increasing from 8MB to 32MB. The increase should allow for massive amounts of transaction throughput for years to come.\nThe first and biggest change to the Bitcoin Cash consensus rules is obviously the fourfold block size increase. Raising the block size to 32MB will allow vast amounts of transactions to pass through the network with consistent inexpensive transaction fees. Right now the amount of BCH transactions per day has been steadily increasing , and because the base block size has increased by four times its original size, blocks will not fill up for a very long time. The capability of this mechanism has been proven multiple times as there have been many BCH blocks between 2-8MB processed over the course of the past nine months. For instance, just sixteen days after the fork on August 1 the mining pool Viabtc processed an 8MB BCH block which cleared over 37,000 transactions in one fell swoop. Upgrading the Default Data-Carrier-Size to 220 Bytes\nAnother notable Bitcoin Cash network change is the blockchain’s default data-carrier-size being raised from 80-bytes to 220-bytes. This enables a robust OP_Return feature which is a relatively inexpensive way to embed data into the BCH chain. Essentially the OP_Return is a script code that is used to mark transactions as invalid but many cryptocurrency enthusiasts believe the OP_Return feature is meant to record a rich set of data and not just financial transactions. However, back in 2014, BTC developers believed “storing arbitrary data in the blockchain is a bad idea” and recommended users store “non-currency data elsewhere.” OP_Return has been in the Bitcoin codebase since it was launched, and in February 2014 the 80-byte OP_Return was reduced to 40-bytes , but it was later increased merged back to 80 bytes in 2015. Basically, the developers at the time considered this type of blockchain usage as spam and would end up bloating the network. Photo source: Massimo Bartoletti and Livio Pompianu’s An Analysis of Bitcoin OP_Return Metadata\nHowever, even as developers warned that the use of OP_Return was a ‘bad idea,’ individuals and organizations continued to use it to embed arbitrary data. Two organizations, specifically Omni layer, and Counterparty, showed that using OP_Return for arbitrary data could be innovative towards building meta-protocols over a secure blockchain — although when blocks are full and the network is congested these types of layer systems find the blockchain’s network fees unsustainable. The BCH chain upgrading to 32MB and increasing the default data-carrier-size to 220 bytes will allow all kinds of innovations, like added creativity in applications such as Memo, Counterparty Cash, Blockpress, and many other platforms. This Upgrade Will Help the Cryptocurrency Community Learn to Understand the Original Satoshi OP_Codes Programming languages like Bitcoin’s Script and Forth are considered the ‘hackers programming languages.’\nLast but not least is the re-enabling of disabled Satoshi OP_Codes — which are essentially codes that perform specific operations using an internal stack language called Script . Many people consider Script to be extremely similar to the programming language Forth — another stack-based language and software environment. In the original Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin client, the creator added OP_Codes to the software which can perform operations like simple math and string handling processes. Most of the original OP_Codes were disabled in earlier clients and many people believe this language could bring new functionalities to the Bitcoin Cash network.\nThe OP_Codes implemented on the BCH network will improve our understanding of these codes Satoshi originally added. If all goes well with gaining knowledge from these codes then developers can enhance binary operations and contracts using the OP_Datasigverify code, and possibly OP_Group in the future. Further BCH proponents believe all of the OP_Codes will bring forth many innovative features such as multi-signature operations, colored coins or representative tokens, smart contract compilers, and 0-confirmation sending techniques. A list of OP_Codes Satoshi Nakamoto created long ago. Each has its own operation or function. Not the Last Upgrade\nToday’s upgrade is the first step towards many of these innovations and visions BCH proponents have been talking about for months. And there’s a bunch of other developments being discussed, such as double spend notifications — which notify nodes when a double spend takes place and a new Proof-of-Work (PoW) target called Bobtail . Additionally, programmers are looking into the Graphene protocol and other concepts that could add a rich feature set to the BCH chain. Today’s 32MB upgrade was a successful fork for the BCH community, and very likely there will be many more other upgrades in the future.\nWhat do you think about the Bitcoin Cash upgrade?

I was fascinated by bitcoin and blown-out by the price hike. Soon after I invested in BTC, BCH, ETH, XRP. The more I started reading about Bitcoin and the economics behind it, the more sense it made.\nBut the scaling debate did not make sense in terms of the price. BCH was the same and supposed to solve all the fee problems that BTC had. Moreover, my hero, Roger was a strong supporter.\nOn a hunch, and with some help of great mentors in Technical Analysis at that time, I felt BCH at $400/$300 was the massively undervalued. I missed the bus in 2017 beginning felt like I got a second chance to buy bitcoin below $1000.\nMeanwhile I started using (now realize it is rare to do so) crypto for real world things - I bought hardware wallets using Bitcoin, sent donations to the TAs who helped make me money and the best was stumbling upon yours.org. For the first time in more than a decade of usage of Internet I actually paid to read something. This was a phenomenal use case for crypto and BCH (I was not very impressed with steemit).\nTo continue the experiment of using BCH for real life - I started writing articles on BCH analysis and put enough stuff in the free and paid section of my articles.\nI did this because it helped me open up my mind to the potential investment opportunity in BCH even more after using/paying it for real life things, and I hoped others will see the same instead of just speculating or moving crypto between exchanges.\nA wonderful thing happened to me - People started paying to read my articles and I was earning crypto. It was always a dream to get paid to write, but imagined it was very hard. Yours.org and BCH made this possible.\nSimilar to yours.org, there are so many cool things like tipprbot, memo.cash, blockpress, coinText - I would be really surprised if someone used them and did not appreciate Bitcoin (cash). I remember one BTC troll commenting on twitter, where I asked for her/his BCH address and to her utter surprise, I sent her $5. She/Him was really grateful to me, but later deleted the tweet https://twitter.com/imkeshav/status/941206061125582848 Anyway, long story short, I went all in BCH at end of October and after that there was no turning back (I still find it very hard to diversify)\nhttps://www.yours.org/content/how-i-stumbled-onto-bitcoin-cash-and-invested-early-in-the--greatest-b-666abeefc085\nBecause of this experience and the TA that I learnt, I had an opportunity to present in a local conference for first time investors https://twitter.com/imkeshav/status/935557786728984576\nBased on that feedback from there, I started writing more articles on Technical Analaysis and Fundamental Analysis/Strategy on yours.org and the feedback through BCH has been awesome.\nI would love if you guys can read through them and share your feedback. I did not do this earlier because this subreddit always felt like a battlefield and I was uncomfortable about being relentlessly trolled by core fanatics\nBut I now realized (very late), yours.org is troll-free because 1) I can set a comment fee 2)and they have to use BCH to troll my articles. So even if they troll I/We win ;-)\nAnother reason to post now is that I see the bashing Roger gets and still he does not hesitate/stop. I could do this at least.\nPlease let me know if this subreddit is not a place for this kind of content (TA on BCH) as I don't see anyone else posting. Thanks for your patience.\n submitted by /u/imkeshav\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/imkeshav/status/941206061125582848", "https://www.yours.org/content/how-i-stumbled-onto-bitcoin-cash-and-invested-early-in-the--greatest-b-666abeefc085", "https://twitter.com/imkeshav/status/935557786728984576", "https://www.yours.org/@imkeshav"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T16:24:02.006+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32210, "moreResultsAvailable": 6610, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=25600", "requestsLeft": 406}
