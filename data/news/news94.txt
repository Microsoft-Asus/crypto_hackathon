May 30, 2018 314 Bitcoin Mining Hardware – Is it Still a Smart Investment?\nMining cryptocurrency has become extremely popular over the last 5 years as Bitcoin has seen a considerable price hike. This popularity has contributed to a flood of new mining rigs being developed at a record pace. The ever-changing landscape of the mining sector can leave interested parties confused as to the future value of Bitcoin mining hardware and if purchasing this equipment is still a smart move.\nA quick search of mining forums and you can see that these concerns really became an issue in 2013 when CPU (Central Processing Unit) miners were superseded by GPU (Graphic Processing Units) mining rigs and then later eclipsed by ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) models. Manufacturers are reaping huge bounties from these products. Hence, the continued development of more powerful mining equipment. What is Mining?\nMining is the process in which a network computer (node) adds the next block to the blockchain after completing a difficult math equation known as the Proof-of-Work. In the early stages of mining, this could be accomplished with nothing more than your home PC’s CPU. Bitcoin Mining Rig\nIt wasn’t long before miners realized that GPUs were far more efficient at handling the repetitive nature of the Proof-of-Work algorithms and by the end of 2013, GPUs were the mining standard. This had some serious ramifications as it increased both the cost of obtaining mining equipment, as well as the overall difficulty of the mining sector. Increased Difficulty\nPart of the proof-of-work algorithm is a difficulty adjustment. As more computing resources enter the mining pool, the proof-of-work algorithm makes the mining math problem more difficult to solve. In 2016, the mining sector saw an explosion in both the value of cryptocurrencies and the difficulty of mining. Up until this time, the majority of mining was still GPU-based but the introduction of far more efficient ASIC mining rigs quickly made mining BTC an expensive endeavor to begin. GPU Life Expectancy – Bitcoin Mining Hardware\nThe chart below indicates just how quickly GPU Bitcoin mining hardware has suffered since the introduction of ASIC rigs. In 2011, an average GPU miner could expect anywhere from 100-200 BTC for their efforts. Only one year later, these results were reduced to around 30 BTC and by 2013, you would have been lucky to mine 3 BTC using this hardware. This data reveals that by 2014, the number of BTC you could expect to mine using a GPU dropped below 1 BTC; making GPU miners practically obsolete when used alone. Chart Showing GPU Difficulty Over Time Delivery Date of Your Equipment\nDue to the overwhelming demand for BTC mining hardware, there is now a wait associated with purchasing these products. ASIC miners can have waiting periods that can extend for months. It is important to consider difficulty fluctuations during this time. Basically, if you have to wait too long for your mining equipment, it may not be worth it by the time it arrives. Electricity Costs\nElectricity costs should be one of your main concerns when deciding on what type of mining rig to purchase. You may find that you are losing money if you go with a high-powered mining rig in an area where electricity is expensive. Today’s mining equipment is focused on efficiency as older mining rigs are unable to produce a profit in today’s difficult mining ecosystem. Bitcoin Energy Consuption Chart via CNBC Bitcoin Prices\nThe overall price of BTC (or any other mineable crypto) is another determining factor to consider when deciding on purchasing a mining rig that will stand the test of time. When the value of BTC goes up, so does the profitability of mining this crypto. As was stated before, a single GPU miner could produce over 100 BTC in 2011. While the number of coins that a single GPU can mine has reduced, the value of BTC has appreciated nearly 1000% since those days. Future Transaction Fees\nThe reward for mining a block is scheduled to half every 210,000 blocks. This means that around May 2020, BTC mining rewards will drop from 12.5 BTC down to 6.25 BTC. While this seems like it could crush the mining industry, you must consider that there will only ever be 21,000,000 BTC mined and of that 17,048,151 have already been mined. This means you can expect to see some serious price increases as the number of BTC that are available to be mined diminishes in the coming years. ASIC Miners – Things to Consider\nWhile ASIC mining rigs are far more efficient at mining than their GPU counterparts, you should remember that these chips are only able to mine SHA-256 cryptocurrencies and therefore serve no additional purpose once these tasks are completed. This is in stark contrast to GPU chips that can still be utilized for graphically-intense applications such as gaming long after the last BTC has been mined. Should I Invest in Some BTC Mining Hardware or Not?\nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. If you live in an area that is privy to low, or even free electricity, you may find that your mining hardware’s lifespan outlasts other regions of the world due to your low overhead. Mining is a crucial part of the cryptocommunity and you should expect to see manufacturers continue to produce more powerful mining rigs over the coming years.\nWhat do you guys think?

you listen to when you’re making investment decisions? Warren Buffett is high on many people’s lists of gurus, and Neil Woodford has an impressive long-term record. But do you know who else I like to listen to? The proverbial man down the pub .\nBy that I mean anyone who has no real knowledge of investing, but who picks up on the latest fad and asks me about it. And twice in recent weeks, I’ve been asked about this bitcoin lark.\nThere are sound reasons to shun bitcoin. One is that it’s horribly unstable in value and it’s more akin to gambling than rational investing. Another is that it really doesn’t possess the characteristics needed to actually work properly as a currency (essentially due to that instability), while yet another is that it also doesn’t have what it takes to work as a gold substitute .\nBut putting those rational fears aside, the ultimate reason to see bitcoin as the latest South Sea bubble or tulip mania is possibly when the man down the pub starts talking about buying some.\nFads like bitcoin are often likened to the greater fool theory, in that when you invest in something at an inflated price, its only value lies in there being a greater fool to whom you can sell it on for even more. And when it’s got to the man down the pub , you’re reaching the end of the greater fools line.\nIt happened in the dotcom boom, it happened at the buy-to-let peak, and I see it happening to bitcoin.\nI am surprised by the number of people who are quite happy to consider plonking a couple of hundred down on a dodgy get-rich-quick idea, but who throw their hands up in horror at the stock market and the risk they think they see of losing their shirts. Growth stocks\nEven FTSE 100 growth candidates, like Mediclinic International (LSE: MDC) , are surely going to be a lot safer.\nI reckon Mediclinic’s erratic earnings performance of the past few years has possibly scared away a number of growth investors. After a couple of years of falling EPS following an early spike, the owner of Switzerland’s largest private hospital group recorded a flat year in 2017.\nEconomic weakness in its home base of South Africa, coupled with Swiss regulatory issues, lie behind those few tough years, but the company has branched out into the Middle East with the acquisition of the Al Noor Hospital group.\nFor the year to 31 March, Mediclinic recorded an operating loss of £288m, though that was littered with one-offs and the firm claimed an adjusted operating profit of £370m (up 3%).\nWhile financials are tricky to make sense of in this transitional period, investors’ hopes will surely be focused in an easterly direction. Outgoing chief executive Danie Meintjes reported a “ strong second half performance in Abu Dhabi, ” and reckoned that, with “ continued strong delivery in Dubai and the exciting expansion opportunities ahead, ” there should be further growth in the Middle East in the years to come.\nAnalysts seem to think so too, with a modest EPS rise of 5% predicted for this year and a beefier 12% pencilled in for 2019.\nThat suggests a 2019 P/E of 17.7, which I don’t think is too demanding. Certainly better value than bitcoin, in my view.\nYou Really Could Make A Million\nOf course, picking the right shares and the strategy to be successful in the stock market isn’t easy.

If that hasn't already blown your mind, just wait till you see who she's been working with.\nThe reality TV star and social media influencer is listed as an author on a paper published in a scientific journal earlier this month, and her co-author is none other than Satoshi Nakamoto – the mysterious recluse and inventor of Bitcoin , whose identity has never been revealed.\nStrange company to keep, and the nature of their collaboration is even stranger.\nTheir paper, published in Drug Designing & Intellectual Properties International Journal , is an impenetrable treatise on the topic of 'Wanion', an algorithm methodology for optimising e-commerce systems.\nThe sheer technical language of the paper suggests Nakamoto may have led the work, because Wanion's complexity seems a world away from Kim K's usual fare. Or perhaps the third author, computer scientist Tomáš Pluskal from MIT, shouldered the bulk of the writing.\nIn comments to Retraction Watch, Pluskal spoke glowingly of working with Kardashian.\n\"I have always thought that Kim's scientific talents were a bit under-appreciated, so I wanted to give her the opportunity to show this unknown side of her,\" Pluskal says .\n\"Needless to say, the science presented in the paper would never have reached such high quality without her input.\"\nYet… if you read the paper, the 'high quality' of the commentary is somewhat questionable.\n\"In recent years, much research has been devoted to the synthesis of the Turing machine; nevertheless, few have enabled the deployment of systems,\" the paper opens .\n\"In this work, we show not only that e-commerce can be made cacheable, semantic, and client-server, but that the same is true for vacuum tubes.\"\nHmm. We're no experts on e-commerce or vacuum tubes, but something about that doesn't read quite right.\nThe journal the work appears in is published by a company called Lupine Publishers. That name has a vaguely sinister, predatory ring to it – which is ironically fitting, because (surprise!) this entire study is a sham .\nAs Pluskal explained to Retraction Watch, the paper – which neither Kardashian or Satoshi Nakamoto actually co-authored – isn't a real study, but a contrived fake designed as yet another sting on predatory journals .\nThese journals prey on up-and-coming scientists who are desperate to get noticed in their fields, by charging them exorbitant fees to get their research published, while skipping the peer review process that gives scientific literature its integrity.\nIn this case, it turns out none of the authors were actually legit, and the paper is gibberish.\nWhile Pluskal set up the sting, he had computers write the paper for him, using an MIT program called SCIgen that automatically stitches together scientific-sounding text, and which has previously fooled journals into publishing nonsense.\nOf course, the chaotic output generated by the program is completely meaningless. But that doesn't mean SCIgen isn't useful, at least when your tongue is firmly embedded in your cheek.\n\"I have been using SCIgen for a while,\" Pluskal told Retraction Watch .\n\"It is a fantastic tool that saves so much time and reduces the burden and stress associated with paper preparation. It's cutting-edge MIT technology at its best.\"\nSo, sadly, it seems Kim Kardashian is not a published scientist after all. But that doesn't mean she hasn't made an important contribution to the field .\nThe 'findings' are reported in Drug Designing & Intellectual Properties International Journal .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto", "https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0424-0", "https://www.nature.com/news/publishers-withdraw-more-than-120-gibberish-papers-1.14763", "http://www.lupinepublishers.com/ddipij/pdf/DDIPIJ.MS.ID.000112.pdf", "https://cosmosmagazine.com/technology/kim-kardashian-writes-paper-for-drug-design-journal", "http://news.mit.edu/2015/how-three-mit-students-fooled-scientific-journals-0414", "https://retractionwatch.com/2018/05/28/kim-kardashian-pairs-up-with-an-mit-post-doc-to-publish-a-scientific-paper/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kim kardashian", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim k", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wanion", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drug designing & intellectual properties international journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T11:38:25.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "78118b5b81e9755764991806d50cdefcc55ef537", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjrDl7Vzcp4Xqk5ff4C5PImY7Icg4A3hAGTuOoZI43PxCIsM.bjKQTrAX9Lp5P1N_5qP294r4kOXbSClW3pMtTZ49z.A16Lkyo8v60QbpahoyNYrUnY95JOKGDVXxM24MqKV2VKNEt5A--", "site_full": "www.fool.co.uk", "site": "fool.co.uk", "site_section": "http://fool.co.uk//feed", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "The Motley Fool UK", "title": "This FTSE 100 growth stock looks a far safer bet than bitcoin", "title_full": "This FTSE 100 growth stock looks a far safer bet than bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-30T14:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://1gb82h2px4rr3s7tp94g0nt1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BuySellHold.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45557, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "78118b5b81e9755764991806d50cdefcc55ef537", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjrDl7Vzcp4Xqk5ff4C5PImY7Icg4A3hAGTuOoZI43PxCIsM.bjKQTrAX9Lp5P1N_5qP294r4kOXbSClW3pMtTZ49z.A16Lkyo8v60QbpahoyNYrUnY95JOKGDVXxM24MqKV2VKNEt5A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alan Oscroft", "published": "2018-05-30T14:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "This FTSE 100 growth stock looks a far safer bet than bitcoin", "text": "Alan Oscroft | More on: MDC\nWho do you listen to when you’re making investment decisions?

The Korean Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a ruling by a lower court that allowed the government to confiscate bitcoin that a 34 year-old man surnamed Ahn earned through an illegal business on the grounds that the cryptocurrency has value as his property. The ruling will likely allow the government to confiscate cryptocurrencies used for payments in other illegal transactions, such as those involving drugs, gambling and pornography. Ahn was sentenced to 18 months in jail and was fined 695.8 million won ($644,380) by the Supreme Court in addition to the lower court’s decision that confiscated 191 bitcoin tokens currently worth $1.4 million that he earned through an illegal pornography website. The 34-year-old is in violation of manufacturing and distributing adult content. Ahn ran the porn website AVsnoop.club between December 2013 and early last year. During that time, the site attracted 1.22 million members and made 1.9 billion won in profit. The prosecutors in the first trial wanted to confiscate 1.4 billion won that was not just in his own account, but also the accounts of his family members, as well as 216 bitcoin tokens, which was the total amount that members of his website paid. At the time of his arrest on April 17, the 216 bitcoin tokens were valued at roughly 500 million won. However, by January of this year, when Ahn’s case went up to an appeals court, their value surged up to roughly 2.5 billion won.The judge in the first trial sentenced Ahn to 18 months with a 340 million won fine, but denied confiscation of the 216 tokens, arguing that since bitcoin, unlike cash, has no physical form and only exists as a digitalized file, confiscating it wouldn’t be appropriate. The 340 million won fine was based on advertisement profits and payments from members of the site.However, when the case went to the appeals court, the judge concluded that despite bitcoin having no physical form, the tokens Ahn collected were profit, as they were the result of a transaction through an exchange market and were used to purchase goods and services. Therefore, the government has the right to confiscate it, the judge concluded. He said that allowing the defendant to keep the bitcoin would be the same as allowing the defendant to possess monetary profit gained from managing a pornographic website. The court only acknowledged 191 bitcoin tokens as profit made from criminal acts. Using bitcoin to pay for crimes has been growing in recent years, especially as transactions on the dark web have become more widespread.The most recent such case was earlier this month, when Seoul police arrested and indicted three people who sold 120 million won worth of marijuana that was grown at an officetel (dual-purpose buildings used for commercial and residential purposes) in Goyang, Gyeonggi, from November last year. The payments were made in cryptocurrency to avoid authorities tracking it, according to police.

As of writing, the cryptocurrency is up 5 percent at $7,487 on Bitfinex, having clocked a four-day high of $7,560 before today. A slight corrective rally had been expected, courtesy of a bullish price-relative strength indicator divergence in the brief duration charts seen within the last two days. Further, the resulting bullish outside-day candle engulfed the cost action seen on Monday and Tuesday, and has neutralized the immediate bearish outlook. Daily graph\nAs the name implies the bullish outside-day indicates a bearish-to-bullish trend shift. Nevertheless, analysts and traders usually wait around for confirmation — positive follow-through before calling a reversal. Therefore, a short-term trend reversal is going to be confirmed if bitcoin takes the descending (bearish) 10-day moving average (MA) hurdle in a convincing way. Presently, the 10-day MA is situated at $7,562 and can be capping the upside down in prices, as seen in the chart above. At the mean time, the 50-candle MA hurdle in the 4-hour chart below can also be proving a tough nut to crack. 4-hour graph\nA high volume break over the 50-candle MA of $7,520 could see bitcoin assault the descending trendline barrier, now situated at $7,930. That said, prices will probably revisit $7,100 if bulls are unable to cross the crucial moving average hurdle within the upcoming several hours. The chart also shows the major moving averages (50,100 and 200) are trending southwest, a lingering bearish arrangement. Therefore, a convincing break above the 50-candle MA would be easier said than done. View\nThe immediate outlook has been neutralized, but only a convincing move over the 10-day MA of $7,562 would add credence to yesterday’s bullish outside-day candle and signal a short-term bullish reversal. In such a case, BTC will probably test the descending trendline hurdle, now seen at $7,930. The entire bias stays bearish as long as the falling trendline barrier stays intact Repeated rejection in the 50-candle MA resistance in 4-hour chart could yield a pullback to $7,100–$7,000. A break below $6,900 would open downside towards $5,000, even though a move over the latest high of $9,990 would revive the long-run bullish outlook.\nBull statue image via Shutterstock\n abides by a ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitfinex", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T16:10:29.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "45e6f1d915562bf46762300a6e91ee2b7641199b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfVtyYPOfbQjbRugPn97S3Y-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why people are still buying Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why people are still buying Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-30T14:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "45e6f1d915562bf46762300a6e91ee2b7641199b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfVtyYPOfbQjbRugPn97S3Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "prediction on bush", "published": "2018-05-30T14:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why people are still buying Bitcoin?", "text": "Quote: from: First77 on May 28, 2018, 09:25:11 AM If people buy Bitcoin at $8,000, they will get 100% profit only when Bitcoin reaches $16,000.

Click here to find out more » Why I'm here As a former software engineer with an awareness of information security and as a cryptocurrency entrepreneur, it took me some time to decide if it was worthwhile to write this series of articles. After all, writing this article with my actual identity poses a certain risk to myself and my investors. Even those of us with sensible security measures in place are still at risk of a targeted attack. That's why you will notice I don't use social media or even have a website in order to reduce the number of attack vectors that can keep me up at night. However, I have found it incredibly hard to find high-quality information about Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), blockchain, and cryptocurrency in general from traditional sources. I feel that for the industry to mature, those of us involved with cryptocurrencies have a responsibility to remedy this as best we can. So, that's why I'm here. Who I am Over the last few years, I've been drawn into the Bitcoin rabbit hole that has changed the direction of my career and indeed my life. What I found started as a curiosity and turned into an obsession. This led me to start dabbling with Bitcoin in 2015 when I bought my first Bitcoin just under $250. Later, I would discover Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and make my first investment in Ether at $1. By early 2017, I felt it was time to make more formal arrangements. So, I started a small cryptocurrency mining company called BTC Northwest. By the end of 2017, I had gone from the annoying guy in my peer group who wouldn't shut up about cryptocurrency, to the guy whose phone wouldn't stop ringing. Everyone wanted to get into cryptocurrency, but nobody really knew what was going on. It was then that I had a moment of clarity, and I decided that I needed to quit my software job and focus on ways to capitalize on what I believe is probably the biggest opportunity of our generation. Bitcoin Technical Analysis, Why I'm Not A Fan Let's quickly recap the different approaches of technical analysis and value investing. Technical Analysis Seemingly random data has patterns that can be modeled and possibly predicted using advanced math. Seemingly fairly valued markets have companies that are overvalued and some that are undervalued. When everyone looks at the same chart, they start to act in the same way. We can use this to our advantage. When people get caught up in daily distractions, they forget that the fundamentals are the ultimate long-term drivers of price. When it comes to Bitcoin, a lot of the value investing techniques completely fall apart. After all, the cryptocurrency market is only a few years old and massive amounts of activity that go on are unregulated. On top of that, how do you determine value in the first place? Trying to apply techniques created for analyzing a business that were developed over a hundred years ago to a decentralized cryptocurrency just doesn't make sense (inventory turnover, price/book value, price/earnings ratio, etc). So, with no value investing framework people have turned to technical analysis. These charts look a lot like stock charts, so what's the problem? Well, let's remember that it matters what's being charted . This was my favorite image from Nassim Taleb's book , \"The Black Swan.\" Can technical analysis be useful? Sure. But we need to start by understanding what's creating the output that we're looking at. The Value Investing Approach To Bitcoin Earlier I wrote that traditional value investing methods simply do not apply to Bitcoin. But, that doesn't mean that we're totally in the dark. I think if we understand why value investing worked in the first place, we can extract the key principles and create a new framework for analyzing Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies in general. Going back to first principles may sound like an arduous task in an era of tweets and buzzwords. But, I have a feeling that some of you may understand why this is important. Having an edge in trading today requires that you see things a little differently. Otherwise, buy that S&P 500 Index ETF and take up a new hobby. I've heard woodworking and bird watching are nice. If you're still with me at this point, let's talk about the next step: our value framework. A Bitcoin Value Framework When I was an MBA student we were taught that before doing a financial statement analysis, we had to first understand the value chain . It makes sense if you think about it. How does this company add value? We need to know what we're looking for when we start digging into the numbers; otherwise, we're back to the turkey chart from above. But, does a cryptocurrency have a value chain? Is a cryptocurrency a product or service? Where do we even start? Let's think about these key questions below. How does the Bitcoin software actually operate? Who's in charge of the Bitcoin network? What is the blockchain? What are cryptocurrencies in general? How does Bitcoin add value? Bitcoin is open source; so what? Bitcoin is permissionless; so what? Once we have a high-level understanding of these questions, we can move on to ask a new series of questions like: Do any of the Bitcoin pricing models that are circulating now have any merit? What is the relationship between Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market in general? Bitcoin, How Does It Work? From a high level, Bitcoin is a form of digital currency that allows anyone with an internet connection to transact with anyone else on the Bitcoin network. This short video might help if you prefer that form of media. What the Bitcoin software does is to allow people to send and receive transactions, and to back up their funds for future recovery. Because Bitcoin is software , it can also be used as a platform to transact value between applications. In other words, if I wanted to make an app that has in-game purchases, for example, I could simply add the necessary code and people could buy and sell things inside my app using Bitcoin. If you happen to have a background in economics, or you are interested in currencies in general, you might be thinking \"If Bitcoin is digital, what stops people from just copying and pasting them and flooding the market with supply, thereby tanking the price?\". Well, it turns out that Bitcoin has a clever solution to this that's actually very low tech. All of Bitcoin's transactions since it was launched in January 2009 are recorded in a ledger that is distributed to the entire network. So, if you wanted to try creating some Bitcoin for yourself, you would have to fool the entire network into thinking that your \"books\" are the correct ones. Since there are so many copies of this ledger (often referred to as distributed ledger technology or DLT), it turns out that this is very difficult to do. Another name for this distributed ledger is the blockchain (technically \"blocks\" of transactions that cannot be changed or taken out of sequence without becoming invalid). Who Is In Charge Of Bitcoin? Some people may believe that because it is an open-source software project, nobody is really in charge. Bitcoin was originally proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto (probably a pseudonym) in 2008, but at the end of 2010, he mysteriously vanished. Since that time the power over the network has been held by key players in each industry. The primary centers of authority are the software developers , the users, the exchanges , and the miners who validate transactions and are rewarded with network fees and newly minted Bitcoin. While no single individual can \"control\" the network, per se, within each industry, there are key players who wield influence as thought leaders . This forces the different industry players to come to consensus for the good of the network. What Are Cryptocurrencies? Cryptocurrencies, in general, are digital payment networks that make use of distributed ledgers, advanced cryptography , and other systems like those originated in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is open source, so anyone can read or copy the source code at any time, if they want to, for example, start their own cryptocurrency. This has happened many times over the last nine years, resulting in at least 1,600 cryptocurrencies as I write this in. How Does Bitcoin Add Value? Bitcoin creates value in a number of ways. First of all, Bitcoin is a payment network in which the more people use it, the more valuable it becomes. If this idea sounds familiar, that's because it's the same one used to estimate the value of social networks like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) - Metcalfe's Law . Secondly, for a payment system to have value, it must be scarce. Bitcoin accomplished this by limiting the supply of Bitcoin with a hard cap of 21 million Bitcoin that will ever exist. If you're worried that a high value may make the currency unusable for smaller transactions, it's worth noting that unlike the US dollar, where the smallest unit is the penny, with Bitcoin the smallest unit is a \" Satoshi ,\" which is 1/100,000,000 of a Bitcoin. When it comes to security, Bitcoin again has a novel approach to this problem. Surprisingly, this solution is also very low tech. Since Bitcoin is open source, it actually invites hackers to attack the protocol. Today the market capitalization of Bitcoin is north of $100 billion. If you can hack the platform, it's yours! Of course, this would tank the value of the currency, but you get the idea. Because of this giant \"crypto x-prize,\" the Bitcoin network is constantly under attack, which has made it incredibly resilient . Bitcoin Is Open Source; So What? I have a little thought experiment for you. Let's imagine you walk into your bank and say to the teller, \"Hello, I'd like to see the source code that your bank runs on please.\" What do you think would happen? Regardless of the outcome of that day, I can guarantee you will not be given access to the bank's source code. This is because, in order to protect themselves, the banks have to hide away their source code from the outside world, and rely on a system of firewalls, security experts, video cameras, harsh penalties , insurance, and auditors to ensure their compliance and safety. If someone got access to your bank's source code, they could find a vulnerability and then exploit their software systems, potentially causing a massive damage to the bank's reputation. As many of you are aware, the number of huge hacks and data breaches have been increasing over the years. Information security, especially financial security has been a hot topic. Just ask Target (NYSE: TGT ), Home Depot (NYSE: HD ), Yahoo , and the list goes on. Now, compare this with Bitcoin's approach of being completely open for anyone to see. It should be clear by now just why many in the banking industry are rushing to try and implement Bitcoin's technology. Imagine how much safer and more secure they could be if security were just baked in, instead of having to be bolted on at massive cost. Bitcoin Is Permissionless; So What? Why should we care that Bitcoin is permissionless? It comes down to the speed of innovation. With a restrictive financial system, you get innovation at the speed of regulatory approval. But, when everyone is free to experiment, they end up creating things we couldn't imagine before. Bitcoin Is Money That Can Be Programmed. What Does That Even Mean ? Well, imagine all those legal contracts and exotic financial instruments as pure code that does not recognize national borders. Imagine a bank as pure software. Now you're starting to get the picture. Existing Bitcoin Pricing Models: Are They Valid? Given what we know now, let's take a look at two popular Bitcoin pricing models. The first is Tom Lee's model that he touted on CNBC .\nIf you build a very simple model valuing bitcoin as the square function number of users' times the average transaction value, 94% of the bitcoin movement over the past four years is explained by that equation. At first glance, this seems too good to be true. After all, if we can explain 94% of the movement of Bitcoin then cashing in should be fairly simple. However, I have two major problems with this model. (No offense, Tom. I'm still a big fan of your work.) We Don't Know How Many Bitcoin Users There Are . With Bitcoin, there are no user accounts. So, one user might have 1, 100, or 1,000 payment addresses (or more). Furthermore, a single user might have multiple wallets , each containing multiple addresses. We could try to come up with the number of users by adding up the number of people using popular services, but then how do we know if a single person using both services isn't being counted twice? How Are We Calculating Transaction Value? If we're calculating it in USD, then we're essentially saying the price equals some number times the volume multiplied by the price. Of course, there's a correlation; the output is constructed from the input! (Essentially, we would be saying that \"X\" is correlated with \"X times Y\", this is true but not very helpful.) If we're using the volume in terms of Bitcoin, then we have the issue that exchange volumes are unreliable and potentially completely fabricated . Moon Math A second Bitcoin pricing model that relies more heavily on technical analysis is called Moon Math . This site has made some recent upgrades and does a good job of presenting the data in a way that's visually appealing. However, understanding the actual calculations can be quite involved, and I found it difficult to determine exactly what's going on under the hood. Source: moonmath.win Apparently, the yellow line is a trend line of some kind, which I guess means the price is exactly where it should be? To me, it's just not very satisfying to try and predict the movement of a line based only on the movement of that same line. Furthermore, from my own research, the last price jump into the $19,000 range was a more extreme deviation from the norm than the price in 2011 and 2014, but that's a story for another time. Another issue is that this chart does not take into account the supply of Bitcoin. Every four years on average, the amount of Bitcoin entering the market will fall in half. These shocks to the supply side have an impact that's missed when we only look at the price of a single Bitcoin and do not consider inputs or capitalization (circulating quantity times the value of a single unit). Lastly, if Bitcoin is a disruptive new technology, then we should be looking at its adoption differently from how we would a candlestick chart. The image below is more relevant in my mind. It shows what percentage of households in the US adopt a new technology from the time of its introduction. Source: Energy Institute at Haas Notice that more recent technologies are getting adopted faster as they tend to be built on top of the old technology. Ray Kurzweil calls this phenomenon the Law of Accelerating Returns . In upcoming articles, I'll show you why Bitcoin today is so similar to the internet in the 90s. In fact, that's one of the things that people usually bring up when the topic turns to price speculation. People say that when the bubble bursts, it will be just like the Dotcom days. I love hearing that because I always ask them \"Do you remember when the Dotcom bubble burst, and then everyone quit using the internet? Right, me either. Same thing with Bitcoin.\" Conclusion I hope you found this article useful and that it helped to clear up some confusion. There are always trade offs when you try to explain something that's fairly complicated in a short time, and for the sake of brevity, some information was omitted. Below I have included a short reading list if you just can't get enough. Feel free to comment below and let me know what you think.

That said, today's decision marks a notable legal reference, since there are ongoing criminal cases in South Korea involving cryptocurrencies.\nAs previously reported by CoinDesk, prosecutors from the Incheon district filed a suit in December 2017 against a firm called Max Mining and 21 suspects in an alleged $250-million cryptocurrency mining fraud.\nMost recently, prosecutors in Seoul have also raided several local cryptocurrency exchanges over suspicions of fraud and embezzlement , reportedly seizing assets for further investigation.\nGavel and Korean won image ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/search1/2603000000.html?cid=AEN20180530003500315", "https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/korean-money-wooden-gavel-on-brown-783602950?src=hITjpqfYyzaQvXSL72EBJw-2-48"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wolfie zhao", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "million following supreme court ruling korea seizes bitcoin worth", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "million following supreme court ruling", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "yonhap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "korea seizes bitcoin worth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T15:37:58.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8ffb81a5b819de9c78011bf5a1327b09dcda5bb3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DoCSMKlD.W.E.vIfoby0X1NUQHd7zjAzALVPZkD8BS9yT4UTiSAZqzwBQ7PvP606OR6I.msm0B.koqkx_ErbhOBpNbuC69Uq78WYax9ZPe.IeQWYp9sqhjnMTBq0g_x34z4IrY8AaaTQiQhc8DaoADIoNdzo1BHRiJyuKvQk4lqTLnXNaQNKZYcIe9ZjgCTs-", "site_full": "www.discovernewsline.com", "site": "discovernewsline.com", "site_section": "http://www.discovernewsline.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Discover Newsline", "title": "Silicon Valley #1 Dentist Begins Accepting Cryptocurrencies, Including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dentacoin", "title_full": "Silicon Valley #1 Dentist Begins Accepting Cryptocurrencies, Including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dentacoin", "published": "2018-05-30T14:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8ffb81a5b819de9c78011bf5a1327b09dcda5bb3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_DoCSMKlD.W.E.vIfoby0X1NUQHd7zjAzALVPZkD8BS9yT4UTiSAZqzwBQ7PvP606OR6I.msm0B.koqkx_ErbhOBpNbuC69Uq78WYax9ZPe.IeQWYp9sqhjnMTBq0g_x34z4IrY8AaaTQiQhc8DaoADIoNdzo1BHRiJyuKvQk4lqTLnXNaQNKZYcIe9ZjgCTs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2018-05-30T14:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Silicon Valley #1 Dentist Begins Accepting Cryptocurrencies, Including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dentacoin", "text": "Print This Article Share it With Friends Fremont, CA – May 29, 2018 – Dental care is moving fast into the new financial world currently being fashioned by the advent of cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin's value or maybe the opposite. I'm not sure, but we all know there are effects. But, Im pretty sure, Bitcoin wont die because of that.\nProbably future crypto users or investors will get discourage and eventually will lose interest. Yes, its a major factor.

Everything you need to know about the cryptocurrency\nThe companies behind the Mississippi and South Sea bubbles were set up in the 1700s to trade produce from the new colonies - slaves, natural resources and land. To raise funds to fuel these companies they sold shares, which were heavily marketed to investors as easy money since they had the support of government and a full monopoly. Famously, the shares reached outlandishly inflated prices until they crashed a few years later.\nSome key differences with Bitcoin: These bubbles lasted no longer than 5 years and would have burst even quicker were it not for the communication issues at the time; news travelled very slowly in the 1700’s. Bitcoin is approaching its 10th birthday in a world where information travels as fast as we can consume it. Surely if it were a bubble it would have burst after a year if there were no value in it. The bubbles you mention featured no innovation, no unique selling point that should cause these companies to out-perform their rivals from the Spanish, Dutch and Portuguese. Bitcoin is an invention many consider as significant as the Internet in scale and disruptive effect. Faster, cheaper and more secure than any other global payment method. The South Sea and Mississippi companies were giving people loans to buy its stock, effectively an early version of a ponzi scheme. Again, with Bitcoin, since there is no single party in control, a Ponzi scheme is simply impossible. You can’t use a new investor’s money to pay back an old investor because every single transaction is verified by the entire network.\nEven still I can tell that many of you are reading this thinking “yeah, but nothing is backing it but faith” - Correct, the same thing that gives money in video games value, our central bank-controlled currencies value, and frankly most tech companies value.\nIf Bitcoin is a bubble, then it is one similar to the dotcom bubble, which you may notice people often refer to now as the dotcom “crash” or “correction”. Why do they call it that? Because the bubble didn’t pop; good tech companies came back stronger and more powerful. Amazon shares at the height of the “bubble” were worth $112, 18 years later they are now trading at $1604 - almost 1500% higher.\nDS: Crypto currency is a money laundering tool for criminals and tax cheats. Standard Chartered chief executive Bill Winters has said 40% of criminal transactions are executed via crypto currencies. Crypto has been transformed into the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time\nJS: Bill Winters is apparently not very good at maths. If 40% of criminal transactions are carried out via cryptocurrencies and the Black Market is worth an estimated $1.81 trillion (according to Havocscope.com , a black market research group) then by his calculations, the crypto market should be worth a minimum of $725 billion. That’s more than double all crypto assets combined.\nBesides, Bitcoin is a terrible choice for criminals. In 2013 Mt.Gox, the then largest exchange in crypto, was hacked. User accounts were compromised and more than 800,000 Bitcoins were stolen. But what happened next? A group of volunteers set to work to trace the funds through the blockchain. As every transaction made using Bitcoin is public, these detectives were able to follow the money and the identity of some of the thieves was discovered. Remember, using Bitcoin for a transaction leaves a PERMANENT record on the blockchain. Immutable, never to be deleted. For a criminal, it’s an idiotic tool to use for laundering money or hiding from the taxman.\nDS: Bitcoin miners currently use 0.1% of all the electricity on earth, and will soon use 0.5%. They consume electricity mainly made with coal by more than 159 nations. Entire big data centers repeating stupid games a million times just to validate purchases of crypto-currencies. This is just a waste of energy for something which has a zero intrinsic value.\nJS: First of all, it’s not a “game”. Bitcoin mining - using computer code to create new coins - is a security feature, designed to ensure that nobody is able to send fraudulent transactions, censor the network, or take it down. The level of security provided by Bitcoin’s mining network is now enough to stop attacks from colluding super powers, be they nations or corporations. This security is already at the level where it is enough to scale with a network that could handle all global transactions. Compare that to TSB which had no internet or mobile banking available for almost two weeks. Or compare it with the data breaches at companies including Equifax, Talk Talk, Tesco Bank, Target, Sears - hundreds of millions of people’s banking data stolen. Suddenly Bitcoin’s mining network doesn’t seem like such poor value.\nBitcoin mining’s main locations are where energy and land is cheap. And the cheapest energy tends to be where there is most supply - either in places where new power stations have been built - or where there is ample hydro, solar, wind, tidal and nuclear power. Some of the largest mining farms in the world are in Greenland using geothermal, the deserts of Australia, Asia and the Americas using solar or scattered across Europe where there is excess nuclear and hydro electric power.\nBesides, this is just version 1.0. Now, newer blockchains such as Ethereum and IOTA are testing different mechanisms that remove mining all-together, requiring devices similar in power consumption to an old Nokia or Raspberry Pi.\nDS: Crypto currencies are run by an oligopoly. About 1000 whales own 40% of available bitcoin, exchanges are centralized and development is centralized too. Currency developers are the police, prosecutors and judges at the same time, so they develop their arbitrary rules of law based on their whims.\nWhales owning 40% of bitcoin is simply untrue, and even if it was, it has nothing to do with controlling the currency. Bitcoin addresses are public, but there is no easy way of measuring who owns what accurately. A Bitcoin wallet can be owned by multiple people, individuals can own multiple wallets and companies often have their own, they can also be lost with no way of knowing if the wallet is still accessible.\nThe only thing I can tell you is what we do know:\nExcluding most major exchanges and companies the top 1000 wallets combined own around X% of Bitcoin.\nAlthough Bitcoin can currently be easily influenced by just a handful of mining pools, don’t forget these pools are made up of tens of thousands of individual users. In the past every time a pool has got close to mining more than 50% of blocks, users have quickly turned off them or switched to different ones. I agree the system is far from ideal, but as mentioned earlier many cryptocurrencies are experimenting with new more decentralised alternatives. Bitcoin could easily adopt one of these once it has proven itself secure and decentralised.\nDevelopment is far from centralised, bitcoin’s code is fully open source, meaning anyone in the world can read it, copy it to make their own version, or submit their own changes to the network. You can head to github and see for yourself the numbers. There are over 44 different forks of Bitcoin taking advantage of the original code in the last year alone. If you and your community don’t like the direction, you can fork off and make your own ;). Moment undercover cops pounce on £500k master Bitcoin hacker\nDS: Crypto-land has worse inequality than North Korea or the US. Using the economists’ standard gini coefficient measure of inequality, in Bitcoin ownership it is 0.88 and worse for Ethereum. For North Korea it's 0.86, 0.47 for USA. The distribution of Bitcoin holdings looks much like North Korea and makes China's, and even the US's wealth distribution look like a worker's paradise. So much for democratizing finance.\nJS: You’re comparing the equality of wealth in an entire country, to that of one relatively small, very newly created asset. Unless you’ve found a way of linking wallets to real people (expect a call from the government for help), there is no way of knowing just how in equal Bitcoin is or is not.

Securing crypto assets isn’t as easy as we’d like it to be; it takes some skill, dedication and a bit of patience to secure your bitcoins properly.\nEvery now and then we hear a newsworthy story of some guy who lost a considerable amount of money because he lost the private keys to his wallet, got hacked, or the third-party service provider that had custody over his private keys got hacked.\nThe first in a series of heists – the 2011 hack of the infamous Mt.Gox crypto exchange – resulted in a loss of more than $8.7 million worth of Bitcoin . Given the fact that Mt.Gox controlled approximately 70% of all bitcoin transactions in the world at the time (and did so under terrible management) the second, vastly bigger attack did not come as a surprise. In 2014 , Mt.Gox’s security was breached again, resulting in a mind-boggling $470 million robbery. And this was just the beginning.\nIn 2016, Hong Kong-based crypto exchange Bitfinex announced that roughly 120,000 bitcoins worth $72 million were stolen from the exchange. A year later, on December 6, 2017, Slovenian-based mining company NiceHash got robbed out of 4700 bitcoins worth $80 million, and a year after that, on January 26, 2018, Coincheck reported that hackers had stolen $520 million worth of NEM coins from the wallets hosted on their servers.\nYou get the point. Trusting third-party service providers with your money isn’t exactly a great idea. Cryptocurrencies gave us the freedom to be our own bank, which is excellent, but now we’re the only ones in charge of our security. Granted, we might have had less financial control before, but we had less responsibilities too.\nWith that in mind, if you want to learn how to protect your bitcoins, you’ve come to the right place. This article lays out the precise step-by-step process to complete bitcoin security. Whoever holds the private key owns the funds Image credits: Leons Flanders\nCryptocurrency transactions are peer-to-peer , meaning there’s no official authority acting as an intermediary between the sender and the receiver of the funds. On top of that, blockchain immutability makes cryptocurrency transactions irreversible; once the transaction is verified and the block is added to the blockchain – it’s over. There’s nobody you can call for help and reverse the transaction to get your money back.\nTo fully understand how Bitcoin security works, we first need to explain how and where your bitcoins are stored.\nThere’s a common misconception in the cryptocurrency world that your bitcoins are stored in your wallet. That is not the case. Bitcoins or, rather, Unspent Transaction Outputs ( UTXO ) are recorded on the blockchain. In order to access and spend your bitcoins, you need to prove your ownership over them; you do that by signing the transactions with your private keys , which are stored in your bitcoin wallet. The concept of a user’s Bitcoin balance is a derived construct created by the wallet application. A wallet, therefore, is just a software application that is used to facilitate bitcoin transactions by managing the private and public keys of the wallet owner.\nConsequently, your vital concern regarding the security of your bitcoins is the protection of your private keys. A private key is, essentially, a randomly derived string consisting of 51 alphanumeric characters. It’s main use is to create the signatures that verify ownership over the bitcoins in the transaction. In other words, he who holds the private keys – owns the bitcoins. For this reason, you must never, under any circumstances, disclose your private keys to anyone. Not only will you be giving away your bitcoins, but you will also be drawing a connection between you and the financial activity of the account.\nKeeping your private keys private is no laughing matter. Bitcoin is a multi-billion dollar industry, and dedicated teams of hackers are spending their days construing ways to steal your money.\nBefore you implement the security measures we suggest, you need to know what you’re up against. Most common Bitcoin security threats Image credits: Alberto Antoniazzi\nMany newcomers are ignorant of how shady cryptocurrency hackers can be. Therefore, we’re going to lay out the most common risks and security holes you should be wary of. Keyloggers\nA keylogger is a software or a hardware tool used to record keystrokes. Although keylogging tools are legal and can be utilized for legitimate purposes, they’re most commonly used by hackers as a part of Trojan viruses and other forms of malware to steal victim’s passwords. Screen loggers, on the other hand, are software tools that are used to make covert screenshots of the victim’s screen. They can be programmed to take screenshots of the whole screen periodically or take screenshots when the user clicks their mouse. Ordinarily, hackers will use keyloggers in conjunction with screen loggers. The best protection against this is an anti-keylogger software, which is a tool designed specifically to detect keyloggers, and does so with a much higher success rate than common anti-virus software. Phishing\nHackers use phishing as a prevalent clandestine method to trick victims into unknowingly surrendering their sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, sensitive information about their business, home address or/and phone numbers by disguising as a trustworthy entity in electronic communication. The most common form of phishing is email spoofing , whereby the attacker directs the victim to a fake website that looks identical to its legitimate counterpart (usually a high-profile email service, financial corporation, or some other website that the victim might have an account with), at which point they’re asked to enter their sensitive information. In some phishing schemes attackers will create a clone email address similar to the email address of the victim’s boss, coworker, or a friend in order not to raise any suspicion, hide malware in the attachment files, and instruct the victim to download those files. Be careful: there are many software apps designed to protect your PC from phishing attacks, but there’s no software in the world that can protect you from your own thoughtlessness. Phone-porting attacks\nYou really need to watch out for this one; cryptocurrency users are especially prone to phone-porting attacks. The biggest mistake most of us are probably guilty of is that we don’t think of our phone numbers as personally identifiable sensitive information, but you’d be surprised how much damage hackers can do merely by obtaining your phone number. Typically, hackers will snoop around various cryptocurrency-related social media groups, phishing for naive investors that will give their phone numbers and emails for easy contact. After the attacker acquires the phone number, they call up the phone provider impersonating the victim and ask the customer service representative to transfer the phone number to a device they control. More often than not, the representative will ask the impersonator to answer a few simple security questions such as the date of birth, home address, or the last 4 digits of the victim’s social security number, which the impersonator may be able to answer after some phishing , mail theft , and/or a little bit of social engineering. Once the hacker gets ahold of your phone number, he can change the password to your cryptocurrency exchange account, locking you out and stealing the bitcoins from your exchange wallet. Therefore, the best protection you can take against phone-porting attacks is to keep your phone number secret, keep your cryptocurrency business to yourself, or if you’re going to talk about it on social media – use a far removed pseudonym. Trojans\nIn the past few years, Trojans and other forms of malware have been spreading like wildfire. Pony Loader 2.0 and CryptoShuffler are just two known examples of cryptocurrency-stealing Trojan infections that have caused trouble to crypto users. A Trojan is a specific form of malware that infects a user’s computer and sits there idly, doing nothing but what it was programmed to do. The CryptoShuffler, for example, is a Trojan programmed to scan a user’s computer for clipboards containing strings of numbers that look like crypto wallet addresses. When the Trojan finds such a number, it replaces it with the hacker’s bitcoin address so that when the victim wants to make or receive a payment, he copy-pastes the fraudulent address without notice, and any funds sent to that address are now transferred to the hacker’s wallet. Installing an anti-virus software can certainly help, but it is best that you never keep your private keys in easily accessible clipboards. Instead, store your private keys on an offline device or even on a piece of paper. Exit scams and ICO scams\nAlthough exit scams and ICO scams have nothing to do with your private keys, they have everything to do with the security of your bitcoins. If you’re new to the game, and you’ve decided that you want to invest your money into the latest “revolutionary” new project that will “decentralize the world” or “cure AIDS through blockchain,” take a step back and ask yourself: Have I done a fundamental analysis on the project? Are the founders of the project public and what’s their reputation? Where is the company registered? Is the development team any good?\nIf you know the answers to these questions, then proceed with caution. If not, just stay away from ICOs because most of them are outright scams. Furthermore, you should be very cautious about the third-party service providers you use. Many young companies will offer a polished new product such as a crypto exchange, crypto wallet, or gambling site where customers can create accounts to hold Bitcoin. For a year or so, they will act like a legitimate business and promote themselves aggressively to attract as many new customers as possible. And then, all of a sudden, the company pulls an exit-scam and vanishes with all of their clients’ Bitcoin – claiming they’ve been hacked or simply disappearing into the darkness. This is only possible because the regulatory framework surrounding cryptocurrencies is still under development in many countries around the world. With that in mind, always do your research before investing in a highly volatile industry such as the cryptocurrency one and always, always think twice before you consign your bitcoins to a third-party service provider. Force Majeure\nEven if you’re “doing everything right”, things can go wrong. Various natural disasters such as fires, tornadoes, or floods could destroy your home along with the equipment you’ve used to store your private keys, your hard drive could stop working, your USB drives could be stolen… You can never prepare yourself for all the things that could go wrong. But, you can anticipate most of them, and in the following part of our guide we will help you do exactly that. How to secure your Bitcoins properly Image credits: Dmitrii Kharchenko\nAs we’ve said already, the primary concern with Bitcoin security is where and how your private keys are stored. The private key to your wallet is nothing but a string of characters and, therefore, it can be stored anywhere. Memorising your private key in your head is probably the best way to “store your bitcoins,” but since most of us are not even able to memorize our best friends’ phone number, this is probably out of the question.\nIf you’re not storing your private keys on a piece of paper, the most important factor to the safety of your bitcoins will be the general security status of your hardware device. Let’s get the no-brainer out of the way: Installing an anti-virus program and enabling the firewall on your computer is a must. However, securing your computer might not be enough, and you might want to consider kicking things up a notch and leaving the grid all together. After all, the best way to protect yourself from the dangers of the Internet, is to stay off it! Cold Storage Image credits: Alex Kunchevsky\nWhen we think of bitcoin storage, we differentiate between two different kinds that serve two different purposes – hot and cold storage.\nA hot wallet is a wallet that’s connected to the Internet. This includes exchange wallets, web wallets, desktop wallets, and mobile wallets since they all require an Internet connection to work. Centralized online (hot) wallets are a big no-no for anyone even remotely concerned with the security of their bitcoins. They store your private keys on central servers, creating a single point of failure that hackers (or even the service providers themselves) can exploit. With decentralized wallets like Mycelium and Electrum , on the other hand, you’re in sole custody of your private keys, but they require an Internet connection to operate so you’re still vulnerable to attacks. Third-party service providers such as exchanges and online wallets are prone to hacker attacks and exit-scams, so you should choose such services very carefully, and use two-factor authentication whenever possible.\nCold storage in the context of Bitcoin refers to keeping the private keys to your bitcoins offline. So, following that definition, cold wallets are wallets that aren’t connected to the Internet. This includes (but is not limited to) hardware wallets, offline implementations of core wallets, and paper wallets, as they are physical alternatives designed to keep your bitcoins outside the reach of the Internet. We will look at all of these options and the advantages that they have over hot wallets when it comes to securing your coins. Hard wallets\nHard wallets are the most secure and user-friendly way to store your bitcoins. They’re like little banks that fit into your pocket. Hardware wallets are small, portable, air-gapped devices that generate your private keys offline.\nTrezor and Ledger Nano S and KeepKey are three of the most reputable hardware wallets that support Bitcoin (among other currencies) and that employ two-factor authentication to further secure your funds. The devices are password protected, which means you can regain access to your bitcoins and keychain in the event that you lose the physical device by providing the password.\nBecause of the many security features of hardware wallets, approving multiple transactions during the day with can be a little bit annoying. Like most cold storage alternatives, hardware wallets are better fitted for long term storage, so we suggest you keep small amounts of bitcoins on less secure wallet apps for everyday use. Core wallets\nIdeally, the Bitcoin core wallet should be your first choice for cold storage for three simple reasons: Bitcoin core wallet is secure, stable, and subject to very few changes over time. Core wallets are designed to be conservative, and this is a good thing. When you hold your bitcoins in cold storage over many months or even years, there’s a small possibility that, when you want to access your funds a year later, the company that built the hardware wallet disappeared, or it doesn’t run the latest operating system. If this happens, you’re doomed.\nThe downside to core wallets is that they need to download the whole blockchain to operate. This means that you’ll need to free up around 145GB of space on your hard drive just to install the Bitcoin core wallet, and as time passes and the bitcoin blockchain gets bigger – that number will only go up. Also, core wallets take a very long time to sync, which can be very frustrating when the market is crashing and you’re trying to sell your bitcoins as fast as possible. They are, however, a valid option for a less active user that’s simply looking to store their funds in a safe, air-gapped environment. A cold implementation of Bitcoin’s core wallet is best utilized if you install it on a dedicated hardware device, but more on that later. Paper wallets\nPut simply, paper wallets are nothing but pieces of paper with your private and public keys printed on them. It may sound silly, but paper wallets are one of the most secure ways to store your bitcoins. That is, of course, if you take great care of that piece of paper. Unlike hardware wallets, paper wallets are not fit for everyday use. They are the coldest of cold storage methods, the deep-freeze of bitcoins if you will.\nGenerating a paper wallet is rather simple: Create some randomness using random keystrokes on your keyboard or by moving your cursor around; You will be presented with your public and private keys and their respective QR codes; Click the ‘Paper wallet’ tab, select the number of addresses you want to generate and click ‘Generate’; Print your paper wallet;\nMake sure that your PC and your printer are not connected to the Internet while you generate your paper wallet; simply turn off your WiFi once the page is loaded, and turn it back on after you’ve written down the information and closed the tab. When you want to check your balance, just type your public address in the search box of blockchain.info . Recommended safety measures Image credits: Dmitrii Kharchenko\nNow that you’ve learned how to store your bitcoins, it’s time for some very important safety measures. Separate your bitcoins in hot and cold wallets\nA good way to secure (at least the majority of) your coins is to store them in different places. This way, even if one of those places is compromised, you won’t lose all your coins at once. Our suggested strategy is as follows: keep a small amount of bitcoins in a hot wallet that you can quickly use for day-to-day transactions, and transfer the rest of your savings to a cold wallet that you won’t use very often.\nWhile hot wallets are easily accessible and convenient for everyday use, they are susceptible to cybercrime. In this day and age, hackers are a force to be reckoned with; any device that’s connected to the Internet could fall victim to a cyber attack masked as an antivirus program, a password recovery emergency, or even an email from a dying Nigerian prince begging you to accept his inheritance. You could see how keeping a large amount of money in a hot wallet isn’t exactly smart since, either due to your negligence or a hacker attack on the exchange of your choosing, you could lose it all in the blink of an eye. Hot wallets are handy but susceptible to risk, which is why you should only use them for transacting with a small amount of bitcoins.\nUse cold wallets to store most of your funds that you don’t plan on spending any time soon. Depending on your preferred model, you can get a hardware wallet for about $100-$200. The cheaper (or rather, free) alternative is a paper wallet, which doesn’t make as good of a conversation piece, but at least keeps your bitcoins off the grid. Cold wallets are a bit of a hassle compared to hot wallets, as they either require you to carry a special physical device or to type in your private key every time you want to make a transaction. They aren’t as suitable for day-to-day use, but rather for storing a large amount of your crypto for a long period of time. They are susceptible to external damage and misplacement, but that can easily be solved by storing them in a dedicated safe space like a locked drawer or a safe, and only using them on the rarest of occasions when it’s absolutely necessary. Make backups of your wallets\nAnother important measure you should consider to further secure your bitcoins is to backup any information regarding their storage — and not just once. If you have a paper wallet, issue a couple of copies and keep them in different places. If you have a desktop wallet, burn a copy of all its data onto a CD or a dedicated USB drive (more information on that here ). In fact, make a copy of all your private keys and passwords regardless of what kind of wallet you’re using. You should also make backups frequently so that all new data (like new Bitcoin addresses) you’ve generated since the last backup is properly synchronized. Plan ahead and don’t rely on a single access point; when you’re dealing with money, you can never be too cautious. Encrypt your wallets\nThe next safety measure you should consider is encryption. Bitcoin core has a feature that lets you encrypt the wallet.dat file which contains all sensitive information regarding your account. Any attempt to access the encrypted wallet requires the newly generated passphrase. This adds another layer of security; even if someone gains access to your computer, they still need to provide the passphrase to gain control over the wallet. Encryption is also available for mobile wallets.\nIt’s not a bad idea to encrypt your backups, too. And then create a backup of your encrypted backup — and encrypt that as well. Just kidding. You should, however, encrypt your backups precisely for the aforementioned reason — especially the ones you keep online or on a device that’s connected to the Internet. Offline backups aren’t excluded, though; in the event that someone finds their way to your hiding place, nothing stops them from just loading the contents of your USB or CD and going wild with it. A backup is a hardware-based security measure, and encryption is a software-based one. The two are best used in conjunction with one another to make sure you’re tackling the security issue on all fronts.\nDon’t forget to use a strong password – one that contains letters, numbers and punctuation marks, and is at least 16 characters long. It’s best that you avoid birthdays, personal names, or common words to construct it; your best bet is to use a random password generator for this purpose. Use dedicated hardware for offline transaction signing\nIf you want to take your bitcoin security up a notch, you can use two different computers for offline transaction signing. With the first computer, you will be creating unsigned transactions, while the second one will be used to host the entire wallet along with the private keys used to sign the transactions. When you want to make a payment, create a transaction on the first computer connected to the Internet and save it to a USB drive. After that, transfer the transaction to the offline computer hosting the entire wallet using the USB, sign it with the private key, and then transfer it back to the online computer to execute the payment. This method air-gaps your private keys and minimizes your exposure to malware while protecting you from potential malicious attacks. Needless to say, in order for this to work properly, never connect the PC hosting your wallet to the internet, and never use USB drives that might have been exposed to unprotected devices in the past. Take advantage of multi-signatures\nMulti-signature is a useful Bitcoin feature that allows transactions to require multiple signatures in order to be spent. It means that a transaction can’t be carried out unless M of the N keys (M<N) comprising the multi-signature sign it, thus preventing a single agent (owning a single key) or K agents (K<M) from spending the funds.\nThis feature is particularly convenient for organizations. Let’s say a company has an accounting department consisting of five members; a multi-signature can be put in place so that it takes three of those five members to sign off on any activities regarding the company’s funds. You too can implement multi-signature to secure your bitcoins: simply store the N keys on different devices so that you can avoid a single point of failure. Even if a hacker or a thief gained access to one of those points, he wouldn’t be able to gain control over your funds since he would still need the remaining M-1 signatures necessary to complete the multi-signature. Conclusion Image credits: Dheeraj Parwal\nBy now you should understand the role of private keys, and why keeping them secret is of the utmost importance. To maximize your bitcoin security, use all of the aforementioned methods cumulatively and stick to the basic rules of bitcoin safekeeping: Private keys are for your eyes only. Don’t rely on exchanges or bitcoin clients for security; hot wallets are only for small amounts of bitcoin that you’re willing to lose. Invest in air-gapped hardware or just stick to paper; big amounts of bitcoin are better off in cold storage.\nOn another note, you might consider sharing your private keys (or their hiding places) with a single family member or a friend you trust. In the event that something happens to you or you’re physically prevented from accessing them, they could take care of things for you.\nFinally, don’t forget to take care of your biggest liability: yourself.

This transition is what has resulted in the invention of cryptocurrency and bitcoin. The invention and existence of these two happened merely by serendipity in 2009, by Satoshi Nakamoto who developed the bitcoin with the motive of introducing a new electronic cash system that uses peer to peer network to prevent double spending. It is also a decentralized digital cash system which does not require a server as such ,but requires absolute consensus amongst its peers, failing which the block chain of events is broken. This is what invoked the concept of having a cryptocurrency.\nA cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange created and stored electronically in a blockchain using cryptography methods which enables high security and privacy .It is intangible and can’t be redeemed for other valuable assets in return. The cryptocurrency functioning solely depends on the miners as they are the one’s who confirm the transactions and propagate it in the network. In return they are awarded a unit of the cryptocurrency . The fact that anyone can be a miner poses potential risks of misusing this privilege, but this is avoided by the proof of work technique. This is a mathematical puzzle which is solved by the miner including a lot of hard calculations and algorithms to decipher. The miner who deciphers the puzzle first, gains a unit of the cryptocurrency. The difficulty of this puzzle increases the amount of computer power the whole miner’s invest and there is only a specific amount of cryptocurrency token that can be created in a given amount of time. This is part of the consensus which cannot be broken by any peer.\nThe pros of cryptocurrency are that it is irreversible, pseudonymous, fast, secure and permission less. Cryptocurrencies have the spotlight on them and have set a new trend in the market globally. People are immensely fascinated and enthusiastic about it.\nBitcoin was the first decentralized cryptocurrency that came into existence around 2008-2009 invented by Satoshi Nakamoto. The bitcoin is used as a global means of payment and is majorly used in the dark web and ransomware. Bitcoin has seen a drastic increase in it’s price in the past 7 years. It’s present worth is about 650 dollars or more and the number of users have shot up to 2,00,000 a day . The bitcoin is the leader of the cryptocurrency world with ethereum, ripple and litecoin trailing behind.\nThere are many apps which act as interfaces in buying these currency. The prominent apps being coinbase and blockchain. These apps allow exchange of cash for a bitcoin in return. The blockchain acts like a ledger in the digital world which records every valuable transaction. The fact that it is incorruptible, robust and transparent make it all the more trust worthy and reliable. The blockchain comprises of various node networks .These nodes act as voluntary administrators in order to ensure a decentralized network. In return, they are provided with a bitcoin as remuneration for working on solving complex math puzzles and deciphering codes.\nAll these factors and components are what govern the cryptocurrency world. The introduction of cryptocurrency has revolutionized the whole economy and its outreach has left everyone spellbound. The value of the bitcoin cryptocurrency reached its pinnacle in 15th December 2017 with a value of 17,900 dollars. The price has been seeing fluctuations post this phase of its highest growth. The potential of cryptocurrency in the economy is still abundant and plays a very pivotal role in the economy on the whole.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T15:59:54.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b3ebf2b9eaa7340ffeb80c5c8442583ceaa355dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmboWHJzkcErCTloxKafPJZw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "bitcoin is the vehicle, we run it", "title_full": "bitcoin is the vehicle, we run it", "published": "2018-05-30T13:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b3ebf2b9eaa7340ffeb80c5c8442583ceaa355dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmboWHJzkcErCTloxKafPJZw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Erlinda Santiago", "published": "2018-05-30T13:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin is the vehicle, we run it", "text": "Quote: from: Edi86 on April 29, 2018, 04:39:23 PM A lot of posts are about bitcoin (eg bitcoin for illegal transactions ... bitcoins change lives ... bitcoin destroys the world ... bitcoin poison and so on) but basically it's all humans that move .. bitcoin is the tool.

China Confiscates ¥1.7 Billion From Onecoin Scheme\nAccording to reports from the region, a local Chinese procurator’s office has prosecuted 98 people and recovered 1.7 billion yuan (about $270 million) in an alleged Onecoin pyramid scheme. The case is thought to involve up to 15 billion yuan, and had been under investigation since July 2016, supervised by the Ministry of Public Security.\nThe Onecoin scheme involved twenty provinces in the country, according to South China Morning Post . Details of the case are “complicated,” and the amount involved is “huge”, and the final four suspects in the case had been prosecuted, the reports said. Around the end of 2017, 33 defendants were sentenced to four years in prison and fined between 10,000 and 5 million yuan. 85% of Germans Have Heard of Cryptocurrencies\nThe majority of Germans have heard about bitcoin and even think they understand the term. This according to an online survey conducted by YouGov Deutschland GmbH, in which 2051 persons participated between 11/05/2018 and 14/05/2018. The results were weighted and said to be representative of the German population over 18 years of age.\nThe stats show that 85% of Germans have heard of cryptocurrencies and say they know what the term means. 38% believe that their importance will increase and 21% foresee a loss of significance. 8% percent even say that they would invest all or the larger part of their available money in cryptocurrencies rather than in equities. 53% believe that cryptocurrencies would become more attractive, and 25% do not. Ramadan Kareem\nThe Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, East London, UK has reportedly decided to accept cryptocurrencies as charity. “For a donor that already has a bitcoin or an ethereum account, the effort of converting cryptocurrency into say British pounds or dollars can be quite burdensome. The mosque effectively takes the burden on themselves,” said consultant Lukasz Musial. “For the donor, it’s just the click of a button to transfer to an account provided by the charity. From the mosque’s perspective, it opens a new stream of donations coming from all over the world,” he added. Greenhouse Mining\nUnited American Corp, a Florida-based company, has announced it completed the construction of its first “Blockchain Dome Heat Station” and greenhouse in the Canadian province of Quebec and that all 1,000 mining rig heat generation modules are in full service. Heat coming out of the rigs is used to warm the facility instead of letting that energy go to waste.\n“The Blockchain Dome was built on budget, on-time and to our specification. The results we can see and measure are overwhelming and beyond our expectations,” said CEO Benoit Laliberte. “We will provide further information to the market soon, but we can already state that we have set new efficiency and performance standards for this type of operation going forward,” he added.\nThe sustainable use of mining-generated heat has been a hot topic for a while now. Earlier this year we reported about a similar venture after a photo of ‘Cryptomatoes’ went viral. Crypto Champ Strikes Again\nOn Monday, we reported that Rory MacDonald, the current Bellator MMA Welterweight World Champion, has shared a clip of himself training in a BCH shirt. And on his latest interview on The MMA Hour the champ explained his decision to support cryptocurrency in general and bitcoin cash in particular.\nWhat do you think about today’s news updates?

Visconti\nCasper vs Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) Based on Proof of Stake.\nCasper includes new features that the Byzantine fault-tolerant BFT protocol may not support. It’s actually a combination of Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), a hybrid that will hopefully solve the problematic issues that Proof of Work and Proof of Stake have when used alone.\nThe new features that Casper displays are; Accountability; Dynamic validators; Defenses; and Modular overlay. Accountability\nIf a violator breaks a rule, the violation and validator will be identified. The advantage of “accountability” is that validators can be penalized, thereby solving the “nothing at stake” problem that plagues chain-based PoS currently. The penalty is the validator’s deposit will be forfeited. “This maximal penalty is the defense against violating the protocol. Because Proof of Stake security is based on the size of the penalty, which can be set to greatly exceed the gains from the mining reward, Proof of Stake provides strictly stronger security incentives than Proof of Work.” (Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09437v2.pdf (Source: Vitalik Buterin and Virgil Griffith, November 15, 2017)\nDynamic validators\nA safe way of the validator set to change is introduced.\nDefenses\nDefenses are set up to protect against long-range revision attacks and where more than 1/3 of the validators drop offline.\nModular overlay\nAs an overlay, the design of Casper makes it easy to execute an upgrade to an existing Proof of Work chain.\nPlausible Liveness\nDespite previous events, for example, slashing, delayed blocks, censorship attacks etc. if 2/3 of the validators follow the protocol, then it’s possible to finalize a new checkpoint. The Casper Protocol\nIn Casper, the Friendly Finality Gadget, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09437v2.pdf (Source: Vitalik Buterin and Virgil Griffith, November 15, 2017), the Casper Protocol is described in technical detail. How Casper will change Ethereum is described as such. “Within Ethereum, the proposal mechanism will initially be the existing proof of work chain, making the first version of Casper a hybrid PoW/PoS system. In future versions, the PoW proposal mechanism will be replaced with something more efficient. For example, we can imagine converting the block proposal into some kind of PoS round-robin block signing scheme.”\nRather than use the full block tree, it will be more efficient that Casper uses only the subtree of checkpoints forming the checkpoint tree. “The genesis block [parent block] is a checkpoint, and every block whose height in the block tree (or block number) is an exact multiple of 100 is also a checkpoint.”\nThe Proof of Stake security is derived from deposits so here’s how it works. “Each validator has a deposit; when a validator joins, its deposit is the number of deposited coins. After joining, each validator’s deposit rises and falls with rewards and penalties. Proof of stake’s security derives from the size of the deposits, not the number of validators, so for the rest of this paper, when we say ‘2/3 of validators’, we are referring to the deposit-weighted fraction; that is, a set of validators whose sum deposit size equals to 2/3 of the total deposit size of the entire set of validators.”\nAccording to Live Bitcoin News, Vitalik Buterin’s announcement to choose Proof of Stake over Proof of Work for Ethereum is problematic. First of all, the gain from capital is lower with Proof of Stake compared to Proof of Work. But the number one issue is “the minimum staking amount will be upwards of 1000 ETH” which indicates that people above this ceiling will get richer and people below it will remain poor. This means that the gap between rich and poor will widen so we’re back to the same inequalities that the fiat currency maintains, control of a system in the hands of a rich few. (Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake – What’s the Difference, and Which is Better? January 29, 2018) http://www.livebitcoinnews.com/proof-work-vs-proof-stake-whats-difference-better/ Recent Grads Moindrot and Bournhonesque of Stanford University Explain the Differences\nTo decipher the characteristics between Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Casper, Olivier Moindrot and Charles Bournhonesque formerly from the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering at Stanford University, wrote a report to define the differences. Moindrot and Bournhonesque are recent graduates of Stanford University and are currently working for AI startups in the medical domain.\nIn their Abstract Proof of Stake with Casper, http://www.scs.stanford.edu/17au-cs244b/labs/projects/moindrot_bournhonesque.pdf (Source: Olivier Moindrot and Charles Bournhonesque, Autumn 2017) Olivier Moindrot and Charles Bournhonesque explain that most public blockchains like Bitcoin created by Nakamoto (2008) and Ethereum created by Wood (2014), use Proof of Work to reach a consensus. “All this computation requires a lot of energy to run, and Bitcoin as of December 2017 consumes as much electricity as Denmark2. Because of high initial capital costs and economies of scale, miners get bigger and the system gets more centralized. Finally, the only way proof of work prevents attackers from breaking consensus is by spending a lot of computational effort on the main blockchain: to defend against an attacker the network needs to spend as much as the attacker.”\nIn comparison, Proof of Stake reaches a consensus on the main blockchain by using a set of validators. Proof of Stake was initially introduced in King and Nadal [2012] for the cryptocurrency Peercoin which features a combination of Proof of Work and Proof of State to obtain a consensus.\n“These validators deposit an amount of the blockchain’s cryptocurrency and cast votes weighted by their stake. No unnecessary electricity is consumed, and the system is fully decentralized as there is no economy of scale. The biggest advantage of Casper-like Proof of Stake is that attackers can be identified and their deposit can be destroyed immediately. In Proof of Work, you can’t destroy an attacker’s hardware after an attack.” Proof of Stake with Casper http://www.scs.stanford.edu/17au-cs244b/labs/projects/moindrot_bournhonesque.pdf\nMoindrot and Bournhonesque also describe in detail the definition of Proof of Stake and Casper by explaining the protocol, the validator role, and how the block is finalized. They then prove that Casper ensures accountable safety. Their main contribution was a codebase release as a result of experimenting with the consensus algorithm. The code is available on Github here. https://github.com/omoindrot/simple_casper Recent Version of Casper Uses a Single Type of Message and a Vote\nInitially, Casper used the traditional consensus algorithms but the most recent version of Casper (Buterin and Griffith [2017]) shifted to utilizing a single type of message and vote that combines the roles of “prepare and commit” so this is the protocol illustrated in Proof of Stake with Casper and the results can also be read here. http://www.scs.stanford.edu/17au-cs244b/labs/projects/moindrot_bournhonesque.pdf .\nProof of Stake, currently used in Ethereum, is the long-term replacement for Proof of Work but since there are other issues with it, Casper is a transition from Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, so it’s a hybrid option. “Casper represents an intermediary step to keep using Proof of Work but also add Proof of Stake as an additional layer of finality.” (Source: Proof of Stake with Casper, (Olivier Moindrot and Charles Bournhonesque, Autumn 2017) http://www.scs.stanford.edu/17au-cs244b/labs/projects/moindrot_bournhonesque.pdf) Incentives for Miners\nSince the goal of a blockchain consensus is to finalize transaction blocks, the Casper protocol indicates that validators vote to decide which blocks get finalized and belong to the blockchain. If 2/3 of the validators follow the Casper protocol, there will never be two finalized conflicting blocks. As discussed in the original document Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget, Vitalik Buterin and Virgil Griffith, Nov 15, 2017, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09437v2.pdf , validators vote on checkpoints not on every block in the blockchain.\nThis is where the Casper Protocol is beneficial to miners. “In exchange for their deposit, validators, therefore, get the right to vote on checkpoints and can earn a small reward when they collectively finalize checkpoints. This creates an incentive for the whole network of validators to cooperate towards finalizing the highest possible number of checkpoints, contrary to Proof of Work which is a zero-sum game for miners.” (Source: Proof of Stake with Casper, Vitalik Buterin and Virgil Griffith, November 15, 2017) http://www.scs.stanford.edu/17au-cs244b/labs/projects/moindrot_bournhonesque.pdf)\nIn conclusion, the future of Bitcoin won’t involve unsustainable amounts of electricity because a better process is developing as a result of collaborations. The game changer for Bitcoin miners is Casper right now but could be something else in the future. As well, a full implementation of Proof of Stake with Ethereum is possible. What’s certain, is that brilliant minds in the cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology creative space will maintain fairness and trust in the system by experimenting, finding what works best and what doesn’t. It’s an evolving process for the crypto community to come up with creative solutions for the benefit of all.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.livebitcoinnews.com/proof-work-vs-proof-stake-whats-difference-better/", "http://www.scs.stanford.edu/17au-cs244b/labs/projects/moindrot_bournhonesque.pdf", "https://github.com/omoindrot/simple_casper", "http://www.scs.stanford.edu/17au-cs244b/labs/projects/moindrot_bournhonesque.pdf)", "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09437v2.pdf"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "grace c. visconti casper", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "proof of work", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T16:43:23.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8dbe983fa5a253f6bd64b167df8417b9326d3c89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg._QsXKpwKCS0y9GeS6C8D9YNJGj68c2KdaqVWjHIN51z0oKZvRTR5BPkPcHM5CdEvAvmDE5L40WJxonhkTUKdf", "site_full": "www.moneygrows.net", "site": "moneygrows.net", "site_section": "http://www.moneygrows.net/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Moneygrows", "title": "Bitcoin analysis for May 30, 2018", "title_full": "Bitcoin analysis for May 30, 2018", "published": "2018-05-30T13:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/vDVAQbFPhuZmogqQWRg-xvI7uysdxOCdBqfJJoyRAjjtfmRDD8H0WY5azwINzWPp2weoXhuoljWjcKKWiH4achrAGsbxc0XhI9IPyS0FcyzO02sQyL5zxeeaxXjIG2uZEpKQ-wM=w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8dbe983fa5a253f6bd64b167df8417b9326d3c89", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg._QsXKpwKCS0y9GeS6C8D9YNJGj68c2KdaqVWjHIN51z0oKZvRTR5BPkPcHM5CdEvAvmDE5L40WJxonhkTUKdf", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "noreply@blogger.com (MG Network)", "published": "2018-05-30T13:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin analysis for May 30, 2018", "text": "Contact Us Bitcoin analysis for May 30, 2018\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading upwards.

Italy’s economy is reeling amid a political crisis that has placed a spotlight on the cracks in the EU’s economic foundation. Bitcoin Price Trends up as Italy’s Economy Falters Italian bonds are going bust, and the negativity has spilled over into stocks as well. But as the global financial markets are reeling, bitcoin is finally beginning to see the light of day again, and it could just have something to do with the fact that a potential threat to the euro highlights the benefits of a decentralized currency like bitcoin. The bitcoin price is currently trading above the $7,400 threshold after falling to a May low earlier in the day. Bitcoin Price Chart Reason to Rally The cryptocurrency markets have been searching for a reason to rally, and many of us have been looking to the centralized governments of the world to provide that catalyst. Meanwhile, the mechanics of the cryptocurrency markets are working just fine, and have pulled off a rally — albeit on modest trading volume — on a development that highlights the very strengths of a decentralized world. Bitcoin and its altcoin peers have proven once again the power of a digital currency that is not controlled by the central bank but instead the masses. The crisis in Italy has placed a great deal of pressure on the euro, sending Europe’s common currency to its lowest levels against the USD in months. Italian bonds have similarly sold off amid the possibility of Europe’s third-largest economy staging a Brexit of its own. A decentralized currency like bitcoin becomes even more attractive when the common currency of Europe becomes unstable . Fundstrat’s Thomas Lee cheered the crypto market’s response, telling Business Insider : “To an extent, I think its good to see Bitcoin rallying with Gold, as the adverse developments in Italy and globally are pushing investors to risk-off. It’s good to see Bitcoin as an uncorrelated trade on a risk off day.” Take the Latin American economy of Venezuela as an example. While the economic conditions in Venezuela are specific to the region, comprised of hyperinflation, food crisis and a broke government, the end result is a currency whose value has been destroyed. As a result, Venezuela’s currency was being exchanged for bitcoin at a record pace in mid-April, when more than $1 million in “bolivar-to-bitcoin” conversions occurred in a single day. Italy’s fate in the EU has yet to unfold, and a snap election appears to be taking shape for the coming months there. In the meantime, it’s not just bitcoin that’s benefitting. Other leading digital currencies including ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and litecoin were all trading between 2%-4% higher while cardano soared nearly 10%.

Daily chart\nAs the name suggests, the bullish outside-day indicates a bearish-to-bullish trend change. However, analysts and traders usually wait for confirmation – positive follow-through before calling a reversal.\nSo, a short-term bullish trend reversal would be confirmed if bitcoin takes out the descending (bearish) 10-day moving average (MA) hurdle in a convincing manner. Currently, the 10-day MA is located at $7,562 and is capping the upside in prices, as seen in the chart above.\nMeanwhile, the 50-candle MA hurdle in the 4-hour chart below is also proving a tough nut to crack. 4-hour chart\nA high volume break above the 50-candle MA of $7,520 could see bitcoin attack the descending trendline hurdle, currently located at $7,930.\nThat said, prices will likely revisit $7,100 if bulls are unable to cross the key moving average hurdle in the next few hours.\nThe chart also shows the major moving averages (50,100 and 200) are trending south, a lingering bearish setup. So, a convincing break above the 50-candle MA will be easier said than done. View The immediate outlook has been neutralized, but only a convincing move above the 10-day MA of $7,562 would add credence to yesterday's bullish outside-day candle and signal a short-term bullish reversal. In such a case, BTC will likely test the descending trendline hurdle, now seen at $7,930. The overall bias remains bearish as long as the falling trendline hurdle remains intact Repeated rejection at the 50-candle MA resistance in 4-hour chart could yield a pullback to $7,100–$7,000. A break below $6,900 would open up downside towards $5,000, while a move above the recent high of $9,990 would revive the long-run bullish outlook.\nBull statue image via Shutterstock The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

However, after falling to a near seven-week low of $7,090, the digital coin managed to edge higher and stabilise above the $7,100 mark. From there the Bitoin price was able to rally towards the $7,500 level in the afternoon. The digital currency closed the session at $7,472.59, up from its opening price of $7,129.46.\nWhile Bitcoin has so far today managed to defend its Tuesday gains, the coin hasn’t been able to make much progress beyond yesterday’s close. The cryptocurrency hit an intraday high of $7,573.77 in the early hours of the session, but has since pulled back to lower levels. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price was hovering around $7,485, according to data from cryptocurrency tracker Coinmarketcap.\nBitcoin’s rebound has coincided with a larger trend affecting the cryptocurrency market. All major digital coins have enjoyed strong gains over the past 24 hours, with Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and IOTA standing out as double-digit percentage gainers. Other top 10 tokens such as Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), EOS and Stellar (XLM) have risen by at least 7%, outpacing Bitcoin over the 24-hour period. Thanks to the strong performances, the size of the crypto market has increased by over $20 billion to reach $328 billion.\nIn today’s trading, the Bitcoin price stood at $7,485.65, as of 10:30 BST. The digital coin has gained 4.6% in the past 24 hours, Coinmarketcap data shows. The coin’s total market capitalisation currently stands at $127.7 billion, which represents 38.9% of the total value of all crypto assets.\nFor further information on how to buy and trade Bitcoin, see our comprehensive Bitcoin guide.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dimitar bogdanov", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T14:52:42.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "389485010e87c660f6ac5afc8183b494f9bedeec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme1cbYODOn2S5StQnD81v8k-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Time To Sell Alts For Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Time To Sell Alts For Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-30T12:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "389485010e87c660f6ac5afc8183b494f9bedeec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme1cbYODOn2S5StQnD81v8k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Pelunize12", "published": "2018-05-30T12:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "Time To Sell Alts For Bitcoin?", "text": "most of all coins are low now, it's time to buy them\nwhatever you buy, but keep buy coin which has good potential", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T15:19:35.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "99fb84165a9daad01055d8e2ec56a052a364f858", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.HIeiYfnQqtKkoU6TQRJO3aYtuiU2_tbPTCgmo5aaFlU2KD_ZFnrnMQXOEnDrJfEcB6LNatTJn_zyxVOE1sGE_s5qBz9zkFRU-", "site_full": "www.hofprofit.com", "site": "hofprofit.com", "site_section": "http://www.hofprofit.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Hof Profit", "title": "Can your BitCoins buy you a tax-free home in paradise ?", "title_full": "Can your BitCoins buy you a tax-free home in paradise ?", "published": "2018-05-30T12:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "99fb84165a9daad01055d8e2ec56a052a364f858", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.HIeiYfnQqtKkoU6TQRJO3aYtuiU2_tbPTCgmo5aaFlU2KD_ZFnrnMQXOEnDrJfEcB6LNatTJn_zyxVOE1sGE_s5qBz9zkFRU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "lodewijk", "published": "2018-05-30T12:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can your BitCoins buy you a tax-free home in paradise ?", "text": "by lodewijk | May 30, 2018 | currency , innovation , investing , passport | 0 comments\nCentral banks have something against Bitcoin and another cry [to currencies. one country after another prohibits trade, use and so on.
