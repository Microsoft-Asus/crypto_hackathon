Scott, CEO of Outlier Solutions , moderated a panel of experts that spoke about the energy issue as part of a discussion on the topic of proof of work (PoW) vs. proof of stake (PoS).\nScott told Bitcoin Magazine that there was a lot of discussion at the conference about the new energy report in part due to the attention it’s currently receiving in the press.\n“This is an area where there is a spectacular amount of FUD [fear, uncertainty and doubt],” she noted. “This is in part because it’s a nuanced issue that can’t be summed up in simple statements about net energy consumption.\n“I think that part of the reason that Bitcoin has been a ‘target’ in this respect is that there are relatively straightforward calculations in terms of power consumption in conjunction with the underlying value not being well understood or widely accepted. For instance, few people question the utility costs of a bank or ATM, and the energy consumption cannot be calculated in a straightforward way,” she added.\nScott Howard, CEO and co-founder of Toronto-based ePIC Blockchain Technologies , told the conference audience what many there were already saying: that the energy consumption issue is “fake news” and has been oversimplified to suit Bitcoin opponents. High Energy and Environmental Costs of Traditional Fiat and Banking\nTraditional banking and fiat creation have their own high energy costs, noted a number of conference panelists, including Alex Petrov, CIO of Bitfury ; Jan Čapek, CEO of Slush Pool ; Samson Mow, CSO of Blockstream ; and Howard.\nThey talked about the high infrastructure costs, in terms of both energy and the environment, associated with traditional banking systems, including ATMs, security and servers.\n“There are 3.6 million ATMs deployed in the U.S. Each of them are using 7 to 800 watts just in standby mode,” said Petrov. “This alone generates huge numbers of electricity usage, slightly higher than the Bitcoin network.\n“If you add … internal banking systems, CTVs, communicating with other banks, additional protection … you get higher costs than the cost of Bitcoin,” he added.\n“Gold mining consumes enormous energy. Portions of the electricity crypto mining consumes come from power generation and distribution originally built to supply ore and precious metals extraction or processing,” said Howard.\n“Where traditional energy consumers like gold mines really fall down is all the other negative externalities of the ‘wealth’ they create. Gold mining during and after is one of the most toxic and destructive operations on the planet.”\nHoward talked about the use of abandoned industrial sites for Bitcoin mining, like pulp and paper mills that had been closed due to dwindling forestry supplies and increased concerns about energy use and toxic waste pollution.\n“Lots of crypto mines are sitting in old industrial sites with a 100-megawatt transformer sitting next to them,” he said.\nBy way of example, in the Q&A session that followed the panel, one conference participant talked about his mining operation in British Columbia in a partly abandoned manufacturing site where water is pumped through his mine for cooling and then recycled into a warm-water fish farm. Mining Doesn’t Create New Hydro Infrastructure: Power Is Produced Even If Unused\nAfter the panel, Howard reiterated to Bitcoin Magazine what other conference panelists had said: that large energy mega-projects like hydro dams produce electricity whether they’re used or not.\n“To my knowledge, no one has built out any net-new power generation to supply a crypto mine. Power generation stations are major pieces of infrastructure that take years to put in place and in the range of a decade to pay off. Most power generation is done, certainly in the western world, by publicly owned and/or regulated utilities. Those stations run 24/7, 365 for decades. The energy goes onto the grid no matter what and, until we figure out storage, is a perishable commodity.\n“Crypto mining takes full advantage of this, typically sucking up energy at very low prices. The prices are low because the energy can’t find more productive use, often taking over abandoned industrial sites far away from urban centers,” he added.\nČapek told the conference that “China has been overinvesting in hydro power and has large amounts of power that is not being used” as a result of overbuilding hydro dams in anticipation of industrial needs (principally aluminum manufacturing) that never materialized.\n“Cheap hydro power has helped China dominate the world’s Bitcoin mining business, and this power would be generated with or without Bitcoin mining,” said Čapek, who recommended a recently released study on the energy costs of mining in China.\nČapek said a rough estimate of global Bitcoin mining energy use is 25 terawatt hours per year, only a fraction of the amount of energy used in manufacturing aluminum globally. PoW vs. PoS\nThe panelists mostly agreed that proof of work’s higher energy use is necessary for real security and that proof of stake is not likely to happen soon. They noted that PoS would not give the Bitcoin network the security it needs, even if it was more energy efficient.\n“The more energy that’s expended, the more security you have,” noted Mow. “The system has to be nuclear-proof.”\nPetrov defended the possibility of a hybrid model of both PoW and PoS, saying, “Proof of stake may work for some specific purposes, not necessarily in the financial area but inside private blockchains.”\nMow responded that using both PoS and PoW “brings out the worst of both worlds,” while Howard noted that Dash is using a hybrid model with some success, though it’s very expensive to use.\nHoward concluded: “It [Bitcoin mining] is a positive economic activity, typically in places where it is needed, as well as meaningful revenue to the utilities which are major employers and usually profit centers for governments. The ‘waste of energy’ argument, like most establishment arguments against blockchains, does not pass the test of science.”\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .\nBitcoinmagazine.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://slushpool.com/home/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/want-learn-more-about-mining-theres-new-summit/", "https://blog.bitmex.com/mining-incentives-part-2-why-is-china-dominant-in-bitcoin-mining/", "https://bitfury.com/", "https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(18)30177-6", "https://www.outliercanada.com/", "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/", "https://www.epicblockchain.io/", "https://blockstream.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "d. scott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "outlier solutions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin magazine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T00:31:21.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "893027e4a82a20cb224f089bc3ebe98a86804d2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_DHA11VrlMy1RHAKKVE4HSWomSnfzgA6ne6vCbIUrNXu7pAzxIWe1CuLeau7wHUoWcyhYNMzSk8RLi20Wy9JWONq5U8RuubromeUqxzhfQJc.D.0mno4.f7NtfbjIiuo-", "site_full": "bitcoinmagazine.com", "site": "bitcoinmagazine.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinmagazine.com", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Magazine", "title": "First Bitcoin Mining Conference Hashes Over the High Cost of Energy", "title_full": "First Bitcoin Mining Conference Hashes Over the High Cost of Energy", "published": "2018-05-25T23:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 78582, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "893027e4a82a20cb224f089bc3ebe98a86804d2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_DHA11VrlMy1RHAKKVE4HSWomSnfzgA6ne6vCbIUrNXu7pAzxIWe1CuLeau7wHUoWcyhYNMzSk8RLi20Wy9JWONq5U8RuubromeUqxzhfQJc.D.0mno4.f7NtfbjIiuo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jessie Willms", "published": "2018-05-25T23:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "First Bitcoin Mining Conference Hashes Over the High Cost of Energy", "text": "05.25.18 4:27 PM Moderator Amber Scott with panelists Scott Howard, Alex Petrov, Samson Mow and Jan Čapek\nBitcoin mining uses as much electricity as Ireland, and by the end of 2018, the Bitcoin network will be using as much energy as Austria, according to a new report by Alex de Vries of the Experience Center of PwC in the Netherlands.\nBilled as the first serious, peer-reviewed study of energy use in crypto mining, the report has set off alarm bells, adding to current concerns about the impact of future mining energy consumption on environmental issues like climate change.\nAt the first-ever conference for crypto mining, held on May 17, 2018, in New York City, an expert panel hashed out the implications of rapidly growing energy consumption among miners worldwide.\nAmber D.

London Metropiltan Police Featured\nA British hacker has been given a jail term of 10 years and eight months for using phishing attacks to steal financial data from more than 100 companies which he then sold on the dark web.\nIn a statement , cyber crime detectives at London Metropolitan Police said they had seized bitcoin worth about half-a-million pounds (A$881,744) from Grant West who was sentenced at Southwark Crown Court on Friday.\nWest was arrested and charged in September 2017 after an investigation spanning two years which identified him as mainly targeting London-based organisations. He operated under the pseudonym Courvoisier.\nDuring their investigation, officers from the Met's Cyber Crime Unit discovered that West had attacked major companies such as Sainsbury’s, Nectar, Groupon, AO.com, Ladbrokes, Coral Betting, Uber, Vitality, RS Feva Class Association 2017, Asda, the British Cardiovascular Society, Mighty Deals Limited, Truly Experiences Ltd, T Mobile, M R Porter, the Finnish Bitcoin exchange, and Argos.\nThe Met said West had begun selling the data he had stolen in March 2015 and made about 47,000 sales from an online store. Apart from the stolen data, he was also selling marijuana and guides for carrying out online attacks.\nOne of the phishing emails that Grant West sent to try and lure unsuspecting users.\nIn one phishing attack, aimed at the online takeaway service Just Eat, West made a bid to obtain the personal data of 165,000 customers, an effort which cost the company about £200,000, even though it did not lose any data.\nWest used a laptop belonging to his girlfriend, Rachael Brookes, to stage the attacks, and also stored the personal financial information of more than 100,000 people on the machine.\nHe was also found to have regularly used stolen credit cards to pay for his purchases of holidays, food and household goods.\nA listing of stolen passwords and other digital data offered by West for sale on the dark web.\nOfficers found an SD card at West’s home in Kent which contained about 78 million individual usernames and passwords as well as 63,000 credit and debit card details.\nBrookes was given a two-year community order on 2 May.\nDetective Chief Superintendent Mick Gallagher, head of the Met’s Organised Crime Command, said: \"This case illustrates the lengths that our detectives will go to in order to pursue offenders on the dark web.\n\"We will use many different measures to ensure such offenders are identified, prosecuted and their assets are seized.

In a tweet on May 24th, the tech activist and internet security expert listed five cryptos that will experience huge gains in the summer. The tweet also contained some political predictions on U.S. foreign relations.\nBitcoin Will Rise in June and Dip in July According to McAfee, \"Bitcoin will surpass $15,000 in June.\" The controversial crypto proponent, however, predicts that the spike will be short-lived as he said the number one crypto would dip in July.\nMy short term price predictions: in a major dip, with nearly everything dropping, the price of Docademic doubled since my prediction. The market will turn before June 12th and my predictions will hit. My algorithms predicted Trump's June 12th date. They have never been wrong. pic.twitter.com/IGAzWPtOV4\n— John McAfee (@officialmcafee) May 24, 2018\nBitcoin wasn't the only digital currency whose price McAfee predicted. He also said that both Docademic (MTC) and Bezop (BEZ) would reach new highs by the middle of July. McAfee said that MTC, the healthcare platform token recently listed on a few exchanges like HitBTC, would climb to $0.73 in July. Docademic is currently trading at $0.13 .\nAs for BEZ, McAfee predicts that the e-commerce token will reach $0.52 in July, which represents a 300 percent increase from its present pric e of $0.13. Other short-term price tips provided by the ubiquitous crypto loudmouth include Bitcoin Private (BTCP) surpassing $200 before August and EOS rising to $32 by the end of July. McAfee also tipped GNT to rise above the $5 mark before the end of July.\nEOS is currently trading at just under $12. According to a recent Weiss rating report, it is one of the top altcoins on the market. Tom Lee of Fundstrat recently revealed that EOS was the highest rated currency on the misery index. If these predictions are accurate, then EOS will spike by more than 200 percent while GNT and BTCP will surge by 900 percent and 700 percent, respectively, within the next two months.\nMcAfee: A History of Bold Crypto Declarations John McAfee is no stranger to cryptocurrency predictions. He once famously declared that Bitcoin will be worth $500,000 in 2020, a position that he still defends. Earlier in the week, he tweeted about an impending crypto bull rally , urging traders to pay attention to events in the news and \"use their heads.\"\nThere have been some notable developments in the crypto market so far in May. Both cryptocurrency startups like Coinbase and mainstream finance behemoths like Goldman Sachs have launched products targeted at institutional investors.

In retrospect, it is now obvious that smart/institutional money was stocking up before that date. Hindsight is 20/20. Since 12/17/17, Bitcoin has been in a bear market. The remainder of this analysis will focus on patterns observed during this market downturn, as well as signals for when it might come to an end,” the group said.\nIt added that every time the cryptocurrency market experienced a correction, the magnitude of the drop declined, proposing that the large-scale investors had less amounts of bitcoin after driving major corrections. The group emphasized that the cryptocurrency market experienced three major corrections since December 2017 and the two subsequent corrections recorded lower sell volumes.\n“Not only is selling volume lower, but the drops have been less severe. Each component of each leg down is less steep than the previous leg down. RSI, a momentum indicator, also shows selling has been less extreme. The trend is ‘flattening out.’” Source: BitcoinWisdom\nAs seen in the chart above, the initial correction of bitcoin in December led the price of BTC to fall from $19,900 to $6,000, by more than 69 percent. The second correction that occured on March 5 resulted in a drop from $11,800 to $6,500, by around 44.9 percent, and the third correction pushed the price of bitcoin to fall from $10,000 to $7,300, by 27 percent. Validity of the Theory\nIn 2008, CNBC Mad Money host and fund manager Jim Cramer emphasized that it is relatively easy for large-scale investors to manipulate the stock market, which has significantly deeper liquidity than bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market.\n“It’s a fun game and it’s a lucrative game. You could move it up and fade it, that often creates a very negative feel so let’s say you take a longer-term view into your day and I’m going to boost the futures and then when the real sellers come in, they’re going to knock it down and that’s going to create a negative view,” said Cramer.\nCNBC Fast Money host Melissa Lee raised a similar point on May 25 show, as she noted that banks and institutions have colluded to manipulate Libor among other assets, interest rates, and commodities.\nIt is entirely possible that the premise established by the group of cryptocurrency traders is correct and that large-scale investors have in fact manipulated the cryptocurrency market. But, if it has been the futures market that affected the price of bitcoin over the past five months, it is completely legal to do so and it remains unclear whether similar manipulation strategies can be prevented in the long-term.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI", "https://twitter.com/TheCryptoFam/status/999407808041930752", "https://hacked.com/continue-reading"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T01:42:28.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "26f56bfe1bd9daa2fe199d4b853a91ae3ff67609", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZ2kL2LCBF74Na4UTjywzes-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "bitcoin will rise up again ?", "title_full": "bitcoin will rise up again ?", "published": "2018-05-25T22:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.01, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "26f56bfe1bd9daa2fe199d4b853a91ae3ff67609", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZ2kL2LCBF74Na4UTjywzes-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "energycom", "published": "2018-05-25T22:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin will rise up again ?", "text": "Quote: from: robotrobert on May 25, 2018, 11:22:07 AM Quote: from: reda on April 13, 2018, 05:43:26 PM Quote: from: cxt07 on March 14, 2018, 11:37:58 PM I think at some point it will, but in short term I think it will go back into the 3k range. I am out until the market starts to turn some, just going to limit my losses from here on out.\nNow bitcoin price is increase. So if want to sell check the market place. Then you ideas. It any time to increase and down so plan to work and complete the process. It good opportunity for future growth. Time is important for this process so time to sell and time to buy it. Wait for the price increase the sell it. People know the all process. So before start any process. Plan to work.\nThe Bitcoin is rising up again and this is observing in the current market as the market has recovered from 6k dollar to 8.3k dollar. Another Bitcoin increase trend can be better explained from its average price increase per year and we compare the average demands and prices each year. The current stages are favorable and the market will follow the increase trend as the demand is increasing.\nOf course it will rise up again, this happens usually. People lose their hope when the price goes down. Never be like this, price recovery is already there anytime when it's needed.

It is a brand new payment processor of the Bitcoin Cash network. This system allows merchants from Columbia to accept BCH and convert Pesos as and when their need.\nBitek’s business model is considered to be somewhat similar to the Bitpay Service system as it offers BCH based merchant transaction processing, invoicing and accounting services for the convenience of customer management.\nBitek’s Founder, Javier Barrera recently spoke at the Satoshi’s Vision Conference in Tokyo and detailed how his team is integrating BCH into Colombia’s retail market.\nJavier Barrera and Andrés Rivera are the Co-founders of Bitek. Their passion for Bitcoin Cash is explained in an interview with the Latin American Publication, Diariobitcoin. The Co-founders stated:\n“BCH is a better Bitcoin and it is the asset that best fits with the definition and the philosophical line proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto.”\nBarrera and Rivera explain the benefits of Bitek for merchants looking for a BCH payment gateway such as liquidity with a remuneration in Colombian Pesos, protection from cryptocurrency volatility, and accounting.\nAccording to the article posted on the official website of BCH, they say:\n“Bitek plans to launch a marketplace as well that facilitates trades between buyers and sellers and payments made with Bitcoin Cash. Further Bitek has detailed it has been in talks with BCH-based firms such as Centbee and Nchain concerning future collaborations. The startup has also organized BCH meetups on a weekly basis at popular venues like the Revellion Cultu-Bar. Bitcoin Cash supporters seem pleased with another addition to the slew of companies offering BCH infrastructure services.”\nMerchants who are interested in using Biteks services have to register and fill out the information on Biteks website for the facilities related to the payment gateway, deposits in BCH, and conversion to Colombian pesos.\nOn the official twitter handle of BCH they tweeted their Bitek article, caption being:\n“BCH Payment Processor Bitek Allows Colombian Merchants to Convert to Pesos… #bitcoin “\nThe part where the official Twitter handle of BCH uses “#Bitcoin” while they pretend to be Bitcoin and not Bitcoin Cash is one of the major reasons amateur crypto investors have trust issues.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pesos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrés rivera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barrera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diariobitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rivera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "javier barrera", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitpay service", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colombia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tokyo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T04:39:23.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b0394c8b7474cfe4508c012836c906dabf40ee17", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTCV6nS1w2FZFFIeqCtPlkAF98udxKC3VwdcnyUW7c2LqSY3CaXa1Xeg9q.hpUpoWgkEbZvtxQy1AB8kA0LDxFlEuyoVyL7EsnI8.QzhaqOxfQxLf5ihlwl", "site_full": "ledgergazette.com", "site": "ledgergazette.com", "site_section": "http://ledgergazette.com/feed", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "The Ledger Gazette", "title": "Bitcoin Plus Price Down 26.6% Over Last 7 Days (XBC)", "title_full": "Bitcoin Plus Price Down 26.6% Over Last 7 Days (XBC)", "published": "2018-05-25T22:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/cryptocurrencies/293.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b0394c8b7474cfe4508c012836c906dabf40ee17", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTCV6nS1w2FZFFIeqCtPlkAF98udxKC3VwdcnyUW7c2LqSY3CaXa1Xeg9q.hpUpoWgkEbZvtxQy1AB8kA0LDxFlEuyoVyL7EsnI8.QzhaqOxfQxLf5ihlwl", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rob Logan", "published": "2018-05-25T22:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Plus Price Down 26.6% Over Last 7 Days (XBC)", "text": "Posted by Rob Logan on May 25th, 2018 // No Comments\nBitcoin Plus (CURRENCY:XBC) traded 9.3% lower against the US dollar during the 1 day period ending at 15:00 PM E.T. on May 25th.

One is just simply riding on the other.\nNow, it appears, Bautistas position has softened, bringing UnionBank beyond the level of participation of the majority of legacy financial institutions, which have stuck rigidly to Blockchain evangelism.\nThe major exception to date has been Switzerland, where banks have actively offered Bitcoin-based products since 2016 in what has become a highly-supportive environment for cryptocurrency usage.\nsource: http://bitcoinist.com/philippines-unionbank-mines-bitcoin/\nAno sa tingin nyo ang maidudulot nito sa ating bansa at sa pagpapalaganap ng popularidad ng Bitcoin at Blockchain?\nPara sa kin magandang balita ito dahil mismo ang Union bank ay nagmimina so posible na sa darating na panahon pdi na tayong bumili ng BTC o ibang crypto deretso sa Union Bank na mas mura at hindi maxado ang patong kagaya ng sa coins.ph..\nAno sa tingin nyo po? may magandang maidudulot ba to sa ating bansa? o puro batikos nalang ba para sa mga utak ng mga negatibong tao tungkol sa BTC?\nMaganda to sa tingin ko.

But is this realy so, do such claims have any reasonable ground at all?\nTo my opinion the cause for something like that is again ignorance. I think that regulation that is mentioned in many countries is often mixed with centralization which is something that is not natural to Bitcoin because it's functioning totaly different than fiat currencies. Also some warnings to people that Bitcoin is volatile and risky investment that come from national banks are often interpretated as hostile behaviour towards Bitcoin and attempts to make people not to use it.\nIs there any hope that Bitcoin users and governments will find the common language and help Bitcoin together to be more accepted in economy, especialy by businesses and to become more \"legal\" everywhere?\nI think it is very hard for your statement to happen. It is because of different things like the nature of bitcoin which is decentralized while the government wants it to be centralized it so that they can regulate it. Also, banks and other businesses do not want bitcoin to flourish because it might affect their income so they are also pushing the government to regulate it or if can, to ban bitcoin in their country.

(Source: Crypto Coin Spy) It looked like Bitcoin could finally break the 10K line after the Consensus annual event, but the US Justice Department thwarted all bullish plans, triggering a considerable devaluation. In just 5 days, Bitcoin dropped from ~US$8,400 to almost US$7,000 as the DoJ is currently investigating price manipulation schemes pulled by crypto traders. Bitcoin has gone through a rather significant depreciation since the start of this week, dropping from around US$8,400 to somewhere close to US$7,000. While the drop was gradual in the first days, some sudden drops occurred in the last 2 days, when news about the US Justice Department investigating cryptocurrency price manipulation schemes started to permeate the media.It seems like crypto traders borrowed a few tricks from their counterparts working in the traditional securities markets, and, due to the high volatility and unregulated nature of the crypto world, crypto traders are able to pull wild price swings that may benefit small groups, which get organized via Internet chat rooms. Some of these tricks of the trade include spoofing large fake orders in order to trick unaware traders to jack up the price or quick pump-and-dump techniques involving “fake” coins.In regards these “down and dirty” schemes, Bloomberg reports that “the illicit tactics [...] the Justice Department is looking into include spoofing and wash trading — forms of cheating that regulators have spent years trying to root out of futures and equities markets, [...] In spoofing, a trader submits a spate of orders and then cancels them once prices move in a desired direction.

Still, the digital coin market is active like never before, with many ICO s and celebrity endorsements piquing the interest of Wall Street investors.

Reports state that it will look into just about any activities that could affect market prices, in theory.\nPrime examples of this include spoofing or activities like creating bots to fill the exchanges with orders that aren’t even real. “Pump and Dump” groups may be thought of as connected to this because of what Bloomberg’s report says about anything that fraudulently influences market movement being investigated.\nThe Justice Department is working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on this, whom some of you already know as the employer of Chris Giancarlo , who serves as its chairman and doesn’t blindly stand against Cryptocurrencies.\nThe two organizations will use past examples of fraudulent activities in markets like the futures and equities markets, in their current efforts. The only difference will be that everything will be considered, of course, in the decentralized and often anonymous context of the Blockchain world.\nBloomberg even suggested that the investigation could be wider than only Bitcoin and Ethereum and the CFTC as well as the Department of Justice could be keeping further details close, on purpose. All in all, it seems like concrete regulations could finally be coming.\nStill, overall, it’s logical to wonder how much they can actually do. The CFTC reportedly cannot yet fully regulate crypto markets but what it can do is enact sanctions against digital currencies if it proves fraud in any way.

Co-founder and cryptocurrency maverick, Rhett Creighton has leveled a series of remarkable allegations of theft, incompetence, mismanagement, and cover-ups against his former team in a blog post published on May 23, 2018.\nSource: Wikipedia\nCreighton has been engaged in a public feud with the Bitcoin Private team since he was reportedly fired in April 2018. The allegations made by him range from the relatively minor such as incompetence and infighting to severe accusations including mismanagement of Treasury funds, fraud, bribery, and several coverups to prevent information from reaching the BTCP community.\nBitcoin Theft and Coverup Creighton alleges that BTCP Strategy chief, Giuseppe Stuto accidentally paid 5.5 BTC to a developer Jon S. Layton when he intended to pay 0.55 BTC.\nIn a series of screenshots posted showing the conversation between Stuto and Layton, Stuto repeatedly requested Layton to return the 5 BTC overpayment, and Layton shamelessly refused.\nSource: Medium\nCreighton then posts screenshots of a conversation between himself and BTCP Head of Operations Jacob Brutman in response to a tweet where he criticized the team's lack of communication with the community on the subject of being listed on Binance . Brutman responds by saying that Creighton is not helping by publicising their internal problems and that BTCP is not listed on Binance because their lowball offer of 55 BTC was not accepted.\nAs the exchange goes on, Brutman then reveals that the developer stole 5 BTC, which Creighton at that point is not aware of. When pushed by Creighton on whether this will be revealed to the community, Brutman responds, \"We aren't going to show that. For now, it's chalked up as a dev expense. Not sure we want that to be known.\"\n100,000 BTCP Bribe and Fraud Proposal It will be recalled that on May 22, 2018, Creighton tweeted an allegation stating that he was offered a bribe of 100,000 BTCP to enable Stuto and Brutman steal BTCP coins by writing fraudulent commits in the course of a coin burn. Both Stuto and Brutman have publicly denied the allegation, endorsing a tweet stating that Creighton is looking to take revenge on the team for removing him.\nCreighton then shows a series of conversation between Brutman, Stuto, and members of the BTCP community including Hannah Steinke, where both of them attempt to clear their names of Creighton's fraud and bribery allegation.\nContinuous Intent to Defraud Creighton infers that \"several members\" of the BTCP Treasury have an established pattern of fraudulent behavior which they intend to continue as they move on to a new company called Nexus.\nAnother series of screenshots shows conversations between Brutman and community members where he talks about having a non-profit foundation set up in partnership with Nexus.\nCreighton concludes by hinting that there are more allegations to come. He states, \"But wait! There's more! There's much larger fraud that was never disclosed to the community. Maybe Jake and Guiseppe will disclose it now?\"\nThe post Bitcoin Private Founder Rhett Creighton Alleges BTCP Treasury Mismanagement and Fraud appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rhett creighton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "layton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "creighton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stuto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coverup creighton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jon s. layton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giuseppe stuto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btcp treasury mismanagement", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wikipedia creighton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "treasury", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T22:00:08.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a9657b1b960e21a213a7eef487bbaecd050a4885", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTM4DqbEIlMJGbOAEDCu_4I-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why Bitcoin isn't a legit currency.", "title_full": "Why Bitcoin isn't a legit currency.", "published": "2018-05-25T21:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.255, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a9657b1b960e21a213a7eef487bbaecd050a4885", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTM4DqbEIlMJGbOAEDCu_4I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ME12", "published": "2018-05-25T21:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Bitcoin isn't a legit currency.", "text": "The first purchase using bitcoins was in 2009 when someone bought 2 pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins. Today, that would be worth $83,746,850. Many people have started to use Bitcoin and it is now the most popular cryptocurrency in the world. Many countries whose currencies have become hyperinflated have thought about switching their national currency to Bitcoin. For something to be classified as money, it needs to be a good unit of account, medium of exchange, and store of value. Since Bitcoin has become extremely popular, I wanted to explain to investors and Bitcoin users that Bitcoin isn't a legit currency. The main three reasons why Bitcoin isn't a legit currency is because it is a poor unit of account, medium of exchange, and store of value.\n One of the big three parts of a currency is that it is a good unit of account. For something to be a unit of account, people have to be able to compare its price to the prices of alternative retail goods. Since the value of a bitcoin changes so much, it would be hard and confusing for both the consumer and the seller to recalculate the prices every day. Because the value of a bitcoin compared to other currencies changes greatly on a day-to-day basis, retailers that accept the currency have to recalculate prices very frequently, a practice that would be costly to the merchant and confusing to the consumer. This Quote: from David Yermacks article Is Bitcoin a Real Currency? An Economic Appraisal Bitcoin shows why Bitcoin isn't a good unit of account. That is one reason why Bitcoin can't be a form of currency and why Bitcoin isn't a legit currency.\n The second part of something that is classified as a currency is that it is a medium of exchange. A medium of exchange is an intermediary instrument used to facilitate the sale, purchase or trade of goods. Since bitcoin doesn't have any intrinsic value, so its worth is held up by its usefulness as a currency in the consumer economy. The Youtube video Why Do Banks Fear Bitcoin by VisionVictory explains that there is a set amount of Bitcoins and by the year 2140, there will be a total of 21 million bitcoins. Miners have already mined 11.9 million of them, and this means that there is only 9.1 million left. Once all of it is mined, there wont be any more left to be mined. Dollar bills can be printed by the U.S. government if they were needed. Some more reasons why Bitcoins isn't a good medium of exchange are that Bitcoins transactions each take around 10 minutes each, which is very slow compared to using a credit or debit card, which takes a few seconds. Also, Bitcoin transactions can cost around $20, which is extremely expensive. Because of all of these reasons, Bitcoin can't be a good medium of exchange, which is very important if it were to be a legit currency.\n The third and final part of a currency is that it has to be a good store of value. A store of value means that the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time. In the long podcast on Youtube by Paul Vigna & Michael Casey: The Age of Cryptocurrency, they explain what a decentralized currency is. Bitcoin is an atrocious store of value and one of the reasons why is because of its constant hacking attacks and other security problems. This is mostly because Bitcoin is decentralized, which means that there is no central authority that can stop any Bitcoin transaction or any hacking attempts. One of the reasons why Bitcoin is so popular is because people can stay anonymous and make transactions without people knowing who they are. The downside of using a decentralized currency is that people can do illegal things anonymously and get away with it. And also, Bitcoins exchange rate has no correlation at all with any other big currencies like the Dollar, Euro, and Yen. This makes Bitcoin extremely risky to use because it is tethered to any other currencies so its value would change constantly. This shows how terrible of a store of value Bitcoin is and why it cannot be a legit currency.\n Tons of people are jumping on the Bitcoin Bandwagon without doing their own research on it, and theyre going to lose a lot of time and money because of this. They need to realize that Bitcoin is not a legit currency because it fails to be a unit of account, medium of exchange, and a store of value.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T00:10:01.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9a5fee8e39aa95fd0fe32dc4abc638a12b62484e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9Du2bsLQyNj6Pel9mijQue3aCti8nSPL9LurZUNRitJaprlGmKg38ScmgZcEZAdTT1v6hC8jQh0s8PFokvTG3Dt9LcI5f_IkvHz4wW1SUQTE0rAEwphMngeQO4ahJoI8AGsQBW0GhRA--", "site_full": "www.thezimbabwean.co", "site": "thezimbabwean.co", "site_section": "http://www.thezimbabwean.co/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Zimbabwean", "title": "Zimbabwe Court Lifts Central Bank’s Banking Ban on Bitcoin Exchanges", "title_full": "Zimbabwe Court Lifts Central Bank’s Banking Ban on Bitcoin Exchanges", "published": "2018-05-25T21:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CO", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9a5fee8e39aa95fd0fe32dc4abc638a12b62484e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.9Du2bsLQyNj6Pel9mijQue3aCti8nSPL9LurZUNRitJaprlGmKg38ScmgZcEZAdTT1v6hC8jQh0s8PFokvTG3Dt9LcI5f_IkvHz4wW1SUQTE0rAEwphMngeQO4ahJoI8AGsQBW0GhRA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Own Correspondent", "published": "2018-05-25T21:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Zimbabwe Court Lifts Central Bank’s Banking Ban on Bitcoin Exchanges", "text": "Jump to comments Zimbabwe Court Lifts Central Bank’s Banking Ban on Bitcoin Exchanges The Harare High Court has lifted a ban by the central bank which barred all banks and financial institutions from offering services to cryptocurrency exchanges.\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) failed to appear for court proceedings in a case in which Zimbabwe crypto exchange, Golix is seeking reversal of the central bank’s directive that it stop virtual currency trading in the country.\nGolix had applied to the High Court seeking that it reverse the ban instituted by the central bank this month. The RBZ had also banned banks from processing transactions involving crypto-currency trades.\n“The ban was lifted,” Nhlalwenhle Ngwenya, communications manager at Golix told CCN on Thursday afternoon.\nHe said a statement would follow. However, it has emerged that the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe officials, including the governor, John Mangudya, did not turn up for court proceedings. This prompted the High Court in Harare to issue a default ruling that essentially lifted the Zimbabwean central bank’s ban.\n“We are hoping that we can immediately go back to doing business and processing the order book,” said an official.\nGolix had stopped the order book on Thursday as it sought to deal with the disruption to its operations after the central bank ban, the exchange said in a notice to members Thursday morning. A Relief to Crypto Traders\nThe news brought relief to bitcoin and other crypto traders and investors in Zimbabwe who were now unable to trade on an exchange platform. Golix runs an online crypto exchange platform as a well as a bitcoin ATM in central Harare.\n“Where is the party,” proclaimed one trader on Telegram as news of the lifting of the ban spread. “RBZ ban on cryptos lifted by the High Court. Administrative justice is alive and well in this jurisdiction. Section 68 of the Constitution is our best friend,” tweeted lawyer, Fadzai Mahere .\nIn its application against the central bank’s move, Golix said “the ban in effect outlaws and classifies as illegal Applicant’s operations”.\n“The Respondents are in fact purporting to classify the trade in cryptocurrency as illegal,” it added.\nRespondents were cited as the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and central bank governor, John Mangudya.\nGolix further argues in its court application that the decision taken by the central bank to ban it from cryptocurrency trading in the country amounts to “lawmaking, a function that belongs to the legislature” and not the central bank.\nAfter banning banks from processing cryptocurrency transactions in the country, the central bank of Zimbabwe subsequently wrote to Golix last week, ordering it to shut down its operations.\n“All cryptocurrency exchange houses operating in the country, including Bitfinance (Private) Limited (also known as Golix), are required to cease all virtual currency exchange operations,” wrote Norman Mataruke, the central bank’s registrar of banking in a letter to Golix dated May 15.\nMataruke also directed that cryptocurrency exchange platforms in Zimbabwe were “required to take all the necessary steps to close the cryptocurrency accounts or ‘wallets’ of your customers and to make good any funds currently held on behalf of customers” trading and investing virtual currencies.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/advocatemahere/status/999636132047478785", "https://www.ccn.com/zimbabwe-bans-banks-from-all-bitcoin-dealings/", "https://www.ccn.com/zimbabwe-cryptocurrency-exchange-golix-drags-central-bank-to-court-over-trading-ban/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john mangudya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhlalwenhle ngwenya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "golix", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "zimbabwe court lifts central bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zimbabwe court lifts central bank’s banking ban on bitcoin exchanges jump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "high court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reserve bank of zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rbz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "harare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "golix", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T00:52:30.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b70e3969502aca1a348d0abe5d0a90e6a8d0db0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjrDl7Vzcp4e0ArESXtgWna.xNeGbiz_QQjPaKt9YP5JTV8RcNZlaKkE8Q69yZ3lZ.HeVei2hu2enP0Tap82Qdz91az3C1BS02EH7kfnnggOed10xS3CZfAIgeTJSc0PA-", "site_full": "www.fool.com", "site": "fool.com", "site_section": "http://www.fool.com/feeds/index.aspx?id=foolwatch&format=rss2", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "Motley Fool Headlines", "title": "About to Buy Bitcoin?

Don't put all of your chips on the table at once. When it comes to Bitcoin, in most cases, you're betting that the cryptocurrency will go up indefinitely. That's the nature of a bubble when speculators dominate.\nBut what if you had a chance to protect yourself on the downside? You can do it with derivatives, contracts that may pay you if the price of something goes down (and up).\nFor example, the CME Group, which runs one of the largest derivatives exchanges offers futures contracts on the reference price of Bitcoin.\nA visual representation of the digital cryptocurrency Bitcoin. (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)\nA futures contract is an agreement that's linked to a price on a specified date in the future. Let's say you think Bitcoin is going to hit $20,000 by a certain date.\nYou could buy a contract with that \"strike price.\" If Bitcoin hits that target, you make money. If not, you lose what you paid for the contract. You could also hedge if the price goes down.\n\"The new contract will be cash-settled, based on the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR) which serves as a once-a-day reference rate of the U.S. dollar price of bitcoin,\" the CME said in a press release . \"Bitcoin futures will be listed on and subject to the rules of CME.\"\nNote the CME's mention of \"rules.\" That means the exchange is careful about tracking what it calls the \"reference\" price of Bitcoin and making price disclosure transparent. The exchange is also providing free historical price data , so you can see how volatile the cryptopcurrency has been.\nAlthough the blockchain technology behind Bitcoin isn't exactly transparent -- only a few people know exactly how it works or how it originated -- getting an exchange to track the price is a positive development. It means an independent body will be watching how the price is set. While this is no substitute for real regulation, it's a good first step.\nThe CME is also monitoring a \"spot\" price for Bitcoin, which is what the cryptocurrency is worth at any given moment.\nAlthough nearly any investor can get into trouble with derivatives -- they can be caught too long or too short and lose a lot of money -- it's essential that you have a way to protect yourself if the market crashes.\nKeep in mind as with any investment, portfolio diversification is a good move.

CheapAir.com has appeared to choose self-hosted payment processor BTCPay for its Bitcoin payments, shunning industry stalwart BitPay. CheapAir ‘Doing Testing’ With BTCPay According to comments on social media, BTCPay, which offers open-source merchant software, could officially become the new processor for Cheapair after it dropped Coinbase earlier this month. “We had a nice run with Coinbase but they are sun-setting their merchant platform next week,” the company wrote confirming the planned switch May 24. “We’re looking for an alternative and right now are doing some testing with (BTCPay).” Hey hey hey, welcome @CheapAir ! ;) https://t.co/D2Ar1uU6Hi — BTCPay Server (@BtcpayServer) May 25, 2018 Coinbase revealed it was retiring its merchant processing function in April, a move which the cryptocurrency industry condemned for its disruptive consequences. BitPay, a processor which along with Coinbase continues to be arguably the best-known option for Bitcoin payments, appeared to miss out on wooing CheapAir, meanwhile, which has offered Bitcoin since 2014 and was the first ever travel agency world-wide to accept bitcoin. BitPay Wallet Rules Cause Doubts The company had originally sought to transfer to BitPay, but for undisclosed reasons instead opted for the open-source alternative. The crux, as CheapAir highlighted in a statement last month, could be wallet support. “We have had a great experience with (BitPay) so far and our integration is largely complete. But our one giant concern is that Bitpay does not support “non-payment protocol wallets” (wallets that aren’t BIP-70 compliant),” it reads. “So if you do not have a compatible wallet, you would have to get one and use it as an intermediate stage for your Bitcoin payment.” A request for user input fielded sixty responses. Discussing the move, an executive wrote on BTCPay’s Twitter account that “It makes me even happier that they were considering Bitpay at first, but changed their mind. Feedback on BTCPay’s user experience has been positive from both users and industry figures, with Bitcoin Think editor Beautyon commenting CheapAir represented “what a properly run company looks like.” BTCPay has also garnered acclaim from Bitcoin core developer Nicolas Dorier, who told Bitcoinist it held specific advantages over BitPay in December.

In December 2017, regulators in the U.S. greenlit bitcoin futures trading for the CME Group and CBOE Futures Exchange , but since then, no major European exchange has jumped in. Speaking at an industry event in London on May 23, 2018, Jeffrey Tessler, head of clients, products and core markets for Deutsche Boerse, said they are considering offering cryptocurrency products: \"We are deep at work with it.\" Tessler is quoted in Bloomberg confirming that Deutsche Boerse is “not at the same stage” as CME and that they want to make sure that they understand the underlying transaction “which isn’t the easiest thing to do.” Two months ago, Deutsche Boerse announced a plan to work with the financial management firm HQLAX and R3’s Corda blockchain platform to implement a system that can offer more efficient securities settlement via a blockchain. HQLAX and R3 already have a solution for securities lending with a number of large banks, such as ING and Credit Suisse. Tessler added, “Before moving forwards with anything like bitcoin, we want to understand the volatility and make sure clients are in line and make sure regulators are in line.” This article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine . - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hqlax", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tessler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeffrey tessler", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin technology bitcoin magazine 34 frankfurt stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cme group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hqlax", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe futures exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche boerse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boerse ag", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T19:23:42.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0ff14bce42311f56c6e5a9491423c591c38885dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCelT4taRIE3syzUFlo8RnAAbtV5Xwr8AQ8uQy1gRIDm9jtQzTV1KpBm3BE_2mX99LgYK7rPQuYi8fc4Ki6GlB0D3Lk.1px9DjIOAtluaXMZsr.wdT0OCos0vUbxd0ZI3V", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Friday: Luxury Jets, Cheap Air Tickets Now Offered for Bitcoin Cash", "title_full": "Bitcoin in Brief Friday: Luxury Jets, Cheap Air Tickets Now Offered for Bitcoin Cash", "published": "2018-05-25T21:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1527250113_7819737.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0ff14bce42311f56c6e5a9491423c591c38885dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCelT4taRIE3syzUFlo8RnAAbtV5Xwr8AQ8uQy1gRIDm9jtQzTV1KpBm3BE_2mX99LgYK7rPQuYi8fc4Ki6GlB0D3Lk.1px9DjIOAtluaXMZsr.wdT0OCos0vUbxd0ZI3V", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-25T21:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Friday: Luxury Jets, Cheap Air Tickets Now Offered for Bitcoin Cash", "text": "4 hours ago International Bitcoin.com 88 Bitcoin in Brief today features a couple of announcements adding to the growing number of bitcoin cash adoptions. A luxury cryptocurrency concierge now accepts BCH for the items it offers to the crypto rich – a logical step, according to its founder. An online travel agency is introducing three new coins to its payment options, including bitcoin cash, after “a huge uptick in the number of customers requesting alternative currencies”. Also, a cold wallet for institutions hits the market soon. Also read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: Main Street Adopts Bitcoin Ahead of Wall Street Luxury Purveyor White Now Accepts Bitcoin Cash A US-based luxury crypto concierge service is now accepting bitcoin cash (BCH). The White Company, founded by former executive at Formula 1 and LVMH, Elizabeth White, offers high-end products and luxury brands, including fine watches and sports cars. It has become the latest business to take advantage of the benefits of BCH payments, which include substantially lower transaction fees. This business is trying to fill the market niche for services to those rich customers who want to acquire luxurious items, like private jets, Lamborghinis, and famous artworks, in a more discreet way. That’s why the White Company accepts only cryptocurrency. It all started with payments in bitcoin core (BTC), litecoin (LTC) and ethereum (ETH). However, the exponential growth of the business, of crypto wealth, in general, and the growing popularity of bitcoin cash, in particular, have led to the introduction of BCH payments. It comes as a recognition of the lower transaction fees and faster processing times of the bitcoin cash network, in comparison to legacy cryptocurrencies. The New York headquartered company has also decided to discontinue the LTC option. Noting that “trust is vital in this space,” Elizabeth White was quoted as saying: “I have watched with interest both the growth and the early-adopters of bitcoin cash and I can see that the White Company and BCH are natural partners.” And, according to a corporate press release, the partnership represents a logical next step for the development of the business. Cheapair Introduces Payments in Three Cryptos, including BCH Online travel agency Cheapair.com has also announced it is now accepting bitcoin cash for booking flights and hotels. “It’s official!” the California-based company said in a post on Twitter, confirming it has added BCH to the available payment options, along with two other cryptocurrencies – litecoin (LTC) and dash (DASH). “Help us spread the word #cryptocurrency fans!” tweeted the agency, which also accepts bitcoin core (BTC). According to Cheapair , the list of the supported cryptocurrencies has been expanded in response to customer demand. The company noted the development of a number of new cryptocurrencies aimed at avoiding some of the challenges that have emerged with BTC, whose network has previously been stressed by higher transaction volumes. In different ways, bitcoin cash, litecoin and dash all promise improved transaction potential over their predecessor, being either faster or with lower fees attached, Cheapair explained. “Our cryptocurrency customers tend to be very vocal about what they want, something we appreciate very much. Over the last six months, we’ve seen a huge uptick in the number of customers requesting alternative currencies, so we’ve worked hard to integrate the three that were most requested,” Cheapair CEO Jeff Klee commented. Klee added that the company has already streamlined the process of converting the accepted cryptocurrency to fiat money, which is then paid to airline and hotel suppliers. “That made adding litecoin, bitcoin cash, and dash a relatively minor endeavor for our development team, but a huge benefit for our crypto customers,” he said. Bitun Releases Cold Wallet for Institutions An enterprise-level cryptocurrency cold wallet hardware has been displayed at the 2018 Global Summit in Japan this week. Developers at Bitun, a private bank of blockchain assets, claim that their product is different from any traditional cold wallet. It is completely isolated from the internet and employs a military anti-corrosion technique. The hardware CPU adopts the Secure Boot and Efuse mechanisms, combined with data encryption chips, they said. The security level is recognized by licensed exchanges, according to a PRnewswire report, quoting Bitun representatives. The cold wallet also incorporates technologies such as NFC , face and iris recognition, and it’s verified simultaneously with the smart authorized device for signature. The user can also complete the multi-level approval in the signature process on the mobile hotspot APP. The official release of Bitun’s cryptocurrency cold wallet is scheduled for July this year.

He still fully expects that the Bitcoin price will reach $25,000 by the end of the year. Crypto Market Unexpectedly Slips, Falls By Over 7% Tom Lee, known as a “chronic” bull in the cryptocurrency community, reiterated his belief that Bitcoin will hit $25,000 by the end of the year. He has long been the face of the industry as he regularly appears on CNBC segments regarding this growing market, showing up on a weekly basis. His recent announcement during the CNBC Futures Now segment came after a 1% decrease in the price of Bitcoin. However, not even 24 hours after Tom’s Futures Now appearance, Bitcoin dropped by over five percent to under $7,600. This negative price action has wiped out the majority of price gains seen pre-Consensus. However, Bitcoin did not fall as much as altcoins and actually gained market dominance, moving from 37% to 38%. This has been a common theme as altcoin investors tend to jump ship when waters turn murky for the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, the most established cryptocurrency, has further proven itself to be a store of value and a so-called “shelter in the storm” in this emerging market. Battered but Positive, Tom Lee Stands by Price Prediction While Lee was quick to call this surprising drop “typical crypto volatility” in an email sent to CNBC, during his appearance on Futures Now , he recognized three aspects which have assured his bullish price predictions. The first aspect that he mentioned was the cost of the creation of Bitcoin, or in more simple terms, mining. He highlighted the fact that the electricity, equipment, and other assorted costs of mining a Bitcoin is approximately $8,000. However, after yesterday’s drop, he noted that the cost of mining a Bitcoin had dropped to $6,000. Taking into account that the current price of Bitcoin versus the newly lowered cost of mining one, many still see Bitcoin as an undervalued asset. He also noted that he expects an even higher level of institutional involvement to arrive later this year, saying: I think institutional investors have gained a lot of interest, and they haven’t really come into crypto yet because there is still some regulatory uncertainty. Despite the regulatory uncertainty, Lee still expressed his positive attitude, stating: But that sort of ultimate allocation into crypto as an asset class is going to be a powerful reason why Bitcoin rallies. When looking at market statistics, it is clear to see why he still holds positive sentiment despite the over 60% price decrease in Bitcoin since its December highs. In the past 5 months, venture capitalist firms have poured over $1.3 billion dollars into cryptocurrency startups. Take the example of the heavily publicized announcement of Goldman Sachs’ entry into the cryptocurrency industry. The announcement made earlier this year saw the Sachs-backed Circle purchase the Poloniex crypto exchange, with the end result of Circle reaching a valuation of $3 billion. On the surface, a three billion dollar company in a $350 billion industry may seem irrelevant. However, this is just one of the major examples which show that institutional investors and companies are willing to get invested in this industry. If Tom Lee’s expectations become reality, there will be a countless number of investments made in this industry. Finally, to put a cherry on the Bitcoin’s metaphorical top, Tom recognized statistics put together by his market analysis firm, Fundstrat, stating: Historically, 10 days comprise all the performance in any single year of Bitcoin’s price. If history is any indication, that means a run for Bitcoin will happen fast, possibly skyrocketing within a matter of a few days or weeks. Tom Lee put it best saying: So as miserable as it feels holding Bitcoin at $8,000, the move from $8,000 to $25,000 will happen in a handful of days. What do you think of Tom Lee’s expectations and analysis? Do you think he is too hopeful, has just the right amount, or is he actually underestimating the price of cryptocurrencies in the future? We would love to hear what you are thinking, so please let us know in the comments below. Images Courtesy of Shutterstock and Bitcoinist archives.

May 25 2018, 6:15pm Image: Flickr/CollisionConf\nLots of strange things happen at cryptocurrency conferences , but billionaire Tim Draper just put on one of the most bizarre performances in some time at The Next Web conference in Amsterdam on Friday.\nThe first indications that something odd went down at Draper’s talk came when Bloomberg reported that the billionaire investor—who has famously bought up thousands of bitcoins and is a constant booster of the technology—performed what Bloomberg described as a “rap” in the story’s headline. The site’s description of the performance admitted it involved some singing, but stated that Draper had “dropped some rhymes” about Bitcoin. The article did not contain audio or video of the performance.\nAfter viewing video of the performance posted to Twitter , however, I am convinced that this bizarre display is not a rap. It’s barely singing. Really, it is just totally, completely strange.\nTo my ear, it lies somewhere between a schoolteacher reading a book to children very slowly, slam poetry, and frankly just very bad singing. To see if my assessment was on the mark, I asked Noisey Canada editor Jabbari Weekes if this qualified as rap in any way. “I would say this is bad spoken poetry at best, dad karaoke at its very worst,” he answered, so there you go.\nFor all its awkward hoky-ness, though, there is a dark undercurrent here.

That means anyone who bought in at the hype lost big.\nRecently bitcoin has been hovering around $8,400 U.S. dollars, according to Coinbase, an online exchange where anyone can buy or sell digital currencies.\nAnd since the early days, Ether, Litecoin and other digital currencies have joined bitcoin on the exchanges, which track movements in the valuation that can make investors paper millionaires – or big losers – overnight.\nBack in bitcoin’s early days, Chattanooga attorney T.J. Gentle was CEO of Smart Furniture, a venture-backed company that allowed people to customize and order furniture online. Around 2011, he recalls, a customer offered to pay for a $10,000 order in bitcoin.\nSmart Furniture turned it down.\n“I’ve never had the heart to go back and see what that $10,000 in bitcoin in 2011 would be today,” Gentle admits.\nA quick check reveals that the $10,000 order would be worth more than $14 million today. And at the height of bitcoin’s valuation last December, it was worth more than twice as much – about $33.5 million.\nBut while there are “bitcoin ATMs” scattered around the country, it’s still hard to spend digital currencies, although the online retailer overstock.com takes it, as well as some local retailers like the Nashville restaurant Flyte.\nAt a recent Bitcoins & Beer Meetup at Village Pub in East Nashville, half a dozen enthusiasts talked animatedly about the future of cryptocurrency – its prospects for a healthy return, and the future of blockchain technology. All are aware of the risk of putting U.S. dollars into unsecured, speculative currencies.\n“It’s worth learning about and investing in, but only invest long-term what you can afford to lose,” says Lij Shaw, a record producer and engineer. “Because it’s still risky.”\nBut nearly everyone has his eye on the long term. James White , a Meetup regular who bought bitcoin early, says he owns no stock equities and is investing solely in cryptocurrency.\nEddie Davis\n“I’m going long,” he says. “Go long and stay long.”\nCryptocurrency enthusiast Eddie Davis says he believes that while certain coins may come and go, digital currency is here to stay and will be embraced in developing countries where the ability to bank is limited.\n“I think the driver is going to be the lack of financial availability in the Third World, where everybody has a cell phone and nobody has a bank,” he adds.\n“If you want to buy a goat from the next village, now you pay in chickens. One day you’re going to pay in bitcoin or Ether.”\nDavis, who says he was a day trader in the 90s, bought his first digital currency in February, after the crash. He’d been tracking it since last summer.\nHis interest was piqued after a friend offered to pay him for some mechanical work in Ethereum. Now Davis also holds Litecoin and bitcoin, and says that although his portfolio is up about 10 percent, watching his cryptocurrency rise brings other rewards.\n“I put skin in the game to increase my interest and involvement,” Davis explains. “Now that I’m invested in it, the learning means something.”\nThe blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrency is also creating other ways to invest.\nOne couple at the Meetup talked about their plan to build a real estate portfolio by issuing blockchain-enabled security tokens through a crowd sale. Each security token will give the investor a share in an LLC, and proceeds will be used to purchase properties like a $16 million apartment building on Herman Street in Nashville and others in Tennessee cities like Memphis and Chattanooga.\nThe couple, Luis A. del Mazo, Jr. and Tanya Rodriguez , who both work for Benchmark Realty, hopes to raise $10 million to $50 million for their project from individuals both inside and outside the United States. They must be “accredited investors,” with a minimum net worth of $1 million, excluding primary residence, and $200,000 income for each of the past two years.\n“It is a gamble, and that’s why it’s for accredited investors,” del Mazo acknowledges.\n“I think in the future a lot of people are going to do this to raise money for their businesses.”\nCurrently there are some 1,500 digital currencies out there. The best known are bitcoin, bitcoin cash, Ethereum and Litecoin. New currencies are being issued all the time as “tokens” through initial coin offerings (ICOs), often by startup businesses as a way to raise money. Many trade for pennies.\nAs with the real estate token project, ICOs give early investors the possibility of being in on the ground floor of a project that could take off in the future. But ICOs that promise high rates of return could violate Securities and Exchange Commission rules. The SEC is closely monitoring ICOs to protect consumers from fraud and abuse.\nThat’s as it should be, says Gray Sasser, attorney with Frost Brown Todd in Nashville, who advises companies in the area of blockchain and cryptocurrency.\n“There are some truly bad actors in this space … people trying to stand up a token that does absolutely nothing, marketed in a get-rich-quick scheme. Any token that is marketed as something that is going to go up in value very quickly I would steer away from,” Sasser adds.\n“These things should be considered long-term investments because they are usually at an early stage in the project’s lifetime, so to ever receive a return would be a long time in the future, and you should really only be investing in a project that you understand.”\nSign-Up For Our Free Email Edition Get the news first with our daily email Name", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T00:26:27.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "771cf80b61aee717b00817c9cce61fb2a47a1cd7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS_7zgJLo.SVbrHiBI__CyznSpBPJGxRQplUQu9izHdh_Vb.ukR_TOmdSLBGZG.j0wrCmc3Wtz0JR150z2GWqo_LavsQD9l.L48Dp7bPPbU_9na6J9tloinXXF97FSH7vU-", "site_full": "22ticks.com", "site": "22ticks.com", "site_section": "https://22ticks.com/feed", "site_categories": ["mens_health", "health", "womens_health"], "section_title": "22TICKS LIFESTYLE BLOG", "title": "Bitcoin Ethereum Litecoin BCH Technical Analysis Chart 12/19/2017 by ChartGuys.com", "title_full": "Bitcoin Ethereum Litecoin BCH Technical Analysis Chart 12/19/2017 by ChartGuys.com", "published": "2018-05-25T21:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://22ticks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sojwyY.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "771cf80b61aee717b00817c9cce61fb2a47a1cd7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS_7zgJLo.SVbrHiBI__CyznSpBPJGxRQplUQu9izHdh_Vb.ukR_TOmdSLBGZG.j0wrCmc3Wtz0JR150z2GWqo_LavsQD9l.L48Dp7bPPbU_9na6J9tloinXXF97FSH7vU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lifestyle Blog", "published": "2018-05-25T21:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Ethereum Litecoin BCH Technical Analysis Chart 12/19/2017 by ChartGuys.com", "text": "வாயு தொல்லை உணவுகளும் தீர... வாயு தொல்லை உணவுகளும் தீர்வும் - Gas Trouble reason an... 10 views Latest Gold Mangalsutra D...

Those in the know are happy to get involved, but for the general public, the likes of Bitcoin and Etherium still seem futuristic and mysterious. As their popularity continues to skyrocket, more and more companies – including Luno – have started to move into the space.\nLast night, Luno scooped the UK local prize at the Tech5 awards in Amsterdam (part of The Next Web conference) for its remarkable growth, and came second overall. We caught up with head of product design Lana Glass to find out how they went about designing an app that appealed to the masses.\nIn basic terms, what is Luno? Luno makes it safe and easy for people to buy, store, use and learn about digital currencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. Users download the Luno app or go to the website, create an account, deposit money from their bank account into their Luno Wallet and buy some Bitcoin or Ethereum. Luno also allows you to send and receive digital currencies, monitor the price, set price alerts and place orders on our Exchange. In the long run, our vision is to upgrade the world to a better financial system.\nWhat are your main aims with the design of the product? In early 2017 we underwent a rebrand from BitX to Luno. Most Bitcoin companies have very technical names and BitX was no different. The price of Bitcoin was increasing, our customer base was growing and changing, and our app and website needed to reflect the changes we made in our brand.\nWe wanted to create a friendly, trustworthy, engaging app. One of the first steps was to unify our three platforms - web, Android and iOS - as we needed to make sure that the user experience and offering were the same on each platform. By creating a design system we were able to stay as close to native patterns and elements as possible, while still making each platform look and feel like Luno.\nTell us a bit about your UX aims... As digital currencies are still so new, and a little scary to most people, our main focus is to convey familiarity and build trust with our customers. As we grow across markets we are focusing on localising our products so that customers have the easiest journey possible into this new financial system. This includes translating our apps into multiple European languages, testing how different demographics and regions respond to the illustrations we use and conducting usability tests with potential customers on the ground.\nDigital currencies are still seen as quite a futuristic, techy thing by the general public. How did you tackle this in your design? This is definitely a concern for us. There is still a lot of negativity around digital currencies and a lot of speculation and untruths. Our challenge is to separate the facts from the fiction. There are a few things we can do to build trust with our customers, including using familiar UX patterns, our choice of colour palette, and the illustrations we use and where we use them.\nWe also understand that we have a social responsibility to educate our customers about this new financial landscape, as well as stakeholders, investors, banks and regulators, and bring this understanding with us when designing product changes or new features.\nWhat web technologies Luno is based on… Our mobile-first, responsive web platform uses mostly AngularJS, Typescript and some jQuery for coding the web frontend. We use Grunt as a build tool and Sass for our stylesheet, with Git for version control and Lighthouse for performance.\nWe also have two native apps. On iOS we prefer not to use external libraries, meaning the base tech is all Apple. We migrated to Swift at the end of 2016 as the rebrand allowed us to review parts of our app that hadn’t had some love in a while. We have a few fans of Material Design in the office and we try to stay as close as possible to the great design system that Google has built for Android, without losing our brand voice.\nWe are quite excited about the recent updates to Material Design that were announced at this years I/O and look forward to seeing how Material Theming can help us balance familiarity with personality.\nLuno came second in the Tech5 awards, in recognition of how fast the company has grown. Did such rapid growth raise any design problems? The redesign from BitX to Luno happened in three months from the first announcement to the company to the day the apps went live on the app stores. That includes CI, branding, marketing, website changes and updates to the mobile applications. With such a short turnaround time we were less focused on systems and processes and just wanted to get the best product shipped as soon as possible.\nThis means that when we had time to catch our breath, the design team had a bit of work to do to collate libraries, clean up UI elements, make sure that the user experience was consistent and appealing, and create a design system that we can rely on for years to come.\nRead more:\nHow to make an app Trends that will shape app design in 2018 How to use animation in mobile apps ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lana glass", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luno", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "amsterdam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T21:21:44.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f0507b0234718e8151e8b1f7d00d764d584afe84", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSaMU5e985FKloqYuGazzexM6XEMoqVA3ehxlg.igmjIBVq4nX4C7e_Nmhl7xcaP54gPqOT3IIWCNmG8z7cZq88UjDIJBhHf_T668HDYpFAuG0PYemEiUPOA--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "r/CryptoMarkets", "title": "German Stock Exchange Could Offer Bitcoin (BTC) Futures", "title_full": "German Stock Exchange Could Offer Bitcoin (BTC) Futures : CryptoMarkets", "published": "2018-05-25T21:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.522, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f0507b0234718e8151e8b1f7d00d764d584afe84", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSaMU5e985FKloqYuGazzexM6XEMoqVA3ehxlg.igmjIBVq4nX4C7e_Nmhl7xcaP54gPqOT3IIWCNmG8z7cZq88UjDIJBhHf_T668HDYpFAuG0PYemEiUPOA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "OptimalTwo", "published": "2018-05-25T21:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "German Stock Exchange Could Offer Bitcoin (BTC) Futures", "text": "submitted by /u/OptimalTwo\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.merkle.press/2018/05/german-stock-exchange-could-offer.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T17:14:23.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3fbc821cd358573de064b29e4588646cd4b41d7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRzHGBq.LXaz51VwizU.OPTn21H8X41WIxc82I6zm8UeBrQzAm6w3T_GETB60OcMRTLasPIAeySpSRsbAn9KeESmqZM83k6wH8oQGwsE3SVqYLnGB1ElDVxnMOVeKZduphw_7QE6rp2rQ--", "site_full": "www.sfgate.com", "site": "sfgate.com", "site_section": "https://www.sfgate.com/rss/feed/Tech-News-449.php", "site_categories": ["media", "social"], "section_title": "Tech News", "title": "London police seize bitcoin worth $667,000 from hacker", "title_full": "London police seize bitcoin worth $667,000 from hacker -
