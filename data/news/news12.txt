Spread over 250,000 square meters, the metropolis is home to over 450 pending crypto-merchant establishments. At least, this is the view of the AI commerce platform Eligma who is in the process of testing its cryptocurrency payment product EliPay. Slovenian Prime Minister Dr Miro Cerar visited Ljubljana to inaugurate the Beyond 4.0 international conference on the digitization of society and blockchain . Prime Minister Buys Crypto Coffee\nLocal authorities gave the Prime Minister a tour of the city and before introducing him to the cryptocurrency payment system being developed by Eligma for stores in the region. Once fully operational, EliPay will allow BTC City’s 21 million annual visitors to pay with digital currencies of various types.\nThe Eligma team first explained their product’s functionality to Dr. Cerar who’s staff then went on to purchase a cup of coffee from a local cafeteria. State Secretary Tadej Slapnik made the purchase in cryptocurrency using EliPay. An official press release issued by BTC City said ,\n“The development of BTC City into a Bitcoin City is an important step towards the realization of BTC’s openness-oriented strategy, providing its customers and business partners with freedom and choice regarding their purchases with new forms of payment.” Bitcoin as a Payment Option\nThe city was originally founded as a location for warehouse companies to expand operations in 1954. In 1975, the company operating the warehouses became the largest goods and transport center in erstwhile Yugoslavia and changed its name to Blagovno Trgovinski Center. The name BTC City was born as an acronym for the city, which is three kilometers away from the Ljubljana’s center town.

You are still going to learn something valuable by reading this article.\nHere’s a newsflash for you….\nBitcoin and gold or silver are not mutually exclusive. You can and probably should like them all. Or at least buy them all. I’ve been buying gold and silver for fifteen years. I’ve been buying bitcoin since it was $50 a coin. And I’m still buying both.\nBut it is interesting to see how triggered some people get when discussing bitcoin and precious metals. You’d think you were talking politics. The debates on which is better can get really vicious and or delusional.\nJim Rickards and Peter Schiff hate the bitcoin and love gold and silver.\nHunter Riley III and David Morgan love the gold, silver and bitcoin.\nI’m not exactly sure where Andy Schectman and the Miles Franklin team stand. Probably somewhere in the middle.\nI do know that they will gladly take your bitcoin and sell you some gold.\nEither way, I’m writing this article so I get the last word and here it is….\nRead it and weep, Rickards.\nStop wasting your time and tears.\nCryptocurrencies and precious metals are all here to stay and will become even more popular and expensive or valuable once the idiots in charge of our governments have too many plates to spin.\nSo….\nLearn to love them both.\nLearn how to buy them both.\nLearn how to safely and secretly store them both.\nAs always, please share this article on your Facebook or Twitter pages or send it to a friend because it helps me gain more smart readers like you.\nOk.\nNow let’s get into it….\nBULLETPROOF BITCOIN STORAGE SYSTEM\nAs you probably know, a bitcoin is not an actual coin, it is more like a sophisticated piece of computer code. And there are many different ways to store bitcoin on the internets, your computer, mobile phone or even a piece of paper.\nAnd since all of this bitcoin cryptocurrency stuff has something to do with computers and the internet, you know what that means, don’t you?\nIt means your bitcoin can usually be hacked!\nWell, your actual bitcoin can’t really be hacked, unless something known as a 51% attack happens, but you can be hacked and your bitcoin can be pretty easily stolen from you if you do not follow proper secure storage protocol.\nThere are many different ways to store your bitcoin.\nMost of the methods for storing bitcoin are referred to as using some type of “wallet”.\nTo be quick, you have the option of storing your bitcoin in a hot storage wallet or a cold storage wallet.\nWhen you keep your bitcoin in a hot wallet, you are keeping it in storage that is directly connected to the internet. Examples of a hot wallet are the Exodus.io software wallet or the Coinbase online exchange storage wallet . These are not “bad” wallets, I use both of these wallets for storage of crypto and bitcoin but I do not keep the bulk of my bitcoin stored in any kind of online or “hot” wallet as this leaves you vulnerable to third party risk, confiscation or a hack. Just consider hot wallets as your cryptocurrency checking account. Exodus happens to be my favorite wallet for my cryptocurrency checking account.\nSo where do I keep most of my bitcoin?\nIn a cold storage wallet.\nA cold storage wallet is an offline wallet that does not have an active connection to the internet.\nA cold storage wallet can be a “paper wallet” or a “hardware wallet”. A paper wallet is where you basically just print out your public and private bitcoin keys on to a piece of paper and store it in a safe with your gold and silver. A cold storage hardware wallet is more like a detachable USB drive that you can fit your billions of dollars worth of bitcoin in as easily as songs on your iphone.\nMy favorite cold storage hardware wallet is called a Trezor. This unique wallet does not have an active connection to the internet and never exposes your private keys to the internet which means that your bitcoin is safe from hackers and stays only in your possession. You can load billions of dollars worth of bitcoin onto this usb-like device and store it in a safe with all your gold and silver.\nNow on to the gold and silver. Let’s talk about the…..\nMILES FRANKLIN FULLY SEGREGATED AND SECURE OFFSHORE STORAGE SYSTEM\nOne of the best ways to store your precious metals is using what is known as fully segregated and secure offshore storage.\nI can just hear you thinking….\nHunter, what the hell is fully segregated and secure offshore storage and why do I need it?\nWell smart reader, as you probably know, you have to be very careful when storing your gold, silver or other precious metals with another party.\nIn some cases, if the company storing your metals goes bankrupt and your metals are on their balance sheet, your metals can be taken and a bankruptcy court may only give you back a fraction of what your precious metals are worth because you are considered a general creditor to the company.\nIn other cases, the company who says they are storing your metals can lend them out or even worse, say they bought and are storing your precious metals but never actually buy them as Morgan Stanley did in 2007. The sneaky bastards still charged their customers storage fees for storing this ghost metal.\nThose are just a couple of the land mines you’ve got to avoid when storing your gold and silver and some pretty frickin good reasons to use the fully segregated and secure offshore storage system provided by Miles Franklin.\nThe “fully segregated” in the Miles Franklin fully segregated and secure offshore storage system means that your gold and silver is counted and verified under a recording video camera and titled in your name. After your precious metal is counted and titled, your metal is sealed in a secure container and stamped with your name and account number.\nThis means your silver and gold are not “commingled” with other customers metals as they are in many other storage facilities. Your precious metals are titled and stored separately from all other holders which leaves no chance anyone will have access to them but you. And for insurance purposes, there is a verified record of the exact precious metals you are securing.\nIn the Miles Franklin fully segregated and secure storage system, your precious metals are insured, with vault services provided by Brink’s Canada. And unlike other precious metals storage joints, the metals are not an asset of Miles Franklin or Brink’s and cannot be subject to the claims of any creditor of the two companies. This means the metals are considered your managed assets, and are not listed on the books or balance sheets of Miles Franklin. So if either Miles or Brinks was ever to go bankrupt, the bankruptcy courts have zero claim to your metal. In addition to all this good stuff, your gold and silver are audited on a yearly basis by both Miles Franklin and the independent auditing services of Inspectorate America Corporation for their extra safety and assurance.\nHere’s How the Miles Franklin Fully Segregated and Secure Offshore Storage System Works…\nSTEP ONE: Buy some gold and silver from Miles Franklin. Just give them a call at 1-800-822-8080 and tell them the world famous Hunter Riley III sent you. They will then ship your metals to storage using Brink’s Global Services. Of course, if you already have a war chest of precious metal in your possession you can personally drop off or ship directly to their segregated storage facility. Start the process at the Miles Franklin precious metals storage website here http://preciousmetalstorage.net/ or call 1-877-685-4705\nYou’ll have to fill out some paperwork and client agreements.\nSTEP TWO: Once your gold and silver arrives at the Brink’s Canada precious metals storage facility, they are counted and verified under recorded camera and titled in your name and account number. Then your metal is placed into a super grey security box with a tamper-proof pull tight security seal. Your name, seal number and account number are stamped on the box and added to the computer system.\nIn a few days, you’ll be mailed your Miles Franklin and Brink’s inventory certificate with all the above information.\nBam.\nYour gold and silver is now super secure, segregated and fully insured.\nBut Hunter, what do you like best about the Miles Franklin Fully Segregated and Secure Offshore Storage System that makes it stick out from any other similar storage system in the world?\nSuch a smart reader. I’m glad you asked.\nONE: PROTECTED BY YOUR OWN PRIVATE ARMY. Miles Franklin utilizes vault services provided by Brink’s Canada to secure and store your precious metals. Brinks was founded in Chicago in 1859 so they’ve seen it all, know their stuff and they have that badass Chicago attitude. Brink’s is probably the most respected, sophisticated and experienced precious metals protector in the world. Your metals are housed in their state of the art storage facilities and protected by a private armed security force.\nTWO: YOU SEE STORAGE. Unlike other storage facilities, you can actually visit, check up on and see your metals in storage once a month if you would like. This is an ultra-transparent segregated storage system that you can monitor with your own eyes as well as receive yearly audits from two separate companies.\nTHREE: OFFSHORE STORAGE IN CANADA. The late comedian Robin Williams always said Canada was like a loft above a really great party. Now depending on what you are looking at, he may have a point, but I happen to love Canada as a financially and socially stable safe haven country to offshore some of my gold and silver. Storing your bullion in Canada will allow you to avoid any attempts at confiscation in the USA. Yes, I know that is a long shot, so what else is it good for? Unlike the USA, Canada has very few capital controls which means at any time you can ship your precious metals to locations across the world without facing extra hassle or scrutiny in shipping metal from the USA. It also adds an extra degree of separation between your gold and the banking/financial system in the USA.\nSo if you’ve already read the #1 best selling book in the entire world on gold and silver, Stack Silver Get Gold , you’ll know that there is a three part “store and secure” plan in the book for guarding your precious metals.

Warhol's Fourteen Small Electric Chairs , which is currently valued at £4.2m, will be auctioned on 20 June as digital certificates that can be purchased using bitcoin , ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. This will allow investors to buy a fraction of the iconic artwork, meaning \"anyone can own a Warhol\", according to the art gallery Maecenas. The gallery, which states its aim as \"democratising access to fine art\", partnered with Mayfair-based cryptocurrency broker Dadiani Syndicate in order to stage the auction. \"For the first time ever, high-value, blue-chip art works will be available for everybody to own – utilising the unique technology platform developed by Maecenas, you can now own a piece of history,\" said Eleesa Dadiani, founder of Dadiani Syndicate. \"This is not a divisive strategy, but a win-win for all... [We] look forward to the resulting evolution of the world of fine art.\" Fourteen Small Electric Chairs is part of Warhol's 1980 Reversals series and is regarded as one of the pop artist's most hard-hitting pieces. Fourteen Small Electric Chairs is part of Andy Warhol’s 1980 Reversals series – a postmodern reworking of his iconic 1960s Death and Disaster Series (Maecenas) More The sale of the piece in this way is part of a growing trend of tokenisation , whereby the rights to real-world assets are placed on an online ledger known as a blockchain – the same underlying technology of bitcoin.

This blockchain based platform allows consumers to share their mobility data to earn rewards in the form of MOV tokens that can be used to buy services or pay their next petrol bill.\nJune 7th, 2018. Hong Kong. Moveco is pleased to formally introduce its game-changing ecosystem that will help to push forward the mobility industry as a whole. With the launch of this blockchain-based platform, consumers will now be able to contribute towards technology advancement whilst turning their miles into rewards and discounts. This new opportunity could significantly offset car ownership and travel costs for consumers around the world. At the same time, by making use of car generated data provided by the consumers; Moveco will pave the way for building safer, more convenient, efficient and affordable vehicles and new mobility services for the future.\nAbout Moveco\nMoveco is a blockchain-powered mobility ecosystem that turns miles into rewards. Users can positively contribute to the future of mobility and earn MOV tokens by sharing their mobility data to help with urban planning or to build the next generation of autonomous vehicles.\nMobility is a term that represents the ability to travel between two points, regardless of mode or purpose. The landscape is changing rapidly and the new mobility vertical is pointed toward a future of vehicles that are shared, autonomous, and electric. Data from vehicles generated today will play a crucial role in getting us to that future and developing the mobility services within it. Moveco, through fostering the ecosystem and maintaining a transparent platform, removes the friction from value exchanges between consumers and businesses of all kinds. It exists to bind all stakeholders of our transportation future together. Data flows freely into the Moveco platform and rewards are automatically, and fairly, assigned to the source. Globally-acclaimed management consulting firm McKinsey & Co. estimates that the worldwide market for this car generated data will be valued at $450 to $750 billion by 2030.\nThe Community\nMoveco community members will earn the platform’s proprietary MOV utility tokens according to the miles they move and share. These tokens can be used on goods, services and experiences on the Moveco Redemption Platform or with the loyalty partners of Moveco. Utilizing blockchain technology, Moveco loyalty program and redemption zone will allow MOV tokens to be exchanged for discounts on gas, parking, car washes, and lots of other things.\nMoveco started its journey as a telematics solutions provider dedicated to improving the ease of car sharing through technology. The company’s latest products Drivebox and Drivebox Lite are capable of reading sensor data, tracking routes, and interpretation of driving behavior. The use of blockchain technology will now allow secure and anonymous sharing and monetization of driving information.\nIn terms of its concept, Moveco can be referred to as the mobility industry equivalent of Sweatcoin, a blockchain-based fitness app that rewards users for the number of steps they make. In case of Moveco, the rewards can be earned by driving, using mobility services, or simply walking.\nLawrence Hui, Founder of Moveco said:\n“Moveco believes car generated data is important to drive the future of mobility. We, however, also believe that consumers should be rewarded for the data shared,”\nLawrence Hui went on to state:\n“We look to create a win-win situation, in which car generated data can be collected while consumers are rewarded.”\nMoveco recently joined MOBI ( Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative ), a new consortium formed to discover how blockchain technology can make transportation safer, more affordable and more widely accessible. MOBI is working with companies that account for over 70 percent of global vehicle production market share. Partners of the consortium include BMW, Bosch, Ford, General Motors, Renault, ZF and more.\nVisit the Website: https://moveco.io/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://moveco.io/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "moveco", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "moveco", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T22:34:51.058+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7501d20bbf4dd08e1e169e0ad1d8f1c45b26c480", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8IE6xd4TwJMY49PE_5xSLohufno0NAHgMeBS1A6XvXCFikCyStFH0KijA1Nj6iFYpBiT0WDZY1p8n2P.EK0djJQG.vMUMggeI-", "site_full": "www.dl4all.ws", "site": "dl4all.ws", "site_section": "http://www.dl4all.ws/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Download For All", "title": "Bitcoin Trading Strategy", "title_full": "Bitcoin Trading Strategy", "published": "2018-06-07T21:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "WS", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 79227, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7501d20bbf4dd08e1e169e0ad1d8f1c45b26c480", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8IE6xd4TwJMY49PE_5xSLohufno0NAHgMeBS1A6XvXCFikCyStFH0KijA1Nj6iFYpBiT0WDZY1p8n2P.EK0djJQG.vMUMggeI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "LeeAndro", "published": "2018-06-07T21:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Trading Strategy", "text": "MP4 | Video: AVC 1280x720 | Audio: AAC 44KHz 2ch | Duration: 1 Hours | Lec: 13 | 241 MB Genre: eLearning | Language: English The Shortest, Simplest and Most Practical Bitcoin Course OnlineMore About The Cryptocurrency Trading CourseWhy Now is the Best Time to Start Trading Cryptocurrencies?2) Cryptocurrencies are a free market in which everyone can participate.

Alan Cohn, Of Counsel at Steptoe & Johnson\nYet, having assets with multiple classifications isn’t anything new, Nallengara reminded the audience. We have seen this with security-based swaps , for instance. “This is not a new environment, but it adds to the confusion,” he said. “While we are seeing more coordination, that chapter hasn’t been written yet.” Clarity is at an Enormous Premium\n“We have a new asset class now and a new opportunity to come to some integration,” Cohn said. In addition to the above-mentioned classifications, let us not forget that other entities are considering how to view cryptocurrencies, including the Office of the Comptroller and the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission (FDIC); and what specific laws apply, such as state money transmission-specific laws, state cryptocurrency-specific laws and even state governments’ taxation laws.\n“It’s all over the place,” Cohn said. “But at the end of day, the interest of consumer protection and market integrity are the things most important to the regulators. Therefore, clarity is at an enormous premium.”\nThe market will continue to grapple with how to categorize virtual currencies for the foreseeable future, the panelists agreed. While this space fluctuates, with some countries outright banning cryptocurrencies, the US is still coming to terms with it. However, conflicting regulatory standards have been a part of the history of the currency supply in our country, and lack of clarity is all a part of learning something new.\n“There should be messiness in this space,” Nallengara noted. “My concern is that regulators won’t appreciate that.” Want to stay up-to-date on our thought leadership pieces and other topics such as anti-money laundering and fraud?

Reportedly, companies such as Cumberland , DRW's cryptocurrency arm, even conduct bitcoin trading via Skype.\nLarge Trades not a Novelty\nIn stark contrast, Jump Trading's electronic platform allows users to execute and place large cryptocurrency trades directly with counterparties. Additionally, the desktop interface ensures that external trading exchanges have no intervention in the trade.\nThe investment house is famous for its High Frequency Trading ( HFT ), which utilizes advanced quant algorithms to perform thousands of trades per second in the traditional markets. In addition, the company claims to be developing a \"lower frequency trading strategy,\" but has not released any public information on the latter.\nIndustry observers believe that Jump is serious about its cryptocurrency ventures, besides propagating the fact that voice-based platforms are not the best bet for place trades. Such techniques can easily be tapped and lead to the compromise of sensitive information.\n( Source : Glassdoor )\nCryptocurrency Market Much like FX John Spallanzani, a former FX trader at Sumitomo Mitsui , believes that the cryptocurrency market is maturing similarly to the multi-trillion dollar foreign-exchange market. In the latter's salad days, the market conducted trades exclusively over the phone, adding that his company \"used to call 20 banks at once for spot FX prices in the 1990s.\"\nThe cryptocurrency industry has experienced the rise of many OTC desks in recent times. Popular cryptocurrency exchange Kraken set up an OTC desk in 2017 in New York, while Coinbase launched block trading in May 2018.\nMore to this point, several cryptocurrency-focused investment funds are also opening up at breakneck speed. As per research , over 61 such funds have launched in 2018 alone, with the global total at 366. However, the crypto-specific hedge funds only handle $5 billion: a drop in the financial ocean for traditional hedge funds with trillions of dollars under management.\nThe post Bitcoin Market Maturing as OTC Firms Move to Digital, Finds Report appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "digital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skype", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drw", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cumberland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T21:08:45.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1c29015c49f09308bab559b37993d915c51b2a94", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRtobkJLKSDqtxqPQHHpyoCgmHF6qZU4yc11eUrCb8BFdUjJ_gRyW5pM1kRkGbrujqIRIB2E2oP5oE2QTjgMIml1zT7hAUgDqgdcUkFXABPoxDmW7TLeezt63F9rShkwN1tD26h.NZa7z1J.8ZHnKpV", "site_full": "www.youbrandinc.com", "site": "youbrandinc.com", "site_section": "http://www.youbrandinc.com/feed", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "You Brand, Inc.", "title": "Bitcoin price: Will BTC rise today?

Escape will cancel and close the window.\nYesterday, bitcoin saw a fall of $84.11, or 1.12 percent, as it was trading at $7,403 following its 300th death anniversary. The cryptocurrency suffered its 62nd death this year alone and lost a value of more than $2,600 since its 200th death in December last year. If it continues this way, bitcoin could fall below $7,000 in the coming days. This morning, at the time of writing, it is worth $7,699 – up from around $6,500 in early April, according to Coinable exchange. However, there are a lot of new developments happening in the bitcoin community in the near future which could change the coin’s dull trajectory. A new feature of batching will start to gather many transactions into a single transaction by adding numerous outputs per unit. Using new features by Schnorr Signatures, the unlocking script would have only one signature representing multi-signature transactions of each participant’s signature. Atomic swaps will also allow for some cryptocurrencies (based on the language script, such as bitcoin, Litecoin, Vertcoin) to be exchanged between each other automatically. Despite facing its 300th death, bitcoin is still being regarded as a game-changing currency with a lot of potential. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is the latest to hail the currency, saying: “There’s still a lot of skepticism and a lot of debate and a lot of fights. But that’s where the magic happens, where creativity happens.” However, Forbes states bitcoin is “anything but immune” to government power due to dependence on electricity.With the current trajectory predicting that bitcoin mining will only become more difficult, increased costs and energy usage means the token could struggle to keep its value. LiteCoin is going down with the market dip Bitcoin users claim that the decentralised currency cannot be shut down by the government, but increased energy consumption coming from mining farms could change this. Without electricity and computer power, bitcoin would not be possible to produce, and the government ultimately provides electricity. These factors mean that BTC’s standing remains unclear.

Chanos believes that as bull markets in the crypto industry keep advancing, there will be a rise in the number of questionable blockchain and crypto companies. Food Would Be Better Than Bitcoin In Worst-Case Scenario Chanos is most famous for having predicted the fall of American energy giant Enron Corporation before it filed for bankruptcy in 2001. When asked to share his thoughts on cryptos, Chanos minced no words as he tore into cryptos, terming them a libertarian fantasy. While he has no doubt that the fiat currencies which Bitcoin seeks to replace could one day bring the world to its knees, Bitcoin is still the last thing he’d want to own if the grid went down. And what is Bitcoin good for? Bitcoin is still the area for people who are trying to avoid taxation or other examinations of their transactions. That’s one thing where I think it probably still has utility, but the governments have figured that out. Crypto enthusiasts hail the blockchain and cryptos as revolutionary, yet these proponents still turn to old technology, Chanos claims. Giving an example of an early crypto enthusiast who made money from crypto trading in 2017 but was still using a fax machine to cash in on his earnings, Chanos reiterated his belief that cryptos were nothing but a security speculation which is touted as a technological breakthrough that will transform the current monetary system. Someone at Grant’s interest rate conference recently said that it was as if we had intentionally created a “monetary Somalia.” The crypto craze of the past year fits the classic fraud cycle, the man who also teaches a course on financial fraud at Yale University stated. In the cycle, people’s caution and skepticism gradually fade away as the financial markets improve, and they begin to invest in projects they ordinarily wouldn’t have. This makes it easier for fraudsters to carry out their activities. Once the financial cycle dies down, those fraudsters become easy to spot. Chanos also believes that cryptos would work the least in a worst-case scenario, contrary to many people’s belief. Many crypto enthusiasts believe that a fiat apocalypse is on its way and that cryptos will save the day, but they would not – especially not as a store of value. Food would work the best! Chanos echoed the sentiments of fellow economist and renowned crypto skeptic Nouriel Roubini. Roubini has vocally expressed his skepticism on as many platforms as have been available to him. A favorite at many financial industry discussion panels, he has referred to cryptos as the biggest bubble in human history and a “colossal pump and dump scheme.” Roubini has also called out crypto projects, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum, for claiming that they are decentralized while the mining of these digital assets is controlled by big companies that can afford expensive mining equipment. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jim chanos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james “jim” chanos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chanos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enron corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institute for new economic thinking", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "better than bitcoin in worst-case scenario chanos", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T18:53:47.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "be8556368af9a20bbaaed985188c2a9ae3946933", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fChZtlgO1L3PyFImmOJr7v6TSawQSQ2An94JHU4R0eboj32tKnkS8cZeieWUDiMjte_suCDM6UQyMwSCUxATMlEcMERI_DNFSDmrGxyQKbiQwT4hDNptQq6Q--", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: New Tech and a Quick Way to Make a Fortune in Crypto", "title_full": "Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: New Tech and a Quick Way to Make a Fortune in Crypto", "published": "2018-06-07T20:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1528376914_10272539.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "be8556368af9a20bbaaed985188c2a9ae3946933", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fChZtlgO1L3PyFImmOJr7v6TSawQSQ2An94JHU4R0eboj32tKnkS8cZeieWUDiMjte_suCDM6UQyMwSCUxATMlEcMERI_DNFSDmrGxyQKbiQwT4hDNptQq6Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-07T20:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: New Tech and a Quick Way to Make a Fortune in Crypto", "text": "2 hours ago International Bitcoin.com 45 The most important thing about bitcoin is the new freedom-enhancing innovations that the technology enables, but we know that’s not what everyone is looking for these days.

Sure they are all just bug-ridden trash, other than the outright scams. So why not make money off of that? Guido Vranken, a software security auditor (white-hat hacker) from the Netherlands, has earned a cool $120,000 in just one week of hunting for bugs on the EOS code. He reported 12 vulnerabilities, for $10,000 each. As the EOS ICO brought in a whopping $4 billion, and evidently no shortage of bugs, this seems like a great way to fatten your wallet if you are willing to do the work. You can find their bug bounty program policy here to see what they cover and what not. Thank you. A couple more waiting to be rewarded. I think the final tally was $120K but I lost count. Took me about a week. — Guido Vranken (@GuidoVranken) June 4, 2018 Ledger Wallet for Desktop Is Coming Soon Ledger, the producer of the popular hardware wallet Nano Ledger, has announced that the release date of the new version of the Ledger Wallet desktop edition is now scheduled for July 9 th , 2018. It will be available as native desktop application, supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux, so that users won’t require accessing the wallet via Google Chrome or Chromium anymore. Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes? Block Broker is the latest ICO to fall off the map, deleting all its social media presence and leaving investors to wonder if it was all an exit scam from the start. What makes this case interesting is that it was meant to “completely eliminate ICO fraud by creating a 100% safe investment environment.” The project promised a decentralized ICO investment platform to “ensure that fraudulent ICOs don’t get an opportunity to tarnish the booming industry.” Of course if you are going to trust a “team of experienced professionals” to somehow safely handpick investments for you in a decentralized way, you better make sure they aren’t scamming you first. Strong Demand for Chinese Ghosts And speaking about dishonest ICOs, reports from China indicate that there is still high demand for ghostwriters to produce Chinese whitepapers, despite the ban on the practice in the country. In fact, there are also many people advertising their services as ICO writers in China, offering a whitepaper for an average of 15,000 yuan (about $2,350), according to Securities Daily . “One 20-page whitepaper in Chinese will cost 15,000 yuan, and the one that has 45 to 50 pages will cost 40,000 yuan,” one provider reportedly said. “An additional 7,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan will be charged for an English version. The service usually takes 7 to 10 days to complete,” the whitepaper provider added. Virtual Crypto Technologies’ New Two-Way ATM NetoBit ATM Virtual Crypto Technologies Ltd. (OTCQB: VRCP), an Israeli tech startup dedicated to making cryptocurrencies accessible to the public, announced that it will launch its bitcoin ATM at the Tech Crunch Tel Aviv event today. The Neto Bit ATM is a two-was machine that enables users to both buy and sell cryptocurrencies with fiat money. Alon Dayan, CEO of Virtual Crypto, commented: “We continue to set standards for the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. Our proprietary algorithm reduced the typical transaction time from [between 10 and 60 minutes] to [only] several seconds. At this stage, Neto Bit ATMs combine that speed with the convenience of an ATM, giving customers the ability to buy and sell bitcoin with fiat money. The result is a vastly improved trading experience for customers, which we believe will be attractive to our business partners as well as consumers.” Bitcoin Cash on Money Week Dominic Frisby, Money Week’s commentator on gold and commodities, and the author of ‘Bitcoin: the Future of Money?’ has written in the UK magazine yesterday about his impression of meeting BCH developers when looking for sponsors for his financial game-show. “I was deeply impressed with the ambition of the enterprise. They are really pushing this thing. In the coming weeks there are big deals for payments with major international merchants to be announced. They are building an enormous and ambitious payment infrastructure across all six continents. Owning the coin is like owning shares in the network, a network which is rapidly growing and well marketed. They want bitcoin cash to be used as widely as possible as a means of payment: to make sure it is actually used.” Advising his readers if they should get BTC or BCH, he added that: “Bitcoin cash is more volatile and the downside risk is greater, but if you ask me which of the two is more likely to go up ten times from current prices, I’d have to say bitcoin cash.” What do you think about today’s news updates?

Wu told the publication that the company raised $2.5 billion in revenue last year, a figure somewhat lower than estimates from industry analysts but nevertheless quite impressive.\nAccording to other estimates, Bitmain controls as much as 80 percent of the manufacturing market for application-specific integrated circuit ( ASIC ) mining devices, which — once developed for a specific mining algorithm — quickly replace miners powered by general-purpose GPU chips.\nCanaan Creative, whose devices account for roughly 15 percent of the ASIC market, recently filed for a Hong Kong IPO that is expected to raise $1 billion.\nWu has said that he believes Bitmain is worth $12 billion, while other estimates have put the company’s valuation closer to $8.8 billion. Bitmain brought in 12 times as much revenue as Canaan during 2017, which — depending on the success of Canaan’s offering — could lend credence to Wu’s valuation.\nNo matter the precise figure, however, Bitmain is undoubtedly one of the most valuable companies in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, and the dearth of public cryptocurrency companies could lead investors to pay a premium for its shares.\nHowever, as CCN reported , Bitmain has gradually been expanding its product line beyond mining, even as it seeks to take this part of its business global.\nTo wit, the company is leveraging its expertise in ASIC development to carve out market share in China’s artificial intelligence (AI) industry — where the government favors domestic projects and has effectively blackballed Western giant Google.\nBitmain’s burgeoning AI business is more than just a hedge against a decline in the cryptocurrency market. It is also, unlike mining, an industry with explicit government approval.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock\nThe post Bitcoin Mining Giant Bitmain Could Go Public in Record-Breaking IPO: Report appeared first on CCN .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://ccn.com/tag/asic", "https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-mining-firm-bitmain-is-making-a-major-pivot-to-ai/", "https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-mining-firm-bitmain-is-making-a-major-pivot-to-ai/&quot;", "https://www.ccn.com/bitmains-biggest-bitcoin-mining-rival-plots-1-billion-hong-kong-ipo/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-07/crypto-s-32-year-old-billionaire-mining-king-is-mulling-an-ipo", "http://ccn.com/tag/bitmain", "http://ccn.com/tag/bitmain&quot;", "https://www.ccn.com/bitmains-profits-rival-chipmaker-nvidia-analysts-say/&quot;", "http://ccn.com/tag/asic&quot;", "https://www.ccn.com/bitmains-profits-rival-chipmaker-nvidia-analysts-say/", "https://www.ccn.com/bitmains-biggest-bitcoin-mining-rival-plots-1-billion-hong-kong-ipo/&quot;", "https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-mining-giant-bitmain-could-go-public-in-record-breaking-ipo-report/&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/CbZtTb4bkWiXaAa0h4UxoA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/d54fd5d99fc88346b2a52fda663af941", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-07/crypto-s-32-year-old-billionaire-mining-king-is-mulling-an-ipo&quot;", "https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-mining-giant-bitmain-could-go-public-in-record-breaking-ipo-report/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jihan wu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "asic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canaan creative", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gpu", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T19:19:40.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1654f3da131a268d50386dc4949ef546acd9a730", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSZMZvCKS8WsbM4YeDR1tj5amoLdgyHBwglEIe_xrzrrDsddFvNXSKu8j7h7c3MYd3r10K7Zj.vrM", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "Three Apartments Sold for 420 Bitcoins in Budva", "title_full": "Three Apartments Sold for 420 Bitcoins in Budva", "published": "2018-06-07T20:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1654f3da131a268d50386dc4949ef546acd9a730", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSZMZvCKS8WsbM4YeDR1tj5amoLdgyHBwglEIe_xrzrrDsddFvNXSKu8j7h7c3MYd3r10K7Zj.vrM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-07T20:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Three Apartments Sold for 420 Bitcoins in Budva", "text": "Three Apartments Sold for 420 Bitcoins in Budva\nThree Apartments Sold for 420 Bitcoins in Budva Total Montenegro News (press release) (blog) Full coverage Google ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "montenegro news", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "budva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "budva tota", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T20:46:37.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "91544b3c87dfbac4450b2b0bd540441a21685051", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3J2eLSvO9um7niQDgFcodiappTeKLeeUhbproJElmhojrP7i0cNS1DFMnUM78JFQyI-", "site_full": "earnforum.net", "site": "earnforum.net", "site_section": "http://earnforum.net/viewforum.php?f=10", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "EarnForum.net -

Dadiani Fine Art in London's upmarket Mayfair, through its luxury market place Dadiani Syndicate and in partnership with blockchain platform Maecenas Fine Art, will put 49% of the Warhol work up for sale in cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum on June 20.\nThe piece is currently valued at $5.6 million — that's about 730 Bitcoin.

Lugano, Switzerland. With this campaign, any TIO holder is automatically qualified to benefit from ongoing token airdrops from high potential toke sales. Such token sales have undergone an extensive vetting process by the experienced trade.io consulting team for AML processes, technical viability and longevity, and as a result have been verified as high potential projects by the company.\ntrade.io targets to airdrop as many as 2 million tokens (sometimes more) per verified token aale, specifically to its TIO holders and to its loyal community. Clients who have already passed the strict trade.io vetting processes and who are in line to distribute their Alt Coins to the trade.io network include: TV-TWO, token sale Watchdog, INGOT Coin, DarcMatter, ZeroEdge. Another 50 token sales are already in discussions to join the trade.io token sale consulting pipeline. This could potentially make 100 million coins available for airdrop to TIO holders within the coming months.\nHow Does the Airdrop Work\nCommunity members who join in trade.io’s telegram groups plus the token sale client’s telegram group will automatically be airdropped a pre-set percentage of tokens.\nExisting TIO Holders who actively participate into the token sale of the client via the upcoming trade.io airdrop web page will be eligible to receive a significant number of additional Alt Coins. The top raffle allocation is USD 100,000.\ntrade.io will take a snapshot of all wallets holding TIO – anybody holding over 2,500 TIOs will be eligible to receive an additional airdrop. This will be an ongoing process for any token sale launched on the trade.io platform.\nTIO holders who participate in the token sale via the trade.io link will be eligible to receive additional bonuses over and above what the client token sale is offering. To register to be informed about upcoming airdrops, visit https://airdrops.trade.io\nCEO of trade.io Jim Preissler commented:\n“We are constantly looking for ways to add value to the experience of our loyal community and TIO holders. We feel that an ongoing airdrop of this enormity is the perfect way to both thank our community for their loyalty plus to assist new high potential ICOs in accessing our informed and ambitious community.”\nThe Company’s vision is to continually onboard quality token sales, which will bring a stream of high potential Alt Coins to TIO holders on an ongoing basis. With this, any hodler of the TIO token will automatically inherit high quality coins. This will help TIO holders to diversify – as well as to increase – the size of their portfolio.\nHe continued:\n“This airdrop is a win-win situation for all company stakeholders. The Alt Coins from from our upcoming ICOs will also be airdropped into our liquidity pool, which will benefit all of its participants.”\nThe Trade Token is currently available to purchase on the following exchanges: OKEX, Bancor, GateIO, TIDEX, KuCOIN, HitBTC, IDEX. The trade.io exchange is scheduled to launch within the coming weeks.\nAny percentages stipulated and / or airdrop terms & conditions will be issued by the company upon final launch of the airdrop program in due course. All announcements will be made on our official telegram channel https://t.me/TradeToken\nAbout trade.io\ntrade.io is a next generation financial institution based on blockchain technology, and providing the ultimate in security and transparency via its flagship product the trade.io exchange as well as its highly sought after token sale Consulting Services and Angel Investment Program. trade.io successfully completed its token sale in January 2018 and raised over 31 million USD from loyal participants and community members who want greater transparency in the financial markets.\nVisit the Website: https://trade.io/ Connect on Twitter: https://twitter.com/tradetoken?lang=en Connect on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/trade.io/?_rdc=2&_rdr Meet the team: https://www.linkedin.com/company/trade-io/\nName: marketing@trade.io Email: Helen Astaniou\ntrade.io is the source of this content.

trust of Wall Street institutions just yet, but millennials are all in. Blockchain Capital recently conducted a study of 2,000 millennials (aged 18-34) and asked them to make a theoretical choice between owning $1,000 in bonds or stocks and $1,000 in bitcoin: Thirty percent chose bitcoin.\nThese days, a single bitcoin goes for more than $12,900. That’s a gain of nearly 1,550% since the beginning of the year. It seems millennials are laughing all the way to the decentralized blockchain.\nThe price of bitcoin keeps skyrocketing because people believe its price will keep shooting higher. It’s such an incredible gain, in fact, that C-suite execs can no longer afford to ignore bitcoin and its underlying technology — blockchain. Neither can you.\nThe following bitcoin stocks aren’t pure plays on the cryptocurrency and that’s what makes them attractive. Once bitcoin is no longer “cool,” there will be a massive correction, but not in companies that are diversified. And Blockchain, for what it’s worth, is another thing entirely.\nThat’s why the following stocks are all much safer bets on the digital money craze than bitcoin, ethereum or any other digital currency. And you won’t end up like this guy for owning them.\nEditor’s note: This story was originally published Dec. 22, 2017. It has since been republished and re-edited to reflect recent information. Source: Shutterstock Bitcoin Stocks: Microsoft\nBlockchain, the technology behind bitcoin, could be the most monumental shift in our culture since the internet, which is why Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) invested in it.\nAzure, Microsoft’s cloud computing arm, hopes to be the first to mainstream blockchain-to-enterprise businesses. Billed as a distribution ledger, Microsoft is selling businesses a new infrastructure from which to do business, offering several different blockchain apps for companies to create their own “network topology:” :\n“Rather than spending hours building out and configuring the infrastructure, we have automated these time-consuming pieces to allow you to focus on building out your scenarios and applications. You are only charged for the underlying infrastructure resources consumed, such as compute, storage, and networking. There are no incremental charges for the solution itself.”\nCompanies that will benefit the most tend to rely on third-party intermediaries, with multiple parties sharing and updating data between firms. Blockchain simplifies this process and allows everyone to have access to the same data at all times. Nothing can be deleted.\nThe difference between Microsoft’s blockchain and bitcoin’s, however, is that bitcoin is a public blockchain while Microsoft’s is specifically designed for enterprise. And it’s not the only company that has found an enterprise use for bitcoin’s secret sauce … Source: Atomic Taco via Flickr Bitcoin Stocks: IBM\nInternational Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ), like Microsoft, is targeting enterprise with blockchain technology, and it has several solutions for businesses small and large.\nIBM is focusing on democratic applications of blockchain . That is, it allows users to create networks, determine governance rules, invite network members and validate transactions.\nIts “blockchain workshop” provides consultation on how to best use the technology and successfully create your own blockchain network. While “blockchain accelerator” helps guide businesses through the legal and technical ramifications of blockchain networks.\nWhat’s more, IBM is continually dreaming up new applications for blockchain as “untold more” exist that will change the future of business for the better. Enter Hyperledger — IBM’s open source collaboration to improve blockchain across all industries.\nMore than 130 members spanning industries such as finance, manufacturing and technology are working to create a distributed ledger framework that is open and standardized. Source: Shutterstock Bitcoin Stocks: Pfizer\nBig Pharma has been plagued by supply-chain fraud and blockchain is the answer to all its problems.\nThe Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), established in 2013, is weighing on the pharmaceutical industry to find a solution and Big Pharma is betting on blockchain to create an interoperable system to stamp out rampant counterfeiting.\nTo this end, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ) joins with several Big Pharma cohorts in the “MediLedger Project,” a collective of pharmaceutical companies working on a program to track drugs through a blockchain.\nBasically, if a shipment of drugs “falls off the truck,” the data stored on the blockchain would show who last touched the shipment. Any stolen goods would be harder to unload in bulk, too, as blockchain makes it easier to prove authenticity.\nSuch a system could slow the bleed of counterfeit drugs, which hit $75 billion this year , and that could only be good for Pfizer’s bottom line. Source: Overstock.com Bitcoin Stocks: Overstock\nThe past few months have been good to Overstock.com Inc (NASDAQ: OSTK ), which has gained 280%-plus since the beginning of August. Not bad for an outlying e-commerce stock that scrambles for light under Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AMZN ) shadow.\nThe reason for this is Medici Ventures, Overstock’s blockchain-focused division that has been in the works secretly for the past three years. Medici, according to its website, focuses on “six key areas of emerging crypto-industries”— capital markets, money and banking, identity, land, voting and underlying tech. The firm has a number of companies in its portfolio dedicated to advancing blockchain applications, but the most prominent is tZero.\nTZero is planning an initial coin offering (ICO) to fund the development of trade “tokens” for an SEC-compliant alternative trading system. Essentially, it’s a stock offering in the parlance of blockchain .\nAccording to at least one analyst, OSTK stock could gain more than 60% if it sold its retail business to focus solely on its blockchain ventures. Source: Via Square Bitcoin Stocks: Square\nSquare Inc (NYSE: SQ ) CEO Jack Dorsey hasn’t been shy on the topic of blockchain, describing the technology as “the next big unlock,” but he cautions against blanket approaches.\nDoes this mean that Square, or Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ), won’t soon take advantage of blockchain? Not necessarily. Until then, Square stock is primed to have a first-mover advantage in the bitcoin marketplace space, which isn’t a bad place to be.\nSquare just hopped on the bitcoin train in November, and not a minute too soon. In the past three months alone, the price of bitcoin has soared nearly 340%. SQ stock gained 2% on reports of it testing a bitcoin marketplace in its Square Cash app, as user Zach Miles revealed through Twitter: since when can you buy bitcoin through @SquareCash ?! pic.twitter.com/etrEY41kCo\n— Zach Miles (@zachmil_es) November 8, 2017\nAs this bitcoin-buying feature begins rolling out to more of Square’s user base, SQ stock could benefit from fees it generates from people buying and selling the cryptocurrency.\nAnd more people could flock to bitcoin as Square gives the digital currency a mainstream legitimacy. Source: via Wikimedia Bitcoin Stocks: JPMorgan\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM ) CEO Jamie Dimon isn’t one to mince words, dubbing bitcoin a “fraud” and questioning the intelligence of the people who buy it . Blockchain, however, is another story.\nWhich is why JPM just launched a new payment processing network that uses blockchain in collaboration with the Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE: RY ) and the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group .\nBlockchain has proven especially valuable for finance, and JPMorgan has poured millions into its blockchain effort, Quorum , which it hopes will simplify its processes and lower its costs.\nFor instance, international money transfers would reach their beneficiaries much more quickly (and much more securely) when done through blockchain than through traditional means. This will be especially true as more banks join in. Source: Thetaxhaven via Flickr (modified) Bitcoin Stocks: SAP\nAnother company listed in the Reality Shares Nasdaq Blockchain Economy Index is SAP SE (ADR) (NYSE: SAP ). SAP revealed its blockchain-as-a-service product earlier this year, a fee-based service accessible in the SAP cloud.\nAs more businesses begin to use emerging technologies like blockchain, it’s SAP’s job to leverage that into a business model. Enter SAP Leonardo, a product line that includes machines learning, Big Data, Internet of Things, analytics and blockchain services.\nSAP Leonardo is crucial to SAP’s growth and ability to adapt to an increasingly digital world as businesses seek out new technologies to better serve the customer.\nSAP is also spearheading a blockchain co-innovation initiative to cement blockchain into IoT, manufacturing and digital supply chains. Source: Shutterstock Bitcoin Stocks: Accenture\nAccenture Plc (NYSE: ACN ) recently found itself listed in the new Reality Shares Nasdaq Blockchain Economy Index as it seeks to solve what it considers “inefficiencies around money transfers.”\nACN is a consulting firm that works with clients to improve their business. As such, Accenture has blockchain experts that go around from business to business to help them implement a blockchain strategy.\nThey do this through a number of services , including strategy assessment (basically determining whether blockchain is right for a particular business), blockchain solution design (a “holistic” process for blockchain operations), blockchain bootcamp (workshops for training employees), blockchain sandboxes (hands-on development with blockchain toolsets) and more.\nTheir goal?

It is normal that the price of bitcoin gets down but it's been a long time since it is on its original value or higher than its real value. Those who invest these past few months are suffering a lot of loaaes and they are losing hope that bitcoin will continue to drastically decrease in value. Do you have guys some advice for me? It will be really appreciated and I will be eternal grateful.\nThe demand in the market will continue to grow because of new investors each month that is keep on coming in the market and because of that, we can expect that the price of bitcoins will increase even more in the future.\nI agree with you bitcoin is been always that way before, its still in high and low value, but in the end it will

Major Coins Stem Further Losses, With Bitcoin Brushing $7,700 June 7, 2018 150 Although crypto markets are still down over the past month, most of the top ten coins are in the green today, June 7. Market visualization from Coin360\nBitcoin (BTC) is comfortably holding above the $7,600 threshold and inching to a new price point of $7,700, trading at around $7,690 at press time. The leading cryptocurrency, up almost 2.3 percent over a 24-hour period, saw an intra-weekly low just above $7,400, but has since stemmed its losses.\nYesterday’s official clarification from the chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) that Bitcoin is categorically not considered to be a security under U.S. law may have gone some way to bolster market confidence.\nBitcoin’s regulatory status is evidently more clear-cut than major altcoins Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), both of whose representatives have emphatically rejected security classifications, although their regulatory status in the eyes of the SEC remains unclear . Bitcoin price chart from Cointelegraph’s Bitcoin Price Index Leading altcoin Ethereum (ETH) has seen a slightly lower gains of just over 1.3 percent on the day, trading around $606 to press time. Having recovered from its low of $571 earlier this week, the coin has for now reclaimed its ground above the psychological price point of $600. Ethereum price chart from Cointelegraph’s Ethereum Price Index Most of the top ten coins by market capitalization are showing minor fluctuations of within a 2-3 percent range over a 24-hour, as data from CoinMarketCap shows. Of the top ten coins, only Cardano (ADA) is in the red, down less than 1 percent, trading at about $0.21 to press time. Altcoin EOS is seeing the most growth of the top ten coins over the past 24 hours, up over 4.5 percent on the day, trading at $14.20 a coin at press time. EOS is currently ranked in fifth place on CoinMarketCap, with a market capitalization of over $12.7 bln. Yesterday, stock analytics firm Trefis announced they have lowered their Bitcoin year-end price forecast from $15,000 to $12,500, according to their analysis of fundamentals of supply and demand in BTC markets. Trefis pointed to significant recent losses in total BTC transaction volumes across crypto exchanges, and attributed a surplus in supply and subsequent drop in price to Mt. Gox dumping BTC onto exchanges earlier this spring. As of press time, CoinMarketCap data indicates BTC trade volumes of 4.69 bln, down from 7.41 bln one month ago. While markets remain sluggish, institutional actors are making significant headway with their foray into the crypto sphere. Yesterday, one of the largest financial firms in the world, Susquehanna International Group, revealed it would be opening cryptocurrency trading to its clients, initially in the form of Bitcoin futures. The week has also seen news of significant advances among major crypto industry players to bring their operations under the purview of financial regulators. Yesterday, peer-to-peer payments platform Circle Internet Financial Ltd., revealed it is pursuing both a federal banking license and registration as a brokerage and trading venue with the SEC. The news followed hot on the heels of leading U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase initiating its own process to become a fully SEC-regulated broker dealer, through its acquisition of three financial firms.\nOverall market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is $346 bln to press time, up about $10 bln on the week.\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not

The last six months has seen bitcoin’s price fall from more than $19,000 in December, to today’s value of below $7,700.\nThe falling price has been attributed to uncertain regulation, as well as the seizure of bitcoins in different legal cases, such as MtGox, which were then sold on exchanges. While the cryptocurrency markets continue to settle, the short-term forecast is expected to remain relatively stagnant.\n“I believe bitcoin’s price will continue to fluctuate between $6,500 and $8,500 in the coming weeks,” David Hanson, a blockchain expert and CEO of the gaming platform Ultra, told The Independent. “In the medium-to-long term, bitcoin’s value should go up, as big institutions enter the crypto space in a bid to gain first-mover advantage, further legitimising the market.”\nThis view that major institutions will provide a boost to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is shared by other figures in the space, who believe bitcoin will finally break back above $10,000 in the coming months. “As the regulatory landscape clears up we can expect far more investors, including big ticket institutions, to make their first cryptocurrency investments,” Iqbal Gandham, the UK managing director of the investment platform eToro, told The Independent.\n“For the first few months of this year, the crypto industry has been jogging along at a relatively slow pace, waiting for the opportunity to stretch into a sprint.

While rounding out this bottom, price found resistance around $7780. Then, price dipped to about 7355 before rebounding.\nNow, the rounded bottom has evolved into what looks like a \"cup and handle\" pattern. Basically, price was able to hold mostly above the middle of the range for the rounded bottom, which was from around 7750 to about 7060 (the middle was around 7400).\nBTC/USD 1H Chart\n(click to enlarge)\nShort-term Bullish Bias: Judging from price action, it looks like BTC/USD is in the middle of a bull run at least in the short-term. The 1H chart, which is better for assessing short-term trends show that price held above the cluster of 200-, 100-, and 50-hour simple moving averages (SMAs) Bouncing off these SMAs is a bullish \"slingshot\" signal. I think there is upside conservatively to around 7925, which was a previous support pivot. More likely, there will be a push to $8100-$8200 area, which was also a previous support pivot area. While the short-term trend appears bullish, we have to remember that the 2018 trend has been bearish. The thing is, it has turned more sideways. Still, the market is neutral-bearish and is NOT bullish yet, out side of the short-term. From the chart, it looks like the bitcoin still has a good chance to fall back towards $5600 and possibly $5000.\nBTC/USD Daily Chart", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T20:07:51.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c31fecaaf4b2c511ff6579e3d8c0d703e6c4b47b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQhH3h8jj7Vt0TTVIW0.4gW8NlqbLUr5lIWAiIXLkHlCDWLNvKEm0asXrscNiDbc1BX.tw_7HEpONBMJAnR92uYucVe0JbF8qUhqv4qPXMPPY0gJM9sV3xEL6IYLis7u5twcHGfURavI5drpJmm6sAr7MPZbtvwdaVF1jvKkrrJ6GuFerG8f55M", "site_full": "www.financialexpress.com", "site": "financialexpress.com", "site_section": "http://www.financialexpress.com/feed/rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Financial ExpressThe Financial Express", "title": "This 32-year old cryptocurrency billionaire mulls IPO for his Chinese bitcoin mining company", "title_full": "This 32-year old cryptocurrency billionaire mulls IPO for his Chinese bitcoin mining company", "published": "2018-06-07T20:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://images.financialexpress.com/2018/06/bitmain1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 4726, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c31fecaaf4b2c511ff6579e3d8c0d703e6c4b47b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQhH3h8jj7Vt0TTVIW0.4gW8NlqbLUr5lIWAiIXLkHlCDWLNvKEm0asXrscNiDbc1BX.tw_7HEpONBMJAnR92uYucVe0JbF8qUhqv4qPXMPPY0gJM9sV3xEL6IYLis7u5twcHGfURavI5drpJmm6sAr7MPZbtvwdaVF1jvKkrrJ6GuFerG8f55M", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bloomberg", "published": "2018-06-07T20:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "This 32-year old cryptocurrency billionaire mulls IPO for his Chinese bitcoin mining company", "text": "This 32-year old cryptocurrency billionaire mulls IPO for his Chinese bitcoin mining company This 32-year old cryptocurrency billionaire mulls IPO for his Chinese bitcoin mining company An IPO would not only open Bitmain Technologies Ltd.’s books to the world, it would also allow the stock market to assign the company a value in real time. By: Bloomberg | Published: June 7, 2018 5:00 PM Wu runs Bitmain Technologies Ltd., the world’s dominant producer of cryptocurrency mining chips. (Image: Reuters)\nWith his baby face, eyeglasses and go-to outfit of T-shirt, jeans and sneakers, Jihan Wu looks more like a geeky teenager than a self-made billionaire. But thanks to an early foray into cryptocurrencies, the soft-spoken 32-year-old is sitting on what may be one of the industry’s largest fortunes. Wu runs Bitmain Technologies Ltd., the world’s dominant producer of cryptocurrency mining chips. The Chinese company has been shrouded in secrecy since its founding five years ago, but Wu is gradually lifting the veil — and revealing clues about his personal wealth — as he pursues an expansion beyond the crypto-sphere that may eventually lead to an initial public offering.\nIn an interview with Bloomberg News, Wu said Bitmain booked $2.5 billion of revenue last year and that he and co-founder Micree Zhan together own about 60 percent of the business. While Bitmain has few direct comparables, applying a multiple similar to that of publicly traded chipmakers such as Nvidia Corp. and MediaTek Inc. would give the company a valuation of about $8.8 billion. That would make the co-founders’ holdings worth a combined $5.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nWu, who said he has a smaller stake than Zhan, declined to share details of his net worth, his cryptocurrency holdings and his other personal investments. He has previously said Bitmain is worth $12 billion. Zhan declined to comment. Given the uncertainty surrounding digital assets and the limited public information about Bitmain, any estimate of the Beijing-based company’s value — and its owners’ wealth — inevitably involves a lot of guesswork. But that could be about to change.\nAn IPO would not only open Bitmain’s books to the world, it would also allow the stock market to assign the company a value in real time. While Wu said he has no specific plans at the moment, he’s open to a listing in Hong Kong — or in an overseas market with U.S. dollar-denominated shares — because it would give early investors including Sequoia Capital and IDG Capital a chance to cash out. A public share sale would be a landmark event for both Bitmain and the broader crypto industry, which is slowly emerging from the shadows.\nMiners, developers and venture capitalists are opting for more transparency as they try to placate wary regulators and prove that last year’s boom in digital assets was more than just a flash in the pan. An IPO would also help boost Bitmain’s profile as the company branches out into areas including artificial intelligence, a field that enjoys the full-throated backing of Chinese authorities, unlike cryptocurrencies. “The challenge is advancing our technology beyond what we’ve already achieved,” Wu said in an interview at the Four Seasons hotel in Hong Kong.\nOne of Bitmain’s biggest competitors, Canaan Inc., has already filed for a Hong Kong IPO that people with knowledge of the matter said could raise about $1 billion. Bitmain’s 2017 revenue was about twelve times that of Canaan’s. Both companies design custom chips known as application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs. These are particularly good for the brute-force number crunching required by cryptocurrency miners, who verify virtual currency transactions and earn crypto-denominated rewards by solving complex math problems. ASICs are also useful for the heavy workloads associated with some forms of AI, such as machine learning.\nBitmain controls as much as 80 percent of the market for crypto mining gear, according to a February report from Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., whose most conservative estimate of the company’s operating profit is similar to that of Nvidia’s. Bitmain’s Antminers — server-sized boxes filled with dozens or hundreds of identical high-powered chips — sell for a few hundred to a few thousand dollars and are typically bought in bulk by professional operators with access to cheap electricity. Bitmain is the industry’s “800-pound gorilla,” Roger Ver, the virtual currency proponent known as Bitcoin Jesus, said in an interview.\nWhile the company gets most of its revenue from mining equipment sales, it also runs some of the biggest mining collectives, in which members combine their processing capacity and split the rewards. Bitmain’s AntPool and BTC.com collectives control more than 40 percent of the world’s Bitcoin mining power, according to blockchain.info. The company’s outsized role has prompted a backlash from some virtual currency purists, who disdain anything that hints of a concentration of power in the crypto ecosystem. But Wu brushes off the naysayers, pointing out that lots of rivals are angling to grab market share. “Bitmain is trying very hard to maintain its advantage,” he said.\nStiff competition would be just one of several risks for investors in a potential Bitmain IPO. This year’s tumble in cryptocurrency prices has squeezed mining-industry profits, while the number of mine-able Bitcoins is creeping ever closer to its 21 million limit. Bitmain may be diversifying, but a successful push into AI is far from guaranteed, according to Mark Li, a senior analyst at Bernstein who says Bitmain is likely worth less than $10 billion.\nDespite the headwinds, a Bitmain offering would garner plenty of attention from Hong Kong investors, who lack compelling options to bet on China’s nascent chip industry, according to Kevin Wang, an analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. “They’ll have a premium for their valuation because there are very few” stocks like Bitmain in Hong Kong, Wang said. “But the sustainability of the business is the question mark.”\nGet live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds , calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator , know market’s Top Gainers , Top Losers & Best Equity Funds .

The modus operandi for the inner cabal of the global elite is and always has been to provide order out of chaos…sometimes the chaos happen organically and sometimes it has to be created. Money has always been used as their greatest mechanism for control ever since the introduction of usury in the ancient world.\nBut here in the 21st century what’s Donald Trump’s roll in all of this? Is he being set up top take the fall or is he working with the deep state to ensure that that the crash of the dollar happens? In this video Dan Dicks of Press For Truth speaks with Dr. Ron Paul of The Liberty Report to get his views on the coming dollar crash, the idea of a cashless society, cryptocurrencies as a potential hedge and whether or not Donald Trump is a tool of the deep state.

Miners no Longer Wanted\nAccording to local news media Zing , the Vietnamese Finance Ministry has proposed a bill to make the importation of cryptocurrency miners an illegal activity in the nation.\nBack in January, BTCManager informed you that over 8,000 mining equipment were imported into the nation within the first 23 days of January 2018, a figure that surpasses that of 2017 by far.\nIn the latest report from the General Department of Vietnam Customs, it has been revealed that the total number of bitcoin mining rigs brought into the country from 2017 to April 2018 is more than 15,000 units.\nHowever, Vietnam’s Ministry of Finance has made it clear that the proliferation of these cryptocurrency miners into the country has been fueled by the absence of laws making importation of these machines an illegal venture. And it is now ready to change the game with its Document 5964/BTC-TCHQ proposal which it has already submitted to the prime minister.\n“According to the Ministry of Finance, mining machines are not on the list of goods banned from importation and are not subject to the list of specialized management or unsafe goods, so enterprises are easily allowed to complete the import procedures,” Zing reports. Crypto Mining Fueling Crime\nThe decision of the Vietnamese authorities to place a blanket ban on bitcoin mining equipment importation in the country stems from the recent cases of scams that have riddled its cryptosphere, the most significant event being the fraudulent ICO scheme orchestrated by a local startup known as Modern Tech.\nThe firm allegedly claimed to be authorized representatives of the Ifan and Pincoin ICO projects, deceiving about 32,000 gullible citizens into investing in the scheme, subsequently swindling them of roughly $660 million.\n“Ifan and Pincoin investors began to smell a rat when the company ceased paying commissions in fiat, giving them tokens instead,” local news source Tuoitre reported at the time.\nOn April 22, 2018, BTCManager reported that Vietnam’s Prime Minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc had directed several Ministries and financial institutions in the country to stop facilitating crypto-related transactions.\nEven with the near-crippling effect of the PM’s directive, the Ministry has stated that if mining operations continue in the state, then it would be almost impossible to enforce the ban.\nIn essence, Vietnam’s Finance Ministry wants to entirely ban the importation of cryptocurrency mining rigs because it believes that “many of them are being used to launch new virtual currencies and forms of payment and such operations are very difficult to regulate,” said the Ministry.\nIf the proposal is approved, it could be a significant blow to cryptocurrency investors in Vietnam. However, it remains to be how they’ll respond to this new threat.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitcoinschannel.com/category/bitcoin/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "vietnamese finance ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "general department of vietnam customs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T20:45:45.039+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "384cc98d0d7a9a0b5ed9b93cca694b1f425cfa86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWSUKtEk4sQ4venLwVj1ty8HhrqQ4MnLqoMBj1RlagLZ7DVCL7j2i63dvftWGoXm1CB42YqZ01YLLgVQdKGHT4", "site_full": "www.investopedia.com", "site": "investopedia.com", "site_section": "http://www.investopedia.com/feedbuilder/feed/getFeed?feedName=rss_headline", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "rss_headline", "title": "SEC Chair Says Bitcoin Is Not A Security", "title_full": "SEC Chair Says Bitcoin Is Not A Security", "published": "2018-06-07T19:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.investopedia.com/image/jpeg/1528396923749/shutterstock_300528803.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 854, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "384cc98d0d7a9a0b5ed9b93cca694b1f425cfa86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWSUKtEk4sQ4venLwVj1ty8HhrqQ4MnLqoMBj1RlagLZ7DVCL7j2i63dvftWGoXm1CB42YqZ01YLLgVQdKGHT4", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rakesh Sharma", "published": "2018-06-07T19:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "SEC Chair Says Bitcoin Is Not A Security", "text": "SEC Chair Says Bitcoin Is Not A Security By Rakesh Sharma | June 7, 2018 — 12:46 PM EDT More on Bitcoin Bitcoin Gold Hack Shows 51% Attack Is Real\nSEC Chairman Jay Clayton has clarified that bitcoin is not a security. “Cryptocurrencies are replacements for sovereign currencies…[they] replace the yen, the dollar, the euro with bitcoin. That type of currency is not a security,” he said in an interview with CNBC . His assessment is important because the debate around regulation of cryptocurrencies is often focused on their status on securities. (See also: Are There SEC Guidelines On ICOs? )\nBut Clayton held off on commenting about the case for ethereum and ripple, the second and third most valuable cryptocurrencies, being classified as securities. At a conference in April, former CFTC chairman Gary Gensler had come down hard on XRP and said there was “a strong case” to classify it as a security. (See also: ICO Tokens Are Securities: Former CFTC Chair ).\nBitcoin, which has never sought public funds to develop its technology, does not pass the Howey Test used by the SEC to classify securities. No Reprieve For Ethereum Tokens\nBitcoin may be in the clear, but ethereum’s tokens, which have been embroiled in an acrimonious debate regarding their status, were not granted a similar reprieve. Critics charge these tokens with masquerading as utility tokens when they are, in fact, securities.\nIn his CNBC interview, Clayton made it clear that his agency was still intent on regulating tokens. “A token, a digital asset where I give you my money...[in exchange for] providing a return…that is a security and we regulate that. We regulate the offering and trading of that security,” he said. Clayton’s statement is a reiteration of the agency’s crackdown actions in recent times. (See also: SEC Warns Investors About Scam ICOs ).\nClayton has been leading the charge for regulatory action against fraudulent tokens. Based on his stance during the interview, it would seem that he is not ready to back down anytime soon. \"We are not going to do any violence to the traditional definition of security that has worked for a long time,” he said. “We’ve been doing this a long time, there’s no need to change the definition.” According to him, the U.S. securities market, which is the “envy of the world,” was built following the same rules. The reaction to his latest interview was not positive.\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICOs\") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or ICOs.

Bitmain's founder, cryptocurrency billionaire Jihan Wu, told Bloomberg that Bitmain is considering an initial public offering as it expands into producing hardware for AI computing. Bitmain Technologies, the world's largest producer of mining chips, might be considering an IPO, Bloomberg reports.\nThe company, which is run by 32-year-old cryptocurrency billionaire Jihan Wu, has become a global force in the burgeoning cryptocurrency mining industry since it was founded five years ago. In June, Wu told Bloomberg that Bitmain made $2.5 billion in revenue in the year 2017 alone. Now, the company's success might have Wu considering taking it public.\nRecently, Bitmain has been tinkering with another kind of hardware beyond mining chips. The company has expressed interest in developing custom chips to compute in the field of artificial intelligence, called application-specific integrated circuits .\nWu suggested to Bloomberg that Bitmain's interest in expanding into AI hardware might eventually lead to an initial public offering. The listing, Wu said, would most likely occur overseas; Hong Kong was mentioned as a possible option.\n“Bitmain is trying very hard to maintain its advantage,” Wu told Bloomberg.\nRead the full story over at Bloomberg here.\n Share the latest business news with your network:\nEmail sent to: nguyenvu1187.love5@blogger.com | Manage your email preferences | Unsubscribe\nTerms of Service | Privacy Policy\nBusiness Insider. 150 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10011 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jihan wu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zoë bernard", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitmain technologies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ipo", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T18:50:36.010+03:00"}], "totalResults": 32208, "moreResultsAvailable": 31008, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=69af6a92-1446-4129-92ce-e0209947762b&format=json&ts=1525903350122&q=%22bitcoin%22+language%3Aenglish+is_first%3Atrue+thread.title%3Abitcoin&sort=thread.published&from=1200", "requestsLeft": 650}
