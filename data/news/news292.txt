stop trading or transacting in cryptocurrencies.RBZ registrar of banking institutions, Norman Mataruka in a circular yesterday, said they were taking these measures to protect the public and safeguard the integrity, safety and soundness of the country's financial system.The central bank said financial institutions should exit any existing relationships with virtual currency exchanges within 60 days and proceed to liquidate and restitute existing account balances.Mataruka said for the avoidance of doubt, banking services would include maintaining accounts, registering, trading, clearing, collateral arrangements, remittances, payment and settlement accounts, giving loans against virtual tokens.He added that accepting cryptocurrencies as collateral, opening accounts of exchanges dealing with them and transfer/receipt of money in accounts relating to purchase/sale of virtual currencies was also prohibited.\"As monetary authorities, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is the custodian of public trust and has an obligation to safeguard the integrity of payment systems.Cryptocurrencies have strong linkages and interconnectedness with standard means of payments and trading applications and rely on much of the same institutional infrastructure that serves the overall financial system,\" he said.In a separate statement, central bank governor John Mangudya warned the public against trading in cryptocurrencies.\"Any person who buys, sells, or otherwise transacts in cryptocurrencies, whether online, or otherwise, does so at their own risk and will have no recourse to the Reserve Bank or to any regulatory authority in the country,\" he said.\"The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has not authorised or licensed any person or entity or exchange for the issuance, sale, purchase, exchange or investment in any virtual currencies/coins/tokens in Zimbabwe. Exchanges such as Bitfinance (Private) Limited (Golix) and Styx24 are not licensed or regulated by the Reserve Bank.\"He said the Reserve Bank will continue to closely monitor regional and global cryptocurrency developments in order to inform policy direction.\"Locally, the largest cryptocurrency exchange is Golix which is registered under Bitfinance (Private) Limited. - newsday", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "norman mataruka", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "the reserve bank of zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rbz", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T04:39:28.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d4b3b4e33dabc5a601863fd8d740550655f9c722", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcAngQ9NTr42CYtH57aVzhw-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=224.0", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Speculation (Altcoins)", "title": "Bitcoin and eth big scam", "title_full": "Bitcoin and eth big scam", "published": "2018-05-12T17:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.109, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d4b3b4e33dabc5a601863fd8d740550655f9c722", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcAngQ9NTr42CYtH57aVzhw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "joelsamuya", "published": "2018-05-12T17:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin and eth big scam", "text": "Quote: from: bigmelons25 on April 01, 2018, 06:19:25 PM I buy bitcoin at14000 and eth at 1200 and they only fall in price.

It will be available to download on older handsets at a later date.\nBloomberg quoted Alejandro de la Torre, vice-president of BTC.com, as saying: \"It's a good opportunity to tap into the Chinese market. The use of cashless payments with apps is very big and the traditional banking system is lacking, so there's a good use case for crypto payments to grow there.\"\nChinese investors currently have limited access to cryptocurrency wallets. Similar popular apps such as Breadwallet and Airbitz are not available on Chinese mobile app stores. China also banned initial coin offerings last year.\nDespite the authorities' tightening control on cryptocurrency, enthusiasm for virtual currencies remains high.\n\"We expect to see massive growth in global cryptocurrency adoption habits in the near future,\" said Jaime Gonzalo, vice-president of Huawei's mobile services division in a statement.\n\"Huawei is a giant enterprise with a global vision and its decision is made upon the global market demand,\" said Sam Lee, founder and CEO of Blockchain Global Ltd, a multinational company focusing on funding blockchain technology.\n\"In the last year, bitcoin has been a red-hot asset in many countries and regions.\"\n\"Adding the bitcoin wallet app to its app store not only meets the demand from the market, but is also an important step in the company's strategy to develop blockchain technology,\" Lee said.\nThe bitcoin wallet app allows users to buy, store and transfer digital assets on their phone. In countries such as Japan where bitcoin payment is accepted in certain scenarios, users can simply scan QR codes via the app.\n\"Efficiency, reliability, cost and regulation are the four key factors that will decide if cryptocurrency has the competitive edge to replace traditional currency,\" said Li Lihui, former president of Bank of China, at in a recent seminar in Beijing.\n\"In daily use, I don't think cryptocurrency can replace existing popular mobile payment options such as WeChat wallet and Alipay,\" Li said.\n\"But in some centralized trading scenarios, the cryptocurrency can be used as an efficient tool.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zhang sh", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alejandro de la torre", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "huawei", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "appgallery phone", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "app download huawei technologies co ltd", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T10:12:06.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d8835c5525a52b1c12dd60ae40840bf5037ad5d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRFxmM.WvLouXvraQAs4_qVWOo1OGEKWKEtTBtDScrAcxWLqfO7DSfANz6k5qyj_8dHJiNgqT_c1w--", "site_full": "www.iphoneness.com", "site": "iphoneness.com", "site_section": "http://www.iphoneness.com/feed", "site_categories": ["mac_support", "tech"], "section_title": "iPhoneNess", "title": "6 Bitcoin Portfolio Apps for iPhone & iPad", "title_full": "6 Bitcoin Portfolio Apps for iPhone & iPad", "published": "2018-05-12T17:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://iphoneness-exxponentllc.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/16/Crypto-Pro.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d8835c5525a52b1c12dd60ae40840bf5037ad5d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRFxmM.WvLouXvraQAs4_qVWOo1OGEKWKEtTBtDScrAcxWLqfO7DSfANz6k5qyj_8dHJiNgqT_c1w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ci", "published": "2018-05-12T17:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "6 Bitcoin Portfolio Apps for iPhone & iPad", "text": "Bitcoin and crytpo investing can be lucrative if you know what you are doing.

Segwit or Segregated Witness is the name that was given to the implementation of a soft fork change in the transaction format of Bitcoin. This was considered a memorable moment for the LTC as well the BTC community. They have now completed one year since its first initiation.\nCharlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin recently tweeted:\n‚Äú SegWit activated on Litecoin a year ago today!‚Äù\nThe previous year began with three concerning issues for the Bitcoin community. There was an insurgency to increase the blocksize to process more transactions.\nThe second issue was that about increasing numbers of covert ASIC Boost mining on the Bitcoin network. ASIC is specialized to carry out specific functions such as mining.\nFinally the issue of transaction malleability which was one of the most flawed loopholes of the transaction ID verification. The malleability of the transaction means that there are possible ways for a user to potentially alter the transaction ID. This was a major issue as it was reported that if users manipulate the data at a favorable time, extra Bitcoin was sent.\nThe idea of Segwit was to solve the above mentioned hard-core problems. Instead of a complete Segwit hardfork as suggested by Peter Wiulle, a Bitcoin developer in 2015, it was proposed that a soft fork is carried out.\nEven after the benefits offered by segwit such as lightning speed transactions, double the blockchain size, etc. people were skeptical about it.\nThe announcement of a soft fork update created FUD in the community; hence the miners did not agree to implement segwit. Back then Charlie Lee along with the Litecoin [LTC] team made an attempt and promoted segwit and implemented it onto Litecoin. After the execution of Segwit into Litecoin, the percentage of mined Litecoin hiked as depicted below. Litecoin mining chart\n‚ÄúLitecoin just wants to boast and trying to make a name.‚Äù\nA Redditor says:\n‚ÄúThank you, Lee, for helping the mass understand to believe in the soft-fork, could not forget the time the blocksize increased and I was like this is the future baby.‚Äù\nA Twitterati says:\n‚ÄúSegwit update was a much required fork this was a joint effort from Bitcoin and litecoin but it did not solve all the issues regarding the hacks. Nothing new with it as it keeps happening a new update will be required again.‚Äù", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ltc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T17:37:27.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d3f159d0107f90b6ffa3e02b7430980dbe71d49c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZHWav1axiczsx1PJztsm5k-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "What makes Bitcoin valuable?", "title_full": "What makes Bitcoin valuable?", "published": "2018-05-12T17:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 16, "participants_count": 17, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d3f159d0107f90b6ffa3e02b7430980dbe71d49c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmZHWav1axiczsx1PJztsm5k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ca.ming14", "published": "2018-05-12T17:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "What makes Bitcoin valuable?", "text": "Bitcoin as being decentralized is what make it's valuable.

And it continues working even now, albeit with a slight adjustment.\nWhy would this relationship work? My answer is that there are cycles of human emotion which affect our collective attraction to and repulsion from speculative investments like the stock market. It appears that those same cycles of trader emotion are at work on Bitcoin traders, who are feeling those surges and lags in enthusiasm before they reach the hearts of stock investors.\nThe relationship did not seem to begin working until late 2016, which was when Bitcoin prices first touched $1000 and started getting people really excited. The 56-day lag time should have meant a Feb. 10, 2018 top for the DJIA, based on a calculation of 56 calendar days from Bitcoin‚Äôs Dec. 16, 2017 all-time price top.\nBut instead the DJIA topped on Jan. 26. So what happened? My best guess is that the commencement of Bitcoin futures trading on Dec. 15, 2017 may have bent the path of its price action somewhat, thereby disrupting the relationship, sort of like how the huge mass of the planet Jupiter can affect the orbital paths of the lesser planets, and create tides in the sun. And the arrival of bearish traders who finally had a way to short Bitcoin efficiently affected that market, and may have also affected how speculators were feeling about stocks too.\nBecause of that misalignment of the blowoff tops in Bitcoin and the DJIA, I adjusted the comparison several weeks ago, shortening the price offset to just 41 calendar days. That put the DJIA‚Äôs Jan. 26 top in alignment with Bitcoin‚Äôs December top. This new alignment seemed to work for a while during late January to early February, but lately it seems to be getting out of phase. The disruption from the introduction of Bitcoin futures appears to be fading in its influence. Right now, a lag time of 47 calendar days seems to best fit the current DJIA price data to Bitcoin‚Äôs earlier patterns. It may perhaps eventually work its way back to the 56-day offset which applied in 2017.\nIf this relationship stays settled into this 47 calendar day lag that the top chart shows, then that implies a decline for stocks toward a bottom due May 23, and then a rebound into June.

In 2013 they hit the USD$100 mark for the first time, before rising to USD$900 at the start of 2017. Today they are worth USD$12,000 (AUD$17,000). Thousands of amateur traders are now betting huge amounts, while start-up companies use bitcoin to raise money and avoid the transparency needed in a stock market float. But experts fear the currency has become a vast speculative bubble detached from reality. Watchdogs across the world have warned there could be a sudden massive crash if the market turns, losing investors billions of dollars. Economist Nouriel Roubini, who predicted the global financial crisis (GFC), is one who has called cryptocurrency a ‚Äògiant speculative bubble‚Äô bound to end in disaster. However cryptocurrency investors such as Mr Colosi and Mr Lenoci claim the price will continue to boom, potentially as high as USD$50,000 or AUD$100,000. Bitcoins are generated by using an open-source computer program to solve complex math problems. This process is known as ‚Äòmining‚Äô. Each Bitcoin has a unique fingerprint and is defined by a public address and a private key. Owners of bitcoin do not own a physical coin, but instead a string of numbers and letters that give a specific identity. Other types of coins are available online including Ethereum, LiteCoin, Neo and Monero ‚Äî these non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies are often called altcoins.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lenoci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nouriel roubini", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gfc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T19:56:08.094+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a9d2723b3db90f50343e0d7b45ebdb657e6cf28d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHLCKC01H_ftpOxMsahWxfOpFj5ho7LiN1FaENpIbZC__xXLqfwAIrGI8pMMDMv6MmWeZsTJna5o0Pl9gr1umcLO", "site_full": "wegobusiness.com", "site": "wegobusiness.com", "site_section": "http://wegobusiness.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "WeGoBusiness ‚Äì Top business stories from around the internet", "title": "Bitcoin ‚Äì Blockchain Security Takes Spotlight At NYC Innovation Summit", "title_full": "Bitcoin ‚Äì Blockchain Security Takes Spotlight At NYC Innovation Summit", "published": "2018-05-12T17:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://abitco.in/wp-content/themes/newspapertimes-codebase/icon/delicious.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a9d2723b3db90f50343e0d7b45ebdb657e6cf28d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHLCKC01H_ftpOxMsahWxfOpFj5ho7LiN1FaENpIbZC__xXLqfwAIrGI8pMMDMv6MmWeZsTJna5o0Pl9gr1umcLO", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "WeGoBusiness - Digital Business Academy", "published": "2018-05-12T17:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin ‚Äì Blockchain Security Takes Spotlight At NYC Innovation Summit", "text": "Bitcoin ‚Äì Blockchain Security Takes Spotlight At NYC Innovation Summit 12 May 2018\nShare This Tags\nBlockchain use cases, but also the technologies vulnerabilities, were discussed at length at the CDX Academy‚Äôs Blockchain forum on Friday.\nRead more ‚Äì> click here all content is copyright Coin Desk.\nNeed Bitcoin marketing and PR?

Author: Michael King Published: 9:52 AM EDT May 12, 2018 Updated: 10:07 AM EDT May 12, 2018\nCUMMING, Ga. -- The Forsyth County Sheriff's Office said five men had conspired to break into a Forsyth County home and steal nearly $1 million in Bitcoin. Their robbery investigation has been ongoing since January, 2018.\nOn Monday, January 29, the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office Narcotics Unit responded to a local hotel in connection with what was initially thought to be a drug investigation. Narcotics detectives made contact with four males who had zip ties, latex gloves, duct tape and bandanas in their possession.\nMajor Crimes Unit detectives also responded to the hotel. Due to a lack of sufficient evidence, the four males were released from custody.\nAdditional investigation that night linked the four males to a planned robbery of a Forsyth County homeowner. After detectives were able to secure arrest warrants, they moved to arrest the four -- Trivette Adams, Matthew Schwartz, Jacob South and Michael McDermont.\nOfficers found Adams and McDermont on Tuesday, January 30 near Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, attempting to leave the area by plane. Adams fled from deputies, but was apprehended after a brief foot chase.\nSouth and Schwartz fled metro Atlanta, flying to Chicago before they could be caught by police. The Forsyth County Sheriff's Office sent two Major Crimes Unit detectives to Chicago where they were able to extradite the pair with the assistance of the Chicago Police Department.\nA fifth suspect, Justin Ellison of Illinois, was interviewed by detectives in Illinois and arrested following additional investigation on May 11, 2018.\nTrivette Adams, 20, of Pflugerville, Tex., has been charged with residential strong arm robbery and criminal trespass; Robert South, 21, of Norcross has been charged with residential strong arm robbery; Matthew Schwartz, 18, of Hesperia, Calif., has been charged with residential strong arm robbery; Michael McDermott, 18, has been charged with residential strong arm robbery and criminal trespass; Justin Ellison, 20, of Worth, Ill., has been charged with residential strong arm robbery and conspiracy to commit a felony.\nAll five suspects are being held in the Forsyth County Detention Center without bond. ¬© 2018 WXIA", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael king", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "major crimes unit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forsyth county sheriff's office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forsyth county sheriff's office narcotics unit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin forsyth county sherif", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forsyth county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ga.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T17:15:14.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "33c9eedccc9ced660d8dfd503b3acc61ad289b42", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcVtqC0oJB6Evu78eG_GAqs-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=8.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Trading Discussion", "title": "Is trading Bitcoin and other alts still profitable?", "title_full": "Is trading Bitcoin and other alts still profitable?", "published": "2018-05-12T17:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.052, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "33c9eedccc9ced660d8dfd503b3acc61ad289b42", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmcVtqC0oJB6Evu78eG_GAqs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sedahan13", "published": "2018-05-12T17:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is trading Bitcoin and other alts still profitable?", "text": "In my opinion is hard to make consistent profit from crypto trading, high volatility and price manipulation make hard to predict price of crypto.

Bitbond uses cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to bypass the Swift international transfer system to lend money across the globe rapidly and at low cost.\n\"Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,\" Albrecht told Reuters TV in his office in Berlin's fashionable neighborhood Prenzlauer Berg. \"With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.\"\nClients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally.\nAlbrecht's service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013. His office employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month.\nMost clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don't exceed 50,000 dollars. In 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since.\nAdoption of Bitcoin has been rapid in Germany.

But skeptics of the move are wondering what‚Äôs the ‚Äúmore than meets the eye‚Äù aspect of the equation.\nSubscribe to the Bitsonline YouTube channel for more great interviews featuring industry insiders & experts\nHuawei Pivots Toward Bitcoin\nThe Shenzen-based company is the second biggest manufacturer of mobile phones in the world, having already surpassed Apple. Huawei sold over 150 million devices in 2017 and the addition of a pre-loaded bitcoin wallet means hundreds of millions of customers will have access to cryptocurrencies without needing to download a separate application. Yup its there pic.twitter.com/MtoC5Ic5uQ\n‚Äî Misterch0c (@MisterCh0c) May 10, 2018\nThe default integration by Huawei stands in stark contrast to the battles the bitcoin industry has fought with Apple, who at one stage in 2014 removed the ‚ÄúBlockchain‚Äù wallet from the App Store. Many believe the decision was made in order to push their own mobile payments platform, Apple Pay.\nIt is clear that Huawei sees mobile payments playing a much bigger role in the future and that cryptocurrencies will be a big part of that revolution. Jaime Gonzalo, Huawei‚Äôs VP of Mobile Services, commented that the pre-installation of a bitcoin wallet is ‚Äú the tip of the spear of mobile payments, we expect to see massive growth in global cryptocurrency adoption habits in the near future.‚Äù\nThe ‚ÄòBut‚Äô Part ‚Ä¶\nWhile this is unequivocably good news for cryptocurrency due to the fact Jihan Wu‚Äôs Bitmain owns the BTC.com wallet and mining operations, it can be expected that many people will be suspicious. The divide between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash will become part of the debate, surely, however it should be noted that any partnership between Bitmain and Huawei, two companies at the forefront of their respective markets, is a major victory for the industry as a whole and another step on the road towards cryptocurrencies becoming entrenched in the world‚Äôs social fabric. Some comments\n1. Huawei shipped ~153M smartphones last year. (Samsung ~317M, Apple ~215M)2. Huawei is the number one manufacturer in China.3. Bitmain owns https://t.co/u0Gw0i7eyJ so it will support BCH as well.4. This is a big deal, puts bitcoin wallets in millions of hands.\n‚Äî Matt Odell (@matt_odell) May 10, 2018\nFrom a strategy standpoint, if Huawei‚Äôs partnership with BTC.com‚Äôs wallet proves to be a success, that may mean other mobile manufacturers with their own operating systems, like Apple or Google, may follow suit. There you have it. It's a safe bet that Apple will be integrating Bitcoin into iOS as I suggested it should in 2014, now that a Chinese maker is set to dominate. If they have'nt been working on a wallet in secret, they are going to need one. Fast.

The plan is worth a mention, especially on the backdrop of the crypto ban imposed by the social media network. In Saturday‚Äôs Bitcoin in Brief, we also cover Telegram‚Äôs advance towards implementing its payment system using the Gram token. Some blockchain stories with beers and beamers complete today‚Äôs round-up.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Friday: China Mulls Blockchain Standard, Zcash Fights Chinese ASICs Facebook Mulls Own Token, Reports Say\nFacebook is reportedly considering creating its own cryptocurrency. Sources familiar with the matter told the financial news outlet Cheddar that the social media giant is serious about the project to introduce global crypto payments on its platform. A digital token would allow its two billion users around the world to take advantage of crypto transactions and skip state-issued fiat currencies.\nFacebook announced recently that it had formed a team whose main task will be to explore the uses for blockchain technologies that the company can utilize to improve its business. The group is headed by David Marcus, former head of Facebook Messenger and ex-president of Paypal, who currently sits on the board of Coinbase.\nThe development of the payments system, however, is likely to take some time, possibly years. Marcus, who is a crypto enthusiast and an early investor, has been quoted as saying that crypto payments are still very slow and expensive. Facebook is not planning to hold an initial coin offering (ICO) to fund the project. In January, the social network banned crypto-related ads, including advertisements of token sales. Telegram Moving Forward with Crypto Payments\nTelegram , on the other hand, has already raised enough money to fund its own blockchain project and payment system. The messaging service, which is popular with the crypto community, has already attracted $1.7 billion dollars to finance its Telegram Open Network (TON). The company, founded by Russian entrepreneur Pavel Durov, has decided to call off a planned public ICO.\nAccording to Russian media reports, Telegram is now conducting closed tests of a new service designed to store users‚Äô information and documents for verification purposes. Telegram Passport will be used to keep personal details and copies of IDs, banking statements, and utility bills which will be used to identify users on Telegram‚Äôs blockchain TON.\nThe identity verification feature is needed to facilitate payments using Telegram‚Äôs own crypto token called Gram. Once uploaded, the personal information can be potentially shared with partners within the platform, but also on their systems. Telegram Passport, which should be launched by the summer, is expected to prevent anonymous crypto payments. Crypto Beer Vending Machine to Check Age\nCivic, a San-Francisco-based startup, has recently announced plans to introduce a ‚Äúcrypto beer vending machine.‚Äù The project, which will be realized in partnership with a leading US beer producer, aims to also prove that blockchain can be used to verify if a thirsty guy or girl have 21 years of age to legally consume the alcoholic beverage.

BMW Tracking Mileage on a Blockchain\nAnother blockchain partnership aims to track the mileage of cars. A team at BMW, the German automobile manufacturer, has been tasked with finding a way to better preserve the resale value of vehicles leased by the company. Collecting reliable data for the mileage, amortization and maintenance of these cars is crucial for achieving the best price on the second-hand market.\nThe blockchain startup DOVU has been invited by BMW to establish a partnership with Alphabet, the auto giant‚Äôs leasing and fleet vehicle branch, and BMW‚Äôs Innovation Lab in order to develop a system to collect and keep record of the important information. The companies behind the project hope to also evaluate how effective tokenization can be in encouraging customers‚Äô cooperation.\nIn a pilot program implemented by the partners, BMW drivers are prompted by a custom wallet app to take a picture of their dashboards once a week. All submissions are added to DOVU‚Äôs blockchain which is used by Alphabet to compile consistent and unalterable data reflecting the exploitation of the vehicles. The information is then used to assess the mileage and the depreciation of the used cars and ultimately determine their resale value.\nWhat do you think of today‚Äôs Bitcoin in Brief stories?

The plan is worth a mention, especially on the backdrop of the crypto ban imposed by the social media network. In Saturday's Bitcoin in Brief, we also cover Telegram's advance towards implementing its payment system using the Gram token. Some blockchain stories with beers and beamers complete today's round-up.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Friday: China Mulls Blockchain Standard, Zcash Fights Chinese ASICs\nFacebook Mulls Own Token, Reports Say Facebook is reportedly considering creating its own cryptocurrency. Sources familiar with the matter told the financial news outlet Cheddar that the social media giant is serious about the project to introduce global crypto payments on its platform. A digital token would allow its two billion users around the world to take advantage of crypto transactions and skip state-issued fiat currencies.\nFacebook announced recently that it had formed a team whose main task will be to explore the uses for blockchain technologies that the company can utilize to improve its business. The group is headed by David Marcus, former head of Facebook Messenger and ex-president of Paypal, who currently sits on the board of Coinbase.\nThe development of the payments system, however, is likely to take some time, possibly years. Marcus, who is a crypto enthusiast and an early investor, has been quoted as saying that crypto payments are still very slow and expensive. Facebook is not planning to hold an initial coin offering (ICO) to fund the project. In January, the social network banned crypto-related ads, including advertisements of token sales.\nTelegram Moving Forward with Crypto Payments Telegram , on the other hand, has already raised enough money to fund its own blockchain project and payment system. The messaging service, which is popular with the crypto community, has already attracted $1.7 billion dollars to finance its Telegram Open Network (TON). The company, founded by Russian entrepreneur Pavel Durov, has decided to call off a planned public ICO.\nAccording to Russian media reports, Telegram is now conducting closed tests of a new service designed to store users' information and documents for verification purposes. Telegram Passport will be used to keep personal details and copies of IDs, banking statements, and utility bills which will be used to identify users on Telegram's blockchain TON.\nThe identity verification feature is needed to facilitate payments using Telegram's own crypto token called Gram. Once uploaded, the personal information can be potentially shared with partners within the platform, but also on their systems. Telegram Passport, which should be launched by the summer, is expected to prevent anonymous crypto payments.\nCrypto Beer Vending Machine to Check Age Civic, a San-Francisco-based startup, has recently announced plans to introduce a \"crypto beer vending machine.\" The project, which will be realized in partnership with a leading US beer producer, aims to also prove that blockchain can be used to verify if a thirsty guy or girl have 21 years of age to legally consume the alcoholic beverage. To get a cold can, one has to install Civic's app on their smartphone, verify their ID, and then walk up to the machine, Futurism reports. The project's success depends on the readiness of government authorities to accept identity verification performed on a blockchain.

You are also able to get a summary of all of the transactions and hence, there's transparency in the computer system.\nAs a consequence, there's a fundamental minimum guarantee related to them. With Bitcoin, there's zero or very limited quantity of transaction fees. Bitcoin has been in a position to boost its reach and transaction volume also.

Charges of lacking transparency are equivalent to mortal sins in the cryptocurrency space. Ethereum too is particularly sensitive about accusations along these lines, especially in the ongoing light of a possible US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) crackdown. Mr. Buterin and his supporters are fighting back. Also read: Venezuela‚Äôs President Launches Crypto Funded Youth Bank, Encourages Mining Farms Ethereum‚Äôs Vitalik Buterin Responds to Critics And there it was, as Mr. Buterin, skeletal boy genius behind Ethereum, took to Twitter: ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] it was organized without my permission or even involvement [‚Ä¶.]‚Äù The turn of phrase, without my permission , might well haunt him in the days and months to come. It presupposes his benevolence, of course. What was it organized sans Mr. Buterin‚Äôs blessing or presense? The ‚Äúit‚Äù was a recent meeting in Toronto, Canada of Ethereum players, promptly blasted by Catallaxy co-founder and Satoshi Portal CEO (Bylls) Francis Pouliot. He described the event as a ‚ÄúSecret meeting of Ethereum management committee,‚Äù in a Tweetstorm for the ages, continuing about how ‚Äúblockchain governance rules were decided by the stakeholders.‚Äù The entire Ethereum project of late has come under ecosystem scrutiny due to SEC regulators in the United States set to determine its legal fate. Ethereum judged a security, and therefore subject to regulatory jurisdiction as a public company, could conceivably rock much of the crypto world. A healthy majority of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and smart contract platforms are dependent upon ERC20 tokenization. The not even three-year-old tech is many a developer‚Äôs choice, allowing for ease of integration and largely trusted. It is unclear, as of this writing, exactly what implications are carried with an unfavorable SEC determination, but most analysts believe it to be negative at least in the short run. Indeed, most ICOs openly forbid US citizens‚Äô participation in anticipation of odious regulations and subpoenas. Ethereum as an Insane, Plutocratic Government ‚ÄúThis is insane,‚Äù Mr. Pouliot insisted. ‚ÄúThey are establishing a plutocratic government. This has provably failed with Bitcoin (UASF/NO2X). Does anybody even care?‚Äù The evidence marshalled for the slam came from a lone news source, which described the event in worrying terms, according to Mr. Pouliot‚Äôs reading. And it does appear discussions about decentralization, mining, scarcity, and the infamous cases of frozen funds were had in Toronto. However, the cryptosphere seemed unconvinced about a cabal, and took Mr. Pouliot to task. Principal Lane Rettig argued ‚ÄúThe event was not secret, in fact we livestreamed a lot of it. We also did a public AMA. There is no ‚ÄòEthereum management committee‚Äô and no rules were made. Please get your facts right. Your message is intellectually dishonest.‚Äù Mr. Pouliot shot back paraphrasing attributed to Mr. Rettig, and the thread continued along those lines. Vitalik Buterin was eventually compelled to address the issue as it gained traction among the other rumors and news surrounding Ethereum. ‚ÄúI was not at this meeting,‚Äù Mr. Buterin tweeted in response , ‚Äúit was organized without my permission or even involvement, and I honestly don‚Äôt really know much about what happened there.‚Äù In what might be considered a classic Twitter tangent, Mr. Buterin was sucked, then again, into another side argument about privacy coins and the phenomenon of maximalism. Asked his opinion of Monero, he insisted, ‚ÄúIf I was doing anything seriously privacy-demanding I‚Äôd probably go for Zcash first.‚Äù This brought further rebuke from privacy coin guru Rhett Creighton, himself the subject of much derision lately, who snarkily wrote in response, ‚ÄúSays the paid Zcash advisor,‚Äù landing him in a strange bedfellows situation with polemicist Whale Panda . News of potential regulation and very public Twitter flames might have also contributed to an immediate dip of roughly 5% in the price of ether, but it seems to have recovered at time of publication. https://news.bitcoin.com/ethereum-founder-responds-to-charges-of-insane-plutocratic-governance/?utm_source=OneSignal%20Push&utm_medium=notification&utm_campaign=Push%20Notifications ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vitalik buterin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buterin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi p", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "encourages mining farms ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto funded youth bank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T16:23:40.056+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0ea314f4f514cecc6342462654baddc69d7a1b52", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va71EusZXwwynva.pzDv00lsfU5oCQQM9QMEnFdmCdQz3AkF76YD3gRTwHALHgvyjTFLfwD8UuXaG4Tj1edXdWdcSwwiZUN5A29w--", "site_full": "bitcoin.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Bitcoin Stack Exchange", "title": "Trying to open an old bitcoin core wallet.dat file fails", "title_full": "Trying to open an old bitcoin core wallet.dat file fails", "published": "2018-05-12T16:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/bitcoin/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=462e8b9b382b", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 179, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4, "comments": 0, "shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0ea314f4f514cecc6342462654baddc69d7a1b52", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va71EusZXwwynva.pzDv00lsfU5oCQQM9QMEnFdmCdQz3AkF76YD3gRTwHALHgvyjTFLfwD8UuXaG4Tj1edXdWdcSwwiZUN5A29w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lior Lower", "published": "2018-05-12T16:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Trying to open an old bitcoin core wallet.dat file fails", "text": "up vote 0 down vote\nThere are probably other ways, but I tried this a while back with an old wallet.dat from ~2013 and it worked.

Reclaiming disk space . Let‚Äôs take it from there. 7. Reclaiming disk space Each transaction size varies depending on the number of Inputs/Outputs. A good rule of thumb for transaction size calculation is: n_inputs*180B + n_outputs*34B + 10B + (+-n_inputs) According to tradeblock.com the average transaction size since 2014 is around 520 Bytes. There are around 277 Million transactions for that period. Excluding the size of the blocks it would mean that storing all these transactions would occupy ~144 GB. In reality they occupy ~150GB. Quite a lot if you want to interact within your smartphone! The block header with no transactions occupies ~80 Bytes. The number of blocks for the same period is ~240,000 which occupies a total of 19MB. Such size sounds much more competitive. How could we get rid of transactions while preserving correctness? If we are able to reduce all transactions ( Tx0 to Tx3 ) to a single hash ( root hash ) we would save the mentioned disk space without breaking the blocks hashes. For that, we must be able to relate all transactions to each other, which we can do efficiently through a Merkle Tree. Merkle tree If you are familiar with binary trees this concept is trivial. The leaf nodes (Hash0, Hash1, ‚Ä¶) are a hash function applied to some data (in this case Tx0, Tx1, etc‚Ä¶). Upper nodes (Hash01, Hash23) are just a hash function applied to the concatenation of their respective children hashes. The Root Hash is the upper-most hash which is included in the block header and ensures what transactions are present. Why don‚Äôt we just concatenate all hashes one after the other and produce the root hash out of that string? Well, if we wanted to validate if a transaction is part of a block which has many transactions, a Merkle Tree would allow us to do it in logarithmic cost compared to getting all hashes. Can we verify/do payments without a copy of the transactions? 8. Simplified Payment Verification Supposing we have a thin client which doesn‚Äôt have access to the transactions but only block headers, we must find a way to validate that a specific transaction is valid. Such a node can get the longest proof-of-work chain at the moment (from several thick nodes) and request the Merkle Tree branch where the transaction is supposed to be. Once the node knows the transaction is part of the chain and that there are blocks after it he can conclude it was a valid transaction as it was accepted by other thick nodes. As long as we are asking honest nodes this scheme will work. If that‚Äôs not the case Satoshi proposes an alerting system whenever an invalid block is detected by some node. Check a thin client (bitcoinj) security model here 9. Combining and Splitting value As described in Part 1 a transaction isn‚Äôt referring to 1 input‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää1 output exclusively, there might be more. A simple example is when Bob has 1 bitcoin and sends 0.5 to Alice. That transaction has an input of 1 bitcoin and two outputs of 0.5 each (one for Alice and the change for Bob, otherwise he would loose it as transaction fee). When a transaction depends on many transactions and those depend on others we don‚Äôt have to worry about traversing the hole tree as the latest transaction outputs are an aggregate of how much coins are left. 10. Privacy Privacy model in Bitcoin Traditional banking achieves privacy by limiting access to what transactions are going on and the parties involved. As we have mentioned, bitcoin has to announce publicly every transaction so this scheme isn‚Äôt possible anymore. Privacy can be achieved by keeping public keys anonymous and/or using addresses instead. A good practice is to use a new key pair / address for each transaction to make it harder to link coin movement to a common owner. Still there is a risk for multiple input transactions as you could think that the coins are coming from the same source, and when revealing one address you could infer the owner of the others. 11. Calculations If we suppose an attacker could get more power than the honest nodes he can alter the chain. He can‚Äôt alter it in any way he wants, as honest nodes wouldn‚Äôt accept an invalid transaction/block (such as sending other people money to himself or creating money out of thin air). The only option is to alter the outputs of his latest transactions or revert them (the bigger the chain after the transaction the more proof of work is required to generate the longest valid chain ). What are the numbers? The math behind the results shows that the probability of the attacker catching up decreases exponentially the more blocks are confirmed: P = probability of the attacker to catch up (0.1%) q = probability of the attacker finding next block (10%, 15%, ‚Ä¶) z = number of block confirmations These numbers tell us the that the more CPU power an attacker has (q) the more confirmations we have to wait (5, 8, ‚Ä¶) to know that the probability of the attacker catching up with the chain will be < 0.1%. This sounds like the chance for an attack is pretty low given the constantly growing size of nodes within the network but remains a risk for newly created PoW based chains. Check bitcoin weaknesses if you want an extended overview of what could go wrong. 12. Conclusion The paper proposes an electronic transactions system that relies on distrust. Ownership is proven by digital signatures while double-spending is mitigated through the PoW-based P2P network. All rules and incentives are enforced within the network consensus. Bad actors are penalized while honest ones are rewarded. Bitcoin is based on distrust although most users still rely on 3rd party services such as Coinbase .

The plan is worth a mention, especially on the backdrop of the crypto ban imposed by the social media network. In Saturday's Bitcoin in Brief, we also cover Telegram's advance towards implementing its payment system using the Gram token. Some blockchain stories with beers and beamers complete today's round-up.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Friday: China Mulls Blockchain Standard, Zcash Fights Chinese ASICs\nFacebook Mulls Own Token, Reports Say Facebook is reportedly considering creating its own cryptocurrency. Sources familiar with the matter told the financial news outlet Cheddar that the social media giant is serious about the project to introduce global crypto payments on its platform. A digital token would allow its two billion users around the world to take advantage of crypto transactions and skip state-issued fiat currencies.\nFacebook announced recently that it had formed a team whose main task will be to explore the uses for blockchain technologies that the company can utilize to improve its business. The group is headed by David Marcus, former head of Facebook Messenger and ex-president of Paypal, who currently sits on the board of Coinbase.\nThe development of the payments system, however, is likely to take some time, possibly years. Marcus, who is a crypto enthusiast and an early investor, has been quoted as saying that crypto payments are still very slow and expensive. Facebook is not planning to hold an initial coin offering (ICO) to fund the project. In January, the social network banned crypto-related ads, including advertisements of token sales.\nTelegram Moving Forward with Crypto Payments Telegram , on the other hand, has already raised enough money to fund its own blockchain project and payment system. The messaging service, which is popular with the crypto community, has already attracted $1.7 billion dollars to finance its Telegram Open Network (TON). The company, founded by Russian entrepreneur Pavel Durov, has decided to call off a planned public ICO.\nAccording to Russian media reports, Telegram is now conducting closed tests of a new service designed to store users' information and documents for verification purposes. Telegram Passport will be used to keep personal details and copies of IDs, banking statements, and utility bills which will be used to identify users on Telegram's blockchain TON.\nThe identity verification feature is needed to facilitate payments using Telegram's own crypto token called Gram. Once uploaded, the personal information can be potentially shared with partners within the platform, but also on their systems. Telegram Passport, which should be launched by the summer, is expected to prevent anonymous crypto payments.\nCrypto Beer Vending Machine to Check Age Civic, a San-Francisco-based startup, has recently announced plans to introduce a \"crypto beer vending machine.\" The project, which will be realized in partnership with a leading US beer producer, aims to also prove that blockchain can be used to verify if a thirsty guy or girl have 21 years of age to legally consume the alcoholic beverage. To get a cold can, one has to install Civic's app on their smartphone, verify their ID, and then walk up to the machine, Futurism reports. The project's success depends on the readiness of government authorities to accept identity verification performed on a blockchain. Civic's beer vending machine is still a prototype.\nBMW Tracking Mileage on a Blockchain Another blockchain partnership aims to track the mileage of cars. A team at BMW, the German automobile manufacturer, has been tasked with finding a way to better preserve the resale value of vehicles leased by the company. Collecting reliable data for the mileage, amortization and maintenance of these cars is crucial for achieving the best price on the second-hand market.\nThe blockchain startup DOVU has been invited by BMW to establish a partnership with Alphabet, the auto giant's leasing and fleet vehicle branch, and BMW's Innovation Lab in order to develop a system to collect and keep record of the important information. The companies behind the project hope to also evaluate how effective tokenization can be in encouraging customers' cooperation.\nIn a pilot program implemented by the partners, BMW drivers are prompted by a custom wallet app to take a picture of their dashboards once a week. All submissions are added to DOVU's blockchain which is used by Alphabet to compile consistent and unalterable data reflecting the exploitation of the vehicles. The information is then used to assess the mileage and the depreciation of the used cars and ultimately determine their resale value.\nWhat do you think of today's Bitcoin in Brief stories?

The plan is worth a mention, especially on the backdrop of the crypto ban imposed by the social media network. In Saturday‚Äôs Bitcoin in Brief, we also cover Telegram‚Äôs advance towards implementing its payment system using the Gram token. Some blockchain stories with beers and beamers complete today‚Äôs round-up.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Friday: China Mulls Blockchain Standard, Zcash Fights Chinese ASICs Facebook Mulls Own Token, Reports Say\nFacebook is reportedly considering creating its own cryptocurrency. Sources familiar with the matter told the financial news outlet Cheddar that the social media giant is serious about the project to introduce global crypto payments on its platform. A digital token would allow its two billion users around the world to take advantage of crypto transactions and skip state-issued fiat currencies.\nFacebook announced recently that it had formed a team whose main task will be to explore the uses for blockchain technologies that the company can utilize to improve its business. The group is headed by David Marcus, former head of Facebook Messenger and ex-president of Paypal, who currently sits on the board of Coinbase.\nThe development of the payments system, however, is likely to take some time, possibly years. Marcus, who is a crypto enthusiast and an early investor, has been quoted as saying that crypto payments are still very slow and expensive. Facebook is not planning to hold an initial coin offering (ICO) to fund the project. In January, the social network banned crypto-related ads, including advertisements of token sales. Telegram Moving Forward with Crypto Payments\nTelegram , on the other hand, has already raised enough money to fund its own blockchain project and payment system. The messaging service, which is popular with the crypto community, has already attracted $1.7 billion dollars to finance its Telegram Open Network (TON). The company, founded by Russian entrepreneur Pavel Durov, has decided to call off a planned public ICO.\nAccording to Russian media reports, Telegram is now conducting closed tests of a new service designed to store users‚Äô information and documents for verification purposes. Telegram Passport will be used to keep personal details and copies of IDs, banking statements, and utility bills which will be used to identify users on Telegram‚Äôs blockchain TON.\nThe identity verification feature is needed to facilitate payments using Telegram‚Äôs own crypto token called Gram. Once uploaded, the personal information can be potentially shared with partners within the platform, but also on their systems. Telegram Passport, which should be launched by the summer, is expected to prevent anonymous crypto payments. Crypto Beer Vending Machine to Check Age\nCivic, a San-Francisco-based startup, has recently announced plans to introduce a ‚Äúcrypto beer vending machine.‚Äù The project, which will be realized in partnership with a leading US beer producer, aims to also prove that blockchain can be used to verify if a thirsty guy or girl have 21 years of age to legally consume the alcoholic beverage. To get a cold can, one has to install Civic‚Äôs app on their smartphone, verify their ID, and then walk up to the machine, Futurism reports. The project‚Äôs success depends on the readiness of government authorities to accept identity verification performed on a blockchain. Civic‚Äôs beer vending machine is still a prototype. BMW Tracking Mileage on a Blockchain\nAnother blockchain partnership aims to track the mileage of cars. A team at BMW, the German automobile manufacturer, has been tasked with finding a way to better preserve the resale value of vehicles leased by the company. Collecting reliable data for the mileage, amortization and maintenance of these cars is crucial for achieving the best price on the second-hand market.\nThe blockchain startup DOVU has been invited by BMW to establish a partnership with Alphabet, the auto giant‚Äôs leasing and fleet vehicle branch, and BMW‚Äôs Innovation Lab in order to develop a system to collect and keep record of the important information. The companies behind the project hope to also evaluate how effective tokenization can be in encouraging customers‚Äô cooperation.\nIn a pilot program implemented by the partners, BMW drivers are prompted by a custom wallet app to take a picture of their dashboards once a week. All submissions are added to DOVU‚Äôs blockchain which is used by Alphabet to compile consistent and unalterable data reflecting the exploitation of the vehicles. The information is then used to assess the mileage and the depreciation of the used cars and ultimately determine their resale value.\nWhat do you think of today‚Äôs Bitcoin in Brief stories?

Decentralization ensures the security, transparency and integrity of all transactions in the network. But are the popular cryptocurrency exchanges really decentralized, and safe? Most DEX‚Äôs are not able to accept BTC without using an unreliable gateway between the two blockchains. Exploring the Token Swap Ecosystem\nThere are several different types of DEX (Decentralised Exchange) such as pseudo-decentralized, working in the Ethereum network only, for example projects that link blockchains to each other using their own tokens, and decentralized exchanges that use ‚ÄúHashed Timelock Contracts‚Äù.\nEarlier, it was common knowledge that a crypto exchange that did not store user keys, and was decentralized and therefore safe. However, most of these exchanges are built on a single blockchain, which makes them vulnerable ‚Äì in order to get funds from the Bitcoin network to such a crypto exchange for example, one needs to use a gateway, which takes bitcoin and produces a ‚Äúholding‚Äù kind of bitcoins in another network in return. A similar principle lies with Ethereum-based exchanges, for example, EtherDelta. Security: Paramount\nDevotees of centralization believe that storing private keys on a secure server is safer than storing encrypted keys in the user‚Äôs browser. However, if a central server is hacked, everything will be stolen (as it was with a million bitcoins), and paranoids can remove signing of transactions from the browser into the application on the computer and encrypt it.\nSince all code is executed in the user‚Äôs browser, the greatest risk is the intrusion of extraneous scripts into the code. It is likely to be made by the extensions the user installed in the browser, or by a hosting provider.\nTo prevent such attacks, Swap.Online will use cloudflare.com together with Workers, a solution that, in response to any request to the domain, sends a ‚ÄúContent Security Policy‚Äù header with the hash of the JS code allowed for execution in the user‚Äôs browser. Thus, server hacking and most attacks based on the introduction of malicious code will be eliminated. To understand how this works, see the video of the system operation below, or try to make an exchange yourself at https://alpha.swap.online . The Swap Online Platform\nBy using Bitcoin.js, web3.js, and the libp2p library in IPFS, Swap.Online created a cross-blockchain swap system directly in the browser. The full details of the system can be found below: The solution operates on an average 2 to 10 times faster than the existing stock exchanges (taking into account the time to deposit and withdraw funds). On average, the exchange takes 2 to 3 minutes. Swap Online does not store secret user keys. Moreover, even messages between users do not pass through our servers (we use IPFS ). The exchange works right in the browser ‚Äì users do not need to download or install anything. The platform already works between the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, with Tether, and Lightning Network planned. Theoretically, Swap Online is able to work with most cryptocurrencies, except for those where there is no scripting language. Even for currencies like Monero, solutions will be created over time.\nThe source code of the exchange is published in GitHub , and the protocol is distributed as Open Source. The AirDrop is scheduled for June 30th.\nThe Swap.Online team is also engaged in commercial implementation and release of related products: For the B2C market (swap.online) : Exchange solution for BTC -> ERC20 (with an orderbook and a reputation system) For the B2B market (b2b.swap.online) : Widget in the form of html code, which allows accepting any cryptocurrencies directly in the wallet of the site owner by sending tokens in return. The solution has a confirmed demand both from projects in the crowdfunding stage and from those who are already making a real product. For large holders of cryptocurrencies: Ability to safely exchange cryptocurrency without bringing it to centralized exchanges (by replenishing the account only during the exchange). As part of research, the possibility of using the solution as a bridge for the sidechains is being studied.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://github.com/swaponline/swap", "https://ipfs.io/", "http://b2b.swap.online/", "http://swap.online/", "https://alpha.swap.online/", "https://wiki.swap.online/decentralized-exchange-of-bitcoins-for-altcoins-right-in-the-browser-live-demo/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dex", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T16:04:54.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "470227be4d5765eb89f2be269c6a6b2def07ec7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWjOrVwoand9T2lHpGsKdIZZVJzo3AV0SbfjXsfL8XmrKGP4bqTjLbFD48COBnsWB3BB_ZzWDiX7zFvOu9U_fTA6U1E4ruu7I62FcuLejZqA--", "site_full": "wahabali786.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://wahabali786.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Tips and Tricks About Computer And More", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Saturday: ‚ÄúSocial‚Äù Coins, Crypto Vending, Blockchain Mileage", "title_full": "Bitcoin in Brief Saturday: ‚ÄúSocial‚Äù Coins, Crypto Vending, Blockchain Mileage", "published": "2018-05-12T15:56:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "470227be4d5765eb89f2be269c6a6b2def07ec7b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWjOrVwoand9T2lHpGsKdIZZVJzo3AV0SbfjXsfL8XmrKGP4bqTjLbFD48COBnsWB3BB_ZzWDiX7zFvOu9U_fTA6U1E4ruu7I62FcuLejZqA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "OS Tech Tips (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-12T15:56:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin in Brief Saturday: ‚ÄúSocial‚Äù Coins, Crypto Vending, Blockchain Mileage", "text": "Reports suggest that Facebook may develop its own crypto.

A huge problem in fact. The world woke up to how widespread Bitcoin hacking was when the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange based in Tokyo, was hacked in 2014 and 850,000 bitcoins stolen.\nThe Mt. Gox hack was the biggest in history‚Ä¶ so far, but there have been countless other high profile crypto hacks happening on an all too regular basis. By the end of 2017, some $400 million worth of funds were stolen from $3.7 billion raised in ICOs between 2015 and 2017. Bitfloor had 24000 bitcoins stolen from a hack. Bitstamp had 19,000 BTC stolen from a hack and in August 2016, Bitfinex was hacked and 120,000 bitcoins stolen. photo https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page\nThe difficulty with blockchain technology is that it is still very much an unknown quantity. If it‚Äôs possible to hack big exchanges, then it is possible to hack anyone and steal their Bitcoins. Well, one guy is trying to change all that.\nCoinSafety is the brainchild of George Schiro, a software engineer working in the field of digital identity management. A holder of Bitcoin himself since January 2014, George worked on solutions to the increasing number of hacks of digital currencies.\nThe release of his MakeCoinSafe guide provides the broadest guide yet to preventing hacks. The easy to follow steps ensure the safety of digital wallets and prevent hacking of any kind. Designed for those already holding a cryptocurrency, George Schiro‚Äôs guide provides a way to have your own bank, where the money is secure and in your possession 100% of the time.\nAlthough designed more for holders rather day traders of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and for those that already know what is Bitcoin , the guide offers a lot of use to the majority of Bitcoin owners.\nHacking is seen as one of the biggest obstacles to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, being taken seriously by the public at large as an alternative to fiat money. Security in the blockchain world is yet to be fully developed. As more advancements in blockchain occur and the world is still very much in its infantile stage as far as blockchain and cryptocurrency world are concerned, security measures being implemented are not catching up quick enough with the blockchain developers.\nWith the number of ICOs increasing and the amount raised by ICOs so far this year ($6.3 billion) already surpassing last years $5.6 billion total, the public appetite for all things crypto is certainly not waning. Security is increasing and that is helping with crypto take up in general. It‚Äôs good that George Schiro provided his guide to prevent hacking as it can be prevented and should be prevented.\nAuthor: Jacob Maslow About the Author\nGuest Author - Outside contributors to the Dispatch are always welcome to offer their unique voices, contradictory opinions or presentation of information not included on the site.

Huobi and OKCoin ¬ó two other exchanges based in China ¬ó have announced similar plans to stop trading. To be clear: China has not banned the use of cryptocurrencies.

Bitbond uses cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to bypass the Swift international transfer system to lend money across the globe rapidly and at low cost.\n\"Traditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days,\" Albrecht told Reuters TV in his office in Berlin's fashionable neighbourhood Prenzlauer Berg. \"With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via Internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.\"\nClients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the cryptocurrencies' fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally.\nAlbrecht's service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013. His office employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month.\nMost clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don't exceed $50,000. In 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since.\nAdoption of Bitcoin has been rapid in Germany. It trails only the US, according to Bitnodes, which tracks the location of all the Bitcoin nodes that transmit data about new transactions.\n¬© Thomson Reuters 2018", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/submit?url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/online-bank-in-germany-uses-bitcoins-to-transfer-loans-1851260"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "radoslav albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prenzlauer berg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "online bank", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "transfer loans online bank", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trans", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reuters tv", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T16:10:50.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3bb69604fc073f01bc702c86c4100b8c9d9b562d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSaYCiElVFyFVYc7GLp1qmDP08xOK2m8LiPUHyr5dugXT3j03I4yYdQiCYjyxYGVW8cufR2wVyM0iBmXdgdLdB7hQc7AU7iBHQjneSIdxB2Qw--", "site_full": "mukiditrading.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://mukiditrading.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Mukidi Trading", "title": "CCN Tweeted: ‚ÄòAlmost Irresponsible‚Äô to Not Invest in Bitcoin: Billio...", "title_full": "CCN Tweeted: ‚ÄòAlmost Irresponsible‚Äô to Not Invest in Bitcoin: Billio...", "published": "2018-05-12T15:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3bb69604fc073f01bc702c86c4100b8c9d9b562d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSaYCiElVFyFVYc7GLp1qmDP08xOK2m8LiPUHyr5dugXT3j03I4yYdQiCYjyxYGVW8cufR2wVyM0iBmXdgdLdB7hQc7AU7iBHQjneSIdxB2Qw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Pemprov DKI Jakarta (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-12T15:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "CCN Tweeted: ‚ÄòAlmost Irresponsible‚Äô to Not Invest in Bitcoin: Billio...", "text": "OPEN Platform, Jeff, ICO Pass, iShook, Bulleon.io also Tweeted. 22 Your Highlights CCN @CryptoCoinsNews 'Almost Irresponsible' to Not Invest in Bitcoin: Billionaire Mike Novogratz 'Almost Irresponsible' to Not Invest in Bitcoin: Billionaire Mike Novogratz Billionaire bitcoin bull Michael Novogratz, founder and CEO of Galaxy Digital Capital Managem... more ccn.com 8 88 160 OPEN Platform @OpenPlatformICO Our event in Tokyo has concluded an it couldn't have been more successful.

fight poverty", "text": "$14 Million dollar raised as charity through Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Ripple [XRP] to fight poverty May 12, 2018\nLast week during the Annual Tipping Point Gala, the Tipping Point Community successfully raised over $14 Million for charity with help of all the major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Ripple [XRP].\nThe Tipping Point Community is a non-profit charitable and grant-making organization, founded by Daniel Lurie in 2005. The main objective of the organization is to break the cycle of poverty for the 1.3 million people living in the San Francisco Bay Area, and investing in the most promising solutions which could provide a nurturing early childhood, strong education, gainful employment, and secure housing.\nThe most interesting fact about the gala was that the Tipping Point was accepting BTC, ETH, and XRP as donations. They had announced that they would be converting the donations which were received as cryptocurrency to regular fiat currency over the next financial year.\nThe organization collaborates with the public sector to increase the impact and creating various policies for scalable change. The donations were done through a webpage in the program present during the event. The money was donated through a wristband which had a QR code. There were no paddles for the live auction also, when they wanted to donate, they just had to raise their hands. The donor‚Äôs name would instantly go to the screen at the center of the stage of the auction\nThe benefit gala was attended by more than 1000 people at the Bill Graham Civic Center, there was a mixture of tech giants, venture capitalists, socialites, and movers and shakers. The unbiased and unprejudiced attitude exhibited by Tipping point had got the attention of popular Crypto titans who were attending the benefit gala, this included the co-founder of Ripple, Chris Larsen, the CEO of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong and the CEO and founder of Pantera Captial Mangement.\nThe Tipping Point Community has managed to raise over $150 Million since it was first started in 2005. They are also welcoming pro-bono partners to provide services and expertise to fight against poverty.\nA cryptocurrency Investor Larry Evan tweeted:\n‚ÄúBy accepting Crypto Tipping Point Gala raised $14 million in donations.: The gala comprises the time that Tipping Point has accepted #cryptocurrency donations, with the event being attended by the respective #chiefexecutiveofficers of #coinbase, #Ripple‚Äù", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "daniel lurie", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tipping point community", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eth", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco bay area", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T17:37:35.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "38fa0e0e483870de47595d87e31f9f6de294f721", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzJTnq.XBNh8j3cPkoBkE2T_.jsBvExZfyEwNcrh5rwxDaK7CrILKEW1uth4OZ7ztPtZTPPFxsiRg--", "site_full": "feedproxy.google.com", "site": "google.com", "site_section": "http://www.xbt.money/feed", "site_categories": ["advertising", "business"], "section_title": "XBT.MONEY", "title": "Bitcoin Magazine‚Äôs Week in Review: Markets, Miners and Conferences", "title_full": "Bitcoin Magazine‚Äôs Week in Review: Markets, Miners and Conferences", "published": "2018-05-12T15:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.xbt.money/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bitcoin-magazine-week-in-review3.width-800-660x330.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "38fa0e0e483870de47595d87e31f9f6de294f721", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzJTnq.XBNh8j3cPkoBkE2T_.jsBvExZfyEwNcrh5rwxDaK7CrILKEW1uth4OZ7ztPtZTPPFxsiRg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "xbt.money", "published": "2018-05-12T15:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Magazine‚Äôs Week in Review: Markets, Miners and Conferences", "text": "Bitcoin Magazine‚Äôs Week in Review: Markets, Miners and Conferences May 12, 2018 13 Views\nWhile Bitmain creates new ASIC Antminers to mine any cryptocurrency running Equihash proof of work, the affected cryptocurrencies look at measures to prevent it. New York has a lot of news happening this week, with the New York Stock Exchange‚Äôs parent company looking to get into bitcoin trading and Blockchain Week kicking off with the CDX Summit. South Korea continues to be a leader in blockchain technology, rolling out new partnerships with neighboring countries, and building out more blockchain technology.\nFeatured stories by Colin Harper, Nick Marinoff and Aaron van Wirdum.\nStay on top of the best stories in the bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. Subscribe to our newsletter here . Bitmain‚Äôs Antminer Z9 Mini Designed to Mine Zcash, Threatens ASIC Resistance\nBitmain announced, via Twitter, the release of its new Antminer Z9 mini, an ASIC miner capable of mining any cryptocurrency running the Equihash proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm. This includes, most notably, Zcash , which is a decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency designed to offer users complete privacy in transactions. Zcash has always used the Equihash PoW mining algorithm to prevent the progress of Zcash ASIC miners and has predominantly been mined by general-purpose GPU chips.\nThe development of ASIC hardware is causing some cryptocurrencies to change their proof-of-work mining algorithm. Bitcoin Gold has a hard fork coming to defeat it and Monero has already modified their mining algorithm to counter ASIC hardware. GlobalData: South Korea Among the World‚Äôs Leading Markets for Blockchain Technology\nAccording to analytics firm GlobalData , South Korea has become a leader in the blockchain community. Businesses like Korea Telecom are already working to determine how the blockchain can be used to lessen production expenses and generate new types of revenue. Representatives of the South Korean telephone giant have already joined with Sprint and Japan‚Äôs SoftBank to launch a ‚Äúblockchain-powered data roaming service‚Äù in the coming weeks. Executives say the company has big plans to use the blockchain to power ‚Äúfinance, IoT, smart energy and healthcare businesses.‚Äù\nSouth Korea is also attracting businesses from neighboring countries like Japan, whose social messaging platform Line is set to launch a blockchain subsidiary known as Unblock within South Korea‚Äôs borders. The purpose of the subsidiary will be to further study the blockchain and determine how it can best be applied to the company‚Äôs remaining divisions. As the nation leads the blockchain revolution, neighboring regions are also taking the bait and looking into how blockchain technology can best be utilized to further cement operational security and efficiency. NYT Report: Parent Company to NYSE Is Planning a Bitcoin Exchange\nIntercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), wants to establish its own cryptocurrency exchange. According to New York Times (NYT) sources, ICE has been in talks with legacy banks and financial institutions to facilitate swap contracts for potential bitcoin trading. These contracts would essentially allow banks to buy contracts for bitcoin, giving the exchange sure anchors of liquidity. Once an exchange user buys one of these contracts, cash changes hands and the corresponding bitcoin would appear in their wallet the next day. The report reveals that the exchange, which would be built with ‚Äúlarge investors‚Äù in mind, would permit direct bitcoin trading, not futures contracts as we‚Äôve seen with the CBOE and CME. CDX Brings Inaugural Blockchain Summit to New York\nThe latest installment of the Chief Digital Officer Global Forum (CDX) summit series will be held in New York on May 11, 2018.

He still insists that it‚Äôs a better currency and therefore a better store of value that Bitcoin Core. Now, if you have been tracking this guy for sometimes then you will realize that this is the umpteenth time he his saying so. Will repetition come to pass someday? Well, maybe, maybe not. What we know for sure is that Bitcoin Cash shall be forking once more .\nHowever, this time since it shall be done at MTP time, there is no need to track block height. We anticipate this upgrade to take place on Tuesday, May 15 and there, the block size would be hiked to 32 MB from 8MB making it that largest ever block size increment in the world. Besides, their protocol data carrier sizes shall be increased to 220 bytes.\nIf you are a Bitcoin Cash full node or miner, please update, if not then you better stay on the side line and watch. Before the fork begins, full nodes should upgrade their clients to the 32 MB supporting Bitcoin ABC 0.17.1 version.\nSo, while speculations are rife that this upgrade shall increase Bitcoin Cash transaction throughput and fees, will this boost prices after the fork? Or, will it even be successful in the first place regardless of Bitcoin Cash staunch following in Korea and Japan? Let‚Äôs wait and see!\nBitcoin Cash (BCHUSD) Technical Analysis Weekly Chart Bitcoin Cash Weekly Chart by Trading View\nUnless a miracle happen, Bitcoin Cash shall end up with a conspicuous double bar bear reversal pattern right at the middle BB, a resistance line. That‚Äôs a fact! So, despite that stochastic buy signal turning from deep the oversold territory, the general sentiment is bearish.\nBitcoin Cash prices are down 18 percent in the last 24 hours and 20 percent in the last 7 days effectively reversing week ending May 7 gains. At this rate, we shall be aiming for take profit targets at $1000 and $800. Many didn‚Äôt expect this to happen and advised by this, we shall be looking for sells in lower time frames.\nDaily Chart Bitcoin Cash Daily Chart by Trading View\nLike the weekly chart, the depreciation is real but not as wholesome. Bears are stepping on the gas and the result has been that clear break below the middle BB. Inevitably, this means sellers are in charge and it means we shall be trading a bearish break out pattern.\nSo, building on to the bearish engulfing pattern we are seeing in the weekly chart, immediate targets is at $1200, there we might see a reaction and a bounce back to $1400 or so before bears resume their pressure with targets we mentioned earlier.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin cash", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "roger ver", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bch", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin core", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mtp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T16:54:47.027+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "29d92ba6ff7cac4b72f75c33c588808ea1f0134f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WqrE_iVuO9icjWi.188dAiDEKqkuVm6r9LvX4XjhyKn_BG5KPb7fF", "site_full": "www.paganforum.com", "site": "paganforum.com", "site_section": "http://www.paganforum.com/", "site_categories": ["science", "space_astronomy", "health", "adult", "herbs_for_health", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Activity Stream - Pagan Forum", "title": "Bitcoin mining", "title_full": "Bitcoin mining", "published": "2018-05-12T15:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "29d92ba6ff7cac4b72f75c33c588808ea1f0134f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WqrE_iVuO9icjWi.188dAiDEKqkuVm6r9LvX4XjhyKn_BG5KPb7fF", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "michaeljordan5354", "published": "2018-05-12T15:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin mining", "text": "Bitcoin mining is the process of adding records of a new transaction to the Blockchain - the public ledger of all transactions that have ever taken place in the Bitcoin network.
