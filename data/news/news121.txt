Some see them simply as new investments and payment methods, while others worry they provide potential vehicles for illegal activities, from money laundering to drug-dealing.\nIt’s a debate that matters for the sprawling US national security apparatus, which has to keep track of more than 4 million people with some form of security clearance. That includes workers who, at least in theory, could sell secrets to America’s enemies with the aid of anonymous transactions facilitated by cryptocurrencies.\nTerrorists, Cybercriminals\nTerrorists and cybercriminals use cryptocurrencies to shield their transactions from investigators and often demand payment in Bitcoins and other digital assets, according to international law-enforcement groups including the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force and Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre.\nAt the same time, young investors have decamped from the halls of prominent financial institutions for the evolving world of cryptocurrency investing, and entire states have pegged their futures to its popularity. The instrument is going mainstream as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. moves forward with Bitcoin trading operations.\nNevertheless, Bitcoin has fallen about 50 per cent from its December high to about $8,400 (Dh30,828) as regulators around the world continue to evaluate how to manage digital assets and some Wall Street pros dismiss the market. Warren Buffett, for example, has likened Bitcoin to “rat poison squared.”\nIf the US government were to decide that owning cryptocurrencies is a security risk, it could have a “huge negative impact” on the growing market, according to Singh.\nAny move to more closely investigate job applicants who own cryptocurrencies also could hamper the Pentagon’s efforts to expand its operations in cyberspace, a goal that Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis has made a priority.\n“If we’re going to say that if you’ve got a Bitcoin or another digital currency account that could be a signal or shoot up a red flag for a security clearance, guess what? Those people aren’t going to sit around waiting to try to on-board for a government job,” Greg Touhill, a retired Air Force general who was the first Federal Chief Information Security Officer, said in an interview. “It would grow the backlog considerably, in my view.”\nConflicting messages\nThe Pentagon has sent conflicting messages about how it’s handling the matter.\nAfter a Defense Security Service employee suggested in an email that Bitcoin be considered a foreign currency and reported on the lengthy SF-86 security form filled out by clearance applicants, DSS quickly countered by issuing official guidance saying ... there is no official Department of Defense guidance, according to ETHNews, an online cryptocurrency news site.\n“There is no current Department of Defense guidance related to the reporting of ownership of cryptocurrencies,” according to a statement posted to the DSS website. “DSS is working with DoD policy offices for further clarification and once such guidance is issued, DSS will ensure the widest dissemination to industry.”\nThe equivocation has been cited by law firms and job search sites. ClearanceJobs.com put it bluntly: “Should you report your Bitcoin to your security officer? It depends upon who you ask.”\nHuge backlog\nThe lack of clear direction from the Pentagon only adds to the headaches already faced by government contractors that need to hire workers with security clearances.\nTheir top priority is overhauling a clearance system with a backlog of more than 700,000 background investigations and billions of dollars in associated costs.\nRaytheon Co. Vice President Jane Chappell told the Senate Intelligence Committee in March that fixing the clearance system should be a priority for the country and that the backlog was hurting “programs that provide critical warfighter capabilities.”\nFor now, it appears the Pentagon needs further information from the country’s financial regulators. Without a clear policy from the Treasury Department, Securities and Exchange Commission or other agencies, it will be very difficult for the Pentagon to issue guidance, according to Singh.\nIn the US, Bitcoin isn’t treated as a foreign currency for tax purposes, according to a Treasury Department spokeswoman, but Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network monitors virtual currency exchanges to counter money laundering and terrorist financing.\nIf the US government were to assess that Bitcoin is a form of foreign currency, “such activities could have an impact on a security clearance determination,” Major Audricia Harris, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said in a statement.\nBad intent\nThe government should keep in mind that owning cryptocurrencies may not indicate bad intent, said Steve Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists.\n“I don’t know if the government has a clear understanding of what makes a person actually a security risk,” Aftergood said. “Instead they look at proxy factors like excessive debt, drug use and contact with the criminal justice system, which don’t necessarily translate to risk.”\nBut Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, said the Pentagon is right to scrutinise clearance applicants who own cryptocurrencies, even those who are buying and holding them as investments, known as “HODL’ers.”\n“Since Bitcoin’s only real use is to buy drugs, etc, it deserves suspicion,” he said. “As for the HODL’ers, eh, they will pass through the clearance process OK because its clear they are just little speculators. Or outright delusional speculators, in which case, do you really want that type in government?”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "param vir singh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pentagon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "carnegie mellon university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pnc centre for financial services innovation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defence department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T16:12:38.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c6c35e95df9168b548e9526b86d0289ef73cbe6d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRE8l6tXhiMVzBbF.It3uCg-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why Media is negative about Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why Media is negative about Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-27T23:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 14, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.008, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c6c35e95df9168b548e9526b86d0289ef73cbe6d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmRE8l6tXhiMVzBbF.It3uCg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "spadormie", "published": "2018-05-27T23:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Media is negative about Bitcoin?", "text": "I think media is not up for bitcoin because of its volatility.

Source: CNBC\nThe Draper Profile Draper is the founder of Draper University as well as the founder and managing director of DFJ – Draper Fisher Jurvetson, a venture capital fund which propelled him to his current status.\nHowever, his crypto-fame was driven by his investment in bitcoin during the period when he acquired about 30,000 bitcoins which had been confiscated by the U.S. Marshals.\nHis bitcoins are currently valued at over $220 million. He has since not stopped sharing his bullish outlook toward bitcoin. In a recent Bitcoin congregation held in April 2018, Tim shared with a crowd of cryptocurrency enthusiasts that ' …I'm thinking $250,000 a bitcoin by 2022. '\nHe has further gone to praise the Bitcoin system as being among the most secure systems, saying \"…No one has ever hacked the bitcoin blockchain. It is the most secure place to put your money.\" During this speech, he asked people to place their money in bitcoin given its security as compared to fiat currency.\nOver the same period, he went on to criticize India for banning cryptocurrencies, explaining that \"The government needs to realize that it is stifling innovation and should instead be creating an environment where these ideas can be tested and promoted…\"\nRegardless of the situation, his view toward bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general – has been far from deviant. He has expressed his different viewpoints, all of which support his outlook towards the increase in the value of bitcoin.\nTim Da Rapper Nakamoto, Made a Token\nPerfecto, No Friction\nWe want a new world order,\nWe want to play across the Border,\nI just wanna be a HODL'r\nOn my Bitcoin Hustle,\nOn my blockchain Hustle,\nOn my Bitcoin Hustle,\nOn my blockchain Hustle.\nDuring the three-minute rap which was not accompanied by any background music, the billionaire whipped out his iPhone and went ahead to rap, intoning the following:\n\"We want a new world order/we want to pay across the border… I just wanna be a HODLer on my Bitcoin hustle.\"\nIt is, therefore, quite clear that the downturn in the market has been no deterrent to the billionaire's enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency market. In fact, he seems to be doubling down on the belief that the market will soon enjoy a rebound and recover.\nWith the current price of bitcoin standing at just over $7,300 – as of May 27, 2018 – thus with a valuation of $219 million on his 30,000 BTC, a price surge to $250,000 would make Draper one of the wealthiest men in the world!\nThe post The Bitcoin Fever Has Got Tim Da'R'apper appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tim draper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "draper fisher jurvetson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "draper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "draper university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dfj", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amsterdam", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T23:34:25.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "42e848aa8ddd7e4f8ebcbfb07d30c27cca5a6b19", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaOt0k7ud4DgXPFnq8lzCKE-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "bitcoin down, what will happen?", "title_full": "bitcoin down, what will happen?", "published": "2018-05-27T23:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "42e848aa8ddd7e4f8ebcbfb07d30c27cca5a6b19", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaOt0k7ud4DgXPFnq8lzCKE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "piebeyb", "published": "2018-05-27T23:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin down, what will happen?", "text": "I do not ask you to believe in me, but you may be able to buy it under $ 5000, maybe it's the right price for you not to lose too much money, so please wait for it", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T20:13:11.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6dd0c09296791feee9f7f66d86b4b71a06f27476", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWEsBSwHveWIN_nq_e06GyQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Which is more risky?

Recently, British economic historian and author Niall Ferguson told the Bank of England that Bitcoin is the financial system of the future.\nAlso Read: This Week in Bitcoin: McAfee's Bullish Prediction and a Guy Living in His Car\nThe Future of Finance Niall Ferguson is a noted historian, commentator, and the author of fifteen books including The Ascent of Money and The House of Rothschild. On Tuesday he has given a seminar to the Bank of England, talking about the 2008 financial crisis and the reactions to it to this day. In his conclusion of the subject, he mentioned that bitcoin is part of the major challenges ahead for the current fiat-based system.\nFerguson said: \"The financial system of today is not fundamentally that different than the financial system of the pre-crisis period, except that big banks are better capitalized. I don't think much else is really different. The novelties, the things that will really matter ten years hence are still relatively small in scale. Whether its bitcoin or cryptocurrency generally or the massive revolution in online payments that is being achieved by the big Chinese tech companies, that's the financial system of the future, and it is still small enough not to be systemically important in 2018. In short, I am left feeling we are only a matter of time before the next crisis.\"\nBombarded by ICOs The above isn't such a surprising statement coming from Ferguson. Back in December 2017 he wrote : \"At some point, no doubt, regulatory changes in the US will deflate the current bitcoin bubble. But they will not halt, much less undo, this financial revolution. Think about it this way. The maximum number of bitcoins that can be created is 21m. The number of millionaires in the world, according to Credit Suisse, is 36m. Their total wealth is $128.7 trillion. If millionaires collectively decided to hold just 1% of their wealth as bitcoin, the price would be not $15,000 but north of $60,000. If they raised that to 5%, the right price for bitcoin would be above $300,000. I am not saying this is certain to happen. I'm just saying my teenage son thinks it could.\"\nSince then he has also been exposed to more sides of the cryptocurrency market, such as the endless flood of ICO offers. \"I wish I had a bitcoin for every phony white paper I've been shown the last six months, by people trying to raise money before the SEC clamps down,\" Ferguson reportedly said last week. \"When there's no regulation, then the rogues are very quickly on the scene.\"\nFerguson isn't the only noted academic figure that looked at how bitcoin fits economic history recently. Last Monday, Professor Robert Shiller, who received the 2013 Nobel prize in economics and is famous for the Case-Shiller Index, published an article talking about the way the allure of bitcoin fits enthusiasm around previous attempts to reinvent money.\nWhat role in the economy do you see Bitcoin fulfills in ten years from now?

Ethereum is nearing the capitalization of bitcoin and it has real influence on companies and people compared to bitcoin. Simmons is not even a fourth on James level of playing. Basides, Simmons is not even in the top 10 players in the NBA.\nBoth are very valuable, yet each plays a different role and are unique on its own identity. I don't think ethereum is a threat because Bitcoin has already a large edge, and ethereum has special offers and provides best opportunities as well. Ethereum is also a most well-established decentralized software that enables Smart Contracts and Distributed Applications to run without any downtime, while bitcoin is the king of cryptocurrency. We should learn to maintain an environment that plays healthy competion, because our real competitors are ourselves, same thing goes with cryptocurrency.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T18:28:59.071+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5a37593027e8e546739756139a31c840222e6056", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSeLeeG3OnwAksOFgO8fYaTN.frgZZEzjvX_aN0L17SwseSNHeqP5Yfl3OaOvdO8xkyKtY9zRqWypsQfYB6m4nAbB2MoKSUkg-", "site_full": "newsletterdepot.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newsletterdepot.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Newsletter Depot", "title": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-27T23:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5a37593027e8e546739756139a31c840222e6056", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQSeLeeG3OnwAksOFgO8fYaTN.frgZZEzjvX_aN0L17SwseSNHeqP5Yfl3OaOvdO8xkyKtY9zRqWypsQfYB6m4nAbB2MoKSUkg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "llgeek89 (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-27T23:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert – bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin Laufende Aktualisierung ⋅ 27.

If millionaires collectively decided to hold just 1% of their wealth as bitcoin, the price would be not $15,000 but north of $60,000.

Ask them, 'Do you need something that is open, neutral, borderless, that no one controls and that resists censorship?' If yes, then you need Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, ZCash – some open public Blockchain… that expresses these capabilities.\nBeyond Bitcoin, Antonopoulos also had cautionary words for banks looking to Ethereum for Blockchain solutions.\n\"Right now, the big banks, governments – they're in love with Ethereum. They love the fact that Ethereum has all of these capabilities that seem much, much less weird than Bitcoin,\" he continued.\nBut they don't realize that all of the weirdness is still there[…]. The whole point of Ethereum is to make unstoppable code, applications you cannot turn off – and the reason they can't be turned off is because they're decentralized apps – DApps. Why make a DApp unless you wanted to make a DApp that somebody wants to turn off and you want to continue working?\nWhat do you think about Andreas Antonopoulos' views on Bitcoin versus Blockchain?

While I was reading the message I saw the text below saying to \"verify each address, line and signature.\" How would one go about verifying these?\nYour Bitcoin wallet software should have an option to verify a message. For example, in Bitcoin Core, you go to File > Verify Message and a dialog appears where you can enter the address, message and signature. In whatever verify message window, enter the address, message (the line containing the address, email, and date), and signature (the line after the address). Then click \"Verify\". The software will then check whether the signature verifies.\nIf the signature does verify, this means that the owner of the private key for that address actually made the statement that is the message AND that the message was not tampered with in any way.\n2.) If I were to send some bitcoins to the Free Software Foundation and would like for them to know they came from me, I would have to provide some sort of proof. The following excerpt from the message says how to do this; however, I still do not quite understand how to execute this:\nWhen you send Bitcoin to someone, your transaction will \"send from\" some addresses (it doesn't actually send from any addresses, that's now how Bitcoin work). If you look at the transaction details in a block explorer, you will see something labeled as the inputs and a list of addresses. Those addresses are what are referred to on the website as \"sending keys\". Those addresses should all be from your wallet.\nSo what you should do is get the transaction ID of the transaction, find an address that is listed as one of the inputs of the transaction, and then use your wallet software to sign a message (the txid) with that address. You then email that message, the address you signed it with, and the signature, to the FSF. Your signed message can be more than just the txid, it can have any text that you want so you can include things like your name, mailing address, and contribution info.\n3.) I used Gpg4win to verify the whole message by importing John Sullivan's GPG public key from here and clicking the \"Verify\" button. But how does this work and what purpose does the PGP signature at the bottom of the message serve?\nThe PGP signature does two things: it proves that the owner ofthe PGP key (John Sullivan) actually made that statement (or at least knows of its existence) and it verifies that the statement itself was not tampered with.\nThis verification, combined with verifying the address and it's signature earlier, prove that John Sullivan has control over those addresses (because he provided a signature with those addresses and he signed both the addresses and their signatures with his own PGP key). Thus if you send Bitcoin to that address, John will receive the Bitcoin.\nFor more and better info on what a signature means, I suggest you read the wikipedia page on Digital Signatures .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T01:46:11.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b1969b45b4d62703af9f5e8e70669375783fcbf8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUekCFlkL4HJXexyhCVzdHk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=238.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bounties (Altcoins)", "title": "BITCOIN PRIVATE PUBLIC AIRDROP hurry up", "title_full": "BITCOIN PRIVATE PUBLIC AIRDROP hurry up", "published": "2018-05-27T22:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b1969b45b4d62703af9f5e8e70669375783fcbf8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUekCFlkL4HJXexyhCVzdHk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kinsuche", "published": "2018-05-27T22:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "BITCOIN PRIVATE PUBLIC AIRDROP hurry up", "text": "Proof of authentication\nTelegram username: @Errrgh\nTwitter username: @_Errrgh\nWallet: 3PDD5ZbNnPZJMcPwFdRXzscd6VWjnrAohjY", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T14:53:29.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9cb9cc24db3f54eefbe0cdb75680bc4da44b03cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFhv5aZUTr1YnrI.xUIKVTuwkpLbVPq5wQSTwiOvTijBDFX5LCg5PbKefg6ENsSXnMT6c4BNaOmOrnE2BtvOOfb8oKj15xaDBlAbnIN9AIHw5dKq19cSYE8Q21Sj5dYVFCA--", "site_full": "bitcoints.com", "site": "bitcoints.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoints.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoints", "title": "Bitcoin come as miners it is the hot news stress power grids in central washington.", "title_full": "Bitcoin come as miners it is the hot news stress power grids in central washington.", "published": "2018-05-27T22:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitcoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin-come-as-miners-it-is-the-hot-news-stress-power-grids-in-central-washington.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9cb9cc24db3f54eefbe0cdb75680bc4da44b03cf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFhv5aZUTr1YnrI.xUIKVTuwkpLbVPq5wQSTwiOvTijBDFX5LCg5PbKefg6ENsSXnMT6c4BNaOmOrnE2BtvOOfb8oKj15xaDBlAbnIN9AIHw5dKq19cSYE8Q21Sj5dYVFCA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-27T22:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin come as miners it is the hot news stress power grids in central washington.", "text": "Published on May 27th, 2018 | by bitcoin 0 Bitcoin come as miners it is the hot news stress power grids in central washington.\nThe process, which the industry calls mining, involves trillions of computer calculations and sucks up huge amounts of power.

This unauthorized set-up in Cashmere was discovered in 2015. (Chelan PUD / Chelan PUD) By Paul Roberts Seattle Times SMS\nPublic hearings for rural electric utilities are rarely sellout events. But the crowd that showed up in Wenatchee two weeks ago for a hearing about Bitcoin mining in Chelan County was so large that utility staff had to open a second room with a video feed for the overflow.\nThe turnout wasn’t surprising. Chelan County, along with neighboring Douglas and Grant counties, has been at the center of the U.S. Bitcoin boom since 2012, when the region’s ultracheap hydropower began attracting cryptocurrency “miners.”\nThese entrepreneurs earn Bitcoin by solving increasingly complicated mathematical problems established by the shadowy creators of the digital currency. The process, which the industry calls mining, involves trillions of computer calculations and sucks up huge amounts of power.\nAs a result, an area famous for apples, wheat and conservative politics has been transformed into a kind of cyber-boomtown, with Bitcoin mining operations that range from large-scale, state-of-the-art warehouses to repurposed cargo containers to backyard sheds. By the end of this year, according to some estimates, the Mid-Columbia Basin could account for as much as 30 percent of the global output of new Bitcoin and large shares of other digital currencies, such as Litecoin and Ethereum.\nBut as in any boomtown, success has come at a cost. As the cryptocurrency industry morphs into larger, more energy-intensive operations, the Basin’s three public utilities districts (PUDs) are reassessing how they deal with it, and whether they can – or should even try to – keep up.\nThe Rocky Reach hydroelectric dam on the Columbia River is north of Wenatchee. (Courtesy / Chelan County PUD)\nThe sector’s recent growth spurt poses “a very different kind of problem than anything we have addressed before,” Steve Wright, Chelan County PUD general manager, told the crowd at the May 14 hearing. Determining whether the PUD can handle the growth, Wright said, has “required a whole new way of thinking.” Overwhelming ‘gold rush’\nIn a normal year, demand for electric power in Chelan County grows by perhaps 4 megawatts – enough for around 2,250 homes – as new residents arrive and as businesses start or expand. But since January 2017, as Bitcoin enthusiasts bid up the price of the currency, eager miners have requested a staggering 210 megawatts for mines they want to build in Chelan County. That’s nearly as much as the county and its 73,000 residents were already using. And because it is a public utility, the PUD staff is obligated to consider every request.\nThe scale of some new requests is mind-boggling. Until recently, the largest mines in Chelan County used five megawatts or less. In the past six months, by contrast, miners have requested loads of 50 megawatts and, in several cases, 100 megawatts. By comparison, a fruit warehouse uses around 2.5 megawatts.\nBut it’s not simply the scale of requests that is perplexing utility staff. Many would-be miners have no understanding of how large power purchases work. In one case this winter, miners from China landed their private jet at the local airport, drove a rental car to the visitor center at the Rocky Reach Dam, just north of Wenatchee, and, according to Chelan County PUD officials, politely asked to see the “dam master because we want to buy some electricity.”\nBitcoin fever has created other, smaller-scale problems for the utility. Three times a week, on average, utility crews in Chelan County discover unpermitted home miners running computer servers far too large for the electrical grids of residential neighborhoods. In one instance last year, the transformer outside a bootleg miner’s home overheated and touched off a grass fire, Chelan County PUD officials say.\nIn other cases, utility crews responding to unusual spikes in power usage have found racks of remotely controlled servers whirring away in empty apartments. Worse, when the utility began shutting off power to these so-called “rogue operators” earlier this year, some of them became so belligerent that the utility is installing security cameras and bulletproof glass at its downtown Wenatchee headquarters.\nBy February, the Bitcoin “gold rush,” as Wright calls it, had become so overwhelming that Chelan County PUD declared a three-month moratorium on new mines to determine whether the county can absorb even a fraction of that demand. But answering that question was more complex than the utility anticipated — and at the recent hearing, the commission voted to extend the freeze another three months.\nAt the root of the dilemma is a mismatch in business models. Public utilities are typically managed with the expectation of incremental growth, decades-long investments and a community-oriented bottom line — what Wright defines as delivering “the best value, for the most people, for the longest period of time.”\nBitcoin mining, by contrast, is characterized by soaring demand, massive price volatility, and an investment time frame measured in years or even months.\nWhat Chelan County PUD must now decide is whether these two models are compatible. Wright was a public utility veteran who ran the Bonneville Power Administration before coming to Chelan County. He told the hearing that, to a utility manager, the massive surge in new mining demand “looks like lemons.” The utility’s task is to see whether there’s “a way to turn it into lemonade for us” by figuring out what the miners should pay.\nFor would-be miners and investors eager to connect their servers, each week of moratorium represents lost opportunity. But the utility also faces pressure from the community, which remains deeply divided over the presence of cryptocurrency miners.\nAt May’s hearing, perhaps half of the audience members who spoke were deeply skeptical about Bitcoin mining and concerned that the county not encourage further growth. One resident called mining “cyber-gambling.” Another likened miners to “locusts” who were simply looking for “the next field to do their damage.”\nYet others spoke of cryptocurrency mining as the best thing that has come to the Basin in years, not only as a path to personal wealth (many commenters were miners or prospective miners) but also as way to energize a region that has suffered major economic setbacks.\nHanging over May’s hearing was the fate of the Basin’s last big electrical customer: the Alcoa aluminum smelter, which employed more than 400 workers before it was idled several years ago thanks to competition from cheaper Chinese imports. Cryptocurrency mining won’t replace all those jobs — the process is heavily automated. But backers insist that a local mining sector, if allowed to grow, will attract other ancillary services, such as software development, and ultimately provide the Basin with some of the tech-fueled prosperity that Seattle has enjoyed.\n“Yes, we’re the apple capital,” Markham Heard, a safety and environmental consultant who works with the data industry, told commissioners. “But what’s our next step?” A regional trend\nChelan County isn’t the only place where that question is being asked. Across the Columbia River in Douglas County, the cyber-mining sector has expanded so rapidly that the PUD’s existing distribution system is tapped out. For example, a nearly new 84-megawatt substation with enough capacity to handle 30 to 50 years of normal population growth has already been fully subscribed.\nIn neighboring Grant County, meanwhile, which has more surplus power available, miners have requested about 1,700 megawatts, or roughly three times what the county’s residents, commercial users and farmers consume.\nAll told, the three PUDs in the mid-Columbia Basin are considering miners’ requests for well over 2,000 megawatts of power — equal to roughly two-thirds of the total hydropower generated by the Basin’s five hydroelectric dams. And while every request won’t become a contract, the rapid demand is forcing officials at all three public utilities to rethink how they sell power.\nThe biggest issue, of course, is power rates. Currently, residents in Chelan County pay around 3 cents per kilowatt-hour, or about a third what Seattleites pay and around one fifth of the national average. Rates in Douglas and Grants are in that same ballpark.\nThose bargain rates are possible largely because the Basin’s five dams generate around six times what the region can use locally. Much of the surplus is exported, at premium prices, to outside buyers such as Puget Sound Energy, and those outside sales subsidize local rates.\nBut if the utilities are selling more of their power to local Bitcoin miners, they’re exporting less power at those premium prices, which makes it harder to keep local rates low. Further, because much of the surplus is currently committed in long-term contracts, supplying miners with all the megawatts they want might require the utilities do something virtually unprecedented: buy power on the open market, at prices far above what locals have come to expect.\nAdd to this the many millions of dollars the utilities would need to invest in new substations, transmission lines, and other infrastructure, and suddenly, it becomes conceivable that this new industry might signal the end to decades of cheap power.\nJim Renna, a local contractor and businessman, told the commission that the big fear among locals is the utility will soon be “subsidizing [miners] by us having higher rates.”\nThese aren’t new concerns. The three PUDs have been experimenting with policies that force miners to shoulder these extra costs and risks, while insulating ratepayers and the utilities themselves. Chelan County, for example, created a special rate for miners and other so-called “high density loads,” or HDLs, back in 2015, that was effectively twice the residential rate.\nDouglas County, meanwhile, began requiring miners to pay up front for any new infrastructure. Grant County PUD is establishing special rates applied to companies “whose primary revenue stream is evolving and unproven” and whose product is “vulnerable to extreme value fluctuations.”\nThe utilities are attempting to strike a delicate balance. By creating policies that reflect the full costs and risks of cryptocurrency mining, the utilities believe they can protect regular ratepayers while weeding out prospective miners who are unable or unwilling to make a long-term commitment to the Basin — and whose power requests are swamping utilities’ normal operations.\nAs Wright put it, by the end of the moratorium, the utility expects to be able to tell miners exactly what it will cost to mine in Chelan County. If miners can accept those terms, Wright says, the PUD will move forward with investments needed to handle crypto-mining’s much larger next phase. But, says Wright, “if it’s not of interest, then we can stop and go back to doing our day jobs.”\nHow the three utilities decide to treat this new industry will have impacts that go well beyond the Mid-Columbia Basin. Prospective miners elsewhere will be tracking the decisions intently to see whether the Basin is still worth coming to, or whether they should go instead to other cheap-power places, such as Iceland or Quebec.\nAnd, in all likelihood, utility officials in those cheap power regions will be paying attention, too. Even now, Wright says, County PUD’s staff receive calls from their counterparts in communities where mining is just getting started and where there is little certainty about how to manage the boom. “So we are getting a chance here to break new ground,” says Wright.\nThat’s one way to put it.

But we all knew the risks involved in placing funds with Steven. We all became complacent,” BTC Global said on its website. “Until Steven Twain resurfaces or is found there is nothing the admin team can do.”\nSouth African police said they were investigating the alleged fraud, with more than 28,000 investors affected. Police said the company had targeted potential investors with promises of 2 percent interest per day, 14 percent a week and 50 percent per month.\nPayments to investors were reportedly made every Monday until they suddenly dried up.\nRegulators worldwide are grappling with the boom in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which lure investors with the promise of high returns but are not backed by any central banks.\nOn Thursday, a South African teenager was found four days after he was kidnapped by a gang who demanded a ransom in 15 bitcoins, worth about $123,000 (EUR 105,000 or Rs. 84 lakhs).\nPolice gave no details about any ransom payment.

After trading in the $9,000 to $10,000 range for some time it then fell below $9,000 and had been trading between the $8,000 to $9,000 range up to now. Now the price of bitcoin (BTC) has fallen far below the $8,000 level and could drop even further. Outlook is bearish A CoinDesk article from yesterday morning claims: \"Bitcoin risks closing below the 50-week moving average (MA) – an important long-term support not breached for over two-and-a-half years.\"With the bears already on the offensive following the recent sell-off, prices are likely to suffer if bitcoin closes on Sunday below the key support, currently seen at $7,611. More worryingly for the bulls, since the cryptocurrency has not traded below the 50-week MA since October 2015, acceptance below that level would only add credence to the argument that the long-term bull run has ended. \" \" The price has dropped below the 50 week moving average a few days ago. Bitcoin price could fall below $7,000 An article at CCN suggests that the price of bitcoin will likely fall to the higher end of the $6,000 region over the short term. The article notes that the price had dropped by 2.5 over the last 24 hours even dipping below $7,300 at one point. The article notes that this year the bitcoin price has been subject to 3 major corrections on February 7, April 10, and finally May25: \" The initial correction that occurred on February 7 led the bitcoin price to drop from $19,900 to $6,100, by more than 69 percent. The second correction on April 10 prompted BTC to fall from $12,000 to $6,400, by 46 percent. The third and latest correction on May 25 led BTC to decline from $10,000 to $7,200, by 28 percent.\" In each correction there have been smaller sell-offs and a narrower correction period. The first correction lasted nearly two months but the second and this last one bottomed out in about a month. The article claims it is highly likely that the bitcoin price will rebound in the short term once it hits the $6,800 mark which could result in a stronger rally in the mid to long term. At the$6,800 level an accumulation period can be expected during which bitcoin slowly increase its price and gains momentum. This could also help other cryptocurrencies recover. Analyst Willy Woo sees the bitcoin price sliding down to the $5,000 region. The CCN article claims this is unlikely unless the price drops below$ $6,500 and fails to be supported at the $6,800 level. A fall below $6,000 is unlikely. The present situation At about 19:00 UTC the price of bitcoin (BTC) was about $7,282. The open was $7,334.16 and the high $7387.13. The low was $7,226.65.

Antonopoulos Champions Essential ‘Weirdness’\nSpeaking at the Polish Bitcoin Congress in Warsaw May 12, Antonopoulos, who has been a well-known Bitcoin advocate and educator since 2013, argued that Bitcoin’s “weirdness” and decentralization’s ability to “offend” were key to its success.\n“…The reason Bitcoin is interesting is because it’s not controlled, because it can’t be censored, because it’s open, because a lot of the people involved are very, very weird,” he said.\n[…] If you take all that out, what you’re left with – this Blockchain – is a sterile, unexpressive (sic), uninvented environment; a corporate plaything that has been sanitized of every interesting and left as an empty shell. Blockchain Is ‘Basically A Very Slow Database’\nThe views are commonplace for Antonopoulos, who has sought to reinforce the revolutionary qualities behind Bitcoin and other decentralized networks on countless occasions.\nThe Polish talk’s timing, however, was pertinent, as Consensus caused controversy just four days later after other Bitcoin industry figures criticized its Blockchain bias and lack of technical s ubstance.\nBitcoin developers Jimmy Song and Johnathan Corgan specifically highlighted the event’s perceived shortcomings, arguing Blockchain had become a victim of “cargo cult engineering” and that a lack of education on the part of audience members prevented them from sorting valuable information from “buzzwords.”\n“It’s basically a very slow database,” Antonopoulos continued in comments on Blockchain which Song would later emulate.\nIf someone comes to you and says, ‘Do I need a blockchain for my business?’ Ask them, ‘Do you need something that is open, neutral, borderless, that no one controls and that resists censorship?’ If yes, then you need Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, ZCash – some open public Blockchain… that expresses these capabilities.\nBeyond Bitcoin, Antonopoulos also had cautionary words for banks looking to Ethereum for Blockchain solutions.\n“Right now, the big banks, governments – they’re in love with Ethereum. They love the fact that Ethereum has all of these capabilities that seem much, much less weird than Bitcoin,” he continued.\nBut they don’t realize that all of the weirdness is still there[…]. The whole point of Ethereum is to make unstoppable code, applications you cannot turn off – and the reason they can’t be turned off is because they’re decentralized apps – DApps. Why make a DApp unless you wanted to make a DApp that somebody wants to turn off and you want to continue working?\nWhat do you think about Andreas Antonopoulos’ views on Bitcoin versus Blockchain?

Shailesh Bhatt, a builder based in the diamond city, wrote to Gujarat’s junior Home Minister Pradeepsinh Jadeja in February, alleging that Amreli Police had extorted bitcoins worth ₹12 crore from him. Mr. Jadeja forwarded the complaint to the Crime Investigation Department (CID). A probe led to the opening of a Pandora’s Box.\n“While probing the case, we learnt that Bhatt himself was an extortionist. He had extorted bitcoins worth ₹155.21 crore from others before he was kidnapped [for extortion] by the Amreli Police,” CID (Crime) Director General of Police (DGP) Ashish Bhatia told reporters on May 21. New case\nThe agency has registered a new case to book Bhatt and others, including Superintendent of Police (SP) Jagdish Patel and Police Inspector Anant Patel. Former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Nalin Kotadia, currently absconding, is also an accused in the case.

Huge returns of 1%-4% per day were promised. Bhatt invested ₹2 crore in the enterprise. In December 2017, its promoters downed the shutters and went underground.\nTo recover his investment, Bhatt’s accomplices posed as Income Tax officials and kidnapped Piyush Savalia, who had worked with Bit Connect, on January 30, 2018. He was kept in a farmhouse at gunpoint and released two days later, on February 1. “On the morning of February 1, Bhatt’s men kidnapped Dhaval Mavani, another person associated with the company, and released him late on the same night. Mavani was forced to transfer 2,256 bitcoins worth ₹131 crore into their account. The builder and his accomplices had also transferred another 166 bitcoins worth ₹9.64 crore into their account,” Mr. Bhatia said, adding, “When we started a probe directed at Bhatt, he even paid ₹ 34.5 lakh to Piyush Savalia as hush money to keep him quiet.”\nThe former legislator, who played a fixer between Bhatt and the Amreli Police when the police extorted ₹12 crore bitcoins from Bhatt, allegedly received ₹60 lakh, of which the CID has recovered ₹20 lakh transacted through havala.\nMr. Bhatia estimates that the Bitcoin extortion racket is set to get bigger as more people who invested in the hope of making a quick buck became victims of organised crime. “So far, we have only caught two cases involving ₹167 crore,” Mr. Bhatia said. “We are investigating seven companies with investments in virtual currencies in which businessmen parked their illicit cash after demonetisation.”\nA senior official in Gujarat who declined to be named said, “It’s an open secret that people having a high volume of cash at the time of demonetisation converted their black money into crypto currencies with the help of havala operators.” Officials involved in the Bitcoin probe estimate that approximately ₹5,000 crore cash was converted into cryptocurrencies in Surat after demonetisation.\nthe hindu", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.thehindu.com/topic/cryptocurrency/", "http://www.thehindu.com/tag/125-121-81/surat/?utm=bodytag"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jagdish patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jadeja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pradeepsinh jadeja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anant patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nalin kotadia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashish bhatia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shailesh bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pandora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bharatiya janata party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crime investigation department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amreli police", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "surat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gujarat", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T22:19:31.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a66c4c1cb0b5778f89543329c1cafca67db5821c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFvm3bcLa9gpKJwMgOU1NVANAO3iPb9S9w3y5Nc4odjKfntDPQ1dKSKvcq2PGNcu2UgK.d2mb8awidAG0TvkF.lQZd6sotiD5ug.geBR7M1pj", "site_full": "bitcoints.com", "site": "bitcoints.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoints.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoints", "title": "May 27, 2018 Yahoo Finance analysis of Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Ripple", "title_full": "May 27, 2018 Yahoo Finance analysis of Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Ripple", "published": "2018-05-27T22:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a66c4c1cb0b5778f89543329c1cafca67db5821c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFvm3bcLa9gpKJwMgOU1NVANAO3iPb9S9w3y5Nc4odjKfntDPQ1dKSKvcq2PGNcu2UgK.d2mb8awidAG0TvkF.lQZd6sotiD5ug.geBR7M1pj", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-27T22:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "May 27, 2018 Yahoo Finance analysis of Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Ripple", "text": " May 27, 2018 Yahoo Finance analysis of Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Ripple\nWarriors blast Rockets in second half, force Game 7OAKLAND, Calif. – More than seven months and 98 games later, the Rockets’ quest to surpass and succeed the champion Warriors comes down to one more game.
