Operated via its wholly owned subsidiary, North Country Data Center Corporation, it is already mining several cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, dash and ether.\nAlso Read: Police Forces Bust Alleged “New Age Cryptocurrency” Scam in India Mining Operations Come Online\nLocated at a former aluminum smelting plant (Alcoa East Facility), the 1300-acre, 435-megawatt Coinmint site in Massena, New York, is said to provide enough capacity for operating one of the largest mining farms in the world. The company also claims that, in addition to the over $50 million of investment to date, it will invest up to $700 million in its new site, creating an estimated 150 plus jobs over the next 18 months. Operations at the complex are projected to be at full capacity within the next 12 months.\n“The start of operations is a key milestone towards the Massena site reaching its full capacity,” said Coinmint spokesman, Kyle Carlton. “The area’s citizens and its hydroelectric power – a green alternative to the less sustainable energies used at other digital asset infrastructure data centers – were the catalyst for our move and will be foundational assets for continued expansion. The reduced electricity costs will enable us to compete in the rapidly emerging digital currency global marketplace.” Town Welcomes Jobs\nAs we reported earlier this year, when the New York Power Authority approved the allocation of 15,000 kilowatts of hydroelectric power to the mining venture, it is expected to boost employment in the local economy. T he facility is planned to operate around the clock, and accommodate 75 full-time employees in 2018 and an extra 75 in 2019 for a total minimum employment force of 150 employees. The jobs would include security personnel, IT technicians, electricians, installers and operational staff, with an average wage of $46,000.\n“We in Massena, would like to welcome Coinmint to our town,” said on Tuesday Steve O’Shaughnessy, Massena Town Supervisor. “The thought of 150 jobs and revitalization of the Alcoa East Facility is exciting and what we have been working for. We are ready to provide any assistance we can to move this project to its full potential.”\nIs New York going to replace China as the mining capital of the world?

He also said that most ICO’s are will be considered as securities according to the original definition of a security which will not be changed.\nThere has been a lot of confusion in the wild west Cryptosphere on whether the tokens issued by hundreds of ICO’s are considered securities or not. Most of the ICO’s claim that their token is purely a utility token. But according to the chairman of SEC Jay Clayton had previously said that he sees most tokens as securities.\nOn a CNBC interview today, Jay said that the “distributed ledger” technology has a lot of scope and seems promising especially in the Financial markets, he goes on to say that Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin which are competing with sovereign currencies like the Dollar, Yen, etc are NOT securities.\nreplace the Dollar, the Yen, the Euro with Bitcoin, that type of Currency is not a Security\nHe goes on to define what a security is:\nA token, a digital asset where I give you my money and you go off and make a venture or a company…In return for me for giving you my money you say…I’m going to give a return or you can get a return in a secondary market by selling your token to somebody, that is a security and we regulate that. We regulate the offering of that security and we regulate the trading of that security.\nWhen asked whether he will make a clear statement about this he said to the interviewer “Bob, I hope I just did”.\nHe was adamant about changing the rules of the definition of a security, he says that it has been working well for so long and that he doesn’t see a reason to change it.\nThe SEC follows the Howey test (which was introduced in 1946) to determine whether an asset is a security or not. It has 4 criteria Investment of money with an “expectation of profits” solely on the “efforts of others”\nThere have been a lot of discussions of whether Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Ripple would be considered as securities or not when asked he denied to comment on any particular Cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin.\nThe co-founder of Ethereum Joseph Lubin had clearly stated that Ethereum should not be considered as a security As Ethereum is a protocol and does not belong to a single company or organization. Although if the ICO’s which are issued on top of Ethereum are considered as securities then it is not clear whether Ethereum will also a security, and if it is in the US then it will be only applicable to the US investors and the tokens outside the US will not be regulated by the SEC.\nThe SEC recently also appointed Valerie Szczepanik to serve as a senior advisor for digital assets and innovation.\nThank you for reading this article.

Chief Executive Abby Johnson has pushed the firm to experiment with cryptocurrencies, and she even spoke at the Consensus conference, the largest annual gathering of crypto-fans in the world, in 2017.\nBut Fidelity’s actual experiments in cryptocurrencies have been modest. Some Fidelity customers can see their bitcoin balances in their accounts, but customers can’t buy and sell digital coins on the platform. Fidelity has mined cryptocurrencies, and accepts bitcoin and ether for charitable contributions. Employees can purchase food with bitcoin at the Fidelity cafeteria in Boston, and join a Bits and Blocks club to attend internal lectures on blockchain tech.\nAnd yet, Fidelity has mostly been experimenting while other financial firms have been diving in more aggressively, from big traditional exchanges that offer bitcoin futures to companies such as Square (SQ) and Robinhood that allow users to trade digital coins.\nNew job ads sent out internally indicate that Fidelity may have larger ambitions. One ad, obtained by Business Insider, looks for a systems engineer “to help engineer, create, and deploy a Digital Asset Exchange to both a public and private cloud.” There are several companies that allow investors to exchange currency for digital coins, but none with the clout or reputation of Fidelity.\nThe other job ad says the company wants someone to develop custodian services for bitcoin and other digital currencies, Business Insider reported.\nFinding custodians to secure digital assets has proven to be extremely difficult, given that the coins are vulnerable to hacking or getting lost. Several companies have been building custody solutions; the U.S. exchange Coinbase has one available to institutional investors.\nA Fidelity spokeswoman wrote in an email to Barron’s that “It’s no secret that we are actively exploring cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and other digital assets in our Blockchain Incubator at… ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abby johnson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fidelity investments", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fidelity", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T08:13:18.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "515c7b6057b7aabdc24bf3903b8e23c3e97375fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeEp0fUkrsH5VKkhimwUlASyg04CX8w59QFxoOUyLSnd2tTkaG5hypTNcyNFCRxJmTWc.kbhmoH6EwXVKbcFidJfWs0lQmgBsA3zJh.e.RRg--", "site_full": "trenz.today", "site": "trenz.today", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Crypto Market Bullrun Coming Soon!

The applicant is an exchange which has been suspended twice from carrying out any crypto activities and received two business improvement orders.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space The First Rejection\nThe Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) is reportedly preparing to reject an application to operate a crypto exchange in the country. “The first time it has done so,” Nikkei reported, adding:\nThe decision follows the ministry’s conclusion that Yokohama-based FSHO lacks the necessary systems to operate its business…By barring an exchange operator that it has found to be substandard, the agency aims to demonstrate its determination to re-establish a sound currency trading environment in Japan.\nFSHO is a “deemed dealer” or “quasi-operator” of cryptocurrencies in Japan, meaning it has been allowed to operate a crypto exchange while its application with the FSA is being reviewed. There are 16 deemed dealers altogether. However, the agency said recently that 8 of them have indicated that they will withdraw their applications.\nMeanwhile, Japan has 16 fully-licensed cryptocurrency exchanges and about 100 companies are seeking to enter the space including Yahoo! Japan, Line Corp, and Coinbase. Suspended with Corrective Orders\nBesides Coincheck which was hacked in January, FSHO is the only other crypto exchange in Japan to receive two punishment orders from the FSA. The first was on March 8 and the second on April 6.\nIn the March order, the agency suspended all of FSHO’s businesses related to cryptocurrencies from March 8 to April 7 and issued the company a business improvement order. The company was told to correct four areas of operations such as to “Build a position to securely manage user information.” The improved measures taken were to be submitted to the agency by March 22. Rejection to Follow Second Suspension\nIn the April order, the agency again suspended all operations relating to cryptocurrencies of the company from April 8 to June 7 and issued another business improvement order.\nThis second order contains five business improvement areas, some of which were the same as those in the first order. Among new areas are the “Establishment of an effective management system including money laundering and terrorist financing” and a risk management system. The company was supposed to report the changes to the agency by May 7.\nBased on its review, the FSA found that “the exchange did not sufficiently verify the identity of customers in transactions where crime is suspected, or in cases where customer deposits may be diverted,” Nikkei summarized, adding that:\nThe suspension period is due to end Thursday, after which the agency will bar the exchange from operating and deny its registration.\nWhat do you think of the FSA finally rejecting a crypto exchange registration?

The Supreme Court ordered the city court to hear the appeal. Russian Court Overturned Previous Decision St. Petersburg City Court.\nThe St. Petersburg City Court has overturned the ruling of the Vyborgsky District Court of St. Petersburg to block the Bitcoininfo.ru website in Russia.\n“The St. Petersburg City Court quashed the decision of the district court to recognize the information posted on the Bitcoininfo.ru website,” Tass reported the city court explaining on Monday, June 4.\n“Vyborg District Court of St. Petersburg will again consider the case of the blocking of the site on cryptocurrencies, www.bitcoininfo.ru,” Rapsi learned from the city court, adding:\nThe city court canceled the decision to block the site and sent the case [back] to the Vyborgsky District Court for a new hearing. Problem With Spreading Crypto Information\nThis case began in July 2016 when the St. Petersburg Vyborgsky District Court made the ruling to block the Bitcoininfo.ru website in absence of the site owner. The court “considered the statement of the prosecutor’s office that the site contains information about cryptocurrencies” and decided to block the site, the publication detailed. According to the case file, Tass explained that the prosecutor’s office demanded the site be blocked based on its content about cryptocurrencies that “do not lend themselves to state control,”“promote the growth of the shadow economy,” and “do not have certain consumer properties.”\nThe representative of the website’s owner, Sarkis Darbinyan, told the publication that the prosecutor’s actions “takes place without the involvement of site owners,” adding that none of them received “requests for the removal of prohibited information, and the city court refuses to accept appeals after the actual blocking of websites.”\nHe further detailed:\nAccording to the statements of the prosecutor’s office of St. Petersburg, about 100 sites devoted to cryptocurrencies have been blocked.\nThe domain administrator appealed against the court’s decision, believing it to be illegal. However, the city court did not consider his appeal so he appealed to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, which subsequently ordered the city court to consider his complaint.\nIn March, the St. Petersburg City Court struck down a ban on 40 bitcoin-related websites offering information about cryptocurrencies and exchange services in Russia, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported .\nDo you think bitcoin websites will finally be unblocked in Russia?

Electronic Bitcoin OTC Trading\nJump Trading’s new platform is a significant upgrade on the usual OTC bitcoin trading paradigm.\nUsually, firms conduct such transactions with their counter-parties over the phone or via secure messaging services. This method is an auditing nightmare what with having to scrape telephone and messaging records.\nThe new platform built by Jump Trading allows the firm to conduct electronic trades with its clients. The firm created a GUI, which makes it possible for its parties to interact with the OTC desk via a desktop platform. The connection is secured, and users will not be able to connect with external exchange platforms.\nOTC trading is popular with large bitcoin traders who don’t want to deposit a large amount of funds to online cryptocurrency exchanges. Also, such large volume trades might upset the balance of the market as the presence of a massive buy/sell order could send the wrong signals to retail investors.\nThere is also the problem of slippage , i.e. significant price changes between order placement and execution that can affect the profitability of such large transactions. Bitcoin is Maturing as an Asset\nThe new Jump Trading bitcoin OTC trading platform is yet another indication that the cryptocurrency is rapidly maturing. According to forex trader, John Spallanzani, a portfolio manager at Miller Value Partners, bitcoin’s growth closely mirrors that of the multi-trillion-dollar forex market.\nIn the early 90s, long before the advent of desktop and mobile FX platforms, brokers would call multiple banks at once for spot FX prices. These days, everything is done in front of a computer or smartphone screen, and now it appears bitcoin is on the same trajectory.\nSince 2017, bitcoin has emerged as a viable investment asset with dozens of investment funds and OTC trading desks . There are over 360 different bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments funds in the market, operating in various places around the world.\nIn 2018 alone, more than 60 new bitcoin funds have been established.

Cross-border transactions need to become cheaper, more efficient, and more accessible. Checking all of these boxes won’t be easy. Swift and Ripple are directly competing in this regard, which has some interesting consequences. The Current Swift Situation\nIn the world of international payments, Swift has become a household name. This inter-bank messaging service has dominated the market for nearly five decades. More importantly, it also runs over half of the world’s cross-border payments for larger amounts. All of its member banks have a “stake” in the company and need it to become successful.\nOver the years, thousands of banks have become a part of the Swift network. As such, one would expect efficiency when it comes to cross-border payments. That is still not always the case, as some transfers remain expensive and somewhat slow, often taking several days to complete. In this day and age of digital transformation, any delay has become unacceptable.\nEven some of its member banks have begun looking for alternatives. Blockchain technology is of great interest in this regard. It offers transparency, speed, and cost-cutting measures. To counter these developments, Swift has begun evolving its messaging system. Moreover, the team is also experimenting with blockchain. That doesn’t mean competitors are not upping their game at the same time. Ripple Remains the Biggest Competitor\nIn the world of cross-border transactions, Ripple is quickly making a name for itself. Faster, cheaper, and more reliable options using blockchain technology has attracted a lot of attention. Banco Santander is one of the project’s biggest partners to date. Additionally, there are dozens of other firms conducting experiments with Ripple’s native technology and XRP asset. Santander UK’s Ed Metzger explains the bank’s decision as follows:\n“There were some pain points experienced by our customers when making cross-border payments that we wanted to address with the new OnePay FX service. We have had very positive feedback [regarding Ripple] and good take-up. It gives the customer much more certainty over how much money will arrive in the destination account.”\nDespite Swift’s upgrades, it seems evident Ripple still holds all of the cards right now. Blockchain is an advanced form of technology for the financial sector. Ripple has a first-mover advantage in this regard. Moreover, Swift seemingly remains skeptical regarding the potential of distributed ledgers. It is that “attitude’ which can make the difference between remaining a market leader and eventually being dethroned.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "swift", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T16:28:57.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0ac5695d2312d21afc0777a356cfac9cc0f3b9d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKy4CqS7ikn76YgN30fsiqQDX_uc1U8FodI9lG67C8EpkC6N06oAJNKIHa5bCgAV65seLEVtoI1ndFQPhNBh_1PTfn6UiHDv6S8-", "site_full": "phatbit.com", "site": "phatbit.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Why You Shouldn’t Use Cloud Mining + Bitcoin Merch Giveaway! – PhatBit", "title_full": "Why You Shouldn’t Use Cloud Mining + Bitcoin Merch Giveaway! – PhatBit", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://phatbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hqdefault-92.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0ac5695d2312d21afc0777a356cfac9cc0f3b9d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKy4CqS7ikn76YgN30fsiqQDX_uc1U8FodI9lG67C8EpkC6N06oAJNKIHa5bCgAV65seLEVtoI1ndFQPhNBh_1PTfn6UiHDv6S8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why You Shouldn’t Use Cloud Mining + Bitcoin Merch Giveaway! – PhatBit", "text": "10 thoughts on “Why You Shouldn’t Use Cloud Mining + Bitcoin Merch Giveaway!” MrSotko CryptoCurrency says: June 6, 2018 at 4:51 am\nsimply comment down below saying you would like the necklace and include your email address so if you are picked i can get a hold of you and ship it on out. if you dont want to publicly include your email address in the comments please add your email to the about me section of your youtube page.

The last couple of days has seen the many markets retrace – with many traders closely watching to see if the markets can hold up and confirm the formation of a higher low, or if they will wash out to produce more bearish momentum.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Trading Volume Soars But Ripple Keeps Falling BTC Tests Major Trendline\nThe BTC markets recently posted a green weekly candle for the first time in the last four weeks – signaling for the potential for bitcoin to produce a second consecutive higher low since February’s washout down to $6,000 USD. Should support at approximately $7,000 successfully hold, many traders predicting that more bullish momentum may be in store the BTC markets. Transversely, a break-down from the current price area to retest $6,000 would also comprise the rejection of the long-term ascending trendline dated from July 2017. Should this trendline break, such would likely comprise the catalyst for further bearish price action across the cryptocurrency markets.\nLooking at BTC on the 4-hour chart, one can see that it has broken above the immediate descending bear-channel in which the markets have trended for several weeks, as with many other cryptocurrency markets. If BTC can stay outside of said channel, such may be a signal for coming upward price action.\nAs of this writing, BTC is trading for approximately $7,600 and exerts a market dominance of 37.7%. The market capitalization of the bitcoin markets is $130.2 billion. BCH Consolidates Above $1,000\nBCH/USD has also broken out the bear channel in which price action has trend since early May after gaining approximately 15% since the start of June. If prices are able to hold up, BCH will have produced its first higher low for 2018 – potentially comprising the first signal that Bitcoin Cash may be exiting the bear trend that has dominated market action throughout 2018.\nThe BCH/BTC markets have also broken above a bear-channel, with Bitcoin Cash gaining over BTC by approximately 10% in the last week.\nAs of this writing, BCH is trading for approximately $1,150 USD, or 0.15 BTC, with BCH comprising roughly 5.7% of the total capitalization of all crypto markets combined. Bitcoin Cash is the fourth largest crypto market by capitalization with a market cap of nearly $19.8 billion.\nETH/BTC Forms Symmetrical Triangle\nAs of this writing, ETH appears to have bounced off an ascending trendline for the second time since in 2018 that dates back to December, after ETH gained approximately 10% during the last weekend over bitcoin. Whilst ETH/BTC currently appears to be forming one of several potential symmetrical triangles, a break of the immediate ascending trendline could lead to a significant breakdown relative to BTC. ETH is trading for 0.0777 BTC as of this writing.\nWhen paired against USD, ETH has gained roughly 17% in the last week – bouncing from a recent low of approximately $520 to currently be trading for nearly $610. Looking at the daily chart, the ETH/USD markets appear to be creating a new price channel above the long-term ascending trendline from early 2017, and outside of the descending trendline that drove price action from January until early-April.\nLooking at immediate price action on a 4-hour chart, ETH appears to have just crept above last month’s bear-channel, however, a break-out above the descending trendline is still far from confirmed as of this writing.\nThe market dominance of Ethereum is approximately 17.6% as of this writing. The market capitalization of ETH is nearly $60.9 billion. Other Leading Markets Bounce Above Bear-Channels\nThe third largest crypto market by capitalization, Ripple has gained approximately 11.5% over USD this week, rallying from approximately $0.605 to $0.676.\nWhen measuring against BTC, XRP has gained roughly 10% in the last 7 days and is currently trading for 8915 satoshis after having broken above last month’s bear-channel. Ripple has a market capitalization of $26.67 billion.\nEOS has produced a significant bounce in recent days, gaining around over 16% from the last month’s low of roughly $12.15 and breaking above May’s descending channel. EOS/USD currently appears to have bounced off support at the previous all-time-high area from 2017 of approximately $14. When compared with BTC, EOS gained approximately 12% from $0.00165 to $0.00185.\nEOS is currently the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market cap with $12.67 billion.\nDo you think that the markets are forming a higher low?

The landmark ruling occurred on May 30, 2018, and it overturns a decision made by one of the country’s lower courts in a case dating back to last year.In September 2017, the Suwon District Court charged 33-year-old Ahn with the sale and distribution of child pornography. Operating a website since 2013, Ahn was arrested in May of 2017 for disseminating some 235,000 obscene files. Even though the court handed Ahn a guilty verdict and 18 months in prison for his actions, it did not confiscate the 216 bitcoins Ahn accumulated in exchange for the porn.According to the court, the government could not seize Ahn’s bitcoins because, unlike other assets tied to illicit dealings, they aren’t tangible.“It is not appropriate to confiscate bitcoins because they are in the form of electronic files without physical entities, unlike cash,” the court ruled. “Virtual currency cannot assume an objective standard value.”Now, the country’s Supreme Court thinks otherwise. The Suwon District Court’s decision was appealed, and, upon being challenged in South Korea’s highest court, it didn’t hold up. Seeing as Ahn accrued his digital fortune in exchange for an illegal service, the court reversed the decision and mandated that it is lawful for the government to confiscate it. “Korean law stipulates that a seizable hidden asset ranges from cash, deposits, stocks, and other forms of tangible and intangible objects holding standard value,” the ruling from this Tuesday reads. “Bitcoin is intangible and comes in the form of digitized files, but it is traded on an exchange and can be used to buy goods. Therefore, receiving bitcoins is an act of taking profits.”Ahn’s sentence will remain the same, but he’ll have to forfeit 191 bitcoins, worth roughly $1.4 million at press time along with some $654,000 in cash. Tracking Ahn’s transactions on Bitcoin’s ledger, the court was able to determine how many bitcoins he received as payment.“[Ahn] received bitcoins by giving a certain bitcoin address to pornography watchers online. Records stored on the Bitcoin blockchain proved that bitcoins sent to him should be seen as profits online,” the court ruling states.The ruling is a decisive, if roundabout, benchmark for cryptocurrency’s legal status in the country. It gives digital assets like bitcoin enhanced legitimacy at a time when South Korea is also in the process of legalizing and regulating Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). After effecting a domestic ban on ICOs in September of last year, the South Korean government has approached the cryptocurrency industry with ambivalent resolve. Tuesday’s ruling and the outlook of a formal framework for token sales, however, seem to be steering official policy in a clearer, more proactive direction.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine.

The move followed the implementation of similar advertising restrictions on Facebook.\nThe post stated that ads promoting “Cryptocurrencies and related content (including but not limited to initial coin offerings, cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, and cryptocurrency trading advice” would no longer be served on the company’s platforms “In June.” Business Community Criticizes Crypto Ad Ban\nThe prohibitive policy regarding cryptocurrency adverts has garnered criticism from the community.\nRevolut’s head of mobile, Ed Cooper, stated of the ban “Unfortunately, the fact that this ban is a blanket ban will mean that legitimate cryptocurrency businesses which provide valuable services to users will be unfairly caught in the crossfire. A more targeted approach would definitely be preferable: it would seem heavy-handed for example to put a blanket ban on all ads for job postings, anti-virus software or charities just because ads for these products and service are also sometimes used as an entry point by scammers to target consumers.”​\nThe chief executive of UK-based investment firm Blackmore Group has accused Google of banning cryptocurrency ads due to harboring intentions of developing its own cryptocurrency. “I understand that Facebook and Google are under a lot of pressure to regulate what their users are reading, but they are still advertising gambling websites and other unethical practices. I suspect the ban has been implemented to fit in with potential plans to introduce their own cryptocurrency to the market in the near future and therefore removing other crypto adverts allows them to do it on their own terms.”\nWhilst no hard evidence of Google having expressed a desire to develop a cryptocurrency exists, a spokesperson for the company told Business Insider “Like many new technologies, we have individuals in various teams exploring potential uses of blockchain but it’s way too early for us to speculate about any possible uses or plans” in March. In May, Ethereum’s founder, Vitalik Buterin, shared a screenshot of an email from Google’s recruiting department, further fueling speculation that Google may be considering a foray into distributed ledger technology. Google as “Gatekeeper of Information”\nGareth Malna, a fintech lawyer at Burges Salmon, has stated that “The decision by Google to act as a quasi-regulator in this context is a potentially troubling development given its vast commercial power.”\n“​For Google to step in and block that market may sound like consumer protection, but is potentially overstepping its perceived role as gatekeeper to information,” Mr. Malna said.\nDo you think that Google and Facebook will reverse their ad bans targeting cryptocurrency in the near future?

In the first few days of the year, the price of BTC climbed above $17,000 briefly. As of this writing, it's hovering above $7,000, with some investors expecting the value to continue to fall going forward. Although bitcoin remains the largest digital currency in the world by market cap, it has spent the better part of 2018 struggling to maintain the incredible momentum it built up late last year. Coinciding with the decline in bitcoin's value, CNBC reports that Google searches for the term \"bitcoin\" have plummeted by 75% since January . In the past three months, the number of searches for the popular cryptocurrency has roughly halved. Link to Buyer Interest?\nWhile there's not necessarily a direct correlation between Google searches for \"bitcoin\" and the price of the digital currency itself, there is reason to believe that a drop in bitcoin searches is bad news for the cryptocurrency . DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas suggests that his company uses Google Trends \"to track search queries for 'bitcoin' as a proxy for potential new buyers,\" adding that \"bitcoin needs a new narrative in order to reestablish global attention.\"\nGoogle Trends assigns numerical values to represent search interest relative to the highest level of interest in that term over a specified region and time. The highest value, 100, indicates peak popularity for the term among Google searchers. On Jan. 1, bitcoin's popularity measure was 37. By June 2, it dropped to just 9. Other Measures of Interest\nColas utilizes other means of gauging investor interest in bitcoin, too, including wallet growth. For April and May of this year, growth in new wallets was about 2% per month. The first quarter compounded monthly growth was 3.7%, Colas reported. Compared to the last quarter of 2017, though, this number is weak; wallet growth for Q4 last year, compounded monthly, was 7.6%.\nBitcoin is not alone in seeing search interest drop off this year. Ethereum has fallen in search frequency by 70%, while ripple is down by 87%. EOS , however, has moved the opposite direction, with searches nearly doubling so far this year.\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (\"ICOs\") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or ICOs.

Kundra -- the husband of Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty -- had appeared before the ED office in Mumbai on Tuesday. According to some media reports (not by IANS), he was reportedly grilled for several hours by the ED investigators. \"I was summoned by the ED merely as a witness. An enquiry is underway by the concerned regulatory authorities and I stand committed to extend all my cooperation to the law enforcement agency,\" Kundra said, clearing the air on the issue in a statement. A businessman with interest in sports, this is not Kundra's first brush with law. In the past, he had appeared before different authorities on his investments in the Rajasthan Royals IPL team. Some members of that team were also embroiled in the cricket spot-fixing scandal. In his statement here vis-A-vis the media speculation of his grilling, Kundra said: \"I am terribly disappointed by the irresponsible reporting carried out by some sections of the media. Clarity on the issue should have been sought before carrying such headlines.\" \"The authorities, summoned me merely as a witness, as the accused Amit Bharadwaj happens to be an acquaintance and some introductions were made hence there is a certain protocol being followed by the agencies,\" said Kundra. He added that Bharadwaj was intending to buy a team in his Poker League and had entered into a contract with them for the same. \"However, he was expelled on account of non-payment of fees and I was called as a witness in this connection. While we continuously strive to keep taking steps to improve our reputation, these type of unconfirmed, baseless, reports severely dent our market perception and erode investor sentiments,\" he said. \"Notwithstanding what has happened, at Viaan Industries, we shall continue to focus on growing our gaming and media vertical. We remain excited about the company's future and strive to keep adding shareholder value,\" he said. It may be recalled, the ED, sometime back, had registered a criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against a bitcoin-based investment website GainBitcoin, its founder Amit Bhardwaj and eight others. The ED had alleged that about 8,000 investors lost around Rs 2,000 crore funds by transacting in this scheme.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shilpa shetty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raj kundra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kundra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rajasthan royals ipl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ians", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enforcement directorate", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T02:40:06.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c7ad9baf241d42453dbd8453e5ab68cbd2f37453", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtfcycYqfsuDcs_ngsxeYIRVVX.raX4PS3HdX1B9EMAClqC42xstiwP7lh2LER1hdcEBbE4epuXvJp9HzpmvAvYHLPJTqEIlGuw--", "site_full": "reviewcoin.me", "site": "reviewcoin.me", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Best New - Cryptocurrencies 'Are Not Going Away' Says CFTC Official - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "title_full": "Best New - Cryptocurrencies 'Are Not Going Away' Says CFTC Official - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "ME", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "https://reviewcoin.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_1091235845.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c7ad9baf241d42453dbd8453e5ab68cbd2f37453", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtfcycYqfsuDcs_ngsxeYIRVVX.raX4PS3HdX1B9EMAClqC42xstiwP7lh2LER1hdcEBbE4epuXvJp9HzpmvAvYHLPJTqEIlGuw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Best New - Cryptocurrencies 'Are Not Going Away' Says CFTC Official - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "text": "/ Best New – Cryptocurrencies ‘Are Not Going Away’ Says CFTC Official Best New – Cryptocurrencies ‘Are Not Going Away’ Says CFTC Official By root / June 6, 2018\nCryptocurrencies are here to stay, a U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission official said this week.\nRostin Benham, one of the CFTC’s commissioners, spoke during the Blockchain for Impact Global Summit, held at the United Nations Plaza on Monday. During his speech , he emphasized the major potential for blockchain to address issues in healthcare, employment and crime, among other sectors.\nCalling cryptocurrencies a “technological revolution,” Behnam said:\n“But virtual currencies may – will – become part of the economic practices of any country, anywhere. Let me repeat that: these currencies are not going away and they will proliferate to every economy and every part of the planet … Virtual currencies could transform the economic and social landscape.”\nBenham also warned against the flip-side of cryptocurrencies if they are not properly overseen, saying “if we are not thoughtful, if we do not remain ever diligent to the movements within the transformation, we may unleash corruption, criminality and division on a greater scale.”\n“Blockchain could become a source for repression and totalitarianism,” he warned.\nThis is not the first time Benham has expressed caution about the potential use cases for blockchain. In an earlier address last month at the FIA Law and Compliance conference, he shared concerns over the possibility of cryptocurrencies threatening the stability of the financial industry.\nStill, his sentiments over blockchain remain ever cognizant of the new technology’s ability to remake “our economic, social, and political relations.”\nThe BFI summit was aimed at uncovering the applications of blockchain technology to sustainable development and humanitarian challenges by engaging the United Nations (UN) departments, funds, programs and specialized agencies. It is part of a broader initiative by the Blockchain Commission for Sustainable Development that was established last year by the UN General Assembly.\nUN flag image via Shutterstock.

Behind the scenes though, the development of Bitcoin has continued to defy market movements with the continuous development of the Lightning Network (LN), which has led to the creation of several bitcoin LN wallets.\nThe Lightning Network ushered in the promise of easing network congestion by moving on-chain transactions to the second-layer protocol.\nHere are some of the mobile wallets currently in development. Eclair\nDeveloped by Paris-based ACINQ, Lightning-ready Bitcoin wallet Eclair currently has 3,000 wallet downloads, and it came about as a result of three years of working on Lightning. The Eclair wallet is a real Lightning node not a remote control app for a node running on a server. Users can transfer money from a checking to a savings account by closing channels, generate Lightning invoices, and pay Lightning invoices through QR codes or Lightning invoices.\nDominique Padiou, a software engineer at Eclair, told Bitcoin Magazine that payment route computation is made by the wallet itself, which creates better privacy, similar to the way a node on a server would.\nAt the moment, the wallet is outbound only. This is a deliberate move as the company believes users need a mobile Lightning wallet to make payments but not necessarily to receive payments. There are plans, however, to add a receiving feature in the future.\nFor now, funds stored in LN channels cannot be backed up through the app. Padiou said the company plans to \"improve the performance of the wallet in the future, make it secure and add a backup mechanism for the LN channels.\" This wallet is only available on the Google Play Store . Bitcoin Lightning Wallet\nBitcoin Lightning is an SPV BIP37-based wallet developed by Anton Kumaigorodski. It features full Lightning Network support that provides for both on-chain and off-chain network transactions and is available in both testnet and mainnet.\nProcessing is local for both on- and off-chain transactions. Users can send and receive bitcoin almost instantly through dedicated channels. One unique quality of this wallet is that it uses a system of storage tokens to store channel backups and delay refunding transactions anonymously.\nThis process is important, since \"having a mnemonic phrase won\"t get your lost channel balance back unless you have a backup,\" Kumaigorodski stated. The potential for funds to go missing due to inconsistencies remain, but Kumaigorodski added that \"the wallet offers off-chain data loss protection by automating the channel.” This wallet is available on the Google Play Store . Rawtx\nRawtx, short for “raw transactions,” is a mobile Lightning Network wallet for Bitcoin that allows users to send and receive testnet bitcoins on the blockchain and Lightning Network. The lead developer, known by the alias “raw tx,” told Bitcoin Magazine that they created the wallet for users who wanted to test out and get familiar with Lightning technology.\nHe went further to explain what makes the wallet unique. \"It is the easiest to start with. One of the first things we show the user is a way of opening a channel with Lightning faucet.” The Rawtx wallet is built on lnd which is one of the most stable Lightning implementations out there.\nThe app currently supports mainnet transactions but enabling it is not entirely straightforward. The developer told us that the current app available for download is only on testnet, but mainnet testing has begun and it looks promising.\nThe iOS version of the Rawtx wallet is scheduled to be released later this month while the Android version can be found here .\nOther bitcoin Lightning wallets that have been released include LND Thin Wallet developed by Union 7 Labs, Swift Lightning Project and Shango Lightning Wallet . They offer similar features with very little difference in structure and how they process off-chain transactions. Usability Issues\nWhile Lightning has grown since it was first proposed back in 2015, there is still a long way to go in making these apps easy to use for everyday payments for the average person.\nAt the time of publishing, there are currently 2,135 open nodes and 5,566 channels . While there is lots of excitement and optimism about what the Lightning Network represents, users are expected to be cautious as the technology is still in development and surprises are possible.\nThere are also usability issues which could affect the speed of its adoption unless they are fixed. This is most evident in the channel creation process. A user has to go through a series of confirmations before a new channel is accepted, which means the user has to monitor the channel carefully.\nYou can read more about the Lightning Network here .\nBitcoin Magazine currently does not endorse any of these wallets. While we have no concrete reason to believe they are insecure, all Lightning software is still in very early stages, and we cannot guarantee they will work as advertised.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .

TBP #207 - Haseeb Qureshi 0 Jun 6, 2018\nIf you work in payments fraud, you get an appreciation for the weaknesses of our financial infrastructure. Really, it’s kind of a mess. As an engineer, when you see a system full of technical debt and bad design choices, there’s only one conclusion you can reach: this thing is due for a rewrite. That, in large part, is what made our guest, Haseeb Qureshi, catch the crypto bug. In June 2017, he decided the blockchain space was too interesting to sit on the sidelines. He said goodbye to Airbnb so I could pursue crypto full-time.

Tobias, cleveland.com | Posted June 06, 2018 at 03:16 PM | Updated June 06, 2018 at 06:29 PM Comment\nCLEVELAND, Ohio – If you’ve heard about blockchain, it’s probably because you’ve heard about Bitcoin.\nBlockchain shot into the public consciousness last year as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum skyrocketed in value. Blockchain is the underpinning of cryptocurrencies, but there’s more to the technology than that.\nIn the near future, it could be used to automate government records, track trillions of dollars in shipped goods and allow a patient record to be accessed from any hospital.\nCompanies like IBM are funneling money into exploring blockchain, universities are dedicating departments to it and states are passing legislation to try and jump-start its development.\nThat’s why entrepreneur Bernie Moreno is looking to turn Cleveland into “Blockland”, colleges and the government to accelerate development of the technology in Cleveland and to draw start-ups to the area. ( Click here to read more.)\nCryptocurrencies have fallen off in value as the 2017 hype faded. But setting them aside, here’s what blockchain is, what it can do and how people are using it right now. What is blockchain?\n(Video credit: IBM Think Academy, Youtube)\nEnvisioning the future of blockchain requires understanding how the technology works.\nOn its simplest level, blockchain is a constantly growing list of records linked to each other online. These records can be accessed, and the list can be added to, by anyone granted access to the list. Entries can never be overwritten.\nBlockchains are made up of individual units of records, called blocks. The blocks are linked with “hashes” — characters generated by cryptographic algorithms.\nA common metaphor is a financial ledger, which can be used to document continually growing transactions. This is basically how cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin work. But blockchain theoretically could be used to document all kinds of things, including medical records, energy use, company inventory, real-estate titles, votes or even people’s identities.\nSome blockchain platforms, like Bitcoin, are open to the public, available to anyone who wants to use them. Any updates or changes in the platform’s rules are voted upon by other members of the group. In the Bitcoin system, blocks record transfers of bitcoin currency between accounts, but the identity of the accountholders are protected.\nOthers are like a private company, with access controlled by a central authority.\nIt’s not just records that can be tracked on blockchain, but also conditions. By storing the conditions of a deal or transaction on a blockchain ledger, the system can track them and automatically complete certain tasks, like transferring money, if the conditions are met. These are referred to as smart contracts.\nFor example, one French company uses blockchain for a form of flight insurance. If your flight is more than two hours late and your details are loaded into the system, you can be automatically compensated through the platform. What are the benefits of using blockchain?

What drives IOTA to stay on top is a strong capacity of its “blockless” technology called Tangle, alongside with the involvement of IOTA in the Internet of Things. Moreover, IOTA is one of the rare coins to have found its way towards a real-life purpose as well as the mass adoption of IOTA technology and MIOTA units. So, after the first charging crypto station for electric vehicles, IOTA is now taking everything to the next level by partnering up with Norway’s biggest bank.\nIOTA signs an Agreement with Norway’s Bank DNB ASA\nAt the beginning of June, it was evident that IOTA won’t stop with having MIOTA charged electric charging station when it comes to developing the Internet of Things.\nBesides from exploring the boundaries, or better aid possibilities in a borderless ecosystem of IoT, IOTA seems to be working on mass adoption as well, which has been going in its favor with the latest proof that the MIOTA charging station for electric vehicles stationed in the Netherlands is indeed functional and fast.\nHowever, in the terms of developing and exploring the Internet of Things, IOTA has recently partnered up with Norway’s biggest bank.\nThe mentioned bank is called DNB ASA and it represents the largest banking service in Norway while it also represents one of the largest banks in the mentioned area.\nSince DNB ASA banking service and IOTA share the same objective when it comes to the Internet of Things and machine-to-machine communication, the two parties have signed an agreement where both IOTA and DNB promised to work together on “i nnovation and co-creation in the space of citizen-centric innovation, machine economy and decentralized data marketplaces” as stated in the Medium post published on May 31 st by the head of Biz Dev of IOTA.\nIOTA’s Tangle to be Used for Research and Development of IoT\nThe two parties, DNB ASA, the largest Norway’s banking service and IOTA, have agreed to bring their forces together in order to explore and develop a new digital innovation landscape in which Tangle will be the main spinning wheel.\nNorway’s largest banking service already has a history of working with decentralized blockchain-based technology, and will as of the most recent turn of events collaborate with IOTA in order to use Tangle for creating an innovation ecosystem for the Internet of Things, while developing machine economy and decentralized marketplaces.\nIOTA makes up for the first and by far the only ecosystem that runs on a blockchain-based blockless system called Tangle, while being designed and launched specifically for the purpose of building the future of the Internet of Things. That is how IOTA becomes one of the first cryptos ever to get a chance to be used in real life machine-to-machine communication, powered by Tangle of course, which made the MIOTA charging station for electric vehicles as a true success as it was later demonstrated in front of a live audience.\nThat is how it is expected to see IOTA thriving towards mass adoption and radical development of the IoT-related ecosystems, economy, marketplaces and different projects that fit the requirements of machine-to-machine communication and IoT related systems, protocols and products.\nIOTA has held a live demonstration of the crypto charging station for electric vehicles a couple of days ago, showing that charging your Tesla with MIOTA charged station that is driven by Tangle, is simple, easy and fast, while the payment is processed in a matter of seconds.\nIOTA and the Market Performance\nThe market seems a bit shaky, once again showing signs of a sluggish return; however, some of the currencies seem to be rising up against the dollar although with minor gains.\nThat is how MIOTA is trading up in the green while climbing up against the dollar by a minor rise of 0.89%.\nRanked as the ninth-best crypto on the global coin ranking list, this asset can be traded at the price of 1.73$ per one unit with great odds of getting near the price of 2$ per one MIOTA.\nEarlier in January, IOTA has set a record value of over 5$ per one unit, but due to its stability in the market, we didn’t see it go far off from its all-time high.\nIOTA (MIOTA) Partners Up with Norway’s Biggest Bank was originally published on https://globalcoinreport.com/ .

Sitting atop a public ledger blockchain, the data that makes up bitcoin is not owned by any one company or nation. The code is open-source, meaning it can be modified by any person that has access to it. To ensure that the currency remains secure, though, bitcoin transactions are chained together and their information is spread across many locations (in a process known as decentralization), making the digital currency nearly impossible to track or manipulate. Unlike cash or gold, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin do not have a physical form and only exist as lines of code on your computer (or in the blockchain). They are a lot like credit or the money you have in online banking. They just don’t have a corresponding physical object in the real world. As of early June 2018, one bitcoin is valued at $10,000 AUD. The popularity of bitcoin ultimately led to the creation of a bitcoin ATM, a machine that is connected to the internet and allows users to exchange bitcoin and cash via a public key on the bitcoin blockchain. Some of these ATMs also offer the option to purchase bitcoin as well as redeem the cryptocurrency for cash. Besides some obvious signage, they look almost identical to traditional ATMs. But instead of connecting to a bank account, they connect to the entire bitcoin exchange. From 2009 (the year bitcoin was invented) to 2017, there were only 20 bitcoin ATMs installed in all of Australia. For those living in small towns and outside of major cities, gaining access to a bitcoin ATM was close to impossible. However, the last six months have seen that number double, with 24 new machines built in the first half of 2018 alone, and more are being added every day. Adelaide had their first bitcoin ATM installed earlier this year, and is now up to four across the city. Sydney saw their number of bitcoin ATMs double, while Victoria has seen the strongest growth of any region in Australia, with eight new ATMs installed in the last six months. Launched in March 2018, Find Bitcoin ATM is a website that allows consumers to locate one of these 44 bitcoin ATMs in Australia. While bitcoin ATMs are considered safe to use, many of them have high transactions fees (up to 7%). Find Bitcoin ATM allows users to find ATMs with low fees or high daily limits. The service also encourages those who use it to submit a form when they see a new ATM location in their area that has not yet been added to the system. While Find Bitcoin ATM currently only locates machines in Australia, this may change in the future. In the meantime, for those located outside of the country, the website still offers in-depth guides on different types of bitcoin ATMs, as well as frequently asked question regarding the currency and information on keeping your money safe.\nFor more information, visit https://www.findbitcoinatm.com.au .

More recently the Managing Director of the IMF, Christine Lagarde , has had a lot of positive words to say about digital currencies. Moreover, the IMF also showcased a picture of money evolving featuring a picture of a bitcoin which was displayed on the front page of the IMF we b site . Now the IMF has released a report written by a variety of IMF researchers who state:\nWe cannot rule out the possibility that some crypto assets will eventually be more widely adopted and fulfill more of the functions of money in some regions or private e-commerce networks. This picture is displayed on one of the articles featured on the IMF website’s front page. A Payment Shift\nThe study notes that the global financial crisis and bank bailouts have “renewed skepticism in some quarters” of the world and there’s a possibility that digital assets can affect the traditional global monetary policies. There’s also talk of a “payment shift” within the study where cryptocurrencies could replace fiat in some regions.\n“Such a shift could also portend a change in the way money is created in the digital age: from credit money to commodity money, we may move full circle back to where we were in the Renaissance,” explains the IMF report.\nEconomists continue to debate the origins of money, and why monetary systems seem to have alternated between commodity and credit money throughout history. If crypto assets indeed lead to a more prominent role for commodity money in the digital age, the demand for central bank money is likely to decline. “Not so long ago, some experts argued that personal computers would never be adopted, and that tablets would only be used as expensive coffee trays, so I think it may not be wise to dismiss virtual currencies,” said the Managing Director of the IMF, Christine Lagarde in September of 2017. Competitive Pressure and the Allure of the Central Bank Coin\nThe IMF paper also details how banks should respond with competitive pressure and they should continue to solidify fiat currencies as a “unit of account.” Cryptocurrencies, however, have a hard time becoming a standard unit of account the IMF notes and this is because “valuation is largely based on beliefs that are not well anchored” which has made the majority of digital currencies quite volatile.\nThe researcher’s paper mentions that central banks could counteract with their own digital currencies. It goes on to say that the banks have many challenges and opportunities in this digital age but they must regain the public’s trust to remain relevant. “They can remain relevant by providing more stable units of account than crypto assets and by making central bank money attractive as a medium of exchange in the digital economy,” the IMF paper concludes.\nWhat do you think about the IMF’s report and how positive this organization is towards cryptocurrencies?

Aayush Jindal | June 6, 2018 | 7:48 am Bitcoin Price Watch: Can BTC/USD Break This Resistance? Aayush Jindal | June 6, 2018 | 7:48 am Key Points Bitcoin price formed a support base near $7,350 and recovered nicely against the US Dollar. There is a key connecting bearish trend line in place with resistance at $7,650 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair has to move past the $7,650 and $7,680 resistance levels to gain traction.\nBitcoin price is showing positive signs above $7,500 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD must clear the $7,650 barrier for more gains in the near term. Bitcoin Price Analysis\nYesterday, we saw a bearish wave below the $7,400 level in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair traded as low as $7,369 before buyers appeared. A base was formed near $7,350 before the price started an upside move. It traded higher and broke the $7,450 level along with the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last downside move from the $7,780 swing high to $7,350 swing low.\nThe price also succeeded in settling above the $7,500 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Later, there was a close above the 50% Fib retracement level of the last downside move from the $7,780 swing high to $7,350 swing low. However, the price is currently struggling to clear the $7,650 resistance. There is also a key connecting bearish trend line in place with resistance at $7,650 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Therefore, a close above the $7,650 resistance is needed for an upside acceleration towards $7,800.\nLooking at the chart , the current price action is positive, but a proper break above $7,650 is needed for buyers to take control. On the downside, an initial support is around $7,500, followed by $7,400. Below this last, the price may perhaps retest the $7,350 support.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD has reduced most of its bullish slope.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is now placed well above the 55 level.\nMajor Support Level – $7,400\nMajor Resistance Level – $7,650 Bitcoin Price Watch: Can BTC/USD Break This Resistance? was last modified: June 6th, 2018 by Aayush Jindal ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitco", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T11:06:52.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "696a951e89eb7c690aeedec42f29ac1ee363d47c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMo92sxzloFg9.MRekHxziXRr.WTBF03MEyWJuOEAc6iwUtj8kiud05SVxRT73yJK0JdNeLyT_Js3GqApoOnwjumfYqaLPbM3zg-", "site_full": "tpbit.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "ThePiachu's Bitcoin Blog: Global Reserve Currency - Special Drawing Rights vs Bitcoin", "title_full": "ThePiachu's Bitcoin Blog: Global Reserve Currency - Special Drawing Rights vs Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.175, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "696a951e89eb7c690aeedec42f29ac1ee363d47c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMo92sxzloFg9.MRekHxziXRr.WTBF03MEyWJuOEAc6iwUtj8kiud05SVxRT73yJK0JdNeLyT_Js3GqApoOnwjumfYqaLPbM3zg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "ThePiachu's Bitcoin Blog: Global Reserve Currency - Special Drawing Rights vs Bitcoin", "text": "A blog about Bitcoin, Ripple, Crypto 2.0 and everything related. 2016-09-27 Global Reserve Currency - Special Drawing Rights vs Bitcoin Earlier this month, the G20 summit was held in China . One of the more interesting topics discussed, was the addition of Chinese yuan to the SDR - Special Drawing Rights. The topic of SDRs is rather important, but it doesn't seem to be discussed all that widely in the crypto community, so I figured I would cover it today. Special Drawing Rights Special Drawing Rights , or SDRs, are supplementary foreign exchange reserve assets defined and maintained by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). They were created in 1969. SDRs are allocated to countries by the IMF, and private parties do not hold or use them. The value of SDRs is based on a weighted basket of currencies (currently, 41% USD, 31% EUR, 11% CNY, 8% JPY and 8% GBP, worth about 1.39USD/SDR). Special Drawing Rights are posed to replace the dollar as the world reserve currency. They serve well as a unit of account (due to lower volatility), can work well in international law (to have an objective measurement of value across multiple countries), and some countries even started pegging their currency to the SDR (due to increased transparency). While the IMF and SDRs might not be an entirely ideal solution to creating a new, global currency ( with US having a veto power and failing to ratify some reforms for example), it might be a step in the right direction. Where SDRs fall short While the Special Drawing Rights are an interesting idea, they fall short in a one key area - they appear to be inaccessible for anyone short of a government. This can limit how useful the currency can be for say, creating international settlement, or using it as a measurement of value for corporations or even individuals. If SDRs were a publicly available and tradable currency, it would be really interesting to see it used for pricing items, wages, etc. to counter currency wars . If your wage is pegged at 3000USD/month, whether USD goes up or down, you're paid the same amount of dollars. But if your wage was instead set at 3000SDR/month, you would receive the same value each month, no matter if it meant you got 2500USD when the dollar is strong, or 3500USD when it was weak. This could give anyone a protection from the government's meddling . Crypto SDRs Creating a currency based on a basket of other currencies is also not an entirely new idea in the crypto space either. Paul Grignon (author of Money as Debt ) has described his take on the idea as Digital Coin back in 2009. A part of the system, called Perpetual Coin, would initially be issued based on a value of a basket of currencies . Unfortunately, the project never left the conceptual phase, and the website is down now, so it is unlikely we will see it ever implemented... Other than that, there doesn't appear to be an SDR- pegged cryptocurrency out there. This might perhaps be due to the fact that we already have a better alternative to the Special Drawing Rights - Bitcoin . What it lacks in stable value at times, it more than makes up in terms of being all-inclusive and, at least so far, immune from government influence. It wouldn't be hard, however, to create an SDR-Coin - it could function like Tether , or perhaps more accurately, like BitUSD since you couldn't exactly withdraw the coin. The main problem for a centralised issuer would be keeping the valuation of the currency stable, especially in periods where the basket of currencies is adjusted . Other than that, once the currency itself is created (and I would almost bet we would see someone make the currency after the article is published - 700+ cryptos is not enough after all ), it would be interesting to see it start being used internationally. Perhaps we would finally see what is the real demand for SDRs for corporations and real people, rather than just governments. With any luck, this might just hurry the demise of the USD or \" petrodollar \" hegemony. Conclusions Special Drawing Rights are an interesting take on creating a new global reserve currency. While it is currently only accessible to governments, it could be very useful for corporations and end-users. For the time being, Bitcoin is the most accessible alternative for the rest of us.

Very quietly. Published: 24/7 Live - Subscribe to the Pulse Newsletter! Subscribe 24/7 Live - Subscribe to the Pulse Newsletter! Back to Article news The financial firm, Susquehanna International Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, just outside Philadelphia, is one of the largest players in trading traditional investments like stocks, options and exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. Over the past two years, the privately owned company has also built up a trading desk of around a dozen people that buys and sells millions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin and other virtual or cryptocurrencies in private deals. Now the firm is opening trading to a small group of its 500 clients, with plans to expand. The move is the latest sign that the virtual currency markets, which were once relegated to the fringes of the financial world, are being embraced by big, mainstream investors. The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, the Intercontinental Exchange, has been in talks about opening a subsidiary for cryptocurrency trading, and Goldman Sachs is on the verge of opening its own trading operation. But Susquehanna, which has around 1,800 employees around the world, has a lot more money backing its trading desk — and a lot more ability to interact with clients — than the hedge funds and trading firms that have also been early participants in the virtual currency markets. The arrival of big financial institutions has raised concerns among some bitcoin aficionados, who worry that it will harden bitcoin’s status as a speculative trading asset like gold and diminish hopes that it can be used in day-to-day transactions. Not so, said Bart Smith, the head of the digital asset group at Susquehanna. The firm believes bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies inspired by it are likely to have a wide array of uses, but for now, he said, bitcoin’s best bet is to challenge gold as a scarce commodity that can be moved around more easily. The original bitcoin software determined that only 21 million bitcoin would ever be created. That cap isn’t expected to be hit until 2040, and the limited number of tokens currently in circulation has made the online currency appealing as a commodity. Smith said he could also imagine bitcoin, or some competitor, becoming a digital payment method for the internet — as Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, recently predicted — but he wasn’t too worried if that didn’t happen. “We believe that this technology and this asset class is going to change some facet of financial services, and we think it is going to exist forever,” he said. Susquehanna first experimented with trading bitcoin in 2014 after the investor twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss asked the firm about being involved with a bitcoin ETF that they had applied to regulators to create. Regulators eventually denied that application. But Susquehanna kept its one bitcoin trader on board, and then added a few more last year when the cryptocurrency markets took off. The firm decided to step up its operation, and go out to clients, after seeing the success of bitcoin futures contracts, which were introduced by exchanges in Chicago late last year and have been growing in volume in recent months. Susquehanna will trade futures, which are contracts tied to the future price of bitcoin. It will also allow customers to buy and sell actual bitcoin and a few other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and bitcoin cash. To make these available to customers, Susquehanna recently amended the broker dealer license it has on file with regulators. That change will allow the company to trade cryptocurrencies that are labeled by regulators as securities. Regulators in the United States have recently indicated that many newly created virtual currencies — although not bitcoin — should likely be categorized as securities and traded only by regulated entities. Most of the cryptocurrency exchanges where Susquehanna trades are largely unregulated. Bloomberg recently reported that U.S. authorities were investigating whether some traders were taking advantage of this to manipulate the price of bitcoin by posting lots of trades that they didn’t intend to complete. Smith said he had not seen clear evidence of manipulation, but cryptocurrency markets are still very immature compared with the other markets where Susquehanna trades, especially given the lack of regulations for many of the largest exchanges holding cryptocurrencies. He said the single biggest problem for sophisticated investors was the security risk in holding virtual currencies. In other markets, Susquehanna doesn’t have actual custody of stocks or bonds. Bitcoin was built so that users can hold and transfer their tokens with a password or private key that no one else knows. If the private key is compromised, a hacker can take the coins, and the owner has no way to get them back. That has led to big losses at several bitcoin exchanges. Susquehanna built its own systems for storing the cryptocurrencies it is holding for more than a day. To deter hackers, the private keys are kept in devices in an off-site facility that is not connected to the rest of the company’s computer systems. “There were no financial services firms out there two years ago that were storing and moving large amounts of cryptocurrencies, so there is no road map,” he said. Then there is the matter of trying to figure out on a daily basis what a single bitcoin or Ethereum token should be worth. There is still little agreement on what factors traders should take account of when deciding on a value for cryptocurrencies, given that many of the expected uses for digital tokens are still hypothetical. While Smith’s teams look at the technical and security specifications of the coins, it is much harder to answer the most important question: Will they be used as something other than a digital commodity? “The value is: What do you think the best-case scenario of these different digital assets is in the future — and handicapping what is the percentage chance that they will get there,” he said.

If you want to do any IPO with a token, come see us.” The SEC would be “happy to help you do that public offering,” he added.\nIn the interview, Clayton sought to clarify the kinds of characteristics that the agency would look for when determining whether a blockchain-based token constitutes a security.\n“A token, a digital asset, where I give you my money and you go off and make a venture, and in return for giving you my money I say ‘you can get a return’ that is a security and we regulate that,” he told CNBC’s Bob Pisani. “We regulate the offering of that security and regulate the trading of that security.”\nAnd when asked if the agency would come out with a clearer statement on the matter, Clayton responded: “Bob, I hope I just did.”\nAccording to a transcript published by CNBC, Clayton declined to say whether tokens like ether or XRP constitute securities, as some have argued .\nSEC said last summer that “U.S. federal securities law may apply” to ICOs that it would regulate “various activities, including distributed ledger technology, depending on the particular facts and circumstances, without regard to the form of the organization or technology used to effectuate a particular offer or sale.” T\nClayton’s comments follow the appointment of Valerie Szczepanik as the agency’s point person on token sale and cryptocurrency matters.

Bitcoin, the worlds biggest digital currency, continues to lack direction, hovering around $7,500.\nThe lack of activity and inability to recover losses early in 2018 prompted research firm Trefis to lower its year-end price target for the No.1 digital currency. \"Adjusting our forecast for transaction volumes in our interactive Bitcoin Price Estimator now leads to a year-end price target of around $12,500--down from our earlier estimate of $15,000,\" or about 17%, according to Trefis in a June 5 research note.\n\"The global cryptocurrency industry has seen a flurry of new developments since December.

Bitcoin was trading at $7,618.8 rising 2.43% the Bitfinex exchange, as of 8:20 AM ET (12:20 GMT), not far from a session high of $7,659.80. Other digital coins recovered on Wednesday, with Ethereum, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, rising 2.69% to $604.17 on the Bitfinex exchange. Ripple, the third largest virtual currency, increased 1.42% to $0.67019 while Litecoin was at $121.42, up 3.04%. Most virtual currencies plunged in May after the U.S. Department of Justice opened a criminal investigation into the possibility that traders are manipulating the Bitcoin market. Virtual currencies have struggled to gain momentum since, with Bitcoin down 20% since early May. The coin market cap was slighly higher, with total market capitalization at $344 billion at the time of writing compared to $335 billion on Tuesday. In regulation news, the Securities Exchange Commision appointed it first senior crypto advisor. Valerie A. Szczepanik will work in the corporate finance division and will be responsible for applications of US securities laws to “emerging” digital asset technologies such as initial coin offerings and cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile trading firm Susquehanna International Group plans to offer Bitcoin futures and other digital coin products, joining other major finance players. “We believe that this technology and this asset class is going to change some facet of financial services, and we think it is going to exist forever,” head of Susquehanna’s digital asset group Bart Smith said. As virtual currencies have grown in popularity, Wall Street traders have jumped on board by offering futures trading services.

Various firms are looking at the concept of introducing trading desks. One company, which has flown under most people’s radar, already took the plunge a while ago. Susquehanna International Group has built up a trading desk of a dozen people buying and selling cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is an Appealing Currency\nA lot of money can be made and lost with cryptocurrencies. The volatile nature of this industry makes it appealing to speculators and investors. It was a matter of time until the Wall Street big shots began dabbling in these currencies as well. So far, most of the major firms are still in the early process of developing these new options for their clients.\nThat is not the case for Susquehanna International Group. The firm is best-known for trading stocks, ETFs, and options. In that regard, it is not all that different from most Wall Street firms on the market today. What does make it unique is its position in the cryptocurrency trading industry. The privately owned firm has been buying and selling Bitcoin and other currencies through private deals for two years.\nExpanding this functionality will occur shortly. The company indicates they will expose 500 of its clients to cryptocurrency trading in the coming weeks. If successful, the venture will be expanded upon rather quickly. It is another sign of how cryptocurrencies are bound to go mainstream very soon. Moreover, it seems a matter of time until other financial institutions follow this lead by example. A Major Gamble by the Wall Street Firm\nTwo years ago, Bitcoin was not in the position it is right now. In fact, its value was a lot lower and far less attractive to Wall Street. Even so, this particular Wall Street firm saw merit in jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon at such an early stage. In hindsight, it seems to have been a very smart decision when it comes to Bitcoin.\nUnder the current circumstances, not everyone favors Wall Street getting involved in cryptocurrency trading. A lot of people wonder whether or not this will lead to even more speculation and price volatility. Susquehanna’s head of the digital asset group isn’t too concerned in this regard. In his opinion, Bitcoin is poised to challenge gold as a scarce commodity. Even so, Smith acknowledges the currency has a “wide array of uses”, but did not further specify which those may be.\nAll of this shows there is a bright future ahead for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. When Wall Street firms prepare to take the plunge on this industry, it is a matter of time until mainstream traction occurs. Even so, cryptocurrencies still have very few real-world use cases outside of speculation. Changing that will not be easy by any means. Future scaling solutions for Bitcoin and Ethereum may effectively speed up that change a lot sooner than people anticipate.\nImage from Shutterstock Major Wall Street Firm Secretly Traded Bitcoin for Over Two Years was last modified: June 6th, 2018 by JP Buntinx ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "susquehanna international group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T20:05:07.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "919a898a1fb872b4b500c1ac9d5f9d531fdb9287", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMqj_4omXDNCETvIoXCZHTRAgOq7wGAZN12y1rvDRiHXY0ntJxfncTywj0UmzcHpEtWi1nPL6rGogyqhuB.NOgk6iz4ZB0lwX70-", "site_full": "tradecryptoco.in", "site": "tradecryptoco.in", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Ripple CEO: Bitcoin Won’t Be Global Cryptocurrency - Trade Crypto Co.in", "title_full": "Ripple CEO: Bitcoin Won’t Be Global Cryptocurrency - Trade Crypto Co.in", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i1.wp.com/tradecryptoco.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/tradecryptocoins.jpg?fit=669%2C669", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "919a898a1fb872b4b500c1ac9d5f9d531fdb9287", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMqj_4omXDNCETvIoXCZHTRAgOq7wGAZN12y1rvDRiHXY0ntJxfncTywj0UmzcHpEtWi1nPL6rGogyqhuB.NOgk6iz4ZB0lwX70-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ripple CEO: Bitcoin Won’t Be Global Cryptocurrency - Trade Crypto Co.in", "text": "\nRipple’s CEO believes that the dominance of Bitcoin has an expiration date and remains confident his company has solid legal footing in the recent lawsuit filed against it.\nSource: Cryptovest ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cryptovest", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T13:29:47.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ac3501e552ca62427bc23229568169cec6ca3f9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtfcycYqfsuDcDA5JHwSO1LOrPkXfYUD22xjvTFZm6zJQOoGg1NUiGMc7sS2n2v.eFGVt0JDGUIwIqeiZntL_OMk-", "site_full": "reviewcoin.me", "site": "reviewcoin.me", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Best New - AirPod ICO Achieves First Major Milestone - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "title_full": "Best New - AirPod ICO Achieves First Major Milestone - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "ME", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "https://reviewcoin.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/airpod-new-image.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ac3501e552ca62427bc23229568169cec6ca3f9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtfcycYqfsuDcDA5JHwSO1LOrPkXfYUD22xjvTFZm6zJQOoGg1NUiGMc7sS2n2v.eFGVt0JDGUIwIqeiZntL_OMk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Best New - AirPod ICO Achieves First Major Milestone - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "text": "/ Best New – AirPod ICO Achieves First Major Milestone Best New – AirPod ICO Achieves First Major Milestone Best New Cryptocurrency By root / June 6, 2018\nDuring the recently held CryptoKonf 2018 conference, AirPod – the innovative blockchain-based private capsule-style project, announced the commencement of the much-awaited APOD token sale.\nThe Conference which was held in Belgrade, Serbia on 29 and 30 May 2018, covered talks on Blockchain Technology, Fintech, Regulatory Compliance, Cryptocurrency, and ICOs. The event was streamed live by hundreds of cryptocurrency enthusiasts from around the world. AirPod was the Diamond Sponsor of the Conference.\nGrega Mrgole, AirPod CEO presented a pitch for the upcoming Pre-sale and ICO during the opening speech at the CryptoKonf 2018. AirPod’s Pre-Sale started right after AirPod’s presentation.\n“We appreciate to have such a supportive community. With your help, we are going to change the travel experience forever.” – Grega Mrgole, AirPod CEO.\nThe Progress so far?\nThe AirPod ICO completed the first milestone; achieving the target Soft Cap. Airpod reports that the sale of APOD tokens had surpassed the intended ICO Soft Cap! For investors, this achievement means that the AirPod project is all set to being further development and operations, presenting a unique opportunity for the token holders to earn over a long time.\nThe AirPod team thanks the cryptocurrency community for their support.\n“Thank you for your unconditional support. We’ve made it! …Love and gratitude to all our early supporters who believed in us from the very beginning!”\nNow that the ICO started on a high note, AirPod is now approaching the most crucial part of this journey; moving to the destination — the Hard Cap!\nSo, Should You Invest in The AirPod ICO?\nNot only will AirPod be a place to relax but also be one of the most profitable and stable businesses with which cryptocurrency investors can generate passive incomes. The contributors of the AirPod ICO will be part of a stable month-over-month passive income generator, whose ICO is entirely immune to bear market trends. How? The unique project’s ecosystem is shaping up to transform AirPod into one of the most lucrative and reliable business opportunities available today\nHere is a breakdown of how the AirPod ecosystem will work best for you.\nAPOD token holders get an incredible opportunity to earn a stable passive crypto-income. Within a year of the project’s launch, or following the installation of the 400th AirPod unit, a unique program designed to benefit the token holders will be unveiled. The sponsorship program will enable the token holders to leverage their holdings of APOD tokens for a right to a share of the profits generated from a particular AirPod Unit.\nUnder this program, every contributor to the AirPod ICO who holds APOD tokens will be able to join the program and become a sponsor of a particular AirPod unit. The sponsor will be able to earn up to 80% of the profits generated on a month-over-month basis for that specific unit.\nThe contributor to the ICO will have the value of their APOD tokens doubled merely by entering the smart contract backed Sponsorship Program. This way, the token holder will become a Sponsor of twice the value of their APOD tokens as if they were bought after the ICO period.\nSo, in this case, if the APOD token prices are set at $32k, the ICO contributor only has to pay $16k in the APOD tokens they acquired during the ICO.\nDecentralized Applications Will Enable Liquidity.\nThe sponsorship program provides a safer financial future through solid return on investment which will pay off in one-year maximum. So, after a year, the contributors can start collecting their net profits for an indefinite period. Moreover, the contributor can decide to re-contribute their profits to become a Sponsor of other AirPod units as well.\nWhen a contributor joins the sponsorship program, they get to choose the AirPod unit they wish to become a sponsor. The entire system will be based on a Blockchain Technology enabling complete transparency and an overview of the business. The sponsors will be able to see which AirPod unit is best located for profitable and choose to be part of its Sponsorship Program.\nThe AirPod sponsors will be able to trade their share of a particular AirPod unit they sponsor to other holders at any time.

I often look to our bellwethers, Bitcoin(BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD), as signals for the larger crypto market.\nI wanted to see $7085 hold in bitcoin and $495 in Ethereum. On May 28, bitcoin hit $7075, a nominal break and ethereum $505. So far, those levels have held, and we appear to have set up bullishly. As long as they do, we have a very bullish setup - the five-wave pattern off the April lows, which suggests this wave ii we believe bottomed that proceeds a larger third wave rally.\nBelow are six-hour charts that show the expected extent of the coming rally, if these levels hold.\nSee the charts provided in this article in an expandable format.\nNow, let's take a look at the 15-minute chart again for an update.\nUnfortunately, ethereum, while it started in a 5 wave move off the lows, it did not hold key support for an impulsive third wave. So, as of Monday morning I am tracking the pattern as a diagonal, with the expectation that we have another high over Sunday night’s high at $628.\nIf we break down below $538, the probability is we’ll see the May 28 low give way.\nBitcoin did not get as far as ethereum did before dropping Sunday night, so it may be called a 1-2,i-ii, where ii is the second wave in a minor third wave. It is immediately bullish as long as $7375 holds.\nNote the green line on the charts. This is a key level on both, where we retrace .618 of the drop from the May highs. If impulsive over those levels, $8720 in bitcoin and $685 in ethereum, we'll have the strongest confirmation we can have without a direct breakout.\nI currently consider sentiment to be very doubtful to apathetic. The apathetic holder feels shocked that they’ve seen such a drawdown but feels trapped and certainly doesn’t have the money to buy more. The doubtful holder believes bitcoin is in a large-scale correction and will remain in it for many months.\nOne trader I follow called for a 1.5-year correction. Some analysts I watch are calling for bitcoin to go below $5000. While I can see that price level possible, I cannot see it as probable at this time. Granted, if the key levels I’m watching and call out above, actually break, I will look down. And, those levels are quite tight to price here, so we have an early warning.\nIt seems, anecdotally, that we have sentiment conditions ripe for a larger rally to begin. But price must prove.\nConclusion\nIn short, so far price has held over the bottoms struck on May 28. We are now tracking nominally higher support levels in both ethereum and bitcoin to serve as an early warning of failure. As long as support levels hold, we see the next degree third wave as ready to start.\nSee the charts provided in this article in an expandable format.\nRyan Wilday is a cryptocurrency analyst at ElliottWaveTrader , where he hosts the Cryptocurrency Trading premium subscription service.\n© 2018 Copyright Ryan Wilday - All Rights Reserved Disclaimer: The above is a matter of opinion provided for general information purposes only and is not intended as investment advice.

Verschiedene Firmen beschäftigen sich mit dem Konzept der Einführung von BTC Trading Desks. Ein Unternehmen hat bereits vor einiger Zeit den Sprung gewagt. Die Susquehanna International Group hat einen Trading Desk aufgebaut, in dem man Kryptowährungen kaufen und verkaufen kann.\nBitcoin eine attraktive Währung\nMit Kryptowährungen kann man viel Geld verdienen aber auch verlieren. Die Volatilität dieser Branche macht sie für Spekulanten und Investoren attraktiv. Es war eine Frage der Zeit, bis die Wall Street beginnt, in den Krypto-Markt einzusteigen. Bislang befinden sich die meisten großen Wall-Street-Giganten (Goldman Sachs, NYSE) noch in der Entwicklung.\nDas ist bei der Susquehanna International Group nicht der Fall. Das Unternehmen ist bekannt für den Handel mit Aktien, ETFs und Optionen. In dieser Hinsicht unterscheidet es sich nicht allzu sehr von den meisten Wall-Street-Firmen, die heute auf dem Markt sind. Was sie einzigartig macht, ist bereits ihre Position im Krypto-Handel. Das Unternehmen kauft und verkauft seit zwei Jahren Bitcoin und andere Währungen in privaten Deals. Die Erweiterung dieser Funktionalität wird in Kürze erfolgen. Das Unternehmen gibt an, dass es in den nächsten Wochen für 500 seiner Kunden den Krypto-Handel zur Verfügung stellen wird.\nNicht nur das wohlhabende Investoren den Service nutzen und nun vollständig Zugang zum Markt erhalten, sondern auch der steigende Konkurrenzdruck der Wall-Street-Giganten wird durch diese Ankündigung erhöht. Es bleibt spannend, bis wann weitere ihren Service offiziell bekannt geben. Ein großer Schritt für Bitcoin\nVor zwei Jahren war das Thema Krypto relativ unbekannt und der BTC Kurs war ebenfalls verhältnismäßig gering, sodass es verwunderlich ist, dass ein Wall-Street-Riese derartig früh in den Bitcoin-Markt einsteigt und das Risiko in Kauf nimmt. Im Nachhinein war dies natürlich die richtige Entscheidung.\nNicht jeder ist dafür, dass sich die Wall-Street-Unternehmen in den Krypto-Markt einmischen, da man eine extremere Volatilität erwartet. Susquehannas Leiter der Digital Asset Group ist nicht allzu besorgt. Seiner Meinung nach ist Bitcoin bereit, Gold als knappes Gut in Frage zu stellen. Er räumt außerdem ein, dass Bitcoin eine breite Palette von Anwendungsmöglichkeiten hat, ging aber nicht weiter darauf ein.\nDies zeigt, dass Bitcoin und andere Kryptowährungen eine große Zukunft vor sich haben. Wenn sich die Unternehmen der Wall Street darauf vorbereiten, den Sprung in diese Branche zu wagen, ist es eine Frage der Zeit, bis die Mainstream-Traktion eintritt. Dennoch haben Kryptowährungen immer noch verhältnismäßig geringe Anwendungsfälle außerhalb der Spekulation. Zukünftige Skalierungslösungen wie von Bitcoin und Ethereum könnten diesen Wandel eventuell beschleunigen.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jahren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ein unternehmen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "einführung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zeit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kryptowährungen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "die susquehanna international group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-07T01:58:59.107+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "61de40d9024519d8d2f39523713339ca261d01ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mRlktelIWA5BP_k_YHtoeI1srG_CMYLqIiiYSdkTIxOYIy67tI1mnNU.Mu1FA_pjaS1kCtt0lb9GCEHt93OX3tWDy7gXdASEcB19OCs.GTa2A0DMcD0RUuhz89jdC38snAjR1yK8.jXtQ--", "site_full": "1bitcoindaily.com", "site": "1bitcoindaily.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "An Electronic Bitcoin OTC Platform Has Been Built For Institutional Investors – 1 Bitcoin daily", "title_full": "An Electronic Bitcoin OTC Platform Has Been Built For Institutional Investors – 1 Bitcoin daily", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "61de40d9024519d8d2f39523713339ca261d01ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mRlktelIWA5BP_k_YHtoeI1srG_CMYLqIiiYSdkTIxOYIy67tI1mnNU.Mu1FA_pjaS1kCtt0lb9GCEHt93OX3tWDy7gXdASEcB19OCs.GTa2A0DMcD0RUuhz89jdC38snAjR1yK8.jXtQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "View All Posts", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "An Electronic Bitcoin OTC Platform Has Been Built For Institutional Investors – 1 Bitcoin daily", "text": "1 Bitcoin daily An Electronic Bitcoin OTC Platform Has Been Built For Institutional Investors Jump Trading, a Chicago-based firm, has developed a digital bitcoin OTC trading platform, which it expects will revolutionize the bitcoin trading arena ...

You may wonder where to buy Bitcoins anonymously even with cash. Well, there are quite a few options available for that and the ones on top of the list are mentioned below. 1. Local Bitcoins When looking to find the best way to buy Bitcoins anonymously with cash, you should better buy it in person. With Local Bitcoins, you can easily find people near you who are ready to sell their Bitcoins in exchange for cash. Alias emails can be used for signing up at Local Bitcoins and it’s not necessary for you to verify your ID at this platform. Such Bitcoin deals don’t require any documentation whatsoever and allow you to remain truly anonymous. 2. Bitcoin ATMs Another best way to buy Bitcoins anonymously with cash is through a Bitcoin ATM near you. However, the issue is that Bitcoin ATMs are not available everywhere and you may not have one very close to you. But if you have access to one, go for it. Remember, however, that these ATMs require you to specify a Bitcoin address, but you have the option to say that you do not have one. And, when you choose that option, a paper address is generated for you most of the times. Afterwards, it’s possible for you to import private key of your paper wallet to send your Bitcoins anywhere you want. 3. Prepaid Card You may have even wondered how to buy Bitcoins anonymously with a credit card. Well, you have prepaid credit cards for that and they can be availed at any convenience store or supermarket out there. These cards can then be used for making Bitcoin purchases at different platforms like Virwox or Coinmama without having to provide your ID. Disguising transfers between several identities When looking for answers to how to buy Bitcoins anonymously online, you have the option of obfuscating transfers between several identities. There are several services available today that rely on Coinjoin concept for combining transactions of different users into a single transaction for disguising who owns the funds and how much of it. Let’s take a look at a couple of such service providers.

According to new research into their onboarding practices, most of the studied platforms do not meet the requirements of the upcoming regulations under the updated EU anti-money laundering directive.\nAlso read: Localbitcoins Updates ToS: ‘Some Situations May Require ID’ ‘Crypto Identity Crisis’\nThe research , titled “The Cryptocurrency Identity Crisis: An Industry Scorecard for Digital ID Verification for KYC and AML”, looked into the onboarding practices of leading cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers in Europe and the US. Its main goal was to determine whether these prominent platforms implement proper Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures regarding new users. The study was conducted by P.A.ID Strategies and commissioned by Mitek, a provider of digital identity verification solutions.\nThe results show that 68% of 25 examined crypto exchanges and custodian wallets allow users to trade crypto and fiat currencies without conducting formal identification. These companies do not meet many of the requirements mandated by the upcoming EU regulations. They are not performing identity verification checks against official identity documents and lists of politically exposed persons. There is no sanctions screening or audit trail to trace criminal activity.\nThe EU’s fifth anti-money laundering directive, AMLD5, is due to come into effect next year. It is expected to bring crypto-related services in line with the standards applied to other financial products such as those offered by banks. That includes mandatory identity checks on new customers like those conducted by traditional financial institutions.\nThe European Parliament adopted the European Commission’s proposal for a Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive on April 19 this year. The document aims to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing through the financial system of the European Union. It was proposed by the Commission in 2016, even before AMLD4 was implemented by all member-states. The updated directive introduces stricter requirements for customer due diligence procedures and identity verification. Exchanges and Wallets Ranked\nUnder the new rules, cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers will be obliged to apply for registration. The platforms in the study have been ranked according to how compliant their onboarding process is with the AMLD5 provisions.\nTopping the list are exchanges like Coinbase , Gemini , Poloniex , and Itbit . All these require users to present official ID documents to begin trading. They have received an “ID Verification Score” of 9 out of 10. Platforms like Kraken , Bitstamp , Wirex , Local Bitcoins , Bitpanda , and Bitwala are also included in the survey.\nA verified email address and a mobile phone number are often enough to sign up for the exchanges and wallets that do not have KYC procedures. The researchers note that both are easily obtainable without identification. Users can start trading with any email address and a number from a prepaid cell phone service.\n“Cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges want to enjoy the same trust as the wider traditional financial services,” said John Devlin, Principal Analyst at P.A.ID Strategies, quoted by Real Wire . “Meeting regulatory demands ahead of AMLD5 coming into force could go a long way to changing this sector’s reputation as being something of a ‘wild west’,” he added.\nMitek COO Kalle Marsal believes that crypto exchanges and wallet providers want to change the “perceptions of lawlessness,” which in his words is a relatively straightforward fix. “Identity verification processes can be, if implemented correctly, simple for the customer and no barrier to signing up,” he argued.\nDo you expect exchanges and wallets to comply with the stricter EU regulations?

In a flash, it squeezed itself into the Top 20 list of cryptos with highest market capitalization. Since then, TRON has recruited a mighty tech team and released a series of iterations. Albeit good news now and then, TRON is never short of controversaries and even rumors.\nYesterday, TRON launched its Mainnet. All rumors were dispelled, and TRON came again under the spotlights.\nFirst, I’ll talk about highlights of the launch, in case you don’t know yet.\nTRON Mainnet Launch began as scheduled at GMT+8 of May 31, 2018. Justin Sun, the founder of TRON, announced that TRON Mainnet was officially launched in a TRON T-shirt. Rephrasing the famous line of Neil Armstrong, the first human stepping on the moon, Sun proudly claimed that “Odyssey 2.0 launch is one small step for TRON, one giant leap for blockchain.”\nSun explained in English what TRON had done and would do as such: 1. TRON takes the crown for commits in Q2, totaling more than any other blockchain project in the world； 2. TRON has completed mainnet token migration and shed its identity as an ERC token； 3. With 1.08M tokenholders, TRON is now the #1 token on Ethereum, far ahead of any other cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin and EOS; 4. TRON attracts much more attention than other blockchains on Youtube, Twitter, Weibo, WeChat, Reddit and other online platforms, promising to be the hottest cryptocurrency globally; 5. With a consistent trade volume of between USD 500M – USD 1B, TRON has stabilized in the top 5 of most traded cryptos; 6. More than 100 trading pairs have been activated for international transactions; 7. As the TVM version is scheduled to be launched on July 31, TRON is expected to complete basic infrastructure for a decentralized ecosystem in Q3.\nIn the end of his speech, Sun urged all TRON users to participate in the June 26 Super Representative Election.\nAfter Sun, Lucien Chen (CTO), Marcus Zhao (director of blockchain R&D), Haoqi Zhao (director of technical operation) and Wendy Yi (product director) gave their speeches about TRON and its plans. TRON’s commitment to community is apparent in its various programs for developers that include TRON Accelerator, hackathons and programming competitions, totaling up to USD 2B in rewards.\nAs token conversion is the most widely concerned issue among users, TRON has given its official manifesto. As the mainnet is launched, TRX will gain independence, no longer an ERC20 token as it was. There are a number of exchanges where holders can transfer conveniently their TRX into the mainnet at the fixed ratio of 1:1. Users can transact as usual while conversion is being processed.\nAvailable exchanges include Bit-Z, Bittrex, Bitfinex, Bibox, gate.io, Binance, Coinrail, Coinnest, Bitpie, Bixin, RightBTC, DragonEx, Upbit, Bithumb, Liqui, BitKop, OKEX, CoinTiger, Huobi pro and OEX. Watch out for the continually updating list before June 25.\nWhen the migration is completed, all TRX holders are entitled to vote in an election that yields 27 super representatives, or SR, who are somewhat like senior managers in a company. SRs have the access to book-keeping, and their duties include daily maintenance, performance optimization and boosting the ecosystem. By the time that this piece was written, more than 60 individuals or organizations from all over the world had submitted SR applications, among whom were 20+ big names like Node Capital, LinkVC, GENESIS, Next Genius, Antpool, BTCC and Top.one.\nAs a Java-based DApp platform, TRON is developer-friendly and promises high network performance. Over 20 star-ups have joined for various DApps including cold setup wallets and blockchain explorers for PC, web and mobile devices.\nThe price of TRX rose by 6%, though only for a short time, during the half hour after the launch began on May 31 (GMT+8) while it had been fluctuating around USD 0.06 on the same day.\nAs a matter of fact, now that Odyssey 2.0 is technologically available, its full-fledged functioning involves reaching consensus, which in turn requires coordinating the efforts of more than its 1M+ users. From the 1st to the 24th of June, the community developers will be carrying out additional tests on the Mainnet and generating consensus before the first block, also known as the Genesis Block, happens at midnight, June 25 (GMT+8).\nAs the momentum goes, TRON will have surprises for the blockchain community every month ahead just like the amazing six months before now.\nContact Email Address https://tron.network/\nThis is a paid press release.

PermaBull Tom Lee Appears on CNBC Fast Money\nOn Monday, Tom Lee, long known as a cryptocurrency bull in the space, went on CNBC to dispel bearish sentiment against Bitcoin’s viability and more importantly, its price. ‘Fast Money’ host, Melissa Lee, pointed out that bears held three things against Bitcoin.\nFirstly, that the Google search trends for Bitcoin are down, dropping to almost 25% of the levels seen at the start of the year. Many Bitcoin bears believe that this indicator shows that direct investment interest in this cryptocurrency. Although this may be somewhat true, this indicator tells far from the whole story. As well, Tom was quick to point out that the Google Trends indicator was not fully indicative of the price and popularity of Bitcoin :\n“Google searches aren’t the leading indicator for Bitcoin, but instead, acts as a ‘coincident indicator,’ and therefore shouldn’t be looked to as some sort of BTC price predictor .”\nIn this case, this “coincident indicator” means that it moves in correlation with Bitcoin’s price, instead of preemptively signaling the price movement of the popular cryptocurrency. Lee also assured viewers that he believes that traditional institutions are still interested in investing in the space, despite the short-term bear market which the cryptocurrency market has experienced.\nAnother point which Bitcoin bears made was that trading volumes have plummeted since last year’s bull run. According to CoinMarketCap , trading volume is down by over 75% since the late December highs seen in the industry.\nTo help combat this supposed bearish indicator, Lee called the run-up last year a “parabolic blow off.” This essentially means that he thought that the volume seen during late last year was an abnormal figure, and should not be as relevant now. He also compared the daily figures to other volume figures from earlier in 2017;\n“Compared to a year ago, (over) the same time (the first 6 months of 2017), Bitcoin volumes are up nine hundred percent .”\nThis fact affirming that he believes that the volume present in the cryptocurrency trading space is still “healthy.” Tom Lee Affirms That Bitcoin Will Move In An Upward Direction\nFinally, Lee addressed the bearish sentiment that Bitcoin has been struggling to break over the mental and technical barriers in the $10,000 range. To help assist his bullish views on the market, he utilized some research done by his market analysis firm, FundStrat. The Bitcoin bull said specifically:\n“Bitcoin makes all of its performance in 10 days, in any year. So I don’t think that the fact that it is at the current levels is going to prevent it from actually rising before the end of the year.”\nAccording to his prior appearances on CNBC segments, Bitcoin’s price movements can be mainly attributed to 10 days throughout a whole year. If you took out those 10 days in any year, Bitcoin would be down an average of 25% in that year. With this data, he made it apparent that he believes that a Bitcoin price surge will occur within the time span of a few days.\nIf Bitcoin somehow manages to continue its downward trend, Tom Lee made it clear that he believes that Bitcoin will hold price levels at the cost of mining a single Bitcoin. According to research from his firm, the current cost of mining a Bitcoin sits at an average of $6,000 and if history is any indication, that means Bitcoin should hold at $6,000 if worst comes to worst.\nImage from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tom lee refutes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin bull tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "permabull tom lee appears", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melissa lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto news & info bitcoin bull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-06T11:39:55.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "67505f6ddda061c84f6456770d1dee48abe305a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jeB4pbNN3E7UhoG8IEO9KcClgwxTLqQvA6jk04uaoSDwrsfcwZguNnCvxd3D6q0tERIfziLvDTq9sS9.laIXHNpaEai_Nq5XkAIrVxcym9_9jVIs6_Ek_CK", "site_full": "cryptonewslab.com", "site": "cryptonewslab.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Russian Court Overturns Decision to Block Bitcoin Website - Crypto news lab", "title_full": "Russian Court Overturns Decision to Block Bitcoin Website - Crypto news lab", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://cryptonewslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/russia-court-768x768-3.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "67505f6ddda061c84f6456770d1dee48abe305a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jeB4pbNN3E7UhoG8IEO9KcClgwxTLqQvA6jk04uaoSDwrsfcwZguNnCvxd3D6q0tERIfziLvDTq9sS9.laIXHNpaEai_Nq5XkAIrVxcym9_9jVIs6_Ek_CK", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Russian Court Overturns Decision to Block Bitcoin Website - Crypto news lab", "text": "Russian Court Overturns Decision to Block Bitcoin Website Russian Court Overturns Decision to Block Bitcoin Website Blog Share\nA Russian court has overturned a previous court decision to block a bitcoin-related website because it contains information about cryptocurrencies. The Supreme Court ordered the city court to hear the appeal. Russian Court Overturned Previous Decision St. Petersburg City Court.\nThe St. Petersburg City Court has overturned the ruling of the Vyborgsky District Court of St. Petersburg to block the Bitcoininfo.ru website in Russia.\n“The St. Petersburg City Court quashed the decision of the district court to recognize the information posted on the Bitcoininfo.ru website,” Tass reported the city court explaining on Monday, June 4.\n“Vyborg District Court of St. Petersburg will again consider the case of the blocking of the site on cryptocurrencies, www.bitcoininfo.ru,” Rapsi learned from the city court, adding:\nThe city court canceled the decision to block the site and sent the case [back] to the Vyborgsky District Court for a new hearing. Problem With Spreading Crypto Information\nThis case began in July 2016 when the St. Petersburg Vyborgsky District Court made the ruling to block the Bitcoininfo.ru website in absence of the site owner. The court “considered the statement of the prosecutor’s office that the site contains information about cryptocurrencies” and decided to block the site, the publication detailed. According to the case file, Tass explained that the prosecutor’s office demanded the site be blocked based on its content about cryptocurrencies that “do not lend themselves to state control,”“promote the growth of the shadow economy,” and “do not have certain consumer properties.”\nThe representative of the website’s owner, Sarkis Darbinyan, told the publication that the prosecutor’s actions “takes place without the involvement of site owners,” adding that none of them received “requests for the removal of prohibited information, and the city court refuses to accept appeals after the actual blocking of websites.”\nHe further detailed:\nAccording to the statements of the prosecutor’s office of St. Petersburg, about 100 sites devoted to cryptocurrencies have been blocked.\nThe domain administrator appealed against the court’s decision, believing it to be illegal. However, the city court did not consider his appeal so he appealed to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, which subsequently ordered the city court to consider his complaint.\nIn March, the St. Petersburg City Court struck down a ban on 40 bitcoin-related websites offering information about cryptocurrencies and exchange services in Russia, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported .\nDo you think bitcoin websites will finally be unblocked in Russia?
