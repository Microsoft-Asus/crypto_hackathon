BCH/USD Price Levels\nAfter a series of dips in quick succession, bitcoin cash (BCH) has rebounded sharply over the past six days. The latest downtrend saw prices bottom near $884, which coincided with the broader market’s recent swing low near $303 billion.\nPrices have since recovered more than 31% to $1,161.29, which includes a 7% rally on Sunday. // -- Become a yearly Platinum Member and save 69 USD. Click here to change your current membership -- //\nBCH is capitalized at nearly $20 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Daily trade volumes have picked up to around $884 million, up from roughly $510 million this time last week.\nIn terms of trading volume, OKEx, Huobi and Bitfinex are largest markets for BCH trades.\nThe broader cryptocurrency market rose more than $20 billion over the weekend, with the likes of bitcoin, Ethereum and EOS putting up firm gains. At the time of writing, the total cryptocurrency market was worth $351 billion. Google Ad Ban\nBeginning this month, Google will ban all cryptocurrency-related advertising on its search engines as part of a wider crackdown on financial content it has deemed to be harmful. The ban was announced back in March with implementation timeline beginning in June.\n“We don’t have a crystal ball to know where the future is going to go with cryptocurrencies, but we’ve seen enough consumer harm or potential for consumer harm that it’s an area that we want to approach with extreme caution,” Scott Spenser, Google’s director of sustainable ads, told CNBC two-and-a-half months ago.\nGoogle isn’t the only tech company to clamp down on digital currency advertising; social media giants Facebook and Twitter have announced similar restrictions.\nHowever, as we wrote back in March, the bans are unlikely to impact prices because the vast majority of traffic to digital currency exchanges comes through credible link building and organic search. According to Similar Web , paid search represents less than 1% of total traffic to crypto exchanges, where trading takes place.\nA group of industry experts recently told The Independent, a U.K. publication, that the ban is problematic because Google continues to allow advertising for gambling websites and other unethical practices. One analyst speculated that the ban probably coincides with Google’s plan to introduce its own cryptocurrency in the future.\nDisclaimer: The author owns bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.

Now it’s fluctuating consistently between the $5.20’s and $5.30s.\nA peak for Huobi came in mid-May when Huobi Tokens were valued at $5.44, and today’s performance is the closest Huobi has come to re-ascending to its former heights. // -- Become a yearly Platinum Member and save 69 USD. Click here to change your current membership -- //\nUnsurprisingly, 100% of Huobi’s trading volume came from one exchange – its own. The majority of the volume came from HT/USDT trades with $92 million making up 75% of the daily total. Bitcoinn and Ether trades come a long way behind, making up just 17% and 8% respectively. ETF Trade Launch\nOn June 1 st Huobi launched their cryptocurrency based ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) which allows tokens on their exchange to be packaged up into shares, and traded against without actually having to own any of the individual tokens.\nInvestors get the chance to speculate on the success or lack thereof of an entire portfolio of cryptocurrencies, without having to go through the entire cryptocurrency roadmap themselves.\nThis is a similar idea to the Digital Asset Arrays of the ICONOMI platform, where portfolios of tokens are packaged up traded on as one entire asset. China-South Korea Blockchain Fund\nIt was a day of good will all round as Huobi also announced on June 1 st their imminent launch of a $93 million investment fund for blockchain and crypto start-ups.\nThe deal involves Chinese investment firm NewMargin Capital, and South Korean firm Kiwoom Securities Co Ltd, and is seen as a way to foster collaborative business growth between the two nations.\nThe news comes only days after the Binance exchange announced a similar plan involving a $1 billion startup fund. Brazil and Beyond\nOnly a few days ago news broke that Huobi officials were seen setting up an office space in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and have sent out advertisements for staff in the area.\nAt this time Huobi officials have confirmed their intention to move into the Brazillian market, but have issued no further statement detailing the specifics of the venture. Canada\nWhile Huobi have recently registered their business with U.S regulators, they’ve already been making inroads into Canada for a while now.\nIndeed, the general manager of Huobi’s operations in Canada, Ross Zhang has gone as far to say:\n“Establishing Huobi’s first Canadian offices in Toronto is a continued effort to help the blockchain industry become more credible so that mass adoption can come sooner.”\nFeatured image courtesy of Shutterstock.

Money for Nothing, Clicks for Free – How Steemit’s Currencies Work\nPublished // -- Discuss and ask questions in our community on Workplace .\nFirst of all, every post made on Steemit is irretrievably stored on the blockchain forever, just like with a cryptocurrency transaction. Second, every user of the site has their own wallet, and earns money for interacting on the blockchain, similar to how miners are normally rewarded for their time and resources.\nUnlike most cryptocurrencies, however, Steemit doesn’t require an initial investment. Instead it uses an intricate and somewhat complicated system of three different internal currencies, each of which support each other and produce collective pools of funds which can be used to reward users. How It Works\nAuthorship – Every post you make can be voted on, and is eligible to earn financial rewards in the form of Steemit’s internal currencies. Comments you make can also earn money if they get upvoted. // -- Become a yearly Platinum Member and save 69 USD. Click here to change your current membership -- //\nCuration – For every post you upvote you will receive a percentage of that post’s value at the end of the week. Posts are divided up between the author and their curators at 75% and 25% respectively.\nIf a post has many curators, then obviously your chunk of that 25% will be smaller. However the opposite is also true and many people make money each week just by targeting promising posts without too many curators already attached.\nPayouts from each post, comment or upvote you make are made on a weekly basis. After one week, your post stops being eligible for payouts, so if your post doesn’t grab attention in the first seven days, then your opportunity for earning disappears.\nThis is because of the large amounts of data that would have to pass through, and eventually clog up the blockchain if every single post on the network was constantly being updated and transacted upon for the entire time it remained on the site. Where Does the Money Come From?\nWhen a new user signs up to Steemit, they can immediately start giving money to other users by upvoting their posts. This happens without the user ‘buying in’, or making an investment of any kind.\nQuite simply, the block rewards from the Steemit blockchain are distributed among the network of users, with a small portion going to specific witnesses who oversee the running of the blockchain.\nA new user will find initially that their votes aren’t worth all that much. This is because the reward fund is distributed among users according to their influence and popularity.\nIn this sense, Steemit is like a game where instead of searching for some rare, magical artefact, you are instead competing for the attention of the community in the hope of earning a larger share of the Steemit currency (more on that later).\nYou do this by posting high-quality content, no different from on Reddit, YouTube or any other social media/networking site. But on Steemit, your ‘likes’ or upvotes are converted into cold hard cash.\nWhile many popular creators in the Steemit community regularly rake in hundreds of dollars for every post, they have generally been on the site for a long time, and have been able to slowly build up an audience of followers.\nSo don’t expect to just wander onto Steemit and start making money for your blog posts. If your posts happen to be good then you might stand a chance, but generally Steemit is something that has to be viewed with long-term productivity in mind. STEEM Coins\nSTEEM coins represent the foundational currency of the blockchain and are used to represent the market value of the Steemit project. A purchase of STEEM would be an investment in the platform itself, just like with any other cryptocurrency.\nSTEEM currently hovers around the top 30 in market capitalization rankings, and coins are valued at $2.56 at the time of writing. STEEM can be traded on multiple exchanges, or converted into either of the other two internal currencies on Steemit.\nThe highest volume of STEEM trades take place on Binance , Huobi and Upbit . The trading value of STEEM is important, as it has a knock-on effect on Steemit’s other two currencies.\nSTEEM can be held without participating in the Steemit social media platform, and traded like any other cryptocurrency. Or, it can be converted into ‘influence’ on the network in the form of Steem Power. Steem Power\nSteem Power, or SP, is an internal currency on Steemit which cannot be traded on external exchanges.\nSP acts as the internal measure of influence on the platform – so a user with more SP would not only give out more money when they upvote someone’s post, but they’d also receive a higher payout in return for posts they’ve curated.\nUsers can either earn SP directly through their actions of the platform, or they can convert their STEEM coins into SP to make their clicks worth more in terms of upvotes.\nSteemit gives new users a delegated amount of Steem Power to get them started, thus requiring no initial buy-in. Steem Dollars\nSometimes referred to as SBD, or SMD, Steem Dollars allow the Steemit currency to be traded in high volumes without affecting the market value of STEEM too much.\nSteem Dollars are pegged to roughly $1 worth of STEEM. This means that even if STEEM’s market value declines somewhat, SBD will still be able to be cashed out for the value of a dollar a piece.\nSBD tokens provide stability to the currency system as a whole, and mean that STEEM coins can be traded normally regardless of the activity of the social media users on Steemit. At the same time they provide a ‘soft floor’ for participants with their pegged value of $1 against STEEM. Conclusion\nThe entire economic ecosystem is set up to isolate each of the three currencies from each other’s fluctuation.\nWhile successful to some degree, the entire network can still be affected by the trading activity of STEEM coins.\nWhen STEEM does well, the values of Steem Power and Steem Dollars rise along with it. Likewise, when STEEM struggles, users will find that their posts are suddenly worth a lot less.\nIn this sense, Steemit is a project which relies heavily on its community of users. A thriving community represents a strong use case for investors, and will naturally push STEEM’s market value higher and higher.\nAt the same time, artists and creators on Steemit are subject to the fluctuations of the overall market value, and will feel both its benefits and its downsides.\nFeatured image courtesy of Shutterstock.

However, estimating exactly how much electricity the bitcoin network uses, necessary for understanding its impact and implementing policy, remains a challenge.\n“We’ve seen a lot of back-of-the-envelope calculations, but we need more scientific discussion on where this network is headed. Right now, the information available is pretty poor quality overall, so I’m hoping that people will use this paper as a foundation for more research,” said economist and blockchain specialist Alex de Vries, who works at PwC in the Netherlands.\nThe estimates, based in economics, put the minimum current usage of the bitcoin network at 2.55 gigawatts, which means it uses almost as much electricity as Ireland. A single transaction uses as much electricity as an average household in the Netherlands uses in a month. By the end of this year, he predicts the network could be using as much as 7.7 gigawatts—as much as Austria and 0.5% of the world’s total consumption.\n“To me, half a per cent is already quite shocking. It’s an extreme difference compared to the regular financial system, and this increasing electricity demand is definitely not going to help us reach our climate goals,” he said. If the price of bitcoin continues to increase the way some experts have predicted, De Vries believes the network could someday consume 5% of the world’s electricity.\nBitcoin is dependent on computers that time-stamp transactions into an ongoing chain to prevent duplicate spending of coins. Computers in the network perform calculations continuously, competing for the chance, once every ten minutes, to be appointed to create the next block of transactions in the chain. The user of the computer that wins is awarded 12.5 new coins—a process known as “mining” bitcoin.\nHowever, all the time, even the users that don’t win are expending computing power. “You are generating numbers the whole time and the machines you’re using for that use electricity. But if you want to get a bigger slice of the pie, you need to increase your computing power. So there’s a big incentive for people to increase how much they’re spending on electricity and on machines,” de Vries said.\nIt is figuring out when that incentive stops paying off that is at the heart of de Vries’s estimation method. Economic principles suggest that the entire bitcoin network will eventually reach an equilibrium where the costs of the hardware and electricity used to mine equal the value of the bitcoin being mined. That information can approximate the total amount of electricity that the network will use at said equilibrium.\nGetting a good estimate is important in determining the sustainability of cryptocurrencies moving forward and in helping shape policy around them, de Vries said.

Unlike many of the new startups creating their own blockchains, Hodl Hodl is doing these complex transactions on the bitcoin blockchain, countering the narrative that bitcoin is only good as a store of value.\nThe exchange platform debuted in March, and within weeks it garnered more than 5,300 registered users in over 30 countries, all transacting directly through either the bitcoin or litecoin blockchains by using what’s known as a multi-signature smart contract.\nHodl Hodl never touches bitcoin deposits or traditional fiat payments. Rather, it simply provides listings for people to connect, plus an interface to help users apply smart contracts directly to bitcoin.\nThose contracts rely on multisig wallets, where one key belongs to the exchange and the other to the seller. The seller’s keys are generated on the front end, in the browser, never stored on the company’s server or database.\nBecause of that setup, Hodl Hodl CTO Roman Snitko said:\n“Even if the exchange is hacked, the hacker only gets access to one key, whereas the other belongs to the user and the funds cannot be moved.”\nThis paved the way for a disparate real estate platform by the same team, called Househodl, which is set to launch in July with similar multisig contracts in lieu of the banks and lawyers who typically hold funds in escrow.\n“It’s better than dealing with banks and being unreasonably scrutinized time and again for every penny, even though your money is clean,” Snitko told CoinDesk.\nThis underscores the reasons why Snitko and CEO Max Keidun chose to work directly with the bitcoin blockchain rather than build a platform in parallel. They wanted a simple solution that didn’t require the startup to take on all the compliance responsibilities of a bank, the way some might argue exchanges like Coinbase have.\nHodl Hodl’s private key is useless by itself – a relief to traders spooked by the long history of multimillion-dollar thefts of user funds held at traditional crypto exchanges. Their verification process varies by jurisdiction, staying as hands-off as they can be within local regulations, to give users more responsibility and freedom. Unlike Coinbase, Hodl Hodl gives users their own private key.\n“No single party controls the funds on that address,” Snitko said. “That, in turn, means increased security, but also that we’re not exactly a money transmitter from a regulatory point of view.”\nBy coupling compliance with decentralized security features, the Hodl Hodl team strives to show that bitcoin itself can also be leveraged for peer-to-peer business transactions. The team’s upcoming platform, Househodl, will take that idea even further by applying it directly to real estate purchases.\n“Because it’s safer,” Snitko said about why they chose bitcoin. “I do think it is the only secure, decentralized blockchain that stood the test of time.” Bitcoin’s security perks\nFirst and foremost, Hodl Hodl’s interest in bitcoin derives from its security.\nAccording to the founders, it’s much harder for intermediaries to misappropriate money frozen in this transparent, multi-sig escrow process, because no one has complete custody and all the parties involved can look at the blockchain to see what’s going on.\nAs such, multisig on a public ledger represents an upgrade to the centuries-old practice of depositing funds with a third party until a future condition is met.\nApplying this exchange’s smart contract to real estate first occurred to the Hodl Hodl team when a friend tried to sell her apartment to buy more bitcoin. The transaction took months because there were numerous bureaucratic intermediaries, from bankers to real estate agents.\nSnitko said:\n“It’s a whole mess that could be avoided if there was a platform for selling and buying real estate with bitcoin. That’s when we realized there is a demand on both sides of the equation.”\nThe team realized the a multisig process in Hodl Hodl’s flagship business could also offer a more transparent escrow system for buying property with bitcoin. Such transparency is lacking in traditional escrow processes, a situation often exploited by the intermediaries buyers trust the most.\nFor example, according to the New York Law Journal, the Lawyers’ Fund for Client Protection paid $10 million in 2017 to victims of lawyer misconduct that included the theft of escrow funds. In March of this year, another New York attorney was disbarred for hiding client funds in his personal escrow account, veiled behind the trappings of bank paperwork.\nEven if such conduct is rare today, the fact that it can happen suggest that there’s room for improvements that reduce reliance on trusted third parties. “I think real estate is the best use case for bitcoin payments right now,” Snitko added, “Because it’s relatively huge amounts of BTC that are being transferred so even if transaction fees go up, they would still make sense.” On-chain advantages\nUnlike the flagship exchange’s pure P2P model, Househodl contracts will require a third cryptographic key held by a neutral third party, such as a lawyer, plus more paperwork and identification than online currency swaps on Hodl Hodl.\nFunds only move if everyone cooperates, which would prevent the type of lawyer misconduct seen in New York. Yet, all of this still happens directly on the bitcoin blockchain, thanks to the exchange-tested workflow.\n“You will even be able to sign all the papers remotely on our [Househodl] platform, a one-stop-shop,” Keidun told CoinDesk.\nSeveral American real estate agents have already expressed interest in signing up for Househodl, Keidun said. But, due to the unclear regulatory landscape in the U.S., Househodl will probably launch in blockchain-friendly Dubai first, then steadily expand to Europe and North America.\nIn the meantime, new confidential trading options might give Keidun’s small startups a competitive advantage over other P2P platforms, both exchanges and blockchain startups in the real estate industry.\nMany P2P platforms broadcast all live offers to all participants, the same way CraigsList organizes listings by category. So Hodl Hodl allows private offers, which are only visible if the seller sends a direct link to the buyer, or vice versa. This is one advantage Hodl Hodl has over its competitors. And the users don’t even need to sacrifice transparency for privacy, since the transactions are still on-chain, it’s just that they aren’t broadcasting the details a stranger would need to find them.\nIn addition, neither Hodl platform requires the user to cash out, the way incumbent P2P exchange Local Bitcoins does. Yet again, that points back to the fact that the escrow takes place on the blockchain itself.\n“That’s one difference we have from LocalBitcoins, where your funds are essentially held on LocalBitcoins,” Snitko told CoinDesk.\nCome summertime, Househodl will also offer such private listings for buying or selling real estate directly with cryptocurrency.\n“The idea is that you don’t need to cash out into a fiat currency to buy property,” Snitko said, touching on the broader issue of balancing compliance with the bitcoin community’s cypherpunk ethos by adding:\n“The most important challenge, I think, is to guarantee that the purchase is 100 percent legal and there are no legal loopholes to exploit.” Click to add a comment Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published.

This was evident in stories from all over the globe that were covered in this week’s daily editions of Bitcoin in Brief.\nAlso Read: Devere Group Adds Bitcoin Cash and EOS to Crypto Exchange App Poloniex Responds to Complaints\nOn Monday we reported that Poloniex, the US-based cryptocurrency trading platform which was taken over by Circle earlier this year, has finally responded to complaints by its clients about frozen accounts. The company tried to reassure clients their funds were safe and that it has taken steps to increase the speed of the identity verification process. Additionally covered was the fact that the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has revealed it is investigating two dozen unauthorized cryptocurrency-related ventures and has also opened seven whistle-blower reports in 2018 alone. McAfee Warns of War on Crypto John McAfee (Photo by Gage Skidmore)\nThe big news on Tuesday was that cybersecurity expert turned pump and dump guru John McAfee has issued another bullish prediction. Bitcoin (BTC) will surpass $15,000 in June, but will dip in July, McAfee predicted. His prediction was in contrast with Russian analysts who expect that value of BTC will continue to drop, even below the psychological $6,000 USD threshold.\nMcAfee also also talked about “the war we are all engaged in”, Claiming that the banks, the government and the US Securities and Exchange Commission have declared war on crypto. He advised crypto enthusiasts to take action – write their congressmen and press banks and credit card companies with demands for crypto transactions. McAfee called on his followers to also write the SEC and ask “to leave us alone, because we are not a security […] we are a currency.” China Fights Impersonators and Fraudsters\nA couple of stories that show cryptocurrency is still a hot topic in China were our focus on Wednesday . First, Chinese social media has erupted in anger this week after the use of a Mao Zedong impersonator at the Boao Blockchain Forum for Asia in Hainan province. Second, a Chinese procurator’s office has reportedly prosecuted 98 people and recovered 1.7 billion yuan (about $270 million) in an alleged Onecoin pyramid scheme. Additionally covered were high market awareness in Germany, a London mosque that accepts bitcoin donations, a new green mining farm in Canada and an MMA champ’s love for crypto. Asus Creates 20-GPU Mining Motherboard Asus H370 Mining Master\nOn Thursday we reported that Taiwanese computer hardware manufacturer Asus has created a new motherboard with support for up to 20 graphics cards, designed specifically for crypto miners. The company explains that: “Mining is a numbers game; it’s only worthwhile if the value of the cryptocurrency you generate exceeds the cost of producing it. Increasing the number of graphics cards per node is a great way to stack the deck in your favor. ” We also reported about a Singaporean businessman acquiring a Japanese exchange; some ripple-loving alleged Russian hackers shaking down Canadian banks; and a Colombian soccer star launching his own coin. Expanding Horizons in Uganda, Bahrain and Georgia\nCountries not often mentioned in the news made headlines on Friday . First, Binance could be opening a new office in Uganda, CEO Changpeng Zhao revealed at The Africa Blockchain Conference. “I was very impressed by the enthusiasm of Africans to introduce cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. It was surprising to see that cryptocurrencies enjoy not only an increased interest from the people, but also the active support of many representatives of African banks and government officials,” CZ stated. Second, Bahrain has recently enjoyed a spike in online trade using cryptocurrency due to an absence of limiting regulations and a shop selling crypto-priced items is set to open soon in Riffa. Lastly, we reported that a luxurious apartment has been put on sale for 25 bitcoins in Georgia. Blockchain on the Agenda in Spain, Slovenia, Estonia and Hungary\nGovernments all across Europe were our focus on Saturday . Lawmakers in Spain have issued a unanimous call for adopting regulations that favor the implementation of crypto and blockchain technologies. The government of Slovenia has adopted an action plan to underpin the implementation of blockchain technology in the country and create a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. In Estonia, officials have scaled down plans to issue a national cryptocurrency, which were criticized by both the European Central Bank and local banking authorities. And in Hungary, “The newly established Ministry for Innovation and Technology, along with the enhanced national digital wellbeing strategy, can help local blockchain players embrace innovative solutions and improve their fundraising potential,” said Péter Benedek, the CEO of Blockchain Competence Center (BCC).

That’s no secret. Many a would-be miner has been stopped in their tracks by the prospect of a utility bill superseding their profits. But simply mining in locations with cheaper power, such as parts of Canada, Eastern Europe, or China, isn’t the solution either, since cryptocurrency mining still drains the earth’s resources, whether it’s expensive or not.\nSustainable mining, then, isn’t only about finding countries giving their electricity away for next to nothing, or that are cold enough to absorb the heat generated by Bitcoin mining systems. It’s not only about using renewable energy sources, either, according to Blue Chip Vision ’s Director of Research and Innovation, Christine Satchell, Ph.D. Environmental Sustainability\nThis is logically the first area that comes to mind when you think about sustainable mining. After all, what’s to stop people from mining away if all the power sources are renewable and don’t have negative effects on the earth? Take Canada, for example. The Coinsquare exchange has several thousand miners in the Quebec area, using hydro energy.\nCEO Cole Diamond says, “Quebec is incredibly attractive because of the cheap renewable energy. Canada in general, we’re an enormous country with not a lot of people and extra power.”\nThis is making Canada one of the leading players in the sustainable mining space. While other countries, like Georgia, are making huge moves toward blockchain tech and mining, they can’t offer the same political stability as Canada. Taking Mining Off the Grid\nWhile Canada may have some inexpensive renewable energy going unused, according to Satchell, “renewable energy sources are often expensive and bulky,” and this problem needs to be addressed.\nBlue Chip Vision is working on technologies that extend the concept of blockchain beyond the digital realm and take mining off the grid. According to Managing Director Robert Masters, “This more holistic approach considers the hardware and infrastructure, as well as the power needed to run it as integral parts of cryptocurrency’s sustainable future.”\nHe says that the company “ensures mining sustainability and off-grid operations, minus the resource consumption and energy costs associated with common data center operations.”\nIn fact, off-the-grid mining can reduce resource consumption and associated power costs by up to 90 percent. The Power Balance of Bitcoin Miners\n“The huge cost of powering Bitcoin mining systems also means that individuals are pushed out of the Bitcoin mining process, which is against Bitcoin’s decentralized nature,” Satchell points out. This effectively centralizes a decentralized ecosystem.\n“When an abundance of miners from global locations contribute time and code to a protocol, a lack of consensus on the future direction or use of the network can occur. A Bitcoin fork is an example. This not only has the ability to reduce or enhance the network’s value, it can erode the perceived integrity of the network and calls into question its long-term viability and brand value. It also places an immense amount of power in the hands of few.”\nEnsuring that mining doesn’t end up in the hands of a select few who can access or afford the necessary power, Blue Chip argues, is equally as important as ensuring that Bitcoin mining doesn’t have negative effects on the environment.\nSo, beyond solar panels, wind farms, and hydro, in order to mine sustainably moving forward, we must be sure to stay within Bitcoin’s founding ethos of being open to all.

Our script automatically switches mining to the most profitable coin at the moment, given the mining difficulty and stock exchange rates. After that we convert all funds into Bitcoin, thats why your balance is displayed in BTC. It’s the world’s dominant cryptocurrency now, therefore we convert all funds exactly in Bitcoin.

An early dip to an intraday low $990.3 was the only bearish move of the day, with Bitcoin Cash’s struggles of breaking out from $1,000 coming to an end through the morning. A late afternoon rally saw Bitcoin Cash rally to an intraday high $1,102.9, breaking through the day’s major resistance levels to test selling pressure at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $1,100 for the first time since 22 nd May, before easing back to sub-$1,100 levels by the day’s end. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash was down 0.29% to $1,081, with an early attempted break through the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $1,100 leading to a pullback to a morning low $1,072.2 before a partial recovery. For the day ahead, breaking through the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level will be key to continue supporting the bearish trend reversal, with Bitcoin Cash’s pullback from $1,100 late on Saturday continuing to leave the extended bearish trend intact, with a slide back to $800 levels still possible near-term. Failure to move through $1,100 to test the day’s first major resistance level at $1,128.5 will likely weigh on Bitcoin Cash, to bring sub-$1,000 levels into play later in the day, investors likely to hold off for another dip. Holding on to $1,000 levels in the early part of the day should continue to support a positive day ahead. BCH/USD 03/06/18 4-Hourly Chart Get Into Bitcoin Cash Trading Today Litecoin Looking to Slide Litecoin gained 3.14% on Saturday, following Friday’s 1.34% rise, to end the day at $123.65, its highest close since 23 rd May’s $128.38. Recovering from a start of the day intraday low $118.52, Litecoin rallied through the day’s first major resistance level at $121.52 in the late morning, before an afternoon rally saw Litecoin move through to $123 levels to test the day’s second major resistance level at $123.08 and hold, whilst falling short of the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level at $127, to leave the extended bearish trend intact. At the time of writing, Litecoin was down 0.74% to $122.74, with Litecoin pulling back from an early $123.97 high to an intraday low $122.56, Saturday’s gains under threat in the early part of the day as investors look to lock in profits ahead of the next move. For the day ahead, a move through to $123.5 would support another run at $124 levels, with a break through to $124.4 bringing the day’s first major resistance level at $125.9 into play, while the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $127 will likely remain out of reach through the day. Failure to break through to $124 levels through the day will likely see Litecoin pullback to $121 levels, with any deterioration in sentiment across the cryptomarket likely to see the day’s first major support level at $119.96 tested before any recovery.

Blockchain forensics companies have the full weight of law enforcement behind them and the deep pockets of government funding their bitcoin deanonymizing efforts. Tumbler services, in comparison, have little more than some open source code and a desire to reclaim the privacy that’s been gradually eroded from the web over the years, with crypto users among the worst affected.\nBestmixer.io launched in March of this year, and has just issued a major update to its privacy features. Users of BTC, BCH, ETH, and LTC can feed their coins through the service, with the ones that emerge on the other side promised to be untainted and unlinkable. Platforms such as Chipmixer offer a similar service, which can be accessed from the clearnet or deep web, providing a means of obfuscating activity on darknet markets and anywhere else where privacy is desired. Beating Chainalysis at Their Own Game\nIn a post on the Bitcointalk forum , the Bestmixer team announced the introduction of a new module containing reserves for mixing, writing:\nNot so long ago a New York blockchain startup ‘Chainalysis’ announced the launch of a real-time transaction analysis tool. A new tool called ‘Chainalysis KYT’ (Know Your Transaction) allows real-time transaction analysis. In particular, the new functionality allows cryptocurrency companies to find out instantly how reliable their counterparty is, and whether it operates with funds that were previously used in illegal financial transactions. In connection with this news, we decided to divide our reserves into three pools, each of which will fulfill its goals.\nThe Alpha, Beta, and Gamma pools offer different degrees of privacy, with the latter two commanding an increased fee commensurate with the cost of maintaining them. Explaining the importance of privacy for all cryptocurrency users, the Bestmixer team said: “Everyone who has ever participated in a transaction with you has an opportunity to find out the addresses of your wallets, their balances, and can determine the origin of your coins and the destination address. Apart from disclosing the details of your private life, it also makes you an easy target for cybercriminals.”\nChainalysis have become unavoidable in the world of cryptocurrency , particularly when it comes to KYC and KYT. Many ideologues regard them as “enemies of bitcoin ” due to their efforts to deliver cryptocurrency users into the hands of the state that bitcoin was arguably designed to counter. In addition to being used in criminal investigations, Chainalysis is deployed to detect pooling with ICO private sales, something that most ICOs are publicly against but which is rampant. Services such Bestmixer and Chipmixer play a small but vital role in protecting the privacy of those who cherish it the most.\nDo you think bitcoin tumblers can be trusted to thwart forensic services like Chainalysis?

Crypto On the Go: Prague Subway Gets 10 New Bitcoin ATMs\nLocated in Prague, ATM manufacturer General Bytes has installed 10 new cryptocurrency ATMs throughout the Prague subway. Over 1.2 million people pass through the Prague subway on a daily basis, making it one of the busiest metros in Europe. With this latest move, commuters using the busy Prague Metro can buy and sell virtual currencies on the go. Scotland Hospital Opens Rehab Center for Crypto-Trading Addicts\nCastle Craig Hospital — Scotland’s largest addiction treatment facility — has developed a center specifically dedicated to helping cryptocurrency addicts. Representatives explain that “cryptocurrency users can get hooked by the volatile fluctuation of prices online which creates a ‘high’ when they buy or trade a winning currency” and that “this can be exciting but also addictive and … financially disastrous.” The hospital has produced a list of 10 questions that individuals can ask themselves. If they answer “yes” to 5 or more, they likely fall into the “addict” category. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Consolidation Leans Toward a Strong Bitcoin Move\nAfter days of sudden, strong selling, bitcoin has managed to find a local bottom in the low $7000s where it has been drifting around aimlessly. Traders have noted that we have formed a large consolidation pattern called a symmetrical triangle. Symmetrical triangles are consolidation patterns that are typically agnostic regarding their breakout direction. However, one important thing to note about this consolidation pattern is it embodies some of the hallmarks of a reaccumulation trading range (TR) — most notable is the volume profile.\nThere is strong evidence of supply absorption in the market which would likely lead to an upward breakout. However, it is important to note that symmetrical triangles are directionally agnostic and can oftentimes break to the downside. Op Ed: How Atomic Swaps Could Work for Stock Market Trading\nIn traditional stock exchanges, retail investors in public markets are unable to switch from one position to another without first going into cash. For example, an investor looking to trade his or her Amazon shares for PayPal shares must first exchange these Amazon shares for U.S. dollars, before buying PayPal shares with these dollars.\nAtomic swaps allow direct conversion between two cryptocurrencies without having to use a third-party intermediary or exchange. By employing hash time-locked smart contracts, atomic swaps guarantee that parties will deliver the currency needed for the trade, or else the transaction is automatically canceled. These “all or nothing” trades preserve atomicity because they either take place or are canceled immediately. Advancing Toward a Decentralized Internet in the Real World\nThe recently aired Season 5 of the popular HBO comedy Silicon Valley features a decentralized internet powered by end-user devices and an internal blockchain-based crypto economy. As usual, the fictional treatment in the show, which has been rightly praised for providing an entertaining but accurate portrait of contemporary tech trends, is based on real developments.

Four of the notes feature pictures of McAfee in various stages of undress, including one in which he is surrounded by women, his nose covered in white powder (it’s a screenshot from this video ). The other three MRU notes feature pictures of Bitmain founder Jihan Wu, cryptocurrency entrepreneur Brock Pierce, and Bitcoin.com owner (and Bitcoin Cash promoter) Roger Ver. It’s not clear if these three figures gave their consent to have their likenesses featured on MRU notes. No hoax. The \"McAfee Redemption Unit\" is real and coming in 26 days. The graphic is low res – don't want to give much away yet. Printed on currency paper, holographs on both sides, serialized, linked to the blockchain, redeemable, convertible, collectible https://t.co/ySUwkDuW7s pic.twitter.com/75xTje39X8\n— John McAfee (@officialmcafee) May 29, 2018\nHe said that the currency will also have a blockchain component (because why not?) that will allow MRU holders to convert the notes back into fiat (for a fee) by returning them to the MRU Foundation.\nEach MRU has an initial face value of $9.95 and can be redeemed for a one-minute in-person meeting with McAfee (yes, they’re stackable). McAfee said that 341,000 MRU notes of different denominations have been printed, with a total circulation of 6,050,000 MRU and an implied market cap of $60.2 million.\nAssuming the 72-year-old McAfee set aside 10 hours per day to meet with MRU holders (including weekends and holidays), it would take him nearly 28 years to fulfill these obligations. Given his age and lifestyle , that timeline is perhaps a tad optimistic. In the event of his untimely death, MRU holders will not receive any compensation.\nThere’s a case to be made that the redemption process is perhaps even more convoluted than attempting to withdraw USD from Tether . According to a message printed on the notes, they can only be redeemed in person in Mexico during a two-hour window each day, at which time the owner will be given a particular date, time, and location in the United States in which he or she will be able to meet with McAfee. Individuals, incidentally, may only redeem 100 MRUs at a time.\nWhy is the process so difficult? In McAfee’s words:\n“Redemption is purposely made very expensive. My followers are hugely loyal and I feel certain that many will go through time and huge expense for the opportunity to spend private time with me. See what this might do to the fundamental value of each redemption unit. If the value of a unit is based even remotely on the cost of redemption, which people are willing to pay, then the notes will immediately skyrocket. But the big key is in the way I have structured the auction sites. Cannot tell you more now.”\nOne Twitter user understandably asked McAfee whether it was wise to print a new currency “when the goal is to get rid of the existing one,” to which he replied “Patience. You will see. You’re just glimpsing a shadow of a shadow of what I’m doing.”\nFeatured image from Flickr/ NullSession Follow us on Telegram .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john mcafee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fintech conference & expo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fintech", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T20:30:36.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eb547e72b5e3c844a7f5318aa7c2154c5682f324", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSzEaGTID0asLY1XyytPCu8E-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "title_full": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb547e72b5e3c844a7f5318aa7c2154c5682f324", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSzEaGTID0asLY1XyytPCu8E-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Get Free Bitcoins for Lifetime", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nBecome the person, who referred the largest number of new users till the end of June 1, 2019 and we will give you 0.3 BTC.

But rather than coding their own solutions, grin's contributors are all about adopting technology that's been reviewed and approved by a circle of experts.\nAs the team wades into their second test stage, preparing to launch a working payment system, they've been among the first to implement Schnorr , Bulletproofs and Dandelion , all promising technologies originally intended to improve bitcoin's scale and privacy, but that just haven't made it into the hard-to-change cryptocurrency just yet.\nLead grin developer Igno Peverell, named after an obscure Harry Potter character, told CoinDesk:\n\"Testnet 2 was and is likely to stay our largest release in terms of new technology.\"\nIt's also ambitious. In turning MimbleWimble into a real, working software for payments, the developer team behind grin has added features that have been years in the making.\n\"Signature aggregation,\" for instance, has been in the works for bitcoin since 2014 and is one of its most highly anticipated code changes. Pioneered by Bitcoin Core contributor Pieter Wuille , the project \"MuSig\" has the potential to lump signature data together and free up space in the blockchain.\nA working prototype has already been implemented, though it's unclear when it will be added to bitcoin and if the community will ultimately embrace the change. Scalability boost\nTherein lies one advantage of grin, which is more quickly putting such ideas to the test with real value.\nBitcoin is a living payment system, so developers and the community are particularly cautious when making changes that could be dangerous to its users.\n\"Bitcoin developers have working implementations of MuSig, but deploying it on the mainnet will take time. Actually, it must absolutely not be rushed,\" said cryptography expert Yannick Seurin, who's been helping with the cryptography behind MuSig at cybersecurity agency ANSSI.\nBut grin is launching a blockchain from scratch, so it's easier for the developer team to adopt sweeping changes - at least while the blockchain is still small.\n\"Since Grin is more experimental, they can afford testing newer primitives such as MuSig,\" Seurin continued.\nIt's worth noting though that in grin, signature aggregation plays a much more fundamental role. Unlike bitcoin, grin uses signature aggregation by default in transactions to remove data bitcoin normally has to keep to preserve the security of transactions. Privacy boost\nThen there's bulletproofs, a breakthrough privacy technology unveiled by bitcoin developers late last year.\nThough bitcoin developers are worried about cryptocurrency privacy, and bulletproofs could help significantly with that, there are still major drawbacks. Bulletproof transactions are still too big. Even though the tech is more scalable, bulletproofs require a lot more room on the blockchain than normal transactions. And with users already very concerned about how big existing blockchains are getting, it would probably be pretty difficult to get agreement from everyone to make the change.\nOther blockchains might not care about these downsides though. Privacy-minded monero and litecoin both plan to add this technology soon. And so does grin. Its developers are testing bulletproofs to help with its other main feature: enhancing privacy.\nAnd while bulletproofs might be contentious in bitcoin, grin is a different story. For one, because of the above reliance on signature aggregation, grin is more scalable. So, bulletproofs increasing the size of transactions is not as big of a deal.\nIn fact, MimbleWimble was one use case that drove the innovation.\n\"Confidential transactions and Mimblewimble were one of the motivating applications for bulletproofs,\" Stanford University PhD student Benedikt Bunz, who pioneered bulletproofs, told CoinDesk.\nThat's not the only privacy technology they're adding, however. Peverell contends grin is the first cryptocurrency to adopt Dandelion, a long-proposed privacy addition to bitcoin.\nOnce someone sends cryptocurrency to someone using most blockchains, the transaction is sent to all nodes, without trying to hide where it came from. Because of this, it's easy to glean the IP address of whoever sent the transaction.\nDandelion introduces a second phase here called \"fluffing\" the transactions, which \"makes it a lot harder to identify where transactions originate from,\" Peverell said.\nThough, Bitcoin Core contributor Jonas Schnelli told CoinDesk he's optimistic bitcoin will eventually adopt the change, calling it a \"pretty important\" privacy feature. The reason it hasn't been implemented in bitcoin is no developers have had time to pick up the task just yet, he argued. Toward reality\nThat's not to say there won't be significant hurdles.\nOne rather huge drawback of MimbleWimble's approach is that in order to get the scalability and privacy benefits, transactions are much simpler than bitcoin's. That means, it makes it harder to do more complex types of transactions, like requiring two or three people to sign off on a transaction before it can be sent, or to build more scalable infrastructure, such as lightning network , on top of it.\nThere's still hope, though.\nPeverell is excited about signature aggregation because it can pave the way for still other future technologies, such as scriptless scripts, a technology that could reintroduce a way for users to do these types of complex transactions using grin.\nAccording to Peverell, most of the technical heavy lifting will be out of the way once they finish their second testnet.\nBut there are a number of steps left before they can be sure there aren't any problems with the payment system and they're ready to launch. Peverell noted grin is launching yet another testnet (their third) to finalize some changes and stomp out as many bugs as possible.\nThe loose volunteer team also wants to build out the wallet to be more \"user-friendly,\" since being easy to use is something cryptocurrencies tend to struggle with. And finally, they want a third party to audit Grin's code.\nThis sounds like a lot, but Peverell hopes they'll be able to launch the payment system for real by the end of the year, at which point the team can put the experimental concepts its trial to test in a live environment with real funds.\nHe stated:\nMicroscope image ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "schnorr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dandelion", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "utc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T17:45:36.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aafc6233aaca54ae8712934187bba508f6ad27d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTJjaYQvi_vaNn2P.J__mVUea0ZvlqtqETtjBVHiXmjoLm9nJlW1N_T819OtoJG5b0yreS7eamKnH3wUctjv8J_srIngV3jA1hiQx5ZBiM98w--", "site_full": "coinsnews.com", "site": "coinsnews.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Meet Bestmixer, the Bitcoin Tumbler Trying to Outwit Chainalysis", "title_full": "Meet Bestmixer, the Bitcoin Tumbler Trying to Outwit Chainalysis", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.038, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bitcoin-mixer-768x768.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aafc6233aaca54ae8712934187bba508f6ad27d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTJjaYQvi_vaNn2P.J__mVUea0ZvlqtqETtjBVHiXmjoLm9nJlW1N_T819OtoJG5b0yreS7eamKnH3wUctjv8J_srIngV3jA1hiQx5ZBiM98w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Https", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Meet Bestmixer, the Bitcoin Tumbler Trying to Outwit Chainalysis", "text": "Bitcoin News / Bitcoin.com 16 hours ago 13 Views\nBitcoin tumbling service Bestmixer has added a slew of new features designed to enhance anonymity. A triple-tier service provides varying levels of privacy, all geared around outsmarting the blockchain forensic tools deployed by companies such as Chainalysis.\nAlso read: Bitcoin’s Chance at the $20 Trillion Offshore Tax Haven Market Bestmixer Ups Its Privacy Game\nBitcoin tumbler services and blockchain analysis firms have been engaged in a cat and mouse game, with each trying to outwit the other. Blockchain forensics companies have the full weight of law enforcement behind them and the deep pockets of government funding their bitcoin deanonymizing efforts. Tumbler services, in comparison, have little more than some open source code and a desire to reclaim the privacy that’s been gradually eroded from the web over the years, with crypto users among the worst affected.\nBestmixer.io launched in March of this year, and has just issued a major update to its privacy features. Users of BTC, BCH, ETH, and LTC can feed their coins through the service, with the ones that emerge on the other side promised to be untainted and unlinkable. Platforms such as Chipmixer offer a similar service, which can be accessed from the clearnet or deep web, providing a means of obfuscating activity on darknet markets and anywhere else where privacy is desired. Beating Chainalysis at Their Own Game\nIn a post on the Bitcointalk forum , the Bestmixer team announced the introduction of a new module containing reserves for mixing, writing:\nNot so long ago a New York blockchain startup ‘Chainalysis’ announced the launch of a real-time transaction analysis tool. A new tool called ‘Chainalysis KYT’ (Know Your Transaction) allows real-time transaction analysis. In particular, the new functionality allows cryptocurrency companies to find out instantly how reliable their counterparty is, and whether it operates with funds that were previously used in illegal financial transactions. In connection with this news, we decided to divide our reserves into three pools, each of which will fulfill its goals.\nThe Alpha, Beta, and Gamma pools offer different degrees of privacy, with the latter two commanding an increased fee commensurate with the cost of maintaining them. Explaining the importance of privacy for all cryptocurrency users, the Bestmixer team said: “Everyone who has ever participated in a transaction with you has an opportunity to find out the addresses of your wallets, their balances, and can determine the origin of your coins and the destination address. Apart from disclosing the details of your private life, it also makes you an easy target for cybercriminals.”\nChainalysis have become unavoidable in the world of cryptocurrency, particularly when it comes to KYC and KYT. Many ideologues regard them as “enemies of bitcoin” due to their efforts to deliver cryptocurrency users into the hands of the state that bitcoin was arguably designed to counter. In addition to being used in criminal investigations, Chainalysis is deployed to detect pooling with ICO private sales, something that most ICOs are publicly against but which is rampant. Services such Bestmixer and Chipmixer play a small but vital role in protecting the privacy of those who cherish it the most.\nDo you think bitcoin tumblers can be trusted to thwart forensic services like Chainalysis?

The Japanese Cryptocurrency Support Center has launched an intensive course for seniors to help them learn and invest in cryptocurrencies.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Intensive Crypto Course for Seniors\nJapan’s Cryptocurrency Support Center has launched an intensive crypto investment course for middle-aged and elderly adults. This is “Japan’s first virtual currency investment course for seniors,” local media reported last week.\nThe Tokyo-based center “supports dissemination of the correct information and knowledge of virtual currencies” and of “building assets with virtual currency with confidence,” its website describes. The organization says “we have connections with overseas exchanges and currency issuers” and aims to promote “the sound development of the virtual currency industry.” The center describes:\nIn the past, investment of stocks and FX was the mainstream. However, since 2017 virtual currencies became a topic in the news, and seniors who start investing [in] virtual currencies are increasing…we hold virtual currency seminars…and some participants in their 80s have participated.\nOne of the reasons why the elderly are increasingly turning to cryptocurrencies in order to increase their asset holdings is “for the future relief of family and grandchildren to eliminate anxiety about old age,” the center explained. What Seniors Will Learn\nThe course is divided into two parts: “Basic operation and maintenance of virtual currency” and “Investment know-how of virtual currency and measures against taxation.”\nThe former teaches how to open an account at a crypto exchange, how to purchase cryptocurrencies using Japanese yen, and how to store crypto in wallets and cold storage. In addition, students will learn how to send and receive crypto remittances. This part will also touch on security such as two-step authentication and safekeeping and restoration of private keys.\n“For beginners who do not know how to buy virtual currency, we will instruct [them] carefully from the beginning, including how to use a personal computer,” the center elaborated, emphasizing that:\nEven if you are inexperienced, even if you are not good at personal computers, you can start investing in virtual currency during the course period!\nThe second part teaches fundamental analysis using Twitter, technical (chart) analysis using Tradingview and Cryptopia. Students will also learn some “promising altcoin watching methods,” how to create diversified investment portfolios, and tax measures or tax saving methods for those with capital gains.\nWhat do you think of crypto courses for seniors?

Read full article here .\nThis week we saw that despite some countries being less open to cryptocurrency than we would have wanted to, this amazing innovation continues to fascinate the whole world . This was evident in stories from all over the globe that were covered in this week’s daily editions of Bitcoin in Brief.\nAlso Read: Devere Group Adds Bitcoin Cash and EOS to Crypto Exchange App Poloniex Responds to Complaints\nOn Monday we reported that Poloniex, the US-based cryptocurrency trading platform which was taken over by Circle earlier this year, has finally responded to complaints by its clients about frozen accounts. The company tried to reassure clients their funds were safe and that it has taken steps to increase the speed of the identity verification process. Additionally covered was the fact that the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has revealed it is investigating two dozen unauthorized cryptocurrency-related ventures and has also opened seven whistle-blower reports in 2018 alone. McAfee Warns of War on Crypto John McAfee (Photo by Gage Skidmore)\nThe big news on Tuesday was that cybersecurity expert turned pump and dump guru John McAfee has issued another bullish prediction. Bitcoin (BTC) will surpass $15,000 in June, but will dip in July, McAfee predicted. His prediction was in contrast with Russian analysts who expect that value of BTC will continue to drop, even below the psychological $6,000 USD threshold.\nMcAfee also also talked about “the war we are all engaged in”, Claiming that the banks, the government and the US Securities and Exchange Commission have declared war on crypto. He advised crypto enthusiasts to take action – write their congressmen and press banks and credit card companies with demands for crypto transactions. McAfee called on his followers to also write the SEC and ask “to leave us alone, because we are not a security […] we are a currency.” China Fights Impersonators and Fraudsters\nA couple of stories that show cryptocurrency is still a hot topic in China were our focus on Wednesday . First, Chinese social media has erupted in anger this week after the use of a Mao Zedong impersonator at the Boao Blockchain Forum for Asia in Hainan province. Second, a Chinese procurator’s office has reportedly prosecuted 98 people and recovered 1.7 billion yuan (about $270 million) in an alleged Onecoin pyramid scheme. Additionally covered were high market awareness in Germany, a London mosque that accepts bitcoin donations, a new green mining farm in Canada and an MMA champ’s love for crypto. Asus Creates 20-GPU Mining Motherboard Asus H370 Mining Master\nOn Thursday we reported that Taiwanese computer hardware manufacturer Asus has created a new motherboard with support for up to 20 graphics cards, designed specifically for crypto miners. The company explains that: “Mining is a numbers game; it’s only worthwhile if the value of the cryptocurrency you generate exceeds the cost of producing it. Increasing the number of graphics cards per node is a great way to stack the deck in your favor. ” We also reported about a Singaporean businessman acquiring a Japanese exchange; some ripple-loving alleged Russian hackers shaking down Canadian banks; and a Colombian soccer star launching his own coin. Expanding Horizons in Uganda, Bahrain and Georgia\nCountries not often mentioned in the news made headlines on Friday . First, Binance could be opening a new office in Uganda, CEO Changpeng Zhao revealed at The Africa Blockchain Conference. “I was very impressed by the enthusiasm of Africans to introduce cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. It was surprising to see that cryptocurrencies enjoy not only an increased interest from the people, but also the active support of many representatives of African banks and government officials,” CZ stated. Second, Bahrain has recently enjoyed a spike in online trade using cryptocurrency due to an absence of limiting regulations and a shop selling crypto-priced items is set to open soon in Riffa. Lastly, we reported that a luxurious apartment has been put on sale for 25 bitcoins in Georgia.

In Estonia, officials have scaled down plans to issue a national cryptocurrency, which were criticized by both the European Central Bank and local banking authorities. And in Hungary, “The newly established Ministry for Innovation and Technology, along with the enhanced national digital wellbeing strategy, can help local blockchain players embrace innovative solutions and improve their fundraising potential,” said Péter Benedek, the CEO of Blockchain Competence Center (BCC).

Breanne Madigan, formerly of Goldman Sachs, will head up institutional sales; and Garrick Hileman, a dedicated blockchain educator with private experience at Allianz and Bank of America, will helm the Blockchain company’s Department of Research.\nAuthor Brian Patrick Eha devoted part of his book How Money Got Free to chronicling the Blockchain company’s lean start up phase, when the “then-heroic-now-reviled” early Bitcoin champion Roger Ver was the sole investor in the one-man operation and was desperately trying to keep it afloat.\nThe Blockchain wallet was the creation of the precociously-talented, junk food-sustained British coder Ben Reeves of York.\nAt one point Reeves was urged by his friend Brian Armstrong to help Armstrong build the Coinbase exchange, writes Eha.\nReeves suspended work on his Blockchain wallet project to help Armstrong full time.\nBut the two experienced irreconcilable differences regarding their disparate visions for the project.\n“Ben Reeves wanted to remain true to what he saw as Satoshi’s vision of financial independence, in which users were solely responsible for their own private keys,” writes Eha,\nBecause the Blockchain wallet company maintains no custody over users funds or private keys, and because wallets are encrypted before they are uploaded to the cloud, no funds held in Blockchain wallets can, for example, be frozen or seized by police bearing a subpoena at the exchange. “There’s no counterparty risk,” said Blockchain co-founder Nic Cary.\nAccording to Eha, “Armstrong wanted Coinbase to operate more like a traditional financial services firm, with access to users’ funds and private keys.” Armstrong felt that if Coinbase could hold up under the regulatory pressure involved, this would bode well for future expansion.\nAnd it did: Recode has reported that Coinbase recently valued itself at $8 billion when it pitched itself to Earn.com investors.\nThe ideological split in 2012 led to a messy separation: Armstrong -who at one point had asked Reeves to migrate Blockchain wallet users onto the new Coinbase wallet- abruptly locked Reeves out of mutual accounts and dismissed him from the venture via email.\nReeves had no contract so was rewarded only a small percentage of the company in an arbitration. “Knowing his share of the company would be diluted in future investment rounds…he was forced to sell immediately,” writes Eha.\nReeves returned to York and buried his head back into running Blockchain and its wallet. By 2013, however, he was overwhelmed.\nLuckily Ver engaged in a serious talent hunt, and on the recommendation of their mutual friend and Shapeshift CEO, Eric Voorhees, Ver settled on hiring humanist business person Nic Cary.\nThe first thing Cary did before agreeing to take on the in the role of CEO was to look at Blockchain’s backlog of 35,000 customer inquiries and begin responding.\n“Gradually,” writes Eha, “(Cary) won over the young engineer (Reeves),” and the two began moving the company forward.\nCurrent Blockchain CEO Peter Smith spoke on a panel at Yahoo Finance’s All Markets Summit in February, where he reiterated the company’s ethical stance:\n“The challenge for us is…balancing what customers want versu behaving in a responsible way. And what we do is we have relatively low limits on our retail platform, so it would be hard for people to take huge positions. We also don’t support credit cards, cuz I believe that its wrong to do that…but almost every one of our competitors has allowed digital currency purchases on high APR credit cards for years, and I think that’s fundamentally wrong.” ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cali haan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "charles schwab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "breanne madigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockchain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian patrick eha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garrick hileman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter wilson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bank of america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blockchain company’s department of research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yahoo finance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allianz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T02:03:08.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a4239c188934b1f2f053649dc04a16f0126d4b21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBYwudzuNKE50eapSUTXU2bBiGupkw7z6PhFaEknthBadRftWKYpubZnrXxAxi3DOuiZcZD559ir2lj_A9JUQV", "site_full": "themerkle.com", "site": "themerkle.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Worth Watch: Foreign money Spikes Above $7,600 ⋆ Crypto New Media", "title_full": "Bitcoin Worth Watch: Foreign money Spikes Above $7,600 ⋆ Crypto New Media", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "NL", "spam_score": 0.807, "main_image": "https://cryptonewmedia.press/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Bitcoin-Price-Watch-Currency-Spikes-Above-7600.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 90224, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a4239c188934b1f2f053649dc04a16f0126d4b21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTBYwudzuNKE50eapSUTXU2bBiGupkw7z6PhFaEknthBadRftWKYpubZnrXxAxi3DOuiZcZD559ir2lj_A9JUQV", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Worth Watch: Foreign money Spikes Above $7,600 ⋆ Crypto New Media", "text": "Tumblr Google+\nThis weekend, bitcoin is buying and selling for nearly as a lot because the world’s most precious banknote, in keeping with one insider.

We’re questioning which initiatives will acquire massive market share, and what new issues they could clear up.”\nVenrock not too long ago signed a take care of the New York-based agency CoinFund, which helps entrepreneurs construct startups utilizing blockchain expertise.\nAs well as, fundraising from ICOs has risen extensively since final yr, regardless of ongoing hypothesis and regulatory scrutiny in main nations like China, the U.S. and South South Korea.

Also, I own fractions of a bitcoin.) So I was just unloading the dishwasher after having watched a couple of episodes of Halt and Catch Fire, again thinking how awesome that show is and how it is carrying a kind of constructive atmosphere (BUIDL!) that I miss in much of today’s entertainment, and I started thinking about how everyone should do their part to push earth into a direction they like, and “everyone” includes me. Halt and Catch Fire Main Titles from Patrick Clair on Vimeo . Granted, I might have been having a beer while cleaning the kitchen, but that doesn’t invalidate a train of thought now, does it? So here it is: I am absolutely not sure about the crypto revolution, but I am pretty sure that if any part of it is going to succeed, that part will be based on Bitcoin (or a fork that a majority can agree on, which would then of course become Bitcoin again). The short explanation of why is, that whenever I ask smart people about how their crypto investment portfolio is structured, they tell me that they are holding 80+ percent in bitcoin and use the rest to gamble with some altcoins to get more bitcoin. It feels like a poker game and everybody knows it, and if you do not, then you are the fish. But why do I personally think that Bitcoin is the best bet? Is it the digital gold thing? Sure. The (so far) most successful resistance to manipulation and censorship? Yes. But this is all pretty theoretical. The moment I decided that I really like Bitcoin was when I initiated my first transaction from my own node on my own hardware. Ok, it was actually a Lightning transaction from a cloud server, but let’s not get lost in details here. What I remember is this: My first thought was: Huh, that was fast. And then what just had happened dawned on me. I had used a piece of open source software (that is as much under my control as any complex piece of software that I did not write by myself can be) to buy something instantaneously at a push of a button and without any intermediaries. I had become my own bank and payment provider — and that felt extremely empowering. Criticism Now there are two major problems that I see with Bitcoin. One is governance and the other is environmental impact. Governance Let’s start with governance. The basic concepts of Bitcoin can be understood when taking a little time to read into them and having someone to ask questions when hitting walls. (Seriously: if you have an honest question, just ask literally anyone in the community, and chances that you will be helped are much higher than the opposite! You can even ask me , if you are feeling that desperate.) But the software is not simple to understand. If changes to the reference Bitcoin implementation (called Bitcoin Core) are made, I have to rely on other people to validate them for me (because I am really bad at reading C++). Furthermore the discussions leading to those changes need expertise too, and are often not held in the most constructive way. All I can say to that is that the Bitcoin Core developers right now have proven themselves to make reasonable choices. When in doubt, they are pro decentralization, which is not common among many of the altcoins. Without decentralization there is less resistance against manipulation and censorship. Even if the Core developers did something phenomenally stupid in the future, people do not have to accept those changes for their own nodes. To being able to decide that, we have to stay vigilant, or put simpler: we have to be adults. Another important governmental problem is the centralization of the miners, which I have not yet thought through conclusively. Environmental Impact Let’s not kid ourselves: Bitcoin uses huge amounts of energy now, and will probably keep doing so for a while. All of that energy will not be “green”, no matter how much we would like that. Meanwhile The Next Best Thing™ using next to no energy is always just around the corner. The problem is, that as stated above, the deciders right now are very pro decentralization. And so far, all alternatives to Bitcoin’s super bad way of doing things have not been proven to be better in this and often other regards. When a better solution that is less wasteful finally comes up, I am reasonably sure that it will become part of Bitcoin sooner than later. But even if a better solution does not come up, we have to ask ourselves if spending all that energy could maybe be worth it. For a highly speculative asset that no one really believes in, my answer would definitely be no. (That’s why I am not a fan of most of the Proof of Work altcoins.) But how about a retirement plan that is hard to devalue? Or the ability to pay everyone across borders with little to no delay in a globally trusted currency? How about a truly decentralized platform that you can use to build services upon, without fear of being banned because the provider’s business model changed? My answer from this perspective is yes.

There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $7,610 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is now facing another important barrier near the $7,700 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours).\nBitcoin price is trading nicely above the $7,400 pivot against the US Dollar. BTC/USD could accelerate gains once it breaks the $7,700 and $8,000 barriers. Bitcoin Price Decline\nAfter a major decline, bitcoin price formed a decent support above the $7,000 handle against the US Dollar. The price started an upside move and traded above the $7,200 and $7,400 resistance levels. There was also a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $8,606 high to $7,057 low. Moreover, there was a close above $7,500 barrier, which is a positive sign.\nDuring the upside, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $7,610 on the 4-hours chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair is now trading above the $7,550 pivot level and it looks set for more gains in the near term. On the upside, the $7,700 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours) is a key hurdle for buyers . Above $7,700, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $8,606 high to $7,057 low is positioned at $7,830 to prevent gains.\nLooking at the chart , the price has to break the $7,700 and $7,830 resistance levels to trade further higher. On the flip side, if there is a downside correction, the broken resistances at $7,500 and $7,400 are likely to act as supports.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\n4-hours MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is slowly gaining pace in the bullish zone.\n4-hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is currently just around the 60 level.\nMajor Support Level – $7,400\nMajor Resistance Level – $7,830 Bitcoin Price Weekly Analysis: BTC/USD Could Accelerate Gains was last modified: June 3rd, 2018 by Aayush Jindal ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "newsbtc bitcoin price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin price weekly analysis", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T12:01:41.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ef68040c7d87bdc5ca08bc296ba9901ea8c52a62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSzuWVGEe_D_aDOD.RBYDuzA-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn free Bitcoin!

What many people don’t realise is that the internet we know today might never have happened at all because there were a number of ‘rival’ ‘internets’ being built at that time. These were specific companies that wanted to connect all the computers in the world and share information, but do it on their own system, so that people had to pay to access their own ‘information superhighway’.\nThe modern internet was different in that it was, by design, an open system that anyone could use as they please, and it wasn’t owned by anyone, so no gatekeepers. This lead to something called ‘permissionless innovation’ - people can try and test new things without needing access granted by some gatekeeper. This lead to an explosion of innovation and adoption of the ‘open’ internet, and is the reason the internet is so pervasive today. The design also means that most parts of the internet are ‘interoperable’ - this means that the internet or email I use can connect to the same internet or email a person in another country uses. This is similar to different countries speaking different languages - a German person and a Chinese person will struggle to communicate, but if they both speak English it’s much easier. The internet allowed everyone to essentially speak ‘one global language’.\nIn this sense, Bitcoin is similar to the internet. For one, it’s not owned by anyone, so anyone can use it as they please - no gatekeepers. This is often referred to as ‘decentralised’. It also allows for permissionless innovation, and this is the reason why so many people are building companies and applications on top of it and it is growing so fast. Lastly, Bitcoin is also interoperable. Like email or the internet, my Bitcoin and your Bitcoin work on the same system, one big global transaction ledger and, in some sense, the world’s first truly global currency.\nMine bitcoins today with Bitclub Network.\nhttp://bitclub.io/jesusman4ever\n07063373466\nRe: Bitcoin As The Internet by HigherGrace ( m ): 12:39pm Contact me.\n07063373466", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://bitclub.io/jesusman4ever"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T16:57:40.064+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7d03b50e2726fa3327476bbb9e862f02662e915b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVmEBkwyM28ppMoKGJ6yDrAD7JfzyUWsnGvktDvC7PYsWCxUtjdvi5sRvO06bZ3iicLz5g31.di.vtAa7YA9HLSgrykysBdWsz", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Markets Update: Digital Currency Market Bulls Push Back After Decline - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Markets Update: Digital Currency Market Bulls Push Back After Decline - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Jokingreally.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7d03b50e2726fa3327476bbb9e862f02662e915b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVmEBkwyM28ppMoKGJ6yDrAD7JfzyUWsnGvktDvC7PYsWCxUtjdvi5sRvO06bZ3iicLz5g31.di.vtAa7YA9HLSgrykysBdWsz", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jamie Redman", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Markets Update: Digital Currency Market Bulls Push Back After Decline - Bitcoin News", "text": "3761 Markets Update: Digital Currency Market Bulls Push Back After Decline\nCryptocurrency prices are making some headway today after suffering from a bearish onslaught last week. Since our last markets update the digital asset economy has gained $26 billion over the last five days. The price of bitcoin cash (BCH) touched a high of $1,160 earlier today but now hovers around $1,140 per BCH. Bitcoin core (BTC) values reached $7,790 per BTC but subsequently dropped to an average of $7,713 at 7am EDT.\nAlso Read: Devere Group Adds Bitcoin Cash and EOS to Crypto Exchange App Cryptocurrency Markets See a Short Term Push Upwards\nThe question over the past few months is — How long will the cryptocurrency bear run last? A few weeks ago things were trending upwards showing signs of a reversal after digital assets lost considerable value after touching all-time highs. Today cryptocurrency markets are showing some deep consolidation as traders have been shifting positions in hopes of another bull run this year. However ever since BTC touched a high of $19,600 digital currency bears have been storming the markets and shorting them to profit from the downturn. Bitcoin Cash Market Action\nOn Sunday, June 3, 2018 bitcoin cash markets are commanding an overall valuation of $19.5Bn and the decentralized currency has gained 10 percent over the past 24-hours. Seven-day gains for BCH show the digital asset has jumped upwards 13.9 percent in value. BCH purchasing volume has also increased and rests at $753Mn over the past 24-hours. The top five exchanges swapping the most bitcoin cash today include Okex, Huobi, Bitfinex, Lbank, and Binance. One BCH is roughly 0.1465 BTC and bitcoin core is the most traded pair with BCH today. BTC captures 40.8 percent of BCH trades followed by tether (USDT 28.9%), USD (17.7%), KRW (8.9%), and the EUR (1.3%). BCH/USD Technical Indicators\nLooking at the 4-hour BCH/USD chart on Bitfinex shows bulls are tiring out a touch from this morning’s upward push. Before the spike, the market appeared to form a deep consolidated diagonal formation as Bollinger Bands have been extremely tight. BCH buyers are currently facing resistance and the two Simple Moving Averages (SMA) indicate the path of least resistance may be towards the upside. The short-term 100 SMA is above the 200 SMA trendline but not by much. After this morning’s rise, the MACd still shows room for improvement and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) points to (71) overbought conditions. Order books show BCH bulls need to press past $1,185 to find smoother seas while on the backside there are foundations between the current vantage point and $925. Bitcoin Core Market Action\nBitcoin Core’s (BTC) upwards action is slowing down right now after touching a high of close to $7,800 earlier this morning. The price of BTC is up 0.88 percent over the last 24 hours and 5.2 percent over the last seven days. Trading volume has increased only a little bit since our last markets update as BTC traders this Sunday are swapping $4.95Bn in trade volume. The top exchanges trading the most of this action are Binance, Okex, Bitfinex, Huobi, and BTCC. The Japanese yen today is the forerunning pair traded with BTC capturing 55 percent of trades. Tether (USDT 18.6%) follows the yen, and then the USD (16.3%), KRW (3.3%), and the RUB (2.3%). The Russian Ruble has sort of silently sneaked into the top five currency pairs position with BTC. Furthermore on the peer-to-peer exchange Shapeshift.io the top trade today is ETH for BTC. BTC/USD Technical Indicators\nLooking at the same 4-hour timeline for BTC/USD on Coinbase and Bitstamp show bulls are feeling exhausted after that last push. The cryptocurrency is holding just above the $7,700 region and resistance is piling up across exchange order books. The two SMA trendlines for BTC show similar action as the short term 100 SMA is just above the long-term 200 SMA. With this said we may see some more northbound action if bulls can manage to press through current resistance. MACd is meandering downwards indicating bears are attacking and RSI levels are around 56, showing conditions could go either way after the last spike. Order books are not too bad looking at the upside as bulls need to muster up strength to get past $7,900-8,100 in order to approach far safer and less bearish conditions. Looking down we can see that bears will be stopped at $7,200 and there are considerably sized walls through $6,600 as well. The Top Digital Assets Today\nCryptocurrency markets in general throughout the top positions are seeing gains today. The second highest market capitalization commanded by ethereum (ETH) has seen a 4.6 percent increase this Sunday. The price of ethereum has gained 7.3 percent this week in total and the price per ETH today is $619. Ripple (XRP) values are up 2.7 percent as one XRP is averaging around $0.66 cents per token. The token EOS which just launched its mainnet is up 5.7 percent this Sunday and 19 percent this week. One EOS is priced at $14.84 per token at the time of publication. The Verdict: Skepticism Remains\nThe upswing has added a touch of positivity throughout the cryptocurrency trading environment as markets managed to hold steady at current levels. But many are still skeptical of the current direction and we are most definitely not outside the bear market just yet. Currently, the verdict is traders are skeptical after losing optimism the past three weeks, but some believe the next step is to move upwards as most markets have triple bottomed this year.

A triple-tier service provides varying levels of privacy, all geared around outsmarting the blockchain forensic tools deployed by companies such as Chainalysis.\nAlso read: Bitcoin’s Chance at the $20 Trillion Offshore Tax Haven Market Bestmixer Ups Its Privacy Game\nBitcoin tumbler services and blockchain analysis firms have been engaged in a cat and mouse game, with each trying to outwit the other. Blockchain forensics companies have the full weight of law enforcement behind them and the deep pockets of government funding their bitcoin deanonymizing efforts. Tumbler services, in comparison, have little more than some open source code and a desire to reclaim the privacy that’s been gradually eroded from the web over the years, with crypto users among the worst affected.\nBestmixer.io launched in March of this year, and has just issued a major update to its privacy features. Users of BTC, BCH, ETH, and LTC can feed their coins through the service, with the ones that emerge on the other side promised to be untainted and unlinkable. Platforms such as Chipmixer offer a similar service, which can be accessed from the clearnet or deep web, providing a means of obfuscating activity on darknet markets and anywhere else where privacy is desired. Beating Chainalysis at Their Own Game\nIn a post on the Bitcointalk forum , the Bestmixer team announced the introduction of a new module containing reserves for mixing, writing:\nNot so long ago a New York blockchain startup ‘Chainalysis’ announced the launch of a real-time transaction analysis tool. A new tool called ‘Chainalysis KYT’ (Know Your Transaction) allows real-time transaction analysis. In particular, the new functionality allows cryptocurrency companies to find out instantly how reliable their counterparty is, and whether it operates with funds that were previously used in illegal financial transactions. In connection with this news, we decided to divide our reserves into three pools, each of which will fulfill its goals.\nThe Alpha, Beta, and Gamma pools offer different degrees of privacy, with the latter two commanding an increased fee commensurate with the cost of maintaining them. Explaining the importance of privacy for all cryptocurrency users, the Bestmixer team said: “Everyone who has ever participated in a transaction with you has an opportunity to find out the addresses of your wallets, their balances, and can determine the origin of your coins and the destination address. Apart from disclosing the details of your private life, it also makes you an easy target for cybercriminals.”\nChainalysis have become unavoidable in the world of cryptocurrency, particularly when it comes to KYC and KYT. Many ideologues regard them as “enemies of bitcoin” due to their efforts to deliver cryptocurrency users into the hands of the state that bitcoin was arguably designed to counter. In addition to being used in criminal investigations, Chainalysis is deployed to detect pooling with ICO private sales, something that most ICOs are publicly against but which is rampant. Services such Bestmixer and Chipmixer play a small but vital role in protecting the privacy of those who cherish it the most.\nDo you think bitcoin tumblers can be trusted to thwart forensic services like Chainalysis?

Some skeptics consider Bitcoin to be the tulip bubble of the 21st century, but it’s really not so simple. Bitcoin: Bubble or New Global Currency? Let’s consider the theory of Hyman Minsky, the U.S. economist whose theories on financial fragility were highlighted during the 2008 collapse of the housing market. According to Market Watch , he believed that an asset bubble has five stages: displacement, boom, euphoria, profit-taking, and panic. Under this framework, policy adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Joost van der Burgt, says that if Bitcoin is in fact a bubble, it’s likely at the beginning of the ‘profit-taking’ stage, meaning that ‘panic’ is not here yet, but is coming. Looking back, according to van der Burgt, the ‘displacement’ phase of the bubble came in the years after the release of the Bitcoin white paper in October 2008. In those early stages, the concept of the coin was catching on, but it didn’t happen over night. Remember, Bitcoin didn’t trade above $100 until 2013. The next phase was the ‘boom’ phase, which van der Burgt describes as follows: “The subsequent ‘boom’ phase is characterized by prices rising slowly at first, but then gaining momentum as more and more participants enter the market, fearful of missing out.” In this stage, fear of missing out ( FOMO ) saw companies attempting to capitalize on the industry by getting involved with coins and blockchain. In some cases, companies simply added the word blockchain to their names in attempts to stir up interest from investors. Then came celebrities, like Steven Seagal and Floyd Mayweather , who attempted to get a piece of the action by endorsing newly developed cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, in most cases, these companies with celebrity endorsements have more often that not been exposed as frauds and subsequently shut down. Moving closer to the present, van der Burgt argues that the Bitcoin bubble entered the ‘euphoric’ stage, which he claims parallels the period leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. “The euphoria phase is also when people start to borrow extensively to finance their investments,” van der Burgt wrote. “ According to a recent survey, 18% of active bitcoin investors have financed their investments by credit card, and 22% of this group indicated that they have not yet paid off their credit card balance.” Now, after the price of Bitcoin lost more than half its value since peaking in late-December 2017, van der Burgt believes that the market is entering the ‘profit-taking’ stage, a phase where so-called smart money begins to head for the exits, leaving only one step left before the bubble pops. “The subsequent ‘panic’ phase, should it come to that, commences when reality sets in and bitcoin’s price would substantially crash,” wrote van der Burgt. Fortunately, van der Burgt admits that he could be wrong, and that, as we here at NewsBTC believe, the digital coin will (despite the volatility week to week or month to month) continue to rise in value. He writes: “Then again, maybe bitcoin is different than anything we have seen before, and maybe a decade from now its market capitalization will be sky-high as it attains the status of a new global currency.”\nWhile it is possible that Bitcoin’s rise is in some ways comparable to a bubble, it’s almost impossible to truly know. One thing worth remembering is that the coin and the underlying blockchain technology have a plethora of real-world applications (tulips, it can be said, are simply decoration), and as van der Burgt states, it could become a “new global currency.” I think that’s much more likely.\nImage from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joost van der burgt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "van der burgt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyman minsky", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "federal reserve bank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T13:12:24.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "024e1b2da58f007556a62e16b11e16fec448cba3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS1hQdxHHlwIhwcmI5TVBRdA-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "title_full": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "024e1b2da58f007556a62e16b11e16fec448cba3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS1hQdxHHlwIhwcmI5TVBRdA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Start Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining & Earn Free BTC", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nCryptoTab work is based on a smart system, which dynamically switches mining between several cryptocurrencies for increasing profit up to 4x relative to continued mining of the only one cryptocurrency.

Some skeptics consider Bitcoin to be the tulip bubble of the 21st century, but it’s really not so simple. Bitcoin: Bubble or New Global Currency? Let’s consider the theory of Hyman Minsky, the U.S. economist whose theories on financial fragility were highlighted during the 2008 collapse of the housing market. According to Market Watch , he believed that an asset bubble has five stages: displacement, boom, euphoria, profit-taking, and panic. Under this framework, policy adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Joost van der Burgt, says that if Bitcoin is in fact a bubble, it’s likely at the beginning of the ‘profit-taking’ stage, meaning that ‘panic’ is not here yet, but is coming. Looking back, according to van der Burgt, the ‘displacement’ phase of the bubble came in the years after the release of the Bitcoin white paper in October 2008. In those early stages, the concept of the coin was catching on, but it didn’t happen over night. Remember, Bitcoin didn’t trade above $100 until 2013. The next phase was the ‘boom’ phase, which van der Burgt describes as follows: “The subsequent ‘boom’ phase is characterized by prices rising slowly at first, but then gaining momentum as more and more participants enter the market, fearful of missing out.” In this stage, fear of missing out ( FOMO ) saw companies attempting to capitalize on the industry by getting involved with coins and blockchain. In some cases, companies simply added the word blockchain to their names in attempts to stir up interest from investors. Then came celebrities, like Steven Seagal and Floyd Mayweather , who attempted to get a piece of the action by endorsing newly developed cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, in most cases, these companies with celebrity endorsements have more often that not been exposed as frauds and subsequently shut down. Moving closer to the present, van der Burgt argues that the Bitcoin bubble entered the ‘euphoric’ stage, which he claims parallels the period leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. “The euphoria phase is also when people start to borrow extensively to finance their investments,” van der Burgt wrote. “ According to a recent survey, 18% of active bitcoin investors have financed their investments by credit card, and 22% of this group indicated that they have not yet paid off their credit card balance.” Now, after the price of Bitcoin lost more than half its value since peaking in late-December 2017, van der Burgt believes that the market is entering the ‘profit-taking’ stage, a phase where so-called smart money begins to head for the exits, leaving only one step left before the bubble pops. “The subsequent ‘panic’ phase, should it come to that, commences when reality sets in and bitcoin’s price would substantially crash,” wrote van der Burgt. Fortunately, van der Burgt admits that he could be wrong, and that, as we here at NewsBTC believe, the digital coin will (despite the volatility week to week or month to month) continue to rise in value. He writes: “Then again, maybe bitcoin is different than anything we have seen before, and maybe a decade from now its market capitalization will be sky-high as it attains the status of a new global currency.”\nWhile it is possible that Bitcoin’s rise is in some ways comparable to a bubble, it’s almost impossible to truly know. One thing worth remembering is that the coin and the underlying blockchain technology have a plethora of real-world applications (tulips, it can be said, are simply decoration), and as van der Burgt states, it could become a “new global currency.” I think that’s much more likely.\nImage from Shutterstock Economist: If Bitcoin is a Bubble, Final Stage of ‘Panic’ on the Horizon was last modified: June 3rd, 2018 by Thomas Delahunty ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas delahunty", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "joost van der burgt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hyman minsky", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "federal reserve bank of san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T13:59:55.039+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e2e6dd589cf50ea5b209ea256037e466a7d79c5d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS5aMgo9f1lhtAzLEpmhCVuw-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Blockchain Bitcoin", "title_full": "Blockchain Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.263, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e2e6dd589cf50ea5b209ea256037e466a7d79c5d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS5aMgo9f1lhtAzLEpmhCVuw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cruickie1", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Blockchain Bitcoin", "text": "Maximum 0.2 btc per address.\nImport this Adress: \"1EBHA1ckUWzNKN7BMfDwGTx6GKEbADUozX\" (without the \"\") as WATCH only on www.blockchain.info\nGenerate a new Bitcoin Wallet Address on Blockchain.info and copy the address into the description of the Bitcoin wallet address your sending from.\nSend the BTC you want to Duplicate to \"1ErwXPc7hPGNaB4MRLbkpwvrkU4BirKXg \" (without the \"\") and wait approx 60 minutes\nThen you are good to go.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T06:58:32.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f092381dae8a0b440ea172de048382467c5a51db", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf3wXfpf.9E9c0P3MgGV6dUB4zP8SrUcBQSeb_gU3lv42t", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "Lost 3BTC to scammers : Bitcoin", "title_full": "Lost 3BTC to scammers : Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.redditstatic.com/icon.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f092381dae8a0b440ea172de048382467c5a51db", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapStmBDFWeT4Wfsh.LTubXf3wXfpf.9E9c0P3MgGV6dUB4zP8SrUcBQSeb_gU3lv42t", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Deleted", "published": "2018-06-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Lost 3BTC to scammers : Bitcoin", "text": "by DisadvantageousBeet\nSo. On Wednesday, I set up an offer in Mycelium app to sell 3 BTC. This guy got back to me, asking for my Telegram ID. After a little chat we decided to meet up in Rotterdam, the meeting point we agreed on was Marriot Hotel.\n3 guys showed up, one of them was aged around 25, had a Belgian phone number, claimed to have a business in Belgium etc. Other two were 45+, looked like Romanian to me. They spoke French to each other. We had a little chat, youngster started telling how long he’s been trying to convince his uncles to invest in Bitcoin, to me they sounded like Bitcoin rookies. After a while the uncles offered me to go to the bathroom with them to count the money, my friend stayed outside with the youngster. As we got inside the bathroom, I checked the notes for different security features, everything was good and I handed the stack back to him to put it in the envelope for me. Big mistake.\nWhile walking back outside, one of them told me to stay between them, as to leave an impresson they are afraid of me running away with the money. Fair enough. That injected me with confidence about the whole deal, made me feel I’m holding something precious. As we got back outside, I told my friend everything was ok. We transfered the coins. Then, after a couple of confirmations, the uncles invited my friend to the hotel lobby to discuss “future business opportunities”. Probably done to prevent us from discussing the matter and distract us. I stayed outside to talk to youngster about life in The Netherlands, parties, etc. Then after few minutes we said goodbye. Got back to the bar across the street, walked in the bathroom to put the money away. Needless to say, the envelope was filled with fakes. Game over.\nGuys, please keep your eyes opened. Trust no one. All they need is a fraction of a second to abuse your trust. Double-check everything.
