The reason was every man and his dog moved their BTC off the exchanges into cold storage to ensure they received their Bitcoin Cash. So there was very little Supply of Bitcoin available for Lending. Leading up to the fork, 'annualized' Bitcoin interest rate range was 329% - 3,678% (based on daily rates of 0.4-1.0%) #BIBOR @RyanRadloff pic.twitter.com/u3PPoEm62P — Jon Matonis (@jonmatonis) August 4, 2017 BTC lending rate at Poloniex now 0.4906% daily, 500% annual.

Interest payments are now 0.53 BTC = 6.46 $BCH at 0.082. 54 days to go. — BambouClub (@BambouClub) August 5, 2017\nZooming out, we can see that pronounced effect of thr Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork on 1 August 2017. (Data is from Bitfinex but the point stands.)\nSource BFXData.com . See how Rates on BTC lending (Blue line) exploded at 1 August 2017. And see how BTC lending rate is highish in Feb and March 2018 as ascendant bears borrowed BTC to short. A Daily rate of 0.05% equates to an annual compounded rate of 20%.\nHow to earn this interest at Poloniex? It’s easy. Move BTC to your Polo Lending Wallet and offer them for Loan under the Lending tab. You need to set an Amount, a Duration, and a Rate. Set a rate that is in line with the market as seen in Loan Offers . If you try for too high a rate your Offer will not get filled. You can ignore the Loan Demands table. Lending at Bitfinex\nLending is called Funding at Bitfinex. (And confusingly, Funding at Kraken means Deposits and Withdrawals.)\na. You can lend BTC to fund margin traders at Bitfinex who are going Long on ALTBTC positions with leverage.\nb. Bitfinex also offers BTCUSD margin trading (unlike Polo) so you can lend BTC to those going Short on BTCUSD . (They need to possess BTC to sell it.)\nc. You can also lend USD to traders going Long on BTCUSD and ALTUSD.\nUSD rates at Bitfinex tend to dwarf those available In Real Life. You can currently earn a fortune lending USD at Bitfinex. Daily Rate: 0.24273% — BambouClub (@BambouClub) October 14, 2017\nSo, how to lend at Bitfinex? Again, it’s easy. Move BTC or USD to your Funding Wallet. Then go to the Funding Tab and make your Loan Offers, setting an Amount, a Period and a Rate.\nWhen a BTC offer is accepted by a margin trader, the BTC in your funding wallet will be used by the trader to sell bitcoins (open a position). When the trader completes a trade by closing the position, they buy BTC which is returned to your wallet.\nThere are great stats available on Bitfinex Funding .\nYou can also lend ALTS at Bitfinex. (You lend them to margin traders shorting them.)\nSo at time of writing (20 May 2018) $720 million are being lent out at Daily 0.065% / 26% annualised, and 50,000 Bitcoin with value of $415 million at 0.01% Daily / 3.6% annualised. Lending at BitMEX\nRates for Funding at BitMEX are often the highest in the crypto space. It is not so straightforward as lending at Poloniex and Bitfinex.\nWhen net sentiment in the XBTUSD market is bullish, you earn funding income by shorting the XBTUSD Swap contract. (Shorting Bitcoin essentially means you are holding a USD position.) This was the case for most of 2017.\nWhen net sentiment in the XBTUSD market is bearish, you earn funding by going Long the XBTUSD Swap. Ths has applied to most of 2018.\nA few things to note when the objective is purely to maximise funding income:\nFunding fees and rebates apply to the XBTUSD Swap contract only. There is no Funding of the Bitcoin Futures contracts.\nUse small Leverage to avoid getting Liquidated.\nYou must ensure your overall BitMEX portfolio (BTC in Wallet, BTC exposed in positions) is delta-neutral, i.e. unaffected by moves in XBTUSD. You need to use the Bitcoin Futures contract to hedge your XBTUSD Swap position to achieve this.\nHow to find out if you should go Long or Short to get the Funding?\nThe Funding Rate for the current 8-hour Session is displayed in the Contract Details box bottom-left.\nPositive Funding Rate means Longs pay Shorts.\nHover over the box to see Predicted Funding Rate for next Session.\nThe Funding History page shows the history.\nInterest is paid every 8 hour period, so 3 times a day. At 4am UTC then at midday UTC and then at 8PM UTC.\nWhen you are shorting Bitcoin your position (Unrealised PNL) will change according to price of Bitcoin, until you close your short, at which point you will turn it into a Realised PNL. But your interest payments will be realised (Realised PNL) every 8 hours and come into your account.\nWhe you are comfortable with shorting with 1x leverage, you can try 2x. Shorting on 2x allows you to keep some of your Bitcoin in cold storage, so you are exposed to less counterparty risk to BitMEX. Watch the market and add extra margin if the price gets near to your Liquidation price to avoid Liquidation. Check the Market for Lending\nYou can keep an eye on daily and annual rates at CryptoLend and at CoinLend .\nRates (Daily) at 19 May 2018.\nRates (Annual compounded) at 19 May 2018.\nBitMEX often offers the best BTC Lending rates in the crypto space.

People gearing up to buy alts. pic.twitter.com/kYiDREIYMh\n— BambouClub (@BambouClub) June 15, 2017 Rates exploded in the run-up to the Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork on 1 August 2017. The reason was every man and his dog moved their BTC off the exchanges into cold storage to ensure they received their Bitcoin Cash. So there was very little Supply of Bitcoin available for Lending.\nLeading up to the fork, 'annualized' Bitcoin interest rate range was 329% - 3,678% (based on daily rates of 0.4-1.0%) #BIBOR @RyanRadloff pic.twitter.com/u3PPoEm62P\n— Jon Matonis (@jonmatonis) August 4, 2017 BTC lending rate at Poloniex now 0.4906% daily, 500% annual.

Interest payments are now 0.53 BTC = 6.46 $BCH at 0.082.\n54 days to go.\n— BambouClub (@BambouClub) August 5, 2017 Zooming out, we can see that pronounced effect of thr Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork on 1 August 2017. (Data is from Bitfinex but the point stands.)\nSource BFXData.com . See how Rates on BTC lending (Blue line) exploded at 1 August 2017. And see how BTC lending rate is highish in Feb and March 2018 as ascendant bears borrowed BTC to short. A Daily rate of 0.05% equates to an annual compounded rate of 20%.\nHow to earn this interest at Poloniex? It’s easy. Move BTC to your Polo Lending Wallet and offer them for Loan under the Lending tab. You need to set an Amount, a Duration, and a Rate. Set a rate that is in line with the market as seen in Loan Offers . If you try for too high a rate your Offer will not get filled. You can ignore the Loan Demands table.\nLending at Bitfinex Lending is called Funding at Bitfinex. (And confusingly, Funding at Kraken means Deposits and Withdrawals.)\na. You can lend BTC to fund margin traders at Bitfinex who are going Long on ALTBTC positions with leverage.\nb. Bitfinex also offers BTCUSD margin trading (unlike Polo) so you can lend BTC to those going Short on BTCUSD . (They need to possess BTC to sell it.)\nc. You can also lend USD to traders going Long on BTCUSD and ALTUSD.\nUSD rates at Bitfinex tend to dwarf those available In Real Life.\nYou can currently earn a fortune lending USD at Bitfinex.\nDaily Rate: 0.24273%\nAnnualised rate: 146.95 % p.a. pic.twitter.com/feJZDQ7uTn\n— BambouClub (@BambouClub) October 14, 2017 So, how to lend at Bitfinex? Again, it’s easy. Move BTC or USD to your Funding Wallet. Then go to the Funding Tab and make your Loan Offers, setting an Amount, a Period and a Rate.\nWhen a BTC offer is accepted by a margin trader, the BTC in your funding wallet will be used by the trader to sell bitcoins (open a position). When the trader completes a trade by closing the position, they buy BTC which is returned to your wallet.\nUse the Auto-Renew feature to avoid a lot of donkey work. More info. on Funding at Bitfinex .\nThere are great stats available on Bitfinex Funding .\nYou can also lend ALTS at Bitfinex. (You lend them to margin traders shorting them.)\nSo at time of writing (20 May 2018) $720 million are being lent out at Daily 0.065% / 26% annualised, and 50,000 Bitcoin with value of $415 million at 0.01% Daily / 3.6% annualised.\nLending at BitMEX Rates for Funding at BitMEX are often the highest in the crypto space. It is not so straightforward as lending at Poloniex and Bitfinex.\nWhen net sentiment in the XBTUSD market is bullish, you earn funding income by shorting the XBTUSD Swap contract. (Shorting Bitcoin essentially means you are holding a USD position.) This was the case for most of 2017.\nWhen net sentiment in the XBTUSD market is bearish, you earn funding by going Long the XBTUSD Swap. Ths has applied to most of 2018.\nA few things to note when the objective is purely to maximise funding income:\nFunding fees and rebates apply to the XBTUSD Swap contract only. There is no Funding of the Bitcoin Futures contracts.\nUse small Leverage to avoid getting Liquidated.\nYou must ensure your overall BitMEX portfolio (BTC in Wallet, BTC exposed in positions) is delta-neutral, i.e. unaffected by moves in XBTUSD. You need to use the Bitcoin Futures contract to hedge your XBTUSD Swap position to achieve this.\nHow to find out if you should go Long or Short to get the Funding?\nThe Funding Rate for the current 8-hour Session is displayed in the Contract Details box bottom-left.\nPositive Funding Rate means Longs pay Shorts.\nHover over the box to see Predicted Funding Rate for next Session.\nThe Funding History page shows the history.\nInterest is paid every 8 hour period, so 3 times a day. At 4am UTC then at midday UTC and then at 8PM UTC.\nWhen you are shorting Bitcoin your position (Unrealised PNL) will change according to price of Bitcoin, until you close your short, at which point you will turn it into a Realised PNL. But your interest payments will be realised (Realised PNL) every 8 hours and come into your account.\nWhe you are comfortable with shorting with 1x leverage, you can try 2x. Shorting on 2x allows you to keep some of your Bitcoin in cold storage, so you are exposed to less counterparty risk to BitMEX. Watch the market and add extra margin if the price gets near to your Liquidation price to avoid Liquidation.\nMore detail on this trade in this essay: XBTUSD The Philosopher’s Stone and Earning Interest Income on XBTUSD with Minimised Risk .\nCheck the Market for Lending You can keep an eye on daily and annual rates at CryptoLend and at CoinLend .\nRates (Daily) at 19 May 2018.\nRates (Annual compounded) at 19 May 2018.\nBitMEX often offers the best BTC Lending rates in the crypto space.

The builder, Shailesh Bhatt, was the complainant in a bitcoin extortion case. The CID-Crime lodged a fresh FIR against Bhatt and about nine of his accomplices yesterday at Surat after new details emerged during the ongoing probe into the original case, Director General of Police, CID-Crime, Ashish Bhatia, told reporters in Gandhinagar . Two persons, including Shailesh Bhatt's nephew Nikunj Bhatt and Dilip Kanani, were also arrested yesterday from Surat on charges of kidnapping and extorting bitcoins and cash at the builder's behest, he said. After the arrest, the sleuths recovered 152 bitcoins (Rs 8.58 crore), which were in Kanani's wallet, Bhatia said. Bhatt had earlier alleged that some Amreli policemen extorted \"bitcoins worth Rs 9 crore\" from him four months back. While probing his complaint, the CID officials learnt that Bhatt had extorted bitcoins worth crores from others before he was kidnapped by the Amreli police. \"Around two years back, one Satish Kumbhani of Surat floated a company called 'Bit Connect' and lured people like Bhatt to invest in it to get huge returns. Bhatt had invested Rs 2 crore in it. However, its promoters shut shop in January this year and went underground,\" said Bhatia. To recover his investment, Bhatt's accomplices first kidnapped Piyush Savalia by posing as Income Tax officials, as Savalia used to work for that company, he said. Savalia was confined in a farm house at gun-point for three days in January-end, the official said. \"On February 1, Bhatt's men kidnapped Dhaval Mavani at gun-point, as the latter was also attached with the bankrupt firm. Bhatt's accomplices forced Mavani to transfer 2,256 bitcoins worth Rs 131 crore into their account. The builder and his accomplices had also transferred another 166 bitcoins worth Rs 9.64 crore into their account,\" said Bhatia. To set Mavani free, Bhatt and his accomplices also extorted Rs 14.50 crore cash, which the builder received through the 'Angadia' service (an unofficial cash courier service), he said. \"Bhatt and his accomplices extorted bitcoins and cash worth a total of Rs 155.21 crore. Later, they distributed the bitcoins among themselves. Bhatt had kept around 700 bitcoins,\" the CID official said. Since Bhatt is not tech-ssavvy, he took help of his nephew Nikunj Bhatt to transfer these bitcoins, he said. The entire conspiracy was unearthed when Savalia was questioned by the CID recently, Bhatia said. Bhatt had even paid Rs 34.50 lakh to Savalia to keep mum and also to give a false statement that he was never kidnapped by the builder and his men, he said. While two persons, including Bhatt's nephew, have already been arrested on charges of kidnapping and extortion, a search is on for others, said Bhatia. The original case pertains to a complaint filed with the CID-Crime three months back by Shailesh Bhatt. Bhatt had alleged that Amreli policemen had kidnapped him, and his business partner Kirit Paladia, from Gandhinagar on February 9 and extorted bitcoins, which were in the possession of Paladia. Bhatt had alleged that former BJP MLA Nalian Kotadiya was also involved in this conspiracy of extorting bitcoins worth over Rs 9 crore. So far, Bhatt's business partner Paladia, Amreli Superintendent of Police Jagdish Patel, Amreli local Crime Branch inspector Anant Patel, two constables and a middleman have been arrested in the case. Seven constables of Amreli district police, allegedly involved in the case, are still on the run. Recently, a sessions court here had also issued arrest warrant against Nalin Kotadiya, who has been evading arrest ever since his involvement was surfaced during the probe. Bitcoin is a type of digital money that is issued and normally controlled by its developers and used and accepted among the members of the virtual community. The Centre has said it does not recognise bitcoin or any other crypto-currency as legal tender in India.

Ebang could not be immediately reached for comment.\nCanaan estimates it supplies a quarter of the world’s bitcoin blockchain computing power, according to a Reuters interview last month with co-chairman Jianping Kong, who also expects China’s push to promote its domestic chip industry to help drive growth for the company.\nEbang delisted from China’s National Equities Exchange and Quotations, also known as the New Third Board, this year after announcing in January that it would seek a Hong Kong listing.\nWhile many companies promote links to bitcoin and, more commonly, blockchain – the distributed ledger technology that underpins bitcoin – few that focus on the cryptocurrency have listed publicly.\nIn Australia, DigitalBTC went public via a backdoor listing in 2014 when it merged with Macro Energy, an investing group in a deal which raised A$9.1 million ($6.8 million). The company later changed its name to DigitalX ( DCC.AX ) and switched its focus from bitcoin to fintech software.\nAnother miner, Bitcoin Group, withdrew its Sydney listing plans in 2016 after the local regulator questioned whether it would have sufficient working capital to be a going concern.\nIn Canada, Leeta Gold, a mineral exploration company, renamed itself Hive Blockchain ( HIVE.V ) last summer and partnered with Hong Kong-based Genesis Mining on a bitcoin mining facility in Iceland. It has a market capitalization of $333 million.\nCanaan was valued at about $500 million in mid-2017 according to one source cited by IFR. The valuation for its IPO has yet to be set due to a lack of companies to compare it to and fluctuating prices of cryptocurrencies, IFR quoted sources as saying.\nCredit Suisse, CMB International, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are joint sponsors for Canaan’s float, IFR added.\nCredit Suisse and Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The other banks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBitcoin mining equipment makers make computers with special chips that mine the coins more efficiently than more mainstream chips made by companies such as Intel.

The amount of electricity used in mining bitcoins is a subject that has been debated for several years, says economist Alex de Vries, who studies bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. His study into the amount of energy being used to mine bitcoins is the first peer-reviewed research on the topic and was published in the scientific energy journal Joule. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were invented in 2008 by an anonymous computer programmer, and bitcoin mining refers to the work done by computers connected to the global Bitcoin network. We're not talking about just one or two computers, either, but thousands of them. According to the BBC , the computers solve complex mathematical problems that in turn, validate transactions between users of the cryptocurrency without the use of an intermediary. But in order to validate a transaction and prevent a duplication, a process known as “proof-of-work\" is required, and this entails using an army of computers, all working at the same time. OK, if you are still with me, the bitcoins are exchanged along a public digital ledger called the blockchain. It is in the blockchain where all the complicated mathematical calculations, called \"hashes\" are made. And anyone wishing to join in and help in verifying the transactions can do so. They are rewarded with bitcoins. Basically, it is a complicated process and a lot of hard work. De Vries estimates that globally, computers on the bitcoin network are crunching about 26 quintillion hashes — that's 26,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 — every second of every day, reports CBC Canada. The Estimated Number of Terahashes per Second (Trillions of Hashes per Second) Performed by the Bitcoin Network Source: Blockchain.info. Alex de Vries/Joule Use of electricity in bitcoin mining De Vries calculates that right now, the computers in the network, called \"miners,\" are consuming at least 2.5 gigawatts of power per year. However, by the end of this year, they will collectively be using three times that amount of electricity, or 7.5 gigawatts a year. “The main problem is that the energy consumption primarily relates to how agreement on the underlying blockchain is reached,” de Vries told Gizmodo. “Mining makes it a big competitive lottery where the winner—every 10 minutes—gets to create the next block for the blockchain. The built-in reward for this process is fixed, so it motivates participants to constantly add new machines to the network to get a bigger slice of the pie—the more computational power the more you win.” “Mining power is high and getting higher, thanks to a computational arms race, Roberto Frota Decourt, a cryptocurrency expert at the Unisinos Business School in Brazil who wasn’t involved in the new study, told Gizmodo. “The required number of zeros at the beginning of a hash is tweaked biweekly to adjust the difficulty of creating a block—and more zeros means more difficulty. The bitcoin algorithm adds these zeros in order to keep the rate at which blocks are added constant, at one new block every 10 minutes. The idea is to compensate for the mining hardware becoming more and more powerful.” Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency, as the system works based on the blockchain technology without a central bank or single administrator Lars Hagberg, AFP Bitcoin mining a vicious cycle Basically, the whole bitcoin mining process has turned into a vicious cycle of more computer use and more energy requirements. And the process of mining has turned into a game, except the winners only get half of what the reward should be. And as the hashing get harder, it takes even more computations to create a block. And on top of that, Decourt points out that the bitcoin block mining reward gets cut in half every 210,000 blocks, so it actually takes twice the amount of computing time and energy to make the same amount of bitcoins. Not everyone believes De Vries is accurate in his assumptions on the energy being used to produce bitcoins, primarily because he has not taken into consideration competing cryptocurrencies, also known as altcoins. There are other ways to build cryptocurrencies, and they are gaining in popularity. Called proof-of-research and proof-of-stake, these transactions create less energy intensive coins. And then there is the advancement in technologies that make the machines used for mining bitcoins more efficient.

(Photo: Dan Kitwood, Getty Images) CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE A crackdown on cryptocurrency-related scams is being coordinated by state regulators across the country, as con artists play up the popularity of Bitcoin. Various enforcement actions, including some taken in provinces of Canada, have included cease and desist orders involving companies with names like Cryptocashback, Cryptosecure, DasCoin, ThinkCoin, Ubcoin, Leverage and Krios. The North American Securities Administrators Association — a group of state securities regulators who work to protect investors — said Monday that 70 investigations have opened up relating to initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency programs. There are 35 pending and completed enforcement actions nationwide since the beginning of May. Millennials are viewed as potential targets, as are consumers who are embracing products related to financial technology, or fintech. Regulators said millennials are both most likely to use fintech products (84%) and most at risk of fraud relating to some fintech schemes (41%), according to a survey released by the North American Securities Administrators Association in February. ICOs and cryptocurrencies are viewed as high risks for fraud. Initial coin offerings are fund-raising programs that could be used to kick off a new cryptocurrency effort. But some of the ICOs can be nothing but frauds where con artists keep the cash. Even offerings that are legitimate should be viewed as highly risky. \"Not every ICO or cryptocurrency-related investment is fraudulent, but we urge investors to approach any initial coin offering or cryptocurrency-related investment product with extreme caution,\" said Joe Borg, president of the the North American Securities Administrators Association. Why are people ponying up money after repeated warnings about the dangers of ICOs? \"People are afraid to miss out on the latest and the greatest,\" Borg said in a press conference on Monday in Washington, D.C. Many times, retirees and others can fall for these schemes because they're trying to make up for lost time and rebuild underfunded nest eggs, said Borg, who is the Alabama Securities Commission Director. Some consumers who never recovered from the stock market crash in 2008-09 can be lured into sending money — even using digital currency — on nothing but the promise of quick, sizable returns. Regulators said \"Operation Cryptosweep\" has uncovered roughly 30,000 domain names relating to cryptotocurrency. Many were registered in the past year as the price of Bitcoin went bonkers. Bitcoin — which had been valued around $1,400 in early May 2017 — rose above $19,000 by December. Bitcoin has since dropped significantly in value to around $8,400 on May 21 but the buzz continues to build. In some cases, fraudulent websites have used photos of popular personalities. The Texas State Securities Board shut down one initial coin offering site in early May that regulators claim used photos of Jennifer Aniston and other celebrities as part of fake endorsements. Joe Rotunda, NASAA Enforcement Section vice chair and director of Enforcement for the Texas State Securities Board, said fraudsters often use false claims that a well-known public figure or a celebrity is associated with an initial offering as a way to encourage potential investors to send money. One fraudulent effort, he said, even used a photo of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to sell cryptocurrency.

Christopher Gerold, NASAA Enforcement section chair and New Jersey Securities bureau chief, said state regulators used some old-fashioned detective work, including undercover tactics, to try to address the proliferation of cryptocurrency schemes. Gerold said most, if not all, promoters do not have the proper licenses for selling such investments. Michigan consumers are encouraged to contact the state Securities and Commercial Licensing Bureau, which can run a registration check on any investment adviser, broker-dealer, professional, or product.

I believe it would be good if some Bitcoin developers have a \"POW change plan\" set up in case something happens.\nAny Ill conceived thing you can think of. Is being thought of as a scenario to be the one that comes out ahead in the end. Absolutely dont be naive! A plan needs to be in place and ready at a moments notice as to deter such thinking. Thats all\nBR\nPossibly implemented as such. If a geographical area has x amount of hash based on a percentage of the network. If after so many blocks your node exceeds this amount a hard fork countdown is initiated. Just a thought. Have to be over a range of blocks as to not have a lucky streak cause issue.

always submit the real link. Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy. News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies. Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted. No referral links in submissions. No compilations of free Bitcoin sites. Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion. Please avoid repetition — /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted. Aside from new merchant announcements, those interested in advertising to our audience should consider Reddit's self-serve advertising system . Do not post your Bitcoin address unless someone explicitly asks you to. Be aware that Twitter, etc. is full of impersonation.

The police have arrested Amreli Superintendent of Police Jagdish Patel while a former BJP legislator Nalin Kotadia is on the run.\nIn his complaint, Mr. Bhatt had alleged that some Amreli policemen extorted “bitcoins worth ₹9 crore” from him four months back when he was abducted and beaten by the cops.\n“While probing the case, we learnt that Mr Bhatt himself was an extortionist, as he had extorted bitcoins worth ₹155 from others before he himself became a victim when he was kidnapped by the Amreli police,” CID (Crime) chief Ashish Bhatia told reporters on Monday when he announced lodging of a new case to book the complainant and others.\n“Around two years ago, one Satish Kumbhani of Surat floated a company called Bit Connect and lured people like Bhatt to invest in it to get huge returns in a short time. Bhatt had invested ₹2 crore in it. However, its promoters shut shop in January this year and went underground,” said Mr. Bhatia.\nTo recover his investment, Mr. Bhatt’s accomplices first kidnapped Piyush Savalia by posing as Income Tax officials, as Mr. Savalia used to work for that company. Mr. Savalia was confined in a farm house at gun-point for three days in January-end.\n“On February 1, Bhatt's men kidnapped Dhaval Mavani at gun-point, as the latter was also attached with the bankrupt firm. Bhatt’s accomplices forced Mavani to transfer 2,256 bitcoins worth ₹131 crore into their account. The builder and his accomplices had also transferred another 166 bitcoins worth ₹9.64 crore into their account,” Mr. Bhatia said, sharing details of how Mr. Bhatt and his aides were running an underworld type extortion racket in Surat where people turned to virtual currencies to convert their black money during and after demonetisation.\nTo set Mr. Mavani free, Bhatt and his accomplices also extorted ₹14.50 crore cash, which the builder received through the ‘Angadia’ service (an unofficial cash courier service), he said.\n“Bhatt and his accomplices extorted bitcoins and cash worth a total of ₹155.21 crore. Later, they distributed the bitcoins among themselves. Bhatt had kept around 700 bitcoins,” the CID official said.\nSince Mr. Bhatt was not tech-ssavvy, he took the help of his nephew Nikunj Bhatt to transfer those bitcoins into his virtual wallet. The CID (crime) has arrested Nikunj.\nThe entire conspiracy was unearthed when Mr. Savalia was questioned by the CID recently after the arrest of Amreli SP and Police Inspector Anant Patel and Mr. Bhatt’s business partner Kirit Paladia.\nMr Bhatia added that the bitcoin extortion racket was set to get bigger as more people who invested in the hope of making quick bucks became victims of organised racket.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jagdish patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nalin kotadia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashish bhatia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shailesh bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gujarat criminal investigation department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ahmedabad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amreli", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T19:48:09.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d835105d94e70a06563c7a1e94623eef15834eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSuXqOfgp7DdyVPasFIgx6qIal8x4RhH8VoKZQQjNUTKt6aLaEFwlAMvlyt6fc2qk7HEvewWj0fYFbDEpy09BieMx4tnXLrfClvsP_Qko6Pylr_IyKTMGCANMwp9650rX0Mv.S.zk7WIHL3nolndsOYPy4T5Kng5tFPk7UnxzssqnQoU_ipD.snBG9ccT9KCCRnBgQ6.bzN_2sxpp3OSh54pLFcB5e6QatO6UsA9oTZs3_LYIbsBlW6jlp8lFeD8MT7x8a9LPBCHlkdzqtmkhj9.mHRE6YGRjQ-", "site_full": "globenewswire.com", "site": "globenewswire.com", "site_section": "http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/rss/keyword/?kw=AVIATION", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "investors_and_patents"], "section_title": "GlobeNewswire: Latest Articles", "title": "NuvusGro (NUVG) Introduces the Nuvus Mobile Mining Unit (MoMu) Utilizing its Grow.Droid Enterprise Technology – MoMu to Mine Bitcoin, Ether, BCH, and Altcoins", "title_full": "NuvusGro (NUVG) Introduces the Nuvus Mobile Mining Unit (MoMu) Utilizing its Grow.Droid Enterprise Technology – MoMu to Mine Bitcoin, Ether, BCH, and Altcoins", "published": "2018-05-21T19:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://globenewswire.com/Attachment/LogoDisplay/489374?filename=489374.jpg&size=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 31193, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d835105d94e70a06563c7a1e94623eef15834eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSuXqOfgp7DdyVPasFIgx6qIal8x4RhH8VoKZQQjNUTKt6aLaEFwlAMvlyt6fc2qk7HEvewWj0fYFbDEpy09BieMx4tnXLrfClvsP_Qko6Pylr_IyKTMGCANMwp9650rX0Mv.S.zk7WIHL3nolndsOYPy4T5Kng5tFPk7UnxzssqnQoU_ipD.snBG9ccT9KCCRnBgQ6.bzN_2sxpp3OSh54pLFcB5e6QatO6UsA9oTZs3_LYIbsBlW6jlp8lFeD8MT7x8a9LPBCHlkdzqtmkhj9.mHRE6YGRjQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-21T19:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "NuvusGro (NUVG) Introduces the Nuvus Mobile Mining Unit (MoMu) Utilizing its Grow.Droid Enterprise Technology – MoMu to Mine Bitcoin, Ether, BCH, and Altcoins", "text": "NuvusGro (NUVG) Introduces the Nuvus Mobile Mining Unit (MoMu) Utilizing its Grow.Droid Enterprise Technology – MoMu to Mine Bitcoin, Ether, BCH, and Altcoins May 21, 2018 08:30 ET | Source: Nuvus Gro\nSaint Petersburg, FL, May 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nNuvusGro Corp.

Those willing to lend a hand in verifying the transactions and building the blockchain are rewarded with bitcoins.\nIf it sounds complicated, that’s because it is. It’s also hard work.\nDe Vries estimates that globally, computers on the bitcoin network are currently crunching 26 quintillion hashes — that’s 26,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 — every second of every day.\nBitmain, by far the biggest player in the bitcoin world, has locations where tens of thousands of computers are mining at the same time.(Qilai Shen/Bloomberg)\nIt takes quite a bit of computational power to pull that off, and de Vries is among those taking a stab at figuring out just how much energy is used in conducting all that work, publishing his latest survey — the first peer-reviewed research on the topic — in the scientific energy journal Joule .\nBy his math, computers hashing for bitcoins — known as “miners” — are currently using at least 2.5 gigawatts of power per year, and are on track to collectively suck up more than three times that by the end of this year. That’s more than Ireland, Austria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and most Canadian provinces each use in a year. ‘It is growing fast’\nDe Vries also estimates the industry’s voracious appetite for juice has doubled in the past six months, possibly due to new interest in bitcoin — their price spiked to just under $20,000 each at the end of last year — but also because energy-consumption growth is baked in: the supply of undiscovered bitcoins is dwindling so it takes more work to find those left.\nIn the early days, it was comparatively easy to find a bitcoin, as there were fewer miners competing for the work. Mining could be done by hobbyists using personal computers. But as the digital currency’s popularity — and value — has skyrocketed, the increased complexity of the blockchain requires more energy and computing power to solve equations, and now there’s specialized computing farms mining for bitcoin.\nBy de Vries’ math, a single bitcoin transaction uses as much electricity as a typical Canadian home would consume in a month — and there are 200,000 transactions being processed each day.\n“Bitcoin has a big problem,” de Vries wrote. “And it is growing fast.”\nBut de Vries’ numbers and methodology are not without their critics. The economist comes up with his estimates by assuming most large-scale miners are using the most energy-efficient devices possible, then factors in how many machines are known to be in use and the cost of electricity where these machines are known to be clustered.\nHe admits he’s taking educated guesses, partly because many bitcoin miners operate in relative secrecy.\nResearcher and economist Alex de Vries has been charting his best guess at bitcoin’s electricity usage on Twitter at @DigiEconomist for more than a year now.(Alex de Vries)\nStanford University lecturer Jonathan Koomey says de Vries’ work makes far too many leaps of logic, which results in assumptions that are likely wildly out of step with reality.\n“We know there’s a lot of electricity used and we know there’s rapid growth,” Koomey said in an interview. “But nobody has been in these facilities and we don’t have information on the servers themselves.”\nThe 800-pound gorilla of the bitcoin world is a Chinese company called Bitmain , which has huge operations in Mongolia and remote parts of China. Bitmain is a fascinating player as the company both mines for bitcoin itself, but also sells mining equipment to others.\nTheir most efficient model, known as an Antminer S9, has the computational power of about a half-million PlayStation 3 gaming consoles, but uses as much wattage as a dishwasher in the process, according to de Vries.\nIt’s not hard to imagine how 20,000 of those devices — as one of Bitmain’s locations in Mongolia is believed to have — would net an eye-watering electricity bill.\nIndividual bitcoin-mining machines, such as these, have large demands for energy, partly because of the heat that they emit.(Glen Kugelstadt/CBC)\nIt’s also not hard to understand why many of the largest mining facilities are set up in cold-weather places with a steady supply of cheap power, such as Manitoba, Quebec and Iceland . “Rational agents would undertake mining while the marginal costs are lower,” de Vries said.\nWe still don’t know exactly how much power they’re using or how much they pay for it.\nDe Vries admits his work is only meant to be a starting off point for future research. “I think everyone agrees on the minimum energy consumption. But the future estimate? That’s actually quite debatable,” he said.\n“We don’t really have a common approach to getting to a future estimate of electricity consumption right now, which is why I am hoping to get this conversation started.”\nBut Koomey argues it’s classic scaremongering to worry about the electricity use of new technologies. Twenty years ago, he recalls that the media was full of stories about how internet usage was growing too rapidly , and reportedly destined to consume as much as half of all electricity in the world.\n“I’ve seen this happen over and over,” said Koomey. “That was bunk, [so] people shouldn’t jump to conclusions.”\n“To be clear, [bitcoin mining] is a big user of electricity and growing rapidly,” he said. “But we need to be careful to not to overhype the problem.”\nKoomey said he puts more stead in the work of Marc Bevand, another researcher who suggests de Vries is overestimating bitcoin’s power consumption, possibly by twice as much. ( Bevand has published a detailed criticism of de Vries’ work online. ) ‘Digital versions of Beanie Babies’\nRegardless of the electrical toll, some argue any amount of time and effort that is going into the mining of bitcoin is a fruitless folly.\nAndreas Park, a finance professor at the University of Toronto, likens the digital currency to a major fad of the 1990s.\n“Bitcoin, such as it is, has little-to-no use. So we are effectively using our planet’s resources to secure people’s digital versions of Beanie Babies,” he told CBC News in an email.\n“I am a fan of decentralization and blockchains, but I sincerely hope that we find mathematically and economically sound alternative approaches soon that replace this waste of resources.”\nPete Evans is the senior business writer for CBCNews.ca.

Redditors have thronged the thread trying to crack the code and win the prize. The post is currently one of the trending topics on the Bitcoin subreddit.\nDetails of the Puzzle The puzzle is an image with words, numbers, the Bitcoin logo, and other symbols. Within the image are possible clues. Most users on Reddit seem to believe the clues reveal the seed key or the private key of the Bitcoin wallet containing the 1 BTC prize. Others think that the solution is based on color while some think that the \"notdef glyph\" adjacent to the Bitcoin logo is of particular significance.\nAs part of the puzzle, the poster offered the following message:\nThis work is comprised of Satoshi Nakamoto's famous whitepaper words, scaled by Log N. Disparate ideas inspired Satoshi to create a solution to revolutionize modern socio-economics and industry. The work reflects on the elements that brought this technology to life and challenges the underlying security model. Hidden in plain sight lies something more: a treasure hunt. 1 BTC is concealed within the work.\nCryptogreetings also promised to provide helpful hints to that will help people solve the puzzle. So far, seven tips have been released. There are also consolation prizes to be won in addition to the 1 BTC prize. Cryptogreetings also provided the BTC address of the prize for authenticity.\nSo far, no one has been able to crack the code. Some people have put forward different approaches, but it appears nobody is any closer to solving the puzzle. The consensus on the Reddit thread is that the puzzle is especially difficult with one user joking that he/she was better equipped \"to sell a kidney for $9K\" than to solve the picture puzzle.\nCoded Art-themed Puzzles are Becoming a Bitcoin Trend Puzzles hidden in artwork predate the emergence of Bitcoin . Grand art masters of hallowed antiquity usually incorporated coded messages in their works, many of which remain unsolved today.\nFor a technology built on cryptography, it is not surprising to see coded crypto-themed artworks becoming a trend. Earlier in the year, a couple finally solved a three-year-old Bitcoin puzzle, claiming the 5 BTC prize that was worth $50,000 at the time.\nWill you attempt to solve the visual puzzle? Have you found any additional clues yet?

He is a partner of the blockchain technology group Vendibit, which focuses on software and hardware support for blockchain technologies.\n“I asked permission to use this location because I work here. What better place to set it up than here so that if a user required help with the machine, I’d be on-site to help,” says Neophytou.\nNeophytou’s business partner and director of Danish company Copencoin, Daniel Cappiello, tells Business Insider South Africa that the machine or VTM as he dubs it (‘V’ for virtual and/or Vendibit) allows people to buy cryptocurrencies in a safe way. “Safety is an issue around the world because if you buy something that you don’t quite understand, you are faced with potential risks or being taken advantage of by the seller,” he says.\nThe big downside of the machine is that it only allows for one-way transactions: you can’t withdraw cryptocurrency or cash from the VTM.

Each of these systems also have a database connected to it: Windows: Database is stored on your local computer. Dropbox: Database is stored on the Dropbox servers. Fedwire: Database is stored on the Fedwire servers. Cryptocurrencies essentially replace the US Dollars (or your local fiat currency) that you use to purchase these software services. The “database” that cryptocurrencies give you access to is based on blockchain technology. More on blockchain technology in the next section of this guide. But wait, what are the software services that you are getting? Isn’t a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin at https://bitcoin.org/en/ just a currency, like US Dollars? Not quite. The goal of cryptocurrencies is usually to improve on some type of existing software system or network. When you send money via PayPal, Fedwire or Western Union, you are basically sending fiat money electronically, similar to Bitcoin. However, that’s where the similarity ends. Platforms like PayPal have severe limitations on what you can and cannot do. For example, you cannot send/receive money from certain countries (like Nigeria). Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin want to make financial transactions more open and accessible to everyone around the world. Other cryptocurrencies solve other problems, which we will explore later in this guide. Is Cryptocurrency Real Money? Yes. Since this is a new concept to most people, it will take some time to become widely accepted.\nThis is where Bitcoin has been instrumental in paving the way for this new technology. Websites like Newegg at https://www.newegg.com/ take Bitcoin, along with the other traditional payment methods. Here’s what the checkout screen looked like after I added a drone to my cart. Payment processor Stripe at https://stripe.com/bitcoin also allows online merchants to accept Bitcoin. Notice that other coins like Ether or Litecoin are not accepted. However, the fact that Bitcoin is accepted, is a big step towards the adoption of other cryptocurrencies. Risks of Cryptocurrency Trading/Investing. Now that you understand the basics, what are the risks of trading these cryptocurrencies? There are quite a few, but here are the top three. 1. Some Technologies Will Fail. Remember that cryptocurrencies are basically software, created by people or companies. So just like Webvan or Pets.com in the dot-com bust, some of these technologies will fail. …and they will fail spectacularly. Right now, there is a lot of buzz around certain cryptocurrencies increasing several thousand percent, in a few months. This has a lot to do with ignorance and hype. Just like when people found out that this new thing called the “internet” would change the world of business . Did it change the world? Of course. But was there a lot of dumb money that overhyped the first wave of internet companies? Totally. So just remember, trading cryptocurrencies is kind of like trading a software stock. Some of the software will change the world.\nOthers will explode in a giant ball of fire. There are also a lot of scam coins out there, so be careful. Like penny stocks that are just a company on paper, almost anyone can create a new cryptocurrency. Learn how to separate the scams from the deeply under-priced currencies. Then use proper risk management and play the odds. 2. It Requires Technical Savvy. Let’s face it, cryptocurrencies were created by super nerds. Like with Linux, there is still quite a bit of technical know-how that is required. You don’t need to know how to code, but if you are “not good with computers” you may want to stay away from cryptocurrency trading, at least until they start building more user friendly interfaces. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not calling anyone dumb. I’m just saying that if you don’t possess a certain skillset, then you shouldn’t get involved in that area. This could cause you to lose a lot of money, very quickly. For example, I don’t know how to sew, so I don’t make my own clothes. If I did try to make my own clothes, everyone who meets me would think I’m a weirdo for wearing messed up pants. You get the picture. So if you aren’t so tech savvy, but still want to get involved, find someone you trust to trade for you. 3. There’s a Lot of Broker and Technology Risk. Since this is emerging technology, there are still a lot of unknowns with trading at scale and how brokers and the software will react to certain surprise events. If you think that Forex brokers are risky, then you should consider cryptocurrency brokers at least twice as risky. Not just because they could be shady, but there a still so many unknowns with the technology. However, I would still trust the bigger cryptocurrency exchanges over a lot of offshore binary options brokers. So the lesson is: Don’t keep too much of your coinage at the brokers. Move them off to your own wallet as soon as possible. I’ll get to wallets later in this guide.\nRead more about Bitcoin and The BitClub Network at https://mypr.co.za/beginners-guide-to-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-trading-part-1/ .\nFrom: Clyde Thorburn", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.newegg.com/", "https://stripe.com/bitcoin", "https://bitcoin.org/en/", "http://bitclub.network/clydethorburn"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hugh kimura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clyde thorburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cryptocurrency trading-part", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banking and financial services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto currency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub network company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitclub", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-21T23:32:14.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "13e598faa4eaf9a6b174fc6e659904b1201a08fc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQyz4R10Q_BbqR8_FHMPBKNyO_VUuyzfUO3KRLeli6sSa88_wXt1DNl2F0X570m0T1BWLgLGxlzBNVJforMeynsoO3aJs82PtjCQY.tQ35RFZoVw6_TZ_h4", "site_full": "newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://newszelerbitcoins.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoins", "title": "First U.S government agency begins to accept crypto as a payment.

"title": "How a Bitcoin is not a Dollar", "text": "February 4, 2018 How a Bitcoin is not a Dollar\nThere is no intrinsic value to a BitCoin because it is an anonymous IOU written by no one.\nI want you to give me half of your doughnut.\nI can offer to give you a signed IOU that says “Josh will give the holder of this IOU 1/2 doughnut”. The more you trust that I will actually honor the IOU, the more it is worth to you. You might even be able to trade that IOU to someone else for something that they have and you want… assuming they also think there is some chance that I will honor it.\nInstead of writing the IOU, now imagine that I write a program that generates random sequences of letters on my computer. I let that program run for a very, very long time until it happens to generate something like “IOU 1/2 doughnut”. I print this out and I offer to trade it to you for 1/2 your doughnut. YOU: So if I take this note, someday I can give it back to you and you'll give me something yummy? ME : Nope. This is not an IOU from me. It was randomly generated by a computer. YOU: So who owes me the 1/2 a doughnut? ME : No one! But it took the computer a really long time to generate this note at random! YOU: If there is no one who will pay me back, then why would I ever accept this note? ME : You can try to trade it to someone else for something they have and you want!\nA dollar is an IOU from the government, a BitCoin is an IOU from no one…\nEvery dollar starts its life when the US Government spends it or gives it away in a two-sided transaction. The government implicitly says “If you accept this dollar from me now, you can give it back to me at some later time in exchange for something of value.” The dollar represents a claim against the government. This claim is transferable, which is what makes the dollar into currency. But the currency value in the dollar depends on the expectation that the government will honor the claim. No matter how many times a dollar is transferred, it still maintains its claim against the government who created it, and the value of that claim is dependent on expectation that the government will be willing and able to honor that claim.\nEvery Bitcoin begins life when a lucky miner gets to add a one-sided transaction to the ledger. This is literally how it happens. When that miner spends his new BitCoin, there is no debt created. When you get that new BitCoin, you are not getting a claim against the miner who created it- you are not getting a claim against anyone or anything. Every single BitCoin in existence started as a single-sided book entry, so there is no counter party at all. See the difference? No matter how many times the BitCoin is transferred, it is still a single-sided book entry without intrinsic value.\nMining a BitCoin is quite literally doing busy work. The only thing you get as a result of doing the busy work is the ability to prove that you did it, and did it faster than all the other people who were doing exactly the same busy work. Really. Elenchus\nThe government creates dollars out of thin air. There is nothing backing them either.\nYes, the government can (and does) create as many dollars as it wants without limit, and each new dollar created does dilute the value of all existing dollars – but each new dollar does still have a claim. There is a difference between a diluted claim against someone and a claim against nothing & no one.\nThere is nothing stopping me from writing another IOU to Joe for 1/2 of his doughnut tomorrow, and that potentially decreases the value of the IOU I wrote to you today – but you still have the IOU that I gave you, and you can still at least try to get me to pay up someday.\nA BitCoin is not an IOU, it is a store of value.\nThere is nothing that you actually own when you own a BitCoin.\nThe best you can say is that you know a secret number (that you made up) that gives you the ability to request that an update be made to a long list of numbers that are kept on other peoples’ computers. There is nothing that compels those people to update their copy of the list when you request it, and they are even free to simply turn off their computers anytime they want to. You have no claim against the people who run those computers.\nBut a dollar is also just a number on a ledger, there is no guarantee that I will be able to collect on the claim it represents.\nThis is absolutely true. There is no guarantee that the government will honor the claims that the outstanding dollars represent, and the value of a dollar is dependent on the expected likelihood that the government can and will honor those claims. Don’t get me wrong, I am no dollar apologist – and I am not arguing that the government is credit worthy. But a dollar is fundamentally different than a BitCoin in that there is at least a counter party whose credit worthiness you are subject to. With BitCoin, there is no underlying counter party, no credit, no value.\nThe whole point of BitCoin is that there is no central issuer and that is what makes it so great.\nThe mechanics of issuance are not relevant.\nI could envision a distributed block chain ledger where any issuer could create a new unit of value and then transfer it to someone else. Each unit of value would specify the issuer and the terms of redemption. Any person who accepted that unit would be able to evaluate the credit worthiness of the issuer to determine the worth of the unit to them. The government could be one of many issuers on this decentralized ledger, but the dollars it issued will still potentially have value like they do in today’s centralized system.\nA BitCoin is ultimately a unit of value that is anonymous and comes without any redemption terms, so will is intrinsically worthless regardless of the topology of the of ledger used to track its ownership.\nJust like gold, BitCoin has intrinsic value in the effort it takes to mine.\nThere are some numbers that potentially have intrinsic value because they are hard to compute, but a BitCoin is not like that. The number that you use to be able to transfer your BitCoins (your private key) is a random number that effectively you make up. It is not interesting beyond the fact that you made it up and it is secret- it does not have any intrinsic value.\nBut to mine a BitCoin I must solve a very difficult math problem, so value of the solution to that problem is captured in the BitCoin created.\nThis is a widely believed misunderstanding of what a BitCoin is and how the system works.\nTo mine a BitCoin, you must solve a hard problem. But the BitCoin is not the solution to that problem. The solution is a number that, according to the rules of BitCoin, lets you ask other people to update their copies of the ledger with a single sided transaction that transfers a BitCoin into an account that you control.\nBut there is value in solving that hard problem that lets me request that other people update their ledgers.\nThe BitCoin mining problem is a (very hard) formula with one number as the input and one number as the output. You do not get to pick the input number. No one gets to pick the input number. The input number is determined by a combination of every BitCoin transaction that has ever happened, plus some new BitCoin transactions that may happen soon (if you are able to find the solution fast enough). It is essentially a random input. To mine a BitCoin, you must solve an essentially a random math problem.\nThere is no (intentional) intrinsic value to the problem you are solving when you mine a new BitCoin. If you were looking for interesting and valuable solutions to compute, you would almost certainly not pick any of the ones have been found as a result of BitCoin mining.\nBitCoin nonces are the garbage left over from an infinitely inefficient construction project that creates nothing but waste.\n(It would be nice if someone could find a way to retroactively use BitCoin nonces considering the monumental effort that goes into computing them. They might end up having some residual (and unintentional) value to someone, but not in any way captured by BitCoin users!)

Four Democrats are looking to run in the 45th district against current incumbent Republican Mimi Walters--including David Min (former SEC enforcement attorney and UC Irvine law professor); Brian Forde (former White House senior technology adviser and Bitcoin enthusiast); Kia Hamadanchy (former legislative assistant); and Katie Porter (also a UC Irvine law professor). According to reports , recent TV ads run by Min have attacked Forde over his support for Bitcoin, and specifically for receiving donations from such Bitcoin investors as Brock Pierce, who has deep ties to LA's technology community. Brian Forde has been an enthusiastic supporter of the technology industry in Orange County, quoting its strength in such companies like Broadcom and Blizzard Entertainment; he also was director of digital currency at MIT's Media Lab and an advisor in the Obama White House .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":
