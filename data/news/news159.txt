However, he draws interesting points over properties that make bitcoin fit into one category better over others.\nBurgt also shows historical evidence that suggests bitcoin is in a bubble, without saying firmly whether it is or not.\nBitcoin Price Chart Though the price volatility would be an obvious reason why bitcoin struggles as a real-world currency, Burgt looks more closely at the ways it is currently used in the market place alongside central banking structures.\nHis conclusion comes as no surprise: bitcoin is not traded for goods much at all. In additional to increasingly unfavorable global regulations, he says that bitcoin lacks a corresponding real value, which is a key part in exchange for goods.\nHe writes:\n“…the exchange rate between two currencies can be regarded as a broad measure of the prices of one country’s goods and services relative to another country. When looking at the Bitcoin ‘exchange rate,’ this category of determinants seems to be inapplicable – there is no current native Bitcoin economy with native Bitcoin prices for goods and services.”\nAs a security, bitcoin fares better in the current framework, though not great. Securities are either purchases of debt or stakes in a company. Bitcoin doesn’t fit into either of these categories since it does not generate interest, dividends or capital gains.\nAs a commodity and an oft-mentioned “store of value“, however, bitcoin behaves much like entrenched commodities like gold and oil, at least according to Burgt. Though he argues that bitcoin lacks intrinsic value, he points to mining as the key form of placing value on the asset — a value, he says, that approximates to roughly $1,800 per coin.\nHe writes:\n“Although Bitcoins do not possess any real intrinsic value, from a commodity valuation perspective, we can estimate a hypothetical value based on its production costs. Recent estimates regarding the energy involved in mining a single Bitcoin by professional energy-efficient mining rigs put it at about $1,800 when mined in China (where 80% of the currently mined Bitcoins originate).\nThe hypothetical value of $1,800 is far lower than bitcoin’s current price. Burgt only strikes the bubble fear home with a look at the stages of bitcoin’s FOMO and euphoria cycles that pattern previous bubbles in the market place (such as the 2007 financial crisis). In a unique development, however, Burgt mentions John McAfee’s $1 million bitcoin price target as a counterpoint.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock\nFollow us on Telegram.\nAdvertisement", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joost van der burgt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burgt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reserve bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T09:27:42.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "69094aebce1797876b700c388aca9ef37e943ed2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWnXQDFTSkTrmIE_EMGWAFUcapbhmbRj0fxDhPdscfoxbQSWpa.GliOLdLmKjYg93HSWtv1EE9AgcbCPyx4ENKeTLECeuTFCw-", "site_full": "mmo4me.com", "site": "mmo4me.com", "site_section": "https://mmo4me.com/forums/others.40/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Others | Kiếm Tiền Trên Mạng -

While cryptocurrency isn’t really Revolut’s focus point, it’s a good way to get started with cryptocurrencies.\nIf you have a Revolut account, you can now buy and hold Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash. Behind the scene, the startup has partnered with Bitstamp to process the transactions. Revolut currently charges a 1.5 percent fee for cryptocurrency transactions. There are currently 100,000 cryptocurrency transactions per day.\nCompared to a traditional cryptocurrency exchange, you can’t send or receive cryptocurrencies from your Revolut account. You don’t get a bitcoin address for instance. All you can do is buy tokens in the app. If you want to transfer those tokens somewhere else, you’ll have to sell them for USD, GBP, etc. and then buy cryptocurrencies on a traditional exchange using your fiat money.\nRecently, the startup also announced a new feature called Vaults . Revolut users can set up a vault to save money over time.\nYou can round up your spare change every time you make a transaction. For instance, if you pay $3.47 for that delicious ice cream, you’ll save 53 cents in your vault. You can also multiple that amount so that you save multiple times your spare change with each transaction. Many fintech startups also provide this feature.\nYou can also set up recurring payments to set aside a bit of money each day, each week or each month. Interestingly, you get to choose the currency of your vault. So it means that you can decide to buy ethers with spare change and weekly payments for instance. It’s a great way to hedge against the volatility of cryptocurrencies.\nUsers don’t earn interests on vaults. It’s just a way to set some money aside that doesn’t appear in your main Revolut account. You can decide to close your vault whenever you want.\nfrom TechCrunch https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/23/revolut-adds-ripple-and-bitcoin-cash-support/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fintech", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T09:13:20.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3c135fde65a6ee17c8e912d45eb2111a07ee2ae8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqamFnZri34dOrmvF4F7Riw9SNfHi7kmrI.voBN_gnVs8nYhXBpQ_zltKMSTCJ4YeYnHv2.MtlgGz0ThdTw3.RDbomilbu4.q_x", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Cryptocurrency news and discussions.", "title": "Bitcoin Gold Gets Hit With Double Spend Attack – Exchanges Loses $18.6 Million : CryptoCurrency", "title_full": "Bitcoin Gold Gets Hit With Double Spend Attack – Exchanges Loses $18.6 Million : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-24T09:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3c135fde65a6ee17c8e912d45eb2111a07ee2ae8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqamFnZri34dOrmvF4F7Riw9SNfHi7kmrI.voBN_gnVs8nYhXBpQ_zltKMSTCJ4YeYnHv2.MtlgGz0ThdTw3.RDbomilbu4.q_x", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "OsgoodSiimon", "published": "2018-05-24T09:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Gold Gets Hit With Double Spend Attack – Exchanges Loses $18.6 Million : CryptoCurrency", "text": "submitted by /u/OsgoodSiimon\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://e-commerceglobe.com/bitcoingoldattack"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T04:39:17.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b6356ac763d47b03419b526a5a2f73569eeb0ff7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNCkeRGMyOq3CO9RruBcYXUZFZwlkJ7skKu3Yn2acIc4HSlB.f5GGky7C9LEBM73MQw9vBmWGPCCJ6tN9SDEUZBs7oqfM__jHyiO0o4OYSVdYrkDUAK5Ncu73m0Wwq5eE1A--", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/news-btc", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "NewsBTC - Barchart.com", "title": "Bitcoin\\u2019s two-week sell off continued today,", "title_full": "Bitcoin\\u2019s two-week sell off continued today,", "published": "2018-05-24T09:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b6356ac763d47b03419b526a5a2f73569eeb0ff7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNCkeRGMyOq3CO9RruBcYXUZFZwlkJ7skKu3Yn2acIc4HSlB.f5GGky7C9LEBM73MQw9vBmWGPCCJ6tN9SDEUZBs7oqfM__jHyiO0o4OYSVdYrkDUAK5Ncu73m0Wwq5eE1A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Thomas Delahunty", "published": "2018-05-24T09:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin\\u2019s two-week sell off continued today,", "text": "Bitcoin\\u2019s two-week sell off continued today, seeing the coin fall to below $8,000 \\u2014 $7,500 at the time of writing \\u2014 and hitting levels not seen since mid-April. \\n Regulatory Moves Impact Bitcoin\\u2019s Price \\n And it\\u2019s not just Bitcoin, many other top cryptocurrencies were also in the red today despite bullish\\u00a0calls\\u00a0that coin prices would soar following major blockchain events in New York City that have been taking place over the past week. \\n Some in the cryptosphere have pointed to recent regulatory news as the key driver of the sell-off. This Monday, financial authorities in the U.S. and Canada\\u00a0announced\\u00a0a cooperative crackdown on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and other cryptocurrency investment schemes, led by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA). \\n More than 40 state and provincial watchdogs are participating in ‘Operation Cryptosweep,’ which has triggered at least 70 investigations so far . \\n \\n “This [Operation Cryptosweep] cleaned out a lot of the bad projects,” said CNBC’s Brian Kelly. “That has people a little concerned, and is a short-term hit to sentiment.” \\n \\n Moving forward though, Kelly points out that these regulatory steps are all part of the maturation that the market needs in order to attract institutional investors. “The projects that they shut down they appear to be junk, they had a real reason to shut them down,” he said. \\n This week’s crackdown from the NASAA comes amid growing attention from U.S regulators. Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) brought several fraud\\u00a0cases\\u00a0against operators of ICOs and also launched\\u00a0a website to help investors recognize ‘red flags’ when looking for cryptocurrency investment opportunities. \\n Tom Lee Predicts Rebound \\n Despite these recent price woes, Fundstrat\\u2019s Tom Lee still believes Bitcoin will reach $25,000. In an email to CNBC , Lee attributed today\\u2019s drop to ‘typical crypto volatility.’ He also identified three key factors that have him believing the coin will more than triple its current value moving forward. \\n The first is related to the cost of producing and replicating the cryptocurrency. When Bitcoin was trading at around $8,000 yesterday, Lee appeared on\\u00a0CNBC’s ‘Futures Now,’ where he expressed the belief that the digital currency was actually ‘trading at cost’ because the price of production was actually around that number. With this, it is likely Lee is referring to recent data from Morgan Stanley that puts the Bitcoin mining profitability at just over $8,000. This means that if miners want to turn a profit, the coin in theory has to stay above this number. \\n Lee\\u2019s second factor relates to the catalyst that institutional investors will bring to the cryptocurrency space. “I think institutional investors have gained a lot of interest, and they haven’t really come into crypto yet because there is still some regulatory uncertainty,” he said. \\n Lee’s third factor relates to data compiled by Fundstrat, which show a historical trend that has him encouraging investors to hold onto the coin. “Historically, 10 days comprise all the performance in any single year of bitcoin’s price,” he said. “If you just took out those 10 days, bitcoin’s down 25 percent a year.” \\n \\n Lee continued: “So as miserable as it feels holding bitcoin at $8,000, the move from $8,000 to $25,000 will happen in a handful of days.” \\n \\n \\n Featured image from Shutterstock. \\n\nThe post Regulatory Uncertainty Pushes Bitcoin Below $8,000, Tom Lee Predicts a $25,000 Return ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "north american securities administrators association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasaa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T01:19:25.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cf88199265eb16e2aa33dcd25a445827e5471e75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSkmXhZO_05BfXCl1ekjUholZFMzxxbaTC9l96OKhFieFl1hhCQTgRbPKT7Qb_vITp0jPs1K6p3IsM.q1ldq0aEmEeJOP7xiYk-", "site_full": "freeq.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://freeq.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Current price of Bitcoin is $7687.08 – FREEQ Crypto News", "title": "Current price of Bitcoin is $7687.08", "title_full": "Current price of Bitcoin is $7687.08", "published": "2018-05-24T09:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cf88199265eb16e2aa33dcd25a445827e5471e75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSkmXhZO_05BfXCl1ekjUholZFMzxxbaTC9l96OKhFieFl1hhCQTgRbPKT7Qb_vITp0jPs1K6p3IsM.q1ldq0aEmEeJOP7xiYk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FR33Q", "published": "2018-05-24T09:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Current price of Bitcoin is $7687.08", "text": "Current price of Bitcoin is $7687.08\nMay 24, 2018 at 08:00AM\nvia Chain", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T09:04:41.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eb1ddf03e64663aa2df4952754dda5c3555ce4a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTMhD8978_NP5ZLuoZLl_UM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=74.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Legal", "title": "why bitcoin illegal in asia?", "title_full": "why bitcoin illegal in asia?", "published": "2018-05-24T09:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.019, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eb1ddf03e64663aa2df4952754dda5c3555ce4a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmTMhD8978_NP5ZLuoZLl_UM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ruthbabe", "published": "2018-05-24T09:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "why bitcoin illegal in asia?", "text": "Quote: from: bs9 on August 27, 2017, 01:28:41 AM bitcoin illegal some asia country bt why?can you give me some reason about this?? thanks\nIt's because the governments of some of these countries think they're being used by terrorists and drug syndicates to transfer funds for their illegal activities.

Govt. is considering levying 18% GST on trade and usage of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoins and Ethereum in India.\nThis means that instead of banning cryptocurrencies, Indian Govt. will tax them.\nAnd this means, that instead of a banned activity, trading and mining of cryptocurrencies would be legal, and official.\nWelcome to the new age of cryptocurrencies in India! 18% GST On All Cryptocurrencies?\nBloomberg has shared a report, as per which Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs has proposed 18% GST on mining and trading of all digital currencies in India.\nThe proposal shall be shared with GST Council now, which will consider this during their next meeting.\nThe new proposal could be in response to a Delhi High Court order, wherein they had sought replies from the Govt. over the status of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies in India.\nBoth RBI and Ministry of Finance were sent notices by Delhi HC, over a plea asking them to clarify the issue.\nThe proposal to tax cryptocurrencies can be a massive game changer, especially after Income Tax Dept. raided crypto-exchanges , and Govt. was about to term cryptocurrencies as illegal . Taxation Of Cryptocurrencies: 6 Things You Should Know\nHere are the major highlights from the proposal by Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs over taxing cryptocurrencies: Cryptocurrencies can be categorized as intangible goods, such as software and services, which means 18% GST can be applied over them. Purchase of cryptocurrencies can be considered as a supply of goods, and related activities such as supply, transfer, storage, accounting of digital currencies can be considered as services. In case both buyers and sellers are in India, then the sale of cryptocurrency shall be considered as a supply of software. In case sale and purchase of cryptocurrency are taking place outside India, then it would be covered under Import and Export of Services, and thus, integrated GST on cross-border supplies would be applied . Taxing cryptocurrency deals can be enforced retrospectively from July 1st, 2017 when GST was officially launched in India. This means dealers and traders of cryptocurrency can be asked to pay taxes effective July 1st, 2017. Mining of cryptocurrencies would be considered as a supply of goods, as mining produces digital coins. Likewise, Wallets which facilitate storing of digital coins would be taxed as well, under GST under storage of goods.\nHowever, something issues are still ambiguous: For instance, the tax of 18% would be applied on the actual profits made in trading cryptocurrencies, or on the value of the investment.\nWill banks allow buying of cryptocurrencies once 18% GST is approved? HDFC Bank and others had recently banned any buying or selling cryptocurrencies.\nOnce GST Council takes up this issue, then more clarity can be achieved.\nWe will keep you updated, as we receive more details. \"18% GST On Bitcoins? 6 Things You Should Know About Taxation Of Cryptocurrencies!\" , 3 out of 5 based on 5 ratings.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "central board of indirect taxes and customs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delhi hc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delhi high court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of finance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gst council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T10:32:24.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "aad0fb4043179b2374adc5270bafc290811864fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisaGDq2UlHqrZpCpXL61UWvvcjFgSjAr1C2NsCvlotPnSOFbQRYxXKbE-", "site_full": "www.forexfactory.com", "site": "forexfactory.com", "site_section": "http://rss.forexfactory.net/forums/all.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FF All Forums", "title": "LaVoltage replies to: Testing Bitcoin Cryptocurrency on Dynamic Market Profile", "title_full": "LaVoltage replies to: Testing Bitcoin Cryptocurrency on Dynamic Market Profile", "published": "2018-05-24T08:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn-assets.forexfactory.net/images/misc/ff_fb_logo.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2596, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "aad0fb4043179b2374adc5270bafc290811864fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisaGDq2UlHqrZpCpXL61UWvvcjFgSjAr1C2NsCvlotPnSOFbQRYxXKbE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-24T08:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "LaVoltage replies to: Testing Bitcoin Cryptocurrency on Dynamic Market Profile", "text": "Disliked Right.

The elites may not have bitcoins ( Although I doubt that). but don't forget who has the bigger gun. Gun Dictates. if they want bitcoin to make it, they will let it happen. just like they let Mr New Elite become who he thinks he became. . lol I don't know its crazy stuffy. but im only looking at bitcoin and not other cryptos for one reason. and that is because an Israeli bank official stated that it was an asset, and thats when i started to really look at it as such and research.

We had mentioned yesterday that the support region around $7800 was under severe pressure and if and when there is a break through this region, we should see the bears back in control and that’s what we are seeing now. There are no specific reasons for the fall in prices, as the BTC prices lack fundamentals but we could say that the general risk off sentiment that is seen in the markets could also be one of the reasons.\nPrices Below $7800\nThe lack of fundamentals is also telling and the lack of momentum from the bulls could also be attributed to this fall. The prices have been trading near the support region for far too long and the investors and the traders, who are weak holders, have got tired of this loss of momentum and they were looking for the first opportunity to exit the market and once they saw that the prices began to fall slightly, they have taken the opportunity to sell off and push the prices even lower. Now, we are probably looking even further below for support which could once again come in the $6600 region but if and when the prices get there, we could be seeing some serious panic in the markets.\nThe ETH prices have also crashed lower and the prices are now trading below the $600 region as of this writing. Just as how the move higher in the prices was strong, we are seeing the move lower also being quite strong and this has led the markets to be under a lot of pressure of late. We believe that the market is likely to find some support in the $580 region but we have to see whether that would be enough to hold off the selling that we are seeing.\nForecast\nLooking ahead to the rest of the day, we could see the selling continue for the short term though some decent supports are nearby in both the BTC and ETH markets. We would wait to see a turnaround in the risk sentiment and if and when that happens, we could see the prices move up higher.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ethereum price forecast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T20:12:04.033+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "feb8e0eebeb52452e622290e276c16174e7629cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFrxEXIN.lGi.tgo9Xi7ifL0IdWBsPUHNrYSpSyZ.qDoojQ5.L.MXH09F8DI6Ldh70T2uBIIrj86gIMd.a.t362kkRAxtvJF_Yc-", "site_full": "gistafricah.com", "site": "gistafricah.com", "site_section": "http://gistafricah.com/en/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Gist Africah", "title": "South African kidnappers demand ransom in Bitcoins", "title_full": "South African kidnappers demand ransom in Bitcoins", "published": "2018-05-24T08:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://gistafricah.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180524_062316-660x330.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "feb8e0eebeb52452e622290e276c16174e7629cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFrxEXIN.lGi.tgo9Xi7ifL0IdWBsPUHNrYSpSyZ.qDoojQ5.L.MXH09F8DI6Ldh70T2uBIIrj86gIMd.a.t362kkRAxtvJF_Yc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gist Africah Media", "published": "2018-05-24T08:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "South African kidnappers demand ransom in Bitcoins", "text": "\nA criminal gang in South Africa that kidnapped a teenage boy on Sunday has demanded a ransom payment to release the boy – but in Bitcoin cryptocurrency of nearly $120,000, police said.\nThe gang dragged Katlego Marite, 13, into a car while playing with two friends near his home in Witbank, a town in in the eastern province of Mpumalanga, on Sunday afternoon, police spokesman Leonard Hlathi said.\n“They demanded that the family should deposit a sum of 15 bitcoins, not in rands,” he told news channel eNCA. “(The parents) don’t even know what these bitcoins are.

In it, Alex de Vries, a financial economist and blockchain specialist, carefully worked through a number of known data points — the number of bitcoin-mining computers made in the past year, the energy consumption of those computers and the minimum energy costs of cooling large facilities of tightly packed computers, among others — to arrive at an absolute lowest bound for the energy consumption of the bitcoin network today: 2.55 gigawatts, or a bit less than the energy consumption of Ireland.\nBy the end of 2018, de Vries calculated, based on data about ongoing bitcoin mining production, that number could rise to 7.67 gigawatts, or a bit less than the energy consumption of Austria. And that, he said in a statement, amounts to about 0.5 percent of the world’s energy consumption.\nThis is a problem for several reasons, environmental concerns among them. But de Vries showed that it represents a particular problem for the bitcoin miners themselves: It could soon be so expensive to mine bitcoin that the process simply stops being profitable.\nWhy is bitcoin sucking up all this energy? To understand that, you have to know a little about how the bitcoin network works.\nBitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency. That means there’s no central agency that records who owns what. Instead, bitcoin users rely on a shared, time-stamped digital record of their transactions. And maintaining that shared record, adding a “block” to it every 10 minutes or so, is the work of a competitive effort by thousands of computers all over the world. Those computers collectively perform quintillions of calculations per second, each “mining,” trying to solve a math problem that will give it the right to form the next block on the chain. And the winner every 10 minutes is rewarded with 12.5 bitcoins. That’s more than $100,000 at the coin’s current exchange rates.\nGiven those incentives, bitcoin miners have filled up warehouses with computers devoted to mining. Those computers, even the most efficient ones, need a significant amount of power to run. Certain details, like how many of these computers actually get made per year, or what tricks different mining operations use to keep them cool, are industry secrets. But de Vries worked around that secretiveness to find the data he needed for his calculation.\n“[This calculation] marks the first time that bitcoin miner production has been estimated with the help of upstream [chip] production numbers,” he wrote. “Given the ongoing secrecy of bitcoin miner manufacturers, this could prove to be a valuable addition to the toolkit for substantiating trends in bitcoin’s electricity consumption.”\nDe Vries also pointed out that when bitcoin mining becomes more costly than profitable, that doesn’t mean all the bitcoin miners will stop. Some miners, he pointed out, might steal electricity or otherwise figure out ways to mine bitcoin at no personal cost. For example, he said, one researcher mined $8,000 to $10,000 worth of bitcoin on a university supercomputer, costing the university about $150,000. Other, less-nefarious miners, he wrote, might keep mining for reasons like anonymity or libertarian ideology.\nStill, de Vries wrote, bitcoin’s potential to become so energy-hungry that it stops being profitable is a real threat to the network.\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alex de vries", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "joule", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T08:21:07.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9e10d49562d813b0c9bcfc2fdb989202a7a917c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUjzxvEowttD1Vvc2u_PWqY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=224.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation (Altcoins)", "title": "Will bitcoin be replace by ethereum/ripple", "title_full": "Will bitcoin be replace by ethereum/ripple", "published": "2018-05-24T08:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 8, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9e10d49562d813b0c9bcfc2fdb989202a7a917c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmUjzxvEowttD1Vvc2u_PWqY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "honglu69", "published": "2018-05-24T08:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Will bitcoin be replace by ethereum/ripple", "text": "Bitcoin is still the king of crypto and so far it has No 1 market cap for long period of time, for almost 10 years.

Yesterday's highlighted major bearish trend line with current resistance at $1,080 is intact on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is currently correcting higher towards the $1,050 and $1,080 resistance levels in the near term. Bitcoin cash price failed to recover and declined below $1,000 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD may correct higher, but upsides are likely to be limited.\nBitcoin Cash Price Decline There was a sharp increase in selling pressure from $1,150 in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price declined sharply and broke many supports such as $1,100 and $1,050. The decline was such that sellers succeeded in pushing the price below the $1,000 handle. BCH is now trading well below the $1,100 pivot level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nIt traded as low as $967.5 recently before buyers appeared. At the moment, the price is consolidating losses with a correction angle towards $1,100. An initial resistance is near the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,191 high to $967 low. More importantly, yesterday's highlighted major bearish trend line with current resistance at $1,080 is intact on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. The same trend line resistance is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,191 high to $967 low. Therefore, if the price corrects higher, it could face sellers near the $1,050 and $1,080 levels.\nLooking at the chart , the price is in a bearish trend with a decent support near $960-80. A break below the mentioned $960 support may open the doors for a push towards the $900 level.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is slowly recovering in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is moving higher and is currently 40.\nMajor Support Level – $980\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,080\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Jaw Dropped Below $1,000 appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "us dol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "key points bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T08:09:32.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bc81d0c9c5b7d703921d93cda762275d2b6284ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR__x4vRpGLZ_nFLp.JvD3bDn_BnFHP.oJH.97rmPQ_zLo8ESrWXnjxQAWCuli2OSzfC67_jrsRc9NOfO4a_K9d4fPbNatg95N3JljKJRVyCA--", "site_full": "kopitiambot.com", "site": "kopitiambot.com", "site_section": "https://kopitiambot.com/feed", "site_categories": ["tennis", "sports"], "section_title": "Kopitiam Bot", "title": "Revolut adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash support", "title_full": "Revolut adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash support", "published": "2018-05-24T08:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i2.wp.com/kopitiambot.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/httpstechcrunch.comwp-contentuploads201712in-conversation-with-tom-blomfield-monzo-valentin-stalf-n26-and-nikolay-storonsky-revolut0268.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bc81d0c9c5b7d703921d93cda762275d2b6284ee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR__x4vRpGLZ_nFLp.JvD3bDn_BnFHP.oJH.97rmPQ_zLo8ESrWXnjxQAWCuli2OSzfC67_jrsRc9NOfO4a_K9d4fPbNatg95N3JljKJRVyCA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kopitiambot", "published": "2018-05-24T08:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Revolut adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash support", "text": "(Source: techcrunch.com )\nFintech startup Revolut is adding Bitcoin Cash and Ripple to its cryptocurrency feature.

While cryptocurrency isn’t really Revolut’s focus point, it’s a good way to get started with cryptocurrencies.\nIf you have a Revolut account, you can now buy and hold Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash. Behind the scene, the startup has partnered with Bitstamp to process the transactions. Revolut currently charges a 1.5 percent fee for cryptocurrency transactions. There are currently 100,000 cryptocurrency transactions per day.\nCompared to a traditional cryptocurrency exchange, you can’t send or receive cryptocurrencies from your Revolut account. You don’t get a bitcoin address for instance. All you can do is buy tokens in the app. If you want to transfer those tokens somewhere else, you’ll have to sell them for USD, GBP, etc. and then buy cryptocurrencies on a traditional exchange using your fiat money.\nRecently, the startup also announced a new feature called Vaults . Revolut users can set up a vault to save money over time.\nYou can round up your spare change every time you make a transaction. For instance, if you pay $3.47 for that delicious ice cream, you’ll save 53 cents in your vault. You can also multiple that amount so that you save multiple times your spare change with each transaction. Many fintech startups also provide this feature.\nYou can also set up recurring payments to set aside a bit of money each day, each week or each month. Interestingly, you get to choose the currency of your vault. So it means that you can decide to buy ethers with spare change and weekly payments for instance. It’s a great way to hedge against the volatility of cryptocurrencies.\nUsers don’t earn interests on vaults. It’s just a way to set some money aside that doesn’t appear in your main Revolut account. You can decide to close your vault whenever you want.

For me it's still better to start your own business than depend your future in bitcoin investment.\nWhat do you think guys?\nYes that is exactly right. In our current days that people are getting knowledgeable and getting their selves to be aware that putting up investment into Bitcoin can somehow make their lives comfortable, they are now starting to rely their future into Bitcoin and other types of cryptocurrency that was literally the existing misconception that can be observed because they tend to put up all their assets into it without knowing that there are still instances and chances that the price of cryptocurrencies can turn out into a bad thing just what like we are experiencing right now. We must still keep our selves hand on tight into our assets and not just putting it all into crypto or a certain thing to keep ourselves in control because we can never know how or in what manner it will behave which can either be favorable for us or not.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T04:10:51.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dec8af11cda88d18b4d0b3e209199b3e11edce2f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTHYWoefGMsEE785EoiYmuwyUMaClYaOIbi4Uct0bHzywFxwJdR2J.IdrD.hSOGkNAZUUYfFJ0c.q.s_ERXT7vGeeCJ_rolQCwLY0lFvU.0LCv8RYj9Qu0WBmFBfLBwrLoLPlhWISOEww--", "site_full": "code4ppl.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://code4ppl.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Coingeek Conference 2018: Bitcoin Cash Innovation Shines in Hong Kong – Code4PPL", "title": "Coingeek Conference 2018: Bitcoin Cash Innovation Shines in Hong Kong", "title_full": "Coingeek Conference 2018: Bitcoin Cash Innovation Shines in Hong Kong", "published": "2018-05-24T07:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dec8af11cda88d18b4d0b3e209199b3e11edce2f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTHYWoefGMsEE785EoiYmuwyUMaClYaOIbi4Uct0bHzywFxwJdR2J.IdrD.hSOGkNAZUUYfFJ0c.q.s_ERXT7vGeeCJ_rolQCwLY0lFvU.0LCv8RYj9Qu0WBmFBfLBwrLoLPlhWISOEww--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "code4ppl", "published": "2018-05-24T07:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Coingeek Conference 2018: Bitcoin Cash Innovation Shines in Hong Kong", "text": "On May 18, 2018, the blockchain firm Coingeek hosted its inaugural Coingeek Conference held this year in Hong Kong. The event was filled with movers and shakers from the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) ecosystem, alongside hundreds of BCH supporters looking to change the way the world’s money works.\nCoingeek Conference 2018: Spreading the Word of Bitcoin Cash Adoption in Hong Kong Coingeek wrapped up its Bitcoin Cash-focused conference that aimed at spreading the message of the many benefits BCH has to offer. The event was held in Hong Kong, at the luxurious Four Seasons Hotel, and had a wide variety of industry innovators from company’s like Purse.io, Bitmain, Yours, Centbee, Handcash, Nchain, Lokad, Bitcoin.com, and more. Moreover, attendees listened to keynote presentations from Ryan X Charles , Jihan Wu, Dr. Craig Wright, Roger Ver , Joannes Vermorel, Vin Armani, Steven Bower, and Jimmy Nguyen among many special guests.\nLorien Gamaroff CEO of Centbee discusses better wallets and payment solutions. What consumers and merchants need for a Bitcoin Cash world. Bitcoin Cash Powering Online Commerce The event kicked off with Nchain’s Jimmy Nguyen who discussed the latest Nchain BCH-focused endeavor called ‘Bcommerce.’ Nguyen’s talk called ‘A Bcomm World: How Bitcoin Cash will Power the future of ‘Bcommerce,’ got the crowd fired up over how BCH proponents plan to spread mass adoption. The concept of Bcommerce aims to provide a global payment system on-chain, with low commission fees, and fast transactions. Nguyen details how the firm is researching and developing on-chain techniques for Bitcoin Cash, security improvements, better user interfaces and APIs, and most of all merchant adoption.\nCompared to Swift — It is Wonderful to Use Cryptocurrencies as a Payment Method After Nguyen’s speech on Bcommerce, the Coingeek crowd was greeted by the CEO of Bitmain Technologies Jihan Wu. Mr. Wu’s presentation called “The Future of Crypto Economy and Bitcoin Cash,” described how proponents can further bolster BCH adoption. Mr. Wu also discussed the subject of initial coin offerings (ICOs) likely in part because BCH may have the ability to produce colored coins soon. Mr. Wu detailed to the attendees that ICO’s have become a “buzzword” and some for the wrong reasons.\nBitmain Technologies CEO Jihan Wu talks about the future of the crypto economy and Bitcoin Cash. Furthermore, Mr. Wu said many ICOs are misleading and the cryptocurrency industry should “work closely with regulators instead of working closely with lawyers.” Moreover, Mr. Wu joined a panel with Bitcoin.com’s Roger Ver, and Nchain’s Dr. Craig Wright and explained how a giant tech company like Bitmain found significant flaws with the Swift banking system. As far as customers using digital assets for payments Mr. Wu thinks it is great and far more efficient than Swift.\n“It is very wonderful to use cryptocurrencies as a payment method — Basically our customers go to the banks and say they want to wire $1 million dollars to Bitmain and they can say no — You need to give them a reason, you need to give them a contract, and this and that,” explains Mr. Wu.\nBut with Bitcoin Cash you can wire the money as you wish as long as you control the private key — And the money arrives instantly and we can ship out the next day.\nBitcoin ABC’s Amaury Sechet: Working to Increase Scaling Further Following the discussion with Mr. Wu, the Coingeek crowd was greeted by the Lead developer of Bitcoin ABC, Amaury Sechet , who detailed his technical vision for a global payment system. Sechet explains how Bitcoin Cash is continuing towards the original roadmap that Satoshi Nakamoto laid out in his original white paper .\nBitcoin ABC’s lead developer, Amaury Sechet discusses continued BCH scaling. The developer continues by explaining how BCH can already handle Paypal scale volumes, and for cheap network fees. After the BCH developers completed a successful upgrade just a few days prior, Sechet reveals to the Coingeek audience that they are “working to increase scaling further.”\nBitcoin Cash follows the roadmap laid out in the original whitepaper. Purse is Launching a New Bitcoin Cash Implementation Called ‘Bcash’ Attendees at the inaugural Coingeek conference also heard from Nchain’s Dr. Craig Wright who talked about new ways to sell and trade goods with BCH in a presentation titled ‘Bitcoin’s Atomic Age.’ Participants heard from Centbee’s CEO Lorien Gamaroff and the exciting BCH wallet they are working on. Joannes Vermorel the founder of Lokad told the crowd about how proponents can overcome eCommerce hurdles with Bitcoin Cash.\nPurse.io announces native BCH support. Additionally, Coingeek attendees heard a panel on BCH use cases from industry leaders such as Alex Gut of Handcash , Vin Armani of Cointext , Angela Holowaychuk of Ncrypt , and Steven Bower from Purse.io .\nPurse.io also announced a new BCH implementation called ‘bcash.’ Bower told the crowd about a new Bitcoin Cash client that will be released shortly called ‘Bcash’ that’s similar to implementations like the ABC, BU, or XT clients. Alongside this, the crowd was pleased to hear Purse.io is using BCH for native support. Overall the spirit was high in Hong Kong at the 2018 Coingeek event, and everyone who attended was quite optimistic after the successful fork a few days ago.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steven bower", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lorien gamaroff ceo of centbee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centbee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger ver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "handcash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan x charles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig wright", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimmy nguyen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jihan wu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joannes vermorel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vin armani", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "coingeek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin cash innovation shines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lokad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong coingeek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nchain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T09:04:45.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c8e086fb126a9f78e11796347c05993462d069e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQoSSur60KTu9r28Hyoh2VigMUQ_fJsJ6S6RDYT39F8T6_Ga8hqtKIXsdqHaW4qhjf7f6HUQVUii980o0C9gINR4XZwvrt6jGL2ED5.SjrrGhcHjAaVTDs6PQFjI1Q48G4-", "site_full": "nclargegeek.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://nclargegeek.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Forget bitcoin.

A bullish divergence can be seen on stochastic, signaling a possible bounce back to the top. The Fibonacci retracement tool shows the nearby upside targets. Bitcoin price could be due for a bounce off the channel support back to the nearby Fibonacci retracement levels.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to indicate that the path of least resistance is to the downside. The gap between the moving averages is also widening to reflect strengthening bearish pressure. This signals that a break of support is still plausible.\nHowever, RSI is already indicating oversold conditions and may be ready to pull up. In that case, bitcoin price could retreat to the 38.2% Fib near the mid-channel area of interest around $7,900 or the 50% level at the 100 SMA dynamic inflection point. The 200 SMA lines up with the highest Fib at the $8,200 level and the channel resistance.\nStochastic has formed slightly higher lows while price made lower lows, creating a bullish divergence. This is another strong signal for a possible bounce.\nBTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin price continues to reel from profit-taking and the lack of positive industry updates. Even though the dollar lost some ground to its peers after the release of the FOMC meeting minutes for May, BTC/USD has carried on with the drop, presumably from negative remarks by Fed official Kashkari earlier on.\nIn addition, another report by the Fed signaled that bitcoin has a hypothetical value of just $1,800. Joost van der Burgt of the Federal Reserve of San Francisco wrote:\n\"…the exchange rate between two currencies can be regarded as a broad measure of the prices of one country's goods and services relative to another country. When looking at the Bitcoin 'exchange rate,' this category of determinants seems to be inapplicable – there is no current native Bitcoin economy with native Bitcoin prices for goods and services.\"\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Short-Term Bullish Divergence Seen? appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T07:29:55.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "308a8e18ec2925dea2a76a251d8feb8d57ec9fcd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYDgwkAe91crhMpudg8pah1f", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/biz/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/biz/ - Business &amp; Finance - 4chan", "title": "Honestly, you guys don't even know how big Bitcoin", "title_full": "/biz/ - Honestly, you guys don't even know how big Bitcoin - Business & Finance - 4chan", "published": "2018-05-24T07:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "308a8e18ec2925dea2a76a251d8feb8d57ec9fcd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pyGi8um52MYDgwkAe91crhMpudg8pah1f", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2018-05-24T07:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Honestly, you guys don't even know how big Bitcoin", "text": "Honestly, you guys don't even know how big Bitcoin will be.

While it’s unclear exactly how many bitcoin millionaires have been made, even after the recent price crash there are more than 12,000 addresses holding at least $1 million worth of bitcoin, according to the tracking site BitInfoCharts .\nVanech is part of an early wave of people trading in their houses for bitcoin. At the beginning of the year, Realtor.com counted 37 single-family homes across the country that were accepting payment in bitcoin — half of them were in Florida. (It’s unclear if they actually sold using the digital bucks.) Last fall, a home in Austin was bought with bitcoin for an undisclosed amount, and this spring, two condos in Manhattan were bought with bitcoin for around $800,000 and $1.5 million each.\nOne Florida listing agent told Curbed in March that he expects at least 25% of his sales to be made in cryptocurrency in five years. Now the trend has finally arrived in Connecticut.\n“As a realtor who relies on the broad scope of my ability to market a property, I thought, isn’t it time to offer something in crypto?” Vanech told BuzzFeed News. She said her brother got her into crypto and is advising her. She has enough faith that these nouveau riche want to spend their cryptocurrency earnings on luxury listings that she is forming a real estate company called Blockchain Homes.\nJust imagine: Here in this beautiful kitchen inside Vanech's Westport home, you can cook tuna whose journey was tracked on the blockchain . Totally worth 250 bitcoin.

Paul Newman lived there, and Martha Stewart (a hero to the blockchain community, I’m sure) lived there for a while.\nVanech said her Westport house has an \"innovative design\" she believes will appeal to the crypto community — though it has property taxes of about $19,000 per year, which presumably you have to pay in regular old US dollars.\nVanech is a realtor with Sotheby’s, which lists homes in multiple currencies but not bitcoin or crypto (there’s no option for that in Sotheby’s system). This means the website has it listed very inaccurately for $250, not bitcoin, which has led to some confusion. Vanech said that her fellow Sotheby’s agents have had mixed reactions: “Half of them are laughing at this and half are intrigued by the creative innovation for how to market this.”\nVanech said she isn’t worried the listing will attract some drug lord/bitcoin enthusiast trying to hide their ill-gotten money. “What I can say from my conversations with my real estate attorney is that there’s a way to do it that addresses all guidelines in Connecticut,” she told BuzzFeed News.\nIf a buyer paying in crypto doesn’t materialize (it’s unclear if you can get a mortgage in bitcoin), Vanech is willing to take offers in regular dollars. It’s only been on the market for less than a week, but she says she’s had dozens of inquiries. No offers yet.\nWant To Make Millions?

Unless the price stops the correction and closes above 8,553.20, the bearish bias will continue.\n Arief Makmur,", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "arief makmur", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T11:54:53.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "22b3e8c99bea723de1e45a7ada5e3281ddaf6db9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9mEfmTr4kCaN1lxvdM0H35iPJB1Kw0h1awOzSwsRrHMSfj5u.DGCNa", "site_full": "www.latestnigeriannews.com", "site": "latestnigeriannews.com", "site_section": "http://www.latestnigeriannews.com/feed//rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Latest Nigerian News Headlines", "title": "Kidnappers of South African boy demand ransom in bitcoin", "title_full": "Kidnappers of South African boy demand ransom in bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-24T07:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 36301, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "22b3e8c99bea723de1e45a7ada5e3281ddaf6db9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9mEfmTr4kCaN1lxvdM0H35iPJB1Kw0h1awOzSwsRrHMSfj5u.DGCNa", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-24T07:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kidnappers of South African boy demand ransom in bitcoin", "text": "Kidnappers of South African boy demand ransom in bitcoin Published by CNN on Thu, 24 May 2018 A South African gang who snatched a 13-year-old boy are demanding a ransom in bitcoin cryptocurrency, police say.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_africa/~3/TszFrPAQjQg/index.html"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T11:59:20.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1dc24953064e8577795f68b6cfe78154e3e62941", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21RyvQUmWB1AP9XyJLsmByAN8VIZuRfi4WjjlVwXHm4Zzj4himDv27Yc92mRH6oZn62BuV2_3akqDN3xjOwgklMv3bqbe9W.SCQSijWK81JTomYLSFYWWDjG", "site_full": "asian-americans.com", "site": "asian-americans.com", "site_section": "https://asian-americans.com/index.php?option=com_obrss&task=feed&id=2:asian-americans&format=feed&Itemid=121", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "Asian Americans", "title": "Revolut adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash support", "title_full": "Revolut adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash support", "published": "2018-05-24T07:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1dc24953064e8577795f68b6cfe78154e3e62941", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21RyvQUmWB1AP9XyJLsmByAN8VIZuRfi4WjjlVwXHm4Zzj4himDv27Yc92mRH6oZn62BuV2_3akqDN3xjOwgklMv3bqbe9W.SCQSijWK81JTomYLSFYWWDjG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-24T07:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Revolut adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash support", "text": "Revolut adds Ripple and Bitcoin Cash support Details Email\nFintech startup Revolut is adding Bitcoin Cash and Ripple to its cryptocurrency feature. While cryptocurrency isn’t really Revolut’s focus point, it’s a good way to get started with cryptocurrencies.\nIf you have a Revolut account, you can now buy and hold Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash. Behind the scene, the startup has partnered with Bitstamp to process the transactions. Revolut currently charges a 1.5 percent fee for cryptocurrency transactions. There are currently 100,000 cryptocurrency transactions per day.\nCompared to a traditional cryptocurrency exchange, you can’t send or receive cryptocurrencies from your Revolut account. You don’t get a bitcoin address for instance. All you can do is buy tokens in the app. If you want to transfer those tokens somewhere else, you’ll have to sell them for USD, GBP, etc. and then buy cryptocurrencies on a traditional exchange using your fiat money.\nRecently, the startup also announced a new feature called Vaults. Revolut users can set up a vault to save money over time.\nYou can round up your spare change every time you make a transaction. For instance, if you pay $3.47 for that delicious ice cream, you’ll save 53 cents in your vault. You can also multiple that amount so that you save multiple times your spare change with each transaction. Many fintech startups also provide this feature.\nYou can also set up recurring payments to set aside a bit of money each day, each week or each month. Interestingly, you get to choose the currency of your vault. So it means that you can decide to buy ethers with spare change and weekly payments for instance. It’s a great way to hedge against the volatility of cryptocurrencies.\nUsers don’t earn interests on vaults. It’s just a way to set some money aside that doesn’t appear in your main Revolut account. You can decide to close your vault whenever you want. http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/EXSrGQzLwlQ/", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/EXSrGQzLwlQ/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "details email fintech", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T12:48:11.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e22ee539be9e930a948d65e0d3d08fd1f974e86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdCLQWDzEggTNRQ2dvqUpBA-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Government and Bitcoin", "title_full": "Government and Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-24T07:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0e22ee539be9e930a948d65e0d3d08fd1f974e86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdCLQWDzEggTNRQ2dvqUpBA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "putriliesma", "published": "2018-05-24T07:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Government and Bitcoin", "text": "Many people do not know what btc and even investors who invest here have no idea what they are doing which is a big leak and misleading information and volatility that should be the main reason.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T13:37:34.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f9e42aa99bae955b5cc1143b22820d03aa5f0817", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ12d1OcfFtBcuQ7emRKcLGGxCty78vHBtCfgocIJdOR2uh4jmSUGe0jcPAkdm1ytU6gLVeauf4bzB6KycXlmzVYD3w9.oJ7byNtlCudxdh_.jZqrR99rOzal9yMGmREEo-", "site_full": "www.blacklistednews.com", "site": "blacklistednews.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/blacklistednews/hKxa", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BlackListed News", "title": "DOJ Launches Criminal Probe Into Bitcoin Price Manipulation", "title_full": "DOJ Launches Criminal Probe Into Bitcoin Price Manipulation", "published": "2018-05-24T07:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/bitcoin%20teaser%204.jpg?itok=4Qvv33aC", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 93026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f9e42aa99bae955b5cc1143b22820d03aa5f0817", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ12d1OcfFtBcuQ7emRKcLGGxCty78vHBtCfgocIJdOR2uh4jmSUGe0jcPAkdm1ytU6gLVeauf4bzB6KycXlmzVYD3w9.oJ7byNtlCudxdh_.jZqrR99rOzal9yMGmREEo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-24T07:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "DOJ Launches Criminal Probe Into Bitcoin Price Manipulation", "text": "DOJ Launches Criminal Probe Into Bitcoin Price Manipulation Published: May 24, 2018 Source: zero hedge\nAfter months of the SEC and the CFTC pursuing civil cases against individual initial coin offerings that had scammed investors out of millions, it looks like the Department of Justice is now ready to take the government's crackdown against bitcoin to the next level by chasing down allegations of market manipulation in bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies.\nAccording to Bloomberg , the DOJ has opened a criminal investigation into whether large bitcoin traders - so-called \"whales\" - are manipulating the price of bitcoin. Market manipulation has been an increasingly popular topic in crypto world - particularly since prices started their historic surge.\nLast summer, the SEC established the legal precedent that all digital tokens should be treated like legitimate securities and required them to be registered with the agency. Meanwhile, the CFTC, which is also working with the DOJ, declared bitcoin a commodity back in 2015, and is responsible for regulating bitcoin futures.\nInvestigators will likely look to bring charges against traders who engaged in spoofing - flooding the market with fake orders to push a price up or down depending on one's position. Another illicit tactic that the DOJ is looking into is called wash trading, which is also prevalent in equity and futures markets. Wash traders trade with themselves to create the illusion of volume in an otherwise illiquid market.\nThe probe is reportedly focusing on bitcoin and ether, according to Bloomberg's sources.\nThe investigation, which the people said is in its early stages, is the US's latest effort to crack down on an industry that was initially embraced by those who were distrustful of banks and government control over monetary policy.\nBut Bitcoin’s meteoric rise - it surged to almost $20,000 in 2017 after starting the year below $1,000 - has been a lure for mom-and-pop investors. That’s prompted regulators to grow concerned that people are jumping into cryptocurrencies without knowing the risks. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened dozens of investigations into initial coin offerings, in which companies sell digital tokens that can be redeemed for goods and services, due to suspicions that many are scams.\nCryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe, and many aren’t registered with the CFTC or SEC. As a derivatives watchdog, the CFTC doesn’t regulate what’s known as the spot market for digital tokens -- which is the trading of actual coins rather than futures linked to them. But if the agency finds fraud in spot markets, it does have authority to impose sanctions.\nGiven the pressure that the IRS has put on companies like Coinbase to turn over customer information, the DOJ investigation could also ensnare a few exchanges - particularly after the collapse of Mt Gox, the former Tokyo-based exchange has been liquidated after losing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its customers' bitcoin.\nAccording to Bloomberg , the limited oversight of the crypto market (the same reason given by the SEC for rejecting a proposed rule change that would've cleared the way for an ETF) makes it vulnerable to fraud. And exchanges are increasingly realizing that if manipulation isn't eliminated, or at least suppressed, that customers could start walking away from what they now believe to be a rigged market... then again, investors have stuck with stocks and bonds through every financial crisis in the history of modern, post-central bank \"capitalism.\"\nThe limited oversight of crypto trading makes it a target for crooks, said John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied manipulation, including in digital-coin markets. \"There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading,\" Griffin said. \"It would be easy to spoof this market.\"\nSigns are emerging that some crypto exchanges realize the industry’s growth could be constrained if large swaths of investors conclude that trading platforms have a “buyer beware” approach to oversight.\nThat said, good luck : determining who is manipulating prices and who has inside information would be next to impossible in the anonymous world of bitcoin, which is subject to different regulations in different markets. Japan and the Philippines have already developed their own legal framework for crypto markets.\nStudies have shown that 1,000 people own 40% of the bitcoin market. Given this naturally top-heavy concentration, it could be difficult for prosecutors to prove that there's anything illegal going on when the largest players step up to trade.\nIronically, most of the recent \"manipulation\" has been to the detriment of bulls: for example, when the Mt. Gox bankruptcy trustee who has earned the nickname \"the Tokyo Whale\" for his ability to crash prices while unloading massive quantities of bitcoin decides to sell tens of thousands of bitcoins in a single block - crashing the price - is he manipulating the market?\nBut that doesn't mean spoofing isn't happening. For years, the twitter user @bitfinexed (who has since switched his account to private) has documented the work of \"spoofy\" ( who was also profiled here ) - a nickname he used for a group of traders who would place, and then cancel, large orders on different exchanges. He has also highlighted other shady behavior, like the Bitfinexed tether token, which is supposed to allow crypto traders to go from cash to coin more quickly. But we imagine - particularly as more institutions become exposed to the bitcoin market - that the Feds will investigate every scrap of potentially nefarious activity in due time.\nMeanwhile, we imagine crypto enthusiasts will be less than delighted at this news, with accusations that the US is turning into China set to emerge as crypto doomsayers claim the US government is finally making its move against bitcoin.

However, he draws interesting points over properties that make bitcoin fit into one category better over others.\nBurgt also shows historical evidence that suggests bitcoin is in a bubble, without saying firmly whether it is or not.\n[…]\nThough the price volatility would be an obvious reason why bitcoin struggles as a real-world currency, Burgt looks more closely at the ways it is currently used in the market place alongside central banking structures.\nHis conclusion comes as no surprise: bitcoin is not traded for goods much at all. In additional to increasingly unfavorable global regulations , he says that bitcoin lacks a corresponding real value, which is a key part in exchange for goods.\nHe writes:\n“…the exchange rate between two currencies can be regarded as a broad measure of the prices of one country’s goods and services relative to another country. When looking at the Bitcoin ‘exchange rate,’ this category of determinants seems to be inapplicable – there is no current native Bitcoin economy with native Bitcoin prices for goods and services.”\nAs a security, bitcoin fares better in the current framework, though not great. Securities are either purchases of debt or stakes in a company. Bitcoin doesn’t fit into either of these categories since it does not generate interest, dividends or capital gains.\nAs a commodity and an oft-mentioned “ store of value “, however, bitcoin behaves much like entrenched commodities like gold and oil, at least according to Burgt. Though he argues that bitcoin lacks intrinsic value, he points to mining as the key form of placing value on the asset — a value, he says, that approximates to roughly $1,800 per coin.\n[…]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ccn.com/operation-crypto-sweep-us-and-canada-investigate-70-cryptocurrency-scams-sham-icos/", "https://www.ccn.com/peter-thiel-touts-bitcoin-as-digital-gold/", "https://www.frbsf.org/banking/publications/fintech-edge/2018/may/making-sense-of-bitcoin-price-levels/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joost van", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joost van der burgt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burgt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack mathis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T02:31:39.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fd4b0b00a7dcb0e49e52a4cf84d934514f0b2e10", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZPJ.KBRmebPpV1Ko0JDO8p7ke.eTgLrSL5oBCc8ckV6bEebqHHyS.aSBf_HL0ImDiaMVJ_ra9AhnSBwWBHxuFSAhVJa0Un.U8-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Jack Liao's scam Bitcoin Gold attacked, as much as 18 million dollars stolen from exchanges.", "title_full": "Jack Liao's scam Bitcoin Gold attacked, as much as 18 million dollars stolen from exchanges. : btc", "published": "2018-05-24T06:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.06, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fd4b0b00a7dcb0e49e52a4cf84d934514f0b2e10", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBZPJ.KBRmebPpV1Ko0JDO8p7ke.eTgLrSL5oBCc8ckV6bEebqHHyS.aSBf_HL0ImDiaMVJ_ra9AhnSBwWBHxuFSAhVJa0Un.U8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "rdar1999", "published": "2018-05-24T06:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Jack Liao's scam Bitcoin Gold attacked, as much as 18 million dollars stolen from exchanges.", "text": "submitted by /u/rdar1999\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-gold-hit-by-double-spend-attack-exchanges-lose-millions/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T02:21:17.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ac5f548def4df600eb00499b7793eec2b7c8f29c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaftt_3CGzWs_XmFf8lpNNk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "Is banking still important in the bitcoin era?", "title_full": "Is banking still important in the bitcoin era?", "published": "2018-05-24T06:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.144, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ac5f548def4df600eb00499b7793eec2b7c8f29c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaftt_3CGzWs_XmFf8lpNNk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kamilah147", "published": "2018-05-24T06:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is banking still important in the bitcoin era?", "text": "Quote: from: dwsgh on March 06, 2018, 04:37:39 AM Financial technologies such as bitcoin, P2P lending and crowdfunding are just beginning to take off, and businesses involved in the industry pose little immediate threat to traditional commercial banks.

On Monday, regulators in the U.S. and Canada announced \"Operation Crypto-Sweep,\" which is being led by the North American Securities Administrators Association and has more than 40 states and provinces participating.\nTo be clear, the crackdown is focused on cryptocurrency investment schemes, particularly initial coin offerings, or ICOs. It is not targeting major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC-USD) or legitimate businesses such as cryptocurrency exchanges. Even so, it seems to have the market on edge.\nThis comes on the heels of increased cryptocurrency scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), whose chairman has issued strongly worded warnings to cryptocurrency and ICO investors in recent months. A good thing?\nAs I've written before, cryptocurrency regulation isn't necessarily a bad thing . Rather, it is the uncertainty surrounding regulation that drives the market crazy.\nRegulation could be a good thing over the long term for cryptocurrencies. A regulated market would likely attract more institutional investors, and I don't think any legitimate cryptocurrency believer thinks that getting rid of scams is a bad thing for the industry. And, the implementation of global cryptocurrency regulation could help provide much-needed stability to the market, which could solve one of the biggest obstacles standing in the way of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption -- volatility.\nIn the meantime, however, it remains to be seen whether the current sell-off is nearing its end or if investor jitters will continue to send cryptocurrencies downward.\nMatt Frankel has no position in any cryptocurrencies mentioned.

On Monday, regulators in the U.S. and Canada announced \"Operation Crypto-Sweep,\" which is being led by the North American Securities Administrators Association and has more than 40 states and provinces participating.\nTo be clear, the crackdown is focused on cryptocurrency investment schemes, particularly initial coin offerings, or ICOs. It is not targeting major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC-USD) or legitimate businesses such as cryptocurrency exchanges. Even so, it seems to have the market on edge.\nThis comes on the heels of increased cryptocurrency scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), whose chairman has issued strongly worded warnings to cryptocurrency and ICO investors in recent months.\nA good thing? As I've written before, cryptocurrency regulation isn't necessarily a bad thing . Rather, it is the uncertainty surrounding regulation that drives the market crazy.\nRegulation could be a good thing over the long term for cryptocurrencies. A regulated market would likely attract more institutional investors, and I don't think any legitimate cryptocurrency believer thinks that getting rid of scams is a bad thing for the industry. And, the implementation of global cryptocurrency regulation could help provide much-needed stability to the market, which could solve one of the biggest obstacles standing in the way of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption -- volatility.\nIn the meantime, however, it remains to be seen whether the current sell-off is nearing its end or if investor jitters will continue to send cryptocurrencies downward.\nMore From The Motley Fool\n16 Cryptocurrency Facts You Should Know Experts Warned – The Crypto ‘Bloodbath’ Is Here How to Buy Bitcoin Matt Frankel has no position in any cryptocurrencies mentioned.

However, in the back of my head, I know that ten years is just too long of a time to foresee what will happen. I mean, as much as I want to believe for it to still be present and more effectively running by then, it may be replaced by another currency and investment concept within that time.

The Key development in here has been the decision of the large crypt exchange Coincheck to re-enter the Japanese market and to expand into the US. This is a good sign it is not likely really impact the prices too much now. The positive aspect is that it shows that the market is beginning to mature. It also shows that bigger money is entering the market as the traders and the investors become confident that the market is here to stay and that it would be wise for them to first regulate the market and pave the way for the entry of the really big participants, the institutional players. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at: 7,585.0049, -355.00, or -4.47% , a s of 4:00a BST, the market is open. This is an ongoing process and will delay the demand for the cryptocurrencies in the coming months and years and so we are seeing the volatility that we have been used to in this market is likely to become lesser and lesser in due course. Bitcoin 4-Hrs Candlestick Chart ETH prices fell below the $600 mark early Thursday in Europe, but there are no signals for panic now. The prices continue to consolidate and range, as in the rest of the market. We expect this to continue for the next month or so. We do not see any danger to the Bulls yet, and they continue to remain in control of the market as it looks to be an accumulation phase in the big picture of the cryptocurrency market.

The online travel agency is now accepting bitcoin cash (BCH), dash (DASH), and litecoin (LTC) payments for its offerings.\nThe three additions will strengthen the travel agency’s cryptocurrency community support hold that has been growing over the years. In 2013, CheapAir became the first travel agency to accept bitcoin (BTC) as a payment option for booking hotel rooms and Amtrak train seats.\nThe company, later on, added support for Dogecoin (DOGE) and Litecoin (LTC), on bitcoin sales surging to $1.5 million. CheapAir‘s support for cryptocurrencies payments has seen it cement its reputation when it comes to adoption of the new payment option.\nThe addition of new cryptocurrencies was triggered by growing customer demand for such payment options. The travel agency also added the new digital currencies to address the shortcomings of current currencies and the challenges that have come to be, with the usage of bitcoin.\nAdding support for other cryptocurrencies will seek to address the shortcomings of bitcoin. Network congestion and higher transaction fees have seen most people shun the popular cryptocurrency, with the focus now shifting to the likes of bitcoin cash and litecoin.
