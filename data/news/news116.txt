He explained :\nEvery major bank is trying to do something in the space. Either they’re going to be offering bitcoin to their clients, they’re working on a custody platform or they’re opening up a trading desk. A deeper institutionalization of bitcoin is overall positive.\nNevertheless, the dominant cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been hurting this month. After reaching highs of roughly $20,000 late last year, Bitcoin has fallen more than 50 percent in 2018 — and worries remain that the hemorrhaging is far from over. At the time of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $7,220.00, with some analysts fearing prices below $6,000 are likely on their way.\nStill, Bogart remains bullish on Bitcoin. He told CNBC:\nBut when I look out over the next year, two years, I mean the story is very much materializing. Could bitcoin trade lower? Certainly. But do I think it will be higher a year from now? Absolutely. Altcoins Are ‘Over-Promising and Under-Delivering’\nBogart’s bullish sentiment does not extend to altcoins, however. He told CNBC that the majority of cryptocurrencies available to trade are “over-promising and under-delivering,” adding:\nMeanwhile, you have a few [cryptocurrencies] that are kind of excelling at their use cases. Bitcoin being one of them.\nThe venture capitalist also told CNBC that he recommends selling fan favorites Cardano (ADA), TRON (TRX), IOTA, (MIOTA), and NEO (NEO). “A lot of those tokens are overvalued,” Bogart explained. “They could be go [sic] up significantly, but they also have significant headwind.”\nThe partner at Blockchain Capital is also cautious in regards to Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and dominant launchpad for initial coin offerings (ICOs). Bogart explained that the sheer amount of ICOs built on top of Ethereum is cause for concern, particularly if those ICOs don’t succeed.\nOn the other hand, Bogart recommends holding the other major players like Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and EOS (EOS) under current market conditions.\nDo you share Bogart’s belief that Bitcoin is still a strong buy? Do you think investors should be unloading their altcoins, or do you think such a move would be foolish at this point?

Cancel talks of a friend living in the city buying a machine to mine crypto and telling his son to run it round the clock. The result; USD 6 a day. The reporter tells of another friend who had to move his machine due to noise complaints. The most successful, Cancel reports, is a friend that has invested with his family purchasing three machines and is now clearing USD 1,000 a month, which in Caracas is a “small fortune”, he says.\nSo why are residents of Caracas going to these lengths to provide themselves with any kind of an income?\nUnder its controversial president, Nicolas Maduro, the country continues to struggle with a hyperinflation rate estimated at 2,400% at the end of 2017, which has skyrocketed to 18,000% in 2018. The crumbling economy is now causing a humanitarian crisis with 600,000 Venezuelans fleeing to neighboring Columbia alone.\nVenezuela’s crisis has steadily worsened as a result of lower oil prices, corruption, and a totally mismanaged socialist system, experiencing all but a total collapse of the economy, public services, security, and healthcare, writes the Independent.\nArmed gangs and Colombian guerrilla roam the beleaguered nation’s borders. Pro-government militias are terrorizing urban areas, while police stand accused of extrajudicial killings in a country which has now the dubious notoriety of being home to 10 of the world’s most dangerous cities, according to Igarape Institute, a Brazilian think tank which studies violence.\nBitcoin is now recognized as the only way of getting around the country’s currency controls, and bitcoin mining offers Venezuelans a chance to pay for good imported from overseas. Although the process is not sanctioned for individuals other than going through ‘official’ methods, residents are able to sidestep the government controls to buy foodstuffs from Florida and Miami by trading Bitcoin for bolivars, the local hyperinflated currency.\nCancel suggests that even the USD 6 a day his friend was mining is half decent money in the depression hit country, commenting:\n“One key to my mining pals’ success: electricity, while spotty, is basically free, the result of an odd combination of hyperinflation and government-mandated utility price freezes. (It’ll cost you 900,000 bolivars—or about USD 0.90 at the black-market rate—for a coffee, pastry, and juice at a cafe, but you can pay your monthly electricity, water, gas, internet and phone bills for about 300,000 bolivars.).”\nCancel maintains that for those residents who haven’t yet fled the borders to Columbia, its all about managing “somehow” to set up a steady flow of revenue in dollars or another foreign currency. “Human beings can adapt to anything” is a line he keeps hearing as his friends continue the daily struggle of life in Caracas.\n Venezuela Turns to Bitcoin Mining as Hyperinflation Reaches 18,000% 15", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://t.me/bconews", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-25/free-electricity-fuels-a-crypto-mining-boom-in-caracas", "https://bitcoinnews.com/venezuela-turns-to-bitcoin-mining-as-hyperinflation-reaches-18000/", "https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom", "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/maduro-reelection-venezuela-deteriorates-elections-south-america-a8355671.html", "https://bitcoinnews.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nicolas maduro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel cancel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caracas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T11:54:48.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f244cac479e8c6912d8fb3fad24cf4682e4c0c5b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWn9azwJ2uQ0InD7Ln9_qvMj9qysBHBQOr47bIuA12gEzz3ofL1yqg_tdvbTAoKu4FvNoXTuicd7mKgnOSJViVehbrs9QRs0kCm6iG0x5hQunIK_6MTmDb", "site_full": "jamieclawhorn.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://jamieclawhorn.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Is bitcoin a better buy than the FTSE 100? – Jamie Lawhorn's Blog", "title": "Is bitcoin a better buy than the FTSE 100?", "title_full": "Is bitcoin a better buy than the FTSE 100?", "published": "2018-05-28T11:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f244cac479e8c6912d8fb3fad24cf4682e4c0c5b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWn9azwJ2uQ0InD7Ln9_qvMj9qysBHBQOr47bIuA12gEzz3ofL1yqg_tdvbTAoKu4FvNoXTuicd7mKgnOSJViVehbrs9QRs0kCm6iG0x5hQunIK_6MTmDb", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jamie Lawhorn", "published": "2018-05-28T11:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is bitcoin a better buy than the FTSE 100?", "text": "\nThe FTSE 100 has a mixed record of creating value for investors. Over the past two decades, the UK’s leading index has struggled to break above 7,000, although it has smashed through this barrier in the past 12 months.\nPart of the reason why the index has powered higher since 2016 is the falling value of sterling. In dollar terms, the FTSE 100 is actually 11% below its five-year high.\nThe performance of the index is at the mercy of many different global trends. Global economic performance, the strength of sterling , trade wars and political battles have impacted, and will continue to impact, the performance of this global trade barometer.\nSo, does this mean bitcoin is a better buy?\nIs bitcoin a better buy? If you’re looking for a simple investment, bitcoin superficially stands out as a better buy than the FTSE 100.\nAs we have seen over the past two decades, the performance of the UK’s leading blue-chip index is highly correlated to global economic trends. It took years for the FTSE 100 to recover from the dotcom boom in the late 90s and it has only just recovered from the financial crisis. What’s more, recent performance has been driven more by Brexit (and depreciating sterling) than anything else.\nOn the other hand, bitcoin is easier to understand. The value of the cryptocurrency is built on its user base. The more users there are, the higher the value, and unlike the FTSE 100, its value is not dependent on global economic trends. Moreover, you can argue that as a decentralised asset, with no central bank in control of the currency and no risk of debasement through money printing, bitcoin is a safe haven asset that could help protect you against any future market meltdowns.\nSome drawbacks Yet while bitcoin does have some advantages over the FTSE 100, it also has some drawbacks. The biggest problem is the crypto asset’s lack of cash flow. Much like gold, as an investment, the only way you can make money from bitcoin is if the price rises. Meanwhile, it may cost you money to store it safely. The FTSE 100, on the other hand, currently supports a dividend yield of 3.8% backed up by cash flows from global businesses.\nI think this is the most significant differentiator between the two investments. Bitcoin might have similar qualities to a safe haven asset, but no one knows what the price of the cryptocurrency will do going forward. The same can be said for the FTSE 100, however, even if the index goes nowhere over the next 10 years, investors will still pocket a 3.8% dividend while they wait.\nWith this being the case, if I had to pick between the two, I believe the FTSE 100 is a better buy than bitcoin. However, this might not be the best outcome for everyone. Indeed, if you already have a substantial equity portfolio, and you’re looking for some diversification, bitcoin could be an interesting alternative to gold.\nGetting Rich Slowly\nIt’s easy to make a million by using a simple strategy such as tracking the FTSE 100 and letting your money work for you.

A clear example of this has been given by Spence Bogart, an expert in venture capital for startups of Blockchain, who has stated that the increase in cases of Bitcoin use is proof that the cryptocurrency is being institutionalized. In a interview granted to CNBC , Bogart said that Bitcoin continues to be an excellent option to invest in spite of the constant losses it has had in its value since it came to be listed at US $ 20,000 per unit in December 2017. He is also a partner of Blockchain Capital , considers that each entity of the financial world is doing the same to venture into the cryptocurrency sector in the hand of Bitcoin, either offering financial products based on this cryptocurrency to its customers, opening trading tables, or creating storage platforms for cryptocurrencies for institutional investors. Despite the recent regulatory measures taken by the Trump administration, where an investigation into the alleged manipulation of the cryptocurrency market was ordered through the Department of Justice, a fact that was followed by a fall in the prices of most of these assets Bogart said that Bitcoin is still an excellent purchase option. However, Bogart only showed a positive attitude towards Bitcoin, since according to him, the other altcoins seem more promising than they really are, even claiming that many current tokens are overvalued. In this sense, he said that Bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency that is worth buying, and he dared to predict that its value will reach US $ 10,000 by the end of this year.

A case-by-case analysis should be adopted. Decisions discussed: CE April 26 2018, n° 417809, 418031, 418032, 418033 In this decision, the French “ Conseil d’Etat ” recognizes that gains from bitcoin transfers may be taxed as capital gains on movable assets. This decision is groundbreaking in that it recognizes bitcoins as movable assets, and thus provides some answers to bitcoin holders whose gains had up to now been taxed as noncommercial gains or as industrial and commercial gains, depending on the frequency of these operations. Even though this decision seems to bring clarification to the situation, it appears that its application remains complex. The “ Conseil d’Etat ” specifies that “certain circumstances unique to the contemplated transfer” could imply that the gains issued may fall under other taxation provisions categories. In practice, gains from such transactions would be taxed as non-commercial gains if regarded as counterpart for the taxpayer’s contribution to the creation or operation of the bitcoin system. Moreover, if bitcoins were bought in the perspective of being resold, even if the transfer took the form of an exchange for another movable asset, the conditions for carrying on a commercial activity would be met and the gains would be taxed as industrial and commercial gains. Thus, this “ Conseil d’Etat ”’s decision opens a new taxation category possibility for gains from bitcoin transfers, but does not replace the two existent ones i.e. taxed as noncommercial gains or taxed as industrial and commercial gains. The scope of this decision must therefore be tempered as it does not secure the tax treatment of gains from bitcoin transfers and leaves an important role to circumstances.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T14:59:35.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f81d2f9d786769b414e6b992e965e356e9182ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjrDl7Vzcp4Xqk5ff4C5PImY7Icg4A3hAGTuOoZI43Pz90w7tVUQuOXPPCS9meskOsEcKekOFGjRAUH1JnTtZXcOAJiajxDfnAiEyKI.6d1A--", "site_full": "www.fool.co.uk", "site": "fool.co.uk", "site_section": "http://fool.co.uk//feed", "site_categories": ["investing", "finance"], "section_title": "The Motley Fool UK", "title": "Is bitcoin a better buy than the FTSE 100?", "title_full": "Is bitcoin a better buy than the FTSE 100?", "published": "2018-05-28T11:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://1gb82h2px4rr3s7tp94g0nt1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Bitcoin.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 45557, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f81d2f9d786769b414e6b992e965e356e9182ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQjrDl7Vzcp4Xqk5ff4C5PImY7Icg4A3hAGTuOoZI43Pz90w7tVUQuOXPPCS9meskOsEcKekOFGjRAUH1JnTtZXcOAJiajxDfnAiEyKI.6d1A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rupert Hargreaves", "published": "2018-05-28T11:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is bitcoin a better buy than the FTSE 100?", "text": "Rupert Hargreaves | Monday, 28th May, 2018 | More on: ^FTSE Image source: Getty Images.\nThe FTSE 100 has a mixed record of creating value for investors.

Over the past two decades, the UK’s leading index has struggled to break above 7,000, although it has smashed through this barrier in the past 12 months.\nPart of the reason why the index has powered higher since 2016 is the falling value of sterling. In dollar terms, the FTSE 100 is actually 11% below its five-year high.\nThe performance of the index is at the mercy of many different global trends. Global economic performance, the strength of sterling , trade wars and political battles have impacted, and will continue to impact, the performance of this global trade barometer.\nSo, does this mean bitcoin is a better buy? Is bitcoin a better buy?\nIf you’re looking for a simple investment, bitcoin superficially stands out as a better buy than the FTSE 100.\nAs we have seen over the past two decades, the performance of the UK’s leading blue-chip index is highly correlated to global economic trends. It took years for the FTSE 100 to recover from the dotcom boom in the late 90s and it has only just recovered from the financial crisis. What’s more, recent performance has been driven more by Brexit (and depreciating sterling) than anything else.\nOn the other hand, bitcoin is easier to understand. The value of the cryptocurrency is built on its user base. The more users there are, the higher the value, and unlike the FTSE 100, its value is not dependent on global economic trends. Moreover, you can argue that as a decentralised asset, with no central bank in control of the currency and no risk of debasement through money printing, bitcoin is a safe haven asset that could help protect you against any future market meltdowns. Some drawbacks\nYet while bitcoin does have some advantages over the FTSE 100, it also has some drawbacks. The biggest problem is the crypto asset’s lack of cash flow. Much like gold, as an investment, the only way you can make money from bitcoin is if the price rises. Meanwhile, it may cost you money to store it safely. The FTSE 100, on the other hand, currently supports a dividend yield of 3.8% backed up by cash flows from global businesses.\nI think this is the most significant differentiator between the two investments. Bitcoin might have similar qualities to a safe haven asset, but no one knows what the price of the cryptocurrency will do going forward. The same can be said for the FTSE 100, however, even if the index goes nowhere over the next 10 years, investors will still pocket a 3.8% dividend while they wait.\nWith this being the case, if I had to pick between the two, I believe the FTSE 100 is a better buy than bitcoin. However, this might not be the best outcome for everyone. Indeed, if you already have a substantial equity portfolio, and you’re looking for some diversification, bitcoin could be an interesting alternative to gold.\nGetting Rich Slowly\nIt's easy to make a million by using a simple strategy such as tracking the FTSE 100 and letting your money work for you. Unfortunately, most investors 'over-trade' and, as a result, their returns suffer significantly...\nTo help you avoid this key mistake, the Motley Fool has put together this free report entitled \"The Worst Mistakes Investors Make\" .

May 28, 2018 210\nAs Tron (TRX) steals the spotlight with its own MainNet launch on the 31st of May, EOS (EOS) is also preparing for its own launch MainNet on the 2nd of June and at 22:59:59 UTC time. The current countdown available online shows that we are less than a week from the launch.\nBack in Mid April, EOS managed to edge out Litecoin (LTC) from the number 5 spot according to coinmarketcap.com. This happened around the 11th of April, EOS jumped by 31% in value to trade at $8.76 and taking the number 5 spot from Litecoin. EOS has since held on to that position with a market capitalization lead over LTC that is now at $4.2 Billion.\nThe next contender for EOS on the list on coinmarketcap.com is Bitcoin Cash (BCH). The coin is holding on to the number 4 position with a market cap of $17.623 Billion at the moment of writing this. The gap between BCH and EOS is of a market cap worth $6.563 Billion. To catch up with BCH and edge the coin out of the number 4 spot, EOS will have to be valued at $20. EOS had reached this value and surpassed it on the 29th of April this year when it peaked at $21.46.\nBut many crypto-enthusiasts believe that EOS has its sights on a ‘bigger fish’ in the name of Ethereum. Many believe that EOS will be the Ethereum killer in terms of being the platform of choice for developers creating decentralized apps and even in terms of market capitalization. To note is that the Ethereum network has been hit by issues with regards to its security and scalability. The ETH network has been found to have over 34,000 vulnerable smart contracts with the most famous being the Parity incident that leftover $200 Million in ETH locked up indefinitely in a smart contract.\nThe Ethereum platform has also been recently clogged due to Crypto-kitties and other DApps such as Pepe the Farmer and Shrimp farming. The current backlog in transactions stands at over 27,000 in the Ethereum network and according to Etherscan.\nThis then gives EOS the chance to prove itself in terms of providing a secure and more scalable option to that of Ethereum. The current Technical Paper of EOS available states that EOS will be a new blockchain architecture designed to enable vertical and horizontal scaling of decentralized applications. This will solve the transactions per second issue seen in Ethereum. In terms of security, EOS has introduced a time-based security option where certain actions must wait a certain time before being executed.\nThe rest of the capabilities of EOS can be read on the whitepaper . Another option will be to wait for the MainNet launch on the 2nd of June that is sure to bring some action in terms of boosting the value of EOS in the markets.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Results show that a pedagogical framework like HPC is highly effective in increasing teacher agency, leadership skills and subject matter knowledge in the STEM disciplines.\nThe 37 teachers who participated in the studies used an overarching process of inquiry in an action learning approach. Teachers developed integrated term-long units of work in the four STEM disciplines and, when the Arts and Humanities were included, they became powerful STEAM learning sequences.\nAlmost 1,000 students in the teachers’ classrooms responded to what they were learning about electricity, greenhouses, sustainability, earthquakes, the solar system and Newton’s three laws of motion in rich and exciting ways. Innovative strategies and processes were common in all classrooms. They included students, for example, building farmbot-style prototypes, electric circuits and scaled garden beds to demonstrate their learning in STEM. Bitcoin in the classroom\nIn one Stage 2 classroom, students (aged eight and nine) were building a model using an engineering design process and their teacher also used Bitcoin to stimulate student interest in mathematics, which is possibly a first for a NSW primary school\nHowever, as reported a few months ago in an article in Bitcoin News (August 2017), Keiren Nolan, a teacher at Wooranna Park Primary School in Victoria (possibly the first in Australia), is enabling his students to explore cryptocurrency from a young age and his students have developed a school currency known as Wooranacoin. Ten things to Consider\nBefore teachers think more about the possibilities of Bitcoin in their primary school classroom, there are ten points they might want to consider: 1) What is Bitcoin?\nBitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. It was conceptualised by Satoshi Nakamoto but no one is sure if this is a person or a group of people acting under a pseudonym, with the latter being more likely. The white paper on Bitcoin was published in October 2008 and the Bitcoin software was released on the 9 th of January 2009. 2) What gives Bitcoin its value?\nBitcoin can be ‘mined’ by solving complex maths problems. Each time a Bitcoin is mined, the transaction is etched into the ‘blockchain’ (a continuously growing list of records – ‘blocks’ – that are linked and secured using cryptography) sent to the entire distributed ledger (network of participants). Subsequent maths problems become harder and harder to solve. In fact, the algorithms have become so complex to solve that it currently requires a warehouse of supercomputers working in unison day and night to solve them and mine one Bitcoin. The time and energy expelled in this mining process gives Bitcoin its inherent value. 3) Bitcoin is beside the point\nNow who Satoshi is and whether his white paper is all a hoax is beside the point. The real value lies in the concept of the blockchain that people have now started to embrace and adapt into different aspects of life. 4) Bitcoin is more than just a currency\nEven if digital currency never really takes the place of flat money, the blockchain technology underlying it is changing the way people do transactions and contracts. In the future, musicians might attach their music to a ‘smart contract’. Each time their song is downloaded, people will automatically be charged a fee, eliminating pirating, middle operators and ensuring that these artists are no longer getting ripped off. 5) Smart contracts on the blockchain will revolutionise the way people interact\nSmart contracts are a revolutionary way of thinking about contracts. Instead of entrusting a central body to manage transactional information, such as a bank, trust is instead distributed throughout the entire blockchain, making it much harder to tamper with. Information about a transaction must be changed on each and every block on the blockchain and 100s or 1000s or millions of people verify the information at any given time in order to discredit a transaction. 6) Bitcoin in the classroom\nThe mathematical element of Bitcoin lends itself quite well to the classroom and a lot of fun can be had getting creative with this. Students can battle it out solving math problems and collect Bitcoin as rewards. Any Bitcoin collected can be updated and recorded on each student’s ledger, which is replicated identically and distributed throughout the classroom. The class is essentially the blockchain. 7) The future will involve being immersed in the blockchain\nThis is why it is an essential part of good financial literacy. Understanding how the blockchain works will prepare school-aged students for a very different financial landscape than the current one. Many of the next generation of entrepreneurial endeavours will centre on blockchain-related business models and businesses that incorporate blockchain-related applications. 8) Integrated learning through the blockchain\nThe blockchain can be replicated in the classroom. In fact, it is the perfect place to replicate the blockchain. This is achieved through integration of learning areas such as drama, mathematics and science – the distributed ledger system can be replicated in fun, engaging and relevant ways in primary school classrooms. 9) The possibilities for Bitcoin are endless\nBitcoin is only the start. There are lots of other cryptocurrencies in the form of coins and tokens being created by start-ups and companies around the globe right now. In the not too distant future, there may even be opportunities where each coin specialises in a particular transaction. For example, one particular coin may specialise in real estate transactions such as registering property, while another may facilitate transactions of energy stored and sold to the grid via solar panels in a home. 10) Automation of the workforce\nMany future jobs will be automated. For example, in the legal world, conveyancing may become completely automated. In this instance, conveyancing functions can be written into computer programs which use smart contracts to confirm transactions with the entire blockchain on a distributed ledger system. A good understanding of blockchain technology, distributed trust and the ledger system will contribute towards future-focused learning and support the preparation of students to take their place as active global citizens.

First, Blockchain systems offering a distributed billing infrastructure, such as Corda and Ripple, that can be used to process payments by banks. Second, Blockchain platforms that provide smart contract functionality, such as Ethereum and Hyperledger.\nSkorobogatova has already talked about Blockchain as a revolutionary technology that you definitely need to invest in, while stressing that understanding the risks involved and how to manage it is essential for the main financial sector. A fully controlled integration would require from seven to ten years, according to her estimates from June last year.\nThis week, it was also announced that the first officially regulated ICO in the country will be tested using the newly created regulation of the Russian Central Bank, and the main investor Sberbank, being the main investor of this project, will be state-owned. Also this week, the Russian parliament approved the first of three new regulations regulating the crypto and blockchain industries, which define both cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrencies as a property.\nLet's now take a look at the Bitcoin technical picture at the H4 time frame. The market has made a new lower low at the level of $7,000, but the pattern that is unfolding now looks like a Falling Wedge, which means, there are high chances for a temporary pull-back towards the level of weekly pivot at $7,582 or even $7,712. Moreover, there is a positive divergence forming between the price and the momentum oscillator, which supports the temporary bullish outlook.\n*The market analysis posted here is meant to increase your awareness, but not to give instructions to make a trade.

Such is the case for Bitcoin Cash, a major Cryptocurrency that has taken almost a 10% dip in its value over the past week. This comes as a surprise to many, as Bitcoin Cash got featured on a news segment on CNBC recently, which was expected to improve Bitcoin Cash’s position.\nCurrently, Bitcoin Cash is placed in rank 4, according to coin market cap, with a market cap of $17,850,964,631 USD at the time of writing with a circulating supply of 17143125 BCH tokens. Currently, Bitcoin Cash has declined further with a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.160 (taken from the data feed of Kraken). As of 23/05/2018, Bitcoin Cash is valued at $1.040.10 following two massive dips from a high of $1,301.55 on 21st May to $1,233.70 USD on May 22 nd . As mentioned before, this comes as a surprise to many, as the global cryptocurrency market fared much better comparatively, losing only 5.7% of its value compared to Bitcoin Cash’s 10%. Analysts are still not convinced about the exact factors responsible for this.\nBitcoin Cash in the News Last Week\nMany High profile Crypto-personalities have shown their distrust towards Bitcoin Cash following its erratic behavior. Co-founder and CEO of CryptoCompare, Charles Hayter has called it “all standard noise”, while Jeff Koyen, CEO of 360 Blockchain USA called it one of the most controversial coins in the crypto space, second to Ripple. Marshal Swatt of Swatt Exchange, however, has predicted that the decline of Bitcoin Cash may be attributed to the recent Bitcoin Cash miners meet, where a proposal for rewarding developers have been discussed. Many other market influencers have also been discouraging traders and adding to the negative sentiment around the coin, which caused even further decline.\nCNBC’s Bitcoin Cash Feature\nOn 22nd May, cryptocurrencies were once again featured on CNBC’s Fast Money, with Bitcoin Cash being the focus this week. Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM LLC was asked to give a detailed analysis of why he has a bullish stance on Bitcoin Cash. Kelly described to his audiences what he called “catalyst factors” which are the main driving force behind a digital asset. Among the factors he mentioned was the aforementioned mining community meet, citing that this latest development would a value booster. In an unexpected turn of events, however, the segment generated a lot of negative sentiment inside the crypto-community, with many accusing CNBC of “shilling” the currency and suspected collaboration. Many analysts think that the negative backlash from this segment further negatively affected Bitcoin Cash’s value over the weekend.\nFinal Thoughts\nLike with most cryptocurrencies, nothing can be predicted with certainty about future price movements. As Mr. Kelly put it, it all boils down to how the market behaves. Indeed past trends have indicated a similar fate for Bitcoin Cash. Experts noted that the situation is very similar to the incredible highs experienced by most cryptocurrencies in late 2017, followed by a massive price slump at the beginning of the year.\nIn spite of the hurdles faced by Bitcoin Cash at the moment, it is to be noted that Bitcoin Cash has succeeded in the past where many other digital currencies failed. Bitcoin Cash is probably one of the handful of Bitcoin forks that have gained widespread attention and usage. This can be evidenced by Bitcoin Cash’s performance since its launch back in August 2017. According to coin market cap, Bitcoin Cash has held its position in the top ten cryptocurrencies despite price slumps and market movements. Thus, even though situations look bleak presently, the coin is expected to once again rise in value and regain some of its former glory.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Cash Red Again Bitcoin Cash slipped by 0.99% on Sunday, following Saturday’s 0.78% fall, to end the week down 23% at $995.2, with the sub-$1,000 close only the 2 nd since late April. Saturday’s late in the day reversal continued through to the early hours of Sunday morning, with Bitcoin Cash falling through the day’s first major support level at $985.5 to an intraday low $969.5, calling on support at the second major support level at $966.6 before recovering to $1,000 levels by the middle of the day. Bitcoin Cash failed to break through the $1,020 level needed to support a run at key resistance levels, with an intraday high $1,010.8 falling short of the day’s first major resistance level at $1,036.6 and well short of the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $1,155.6, supporting the extended bearish trend formed in early May. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash was down 5.04% to $945.1, as the bears took a firmer grip following last week’s slide and a failed attempt at a weekend rally on Saturday. The start of the day slide to the morning’s low and current $945.1 pulled Bitcoin Cash through the first major support level at $972.87 and second major support level at $950.53 with ease, the market reversal gathering pace as investors begin accept the reality of a more material pullback to sub-$700 levels before a likely bearish trend reversal kicks in. For the day ahead, while it’s looking quite dire for Bitcoin Cash, a recovery to $970 would support a run at $1,000 levels and the day’s first major support level at $1,014.17, such a rebound bucking recent trends, with Bitcoin Cash having been unable to reverse extended intraday losses of late. Failure to move back through to $970 levels will likely see heavier losses through the morning, Bitcoin Cash needing to hold on to $940 levels and steady the ship. The acceleration this morning will likely bring the day’s third major support level at $909.23 into play, with sub-$900 levels likely to be seen. BCH/USD 28/05/18 4-Hourly Chart Get Into Bitcoin Cash Trading Today Litecoin Bulls Let Go Litecoin slipped by 0.41% on Sunday, following Saturday’s 0.61% fall, to end the weekend down 15.5% to $117.84. Moves through the early part of the day followed the broader market, with Saturday’s late sell-off continuing into Sunday morning, Litecoin falling to an intraday low $116.51 to call on support at the day’s first major support level at $116.34. An afternoon recovery to an intraday high $118.98 saw Litecoin fall short of the $120 levels and the day’s first major support level at $119.04, leading to a pullback to $117 levels by the day’s end, leaving Litecoin in the hands of the bears. At the time of writing, Litecoin was down 3.5% to $113.71, with a sell-off in the early hours seeing Litecoin slide through the day’s first major support level at $116.57 and second major support level at $115.31 to call on support at the day’s third major support level at $112.84, with an intraday low and new swing lo $112.5. A partial recovery to $113 levels will ease the pain, though the persistently bearish sentiment across the market could see Litecoin face heavier losses later in the day. For the day ahead, a move back through the day’s second major support level at $115.31 would support a run at $117 levels and a possible return to positive territory, though we would expect the day’s first major resistance level at $119.04 to be left untested through the day, with any hopes of a run at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $130.98 dashed for yet another day. Story Continues Failure to move back through to $117 levels will bring sub-$100 support levels into play for the first time since 2 nd February’s $100.2 low, Litecoin having last sat at sub-$100 levels prior to the December rally that led to an all-time high 420. It’s a bad start to the week and things could well get worse before they get better. LTC/USD 28/05/18 4-Hourly Chart Buy & Sell Cryptocurrency Instantly Ripple Stumbles Ripple’s XRP fell by 1.09% on Sunday, following Saturday’s 0.01% gain, to end the weekend down 13.93% to $0.60127. An early morning fall set the tone for the day, with Ripple’s XRP falling to an intraday low $0.59434 by mid-morning, before recovering to $0.60 levels, in what was a relatively range bound day, the day’s highs and lows avoiding the major support and resistance levels to leave the extended bearish trend intact. The good news for Ripple investors would have been the hold at $0.60 levels by the day’s end, but with the bears in firm control, heavier losses are certainly expected as the market prepares for the introduction of regulatory oversight in the summer. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was down 4.64% to $0.57477, with a broad based market sell-off seeing Ripple’s XRP fall through the day’s first major support level at $0.5924 and second major support level at $0.5836 to an intraday low $0.57136 before steadying. With the bears taking control at the start of the week, Ripple’s XRP will need to move back through the day’s first major support level at $0.5924 to see a recovery to $0.60 levels and bring the day’s first major resistance level at $0.6120 into play. The path of least resistance is likely to be downwards however, with a failure to break through to $0.58 levels in the early part of the day likely to bring the day’s third major support level at $0.564 into play. As investors will have seen this morning, support levels provide little comfort in mass sell-offs and the market will need to see conditions stabilize this morning before making any moves, Ripple’s XRP and the broader market capable of a recovery through the day should key price targets be reached early.

The fraud investigation involves a company named BTC Global, which told clients they would earn 2 per cent per day, 14 per cent a week and 50 per cent in a month, the police said. A search for the company on the Internet showed its services had been suspended. The website lists Steven Twain as the “primary trader”. A request for comment by Reuters sent to an email address listed on the website as belonging to Twain received no response.“Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by agents of BTC Global,” the police said in a statement.“Some of the investors got paid in terms of the agreement. However, the payments suddenly stopped.” Local technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than $50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global. The investigation follows a case this week where kidnappers demanded a ransom in bitcoin of nearly $120,000 to release a South African teenage boy. On Thursday, South Africa’s central bank, said it was in the process of determining whether cryptocurrencies complied with its financial surveillance and exchange control regulations.

The drama begins with an Etsy seller publishing a letter from a lawyer representing the bitcoin trademark holder in relation to bitcoin-branded clothing items the person was offering for sale. “It has come to our client’s attention that you are offering for sale a variety of clothing bearing the Bitcoin trademark on Etsy.co.uk.\n[Our Client] has not authorised your use of the Bitcoin trademark on and in relation to clothing. Such use, therefore, amounts to trademark infringement pursuant to s10(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1994,” the letter reads.\nIn an apparent act of benevolence, the letter goes on to note while the trademark holder could take action against the seller they instead give the seller 14 days to remove the infringing goods instead. While cryptocurrency sites have gone into meltdown over the fact that someone has not only trademarked bitcoin and were enforcing the trademark, with one site even going as far as saying the trademark holder will “have authority over everything Bitcoin, at least in the U.K.,” the truth is nowhere near that reported as the vast majority of those covering the story don’t understand basic trademark law.\nPutting aside the moral arguments over anyone holding a trademark over the term bitcoin, trademarks relate to specific products and the trademark used in this case, UK00003279106, registered by a company called A.B.C.

But the crowd that showed up in Wenatchee two weeks ago for a hearing about Bitcoin mining in Chelan County was so large that utility staff had to open a second room with a video feed for the overflow. The turnout wasn’t surprising. Chelan County, along with neighboring Douglas and Grant counties, has been at the center of the U.S. Bitcoin boom since 2012, when the region’s ultracheap hydropower began attracting cryptocurrency “miners.” […] As a result, an area famous for apples, wheat and conservative politics has been transformed into a kind of cyber-boomtown, with Bitcoin mining operations that range from large-scale, state-of-the-art warehouses to repurposed cargo containers to backyard sheds. By the end of this year, according to some estimates, the Mid-Columbia Basin could account for as much as 30 percent of the global output of new Bitcoin and large shares of other digital currencies, such as Litecoin and Ethereum.

IPHoldings South West ’ has successfully acquired a trademark for the name ‘Bitcoin’. According to a merchant on Etsy, IP-Holdings sent a cease and desist order because they were selling Bitcoin-themed t-shirts. Also read: There’s a Bitcoin Themed Card Game On Kickstarter Called ‘Bitcon’ UK Company Successfully Copyrights the Name ‘Bitcoin’ This week cryptocurrency enthusiasts found out the name ‘Bitcoin’ had been trademarked using the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) in the UK on December 22, 2017. The news came as a shock to one merchant who was selling t-shirts on Etsy with the Bitcoin name and was told to stop his operations or be held liable in a court of law. The letter states : It has come to our client’s attention that you are offering for sale a variety of clothing bearing the Bitcoin trademark on Etsy.co.uk. [Our Client] has not authorised your use of the Bitcoin trademark on and in relation to clothing. Such use, therefore, amounts to trademark infringement pursuant to s10(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1994. Contacting the company is difficult as there is very little information on the London-headquartered firm called IP-Holdings — minus one other patented IP product called ‘Westworld.’ The trademark itself, filed this past December, reveals a list of goods that can’t bear the name without permission such as adult clothing, infants’ clothing, shoes, headbands, socks, and nearly everything that can be manufactured into a product. Trademark number ‘UK00003279106 Bitcoin’ was officially registered into the IPO’s records on April 13, 2018. The “BITCOIN” IPO trademark filed on December 22, 2017. Other Attempts to Trademark the Bitcoin Name Have Failed The UK filing seems to be the first successful trademark using the name Bitcoin as there have been other undertakings in the past. Back in March of 2015, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) rejected the company Urban Trend’s attempt to trademark the name Bitcoin (Reg 86135516 ). A year later during the same month, the Russian patent agency Rospatent denied the Moscow-based firm M-Group when it tried to copyright the Bitcoin name . Many cryptocurrency enthusiasts have been angry about the recent news as prior attempts have infuriated bitcoiners in the past. Back in 2015 the nonprofit organization the Bitcoin Foundation published a plea to individuals and businesses asking them not to copyright the term Bitcoin. “The Bitcoin Foundation believes that the term “Bitcoin” alone should not be the intellectual property of any individual or entity,” explained the organization back in January 2015. Rather, it is a generic term like the terms used for other currencies such as “dollar”, “euro,” “yen,” etc. The Foundation is committed to doing what it can to protect the term “Bitcoin” for public use.

Recently, British economic historian and author Niall Ferguson told the Bank of England that Bitcoin is the financial system of the future. Also Read: This Week in Bitcoin: McAfee’s Bullish Prediction and a Guy Living in His Car The Future of Finance Niall Ferguson is a noted historian, commentator, and the author of fifteen books including The Ascent of Money and The House of Rothschild. On Tuesday he has given a seminar to the Bank of England, talking about the 2008 financial crisis and the reactions to it to this day. In his conclusion of the subject, he mentioned that bitcoin is part of the major challenges ahead for the current fiat-based system. Ferguson said: “The financial system of today is not fundamentally that different than the financial system of the pre-crisis period, except that big banks are better capitalized. I don’t think much else is really different. The novelties, the things that will really matter ten years hence are still relatively small in scale. Whether its bitcoin or cryptocurrency generally or the massive revolution in online payments that is being achieved by the big Chinese tech companies, that’s the financial system of the future, and it is still small enough not to be systemically important in 2018. In short, I am left feeling we are only a matter of time before the next crisis.” Bombarded by ICOs The above isn’t such a surprising statement coming from Ferguson. Back in December 2017 he wrote : “At some point, no doubt, regulatory changes in the US will deflate the current bitcoin bubble. But they will not halt, much less undo, this financial revolution. Think about it this way. The maximum number of bitcoins that can be created is 21m. The number of millionaires in the world, according to Credit Suisse, is 36m. Their total wealth is $128.7 trillion. If millionaires collectively decided to hold just 1% of their wealth as bitcoin, the price would be not $15,000 but north of $60,000. If they raised that to 5%, the right price for bitcoin would be above $300,000. I am not saying this is certain to happen. I’m just saying my teenage son thinks it could.” Since then he has also been exposed to more sides of the cryptocurrency market, such as the endless flood of ICO offers. “I wish I had a bitcoin for every phony white paper I’ve been shown the last six months, by people trying to raise money before the SEC clamps down,” Ferguson reportedly said last week. “When there’s no regulation, then the rogues are very quickly on the scene.” Ferguson isn’t the only noted academic figure that looked at how bitcoin fits economic history recently. Last Monday, Professor Robert Shiller, who received the 2013 Nobel prize in economics and is famous for the Case-Shiller Index, published an article talking about the way the allure of bitcoin fits enthusiasm around previous attempts to reinvent money.

This is a near $200 drop over the last 24 hours, and the bears are still having their way. The current sentiment is that bitcoin could fall to as low as an even $7,000 over the next few days. The currency has been dropping gradually since Sunday May 13, after it spiked to a new high of roughly $9,800. Maybe bitcoin just doesn’t like Mother’s Day… Still, others remain skeptical that bitcoin will stay at the $7,000 position or spike soon after that. Willy Woo, for example, is a cryptocurrency and digital currency analyst. He believes bitcoin could potentially fall below the $6,000 mark in the short term, and test both the $5,700 and $5,500 marks respectively. He cites a high NVT signal, continuously high volatility, an overly high standard NVT, and a volume profile cliff below $6,800 as the four main reasons for his prediction. “NVT signal is still too high,” he explains. “We need more blockchain transactional activity to justify the current price, or the price to drop to reconcile the difference. To drive up transactional activity in a bear slide is very unlikely. Furthermore, volatility is still too high. I’m looking for a sustained low band of volatility, which tends to be a signal for the end of the detox and the next accumulation phase. It’s still got some time to ride down.” NVT signal is a trading indicator that Woo, himself, developed. It is a standard NVT ratio-network valuation divided by transaction value on the blockchain. The figure is then smoothed out using a moving average, which is then applied to the transaction value, creating a more responsive chart. Woo did mention, however, that bitcoin isn’t likely to strike the bottom half of the $5,000 range, and that a price correction as steep as the one witnessed in 2014 would not happen. He further stated that a cryptocurrency bull rally would occur again, though not until the third quarter of 2018. “So, in summary, my best guess – slow bleed down to $6,800, then a steeper slide to $5,700, then a leveling out of the drop, then a flat zone,” he explained. “This is an educated guess based on volume profile and fundamental data framing the rate of movement.” It’s hard to accept the idea of bitcoin suddenly sinking into oblivion when so many countries are beginning to explore its technology and benefits. Great Britain, for example, has recently published a working paper on the subject, while the Bank of England’s governor Mark Carney states that the institution is open to the idea of a central bank-issued digital currency. This marks a massive change in sentiment, as prior to the G20 Summit in Argentina last March, Carney had been very vocal about the negative side of bitcoin , repeatedly calling the currency a “failure.” He also said that it needed to be “held to higher standards,” and that cryptocurrencies were part of “speculative mania.” Carney now believes a central bank digital currency (CBDC) could potentially heighten the region’s presence in the crypto space and assist Britain’s economy.

Antonopoulos Champions Essential ‘Weirdness’ Speaking at the Polish Bitcoin Congress in Warsaw May 12, Antonopoulos, who has been a well-known Bitcoin advocate and educator since 2013, argued that Bitcoin’s “weirdness” and decentralization’s ability to “offend” were key to its success. “…The reason Bitcoin is interesting is because it’s not controlled, because it can’t be censored, because it’s open, because a lot of the people involved are very, very weird,” he said. […] If you take all that out, what you’re left with – this Blockchain – is a sterile, unexpressive (sic), uninvented environment; a corporate plaything that has been sanitized of every interesting and left as an empty shell. Blockchain Is ‘Basically A Very Slow Database’ The views are commonplace for Antonopoulos, who has sought to reinforce the revolutionary qualities behind Bitcoin and other decentralized networks on countless occasions. The Polish talk’s timing, however, was pertinent, as Consensus caused controversy just four days later after other Bitcoin industry figures criticized its Blockchain bias and lack of technical s ubstance. Bitcoin developers Jimmy Song and Johnathan Corgan specifically highlighted the event’s perceived shortcomings, arguing Blockchain had become a victim of “cargo cult engineering” and that a lack of education on the part of audience members prevented them from sorting valuable information from “buzzwords.” “It’s basically a very slow database,” Antonopoulos continued in comments on Blockchain which Song would later emulate. If someone comes to you and says, ‘Do I need a blockchain for my business?’ Ask them, ‘Do you need something that is open, neutral, borderless, that no one controls and that resists censorship?’ If yes, then you need Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, ZCash – some open public Blockchain… that expresses these capabilities. Beyond Bitcoin, Antonopoulos also had cautionary words for banks looking to Ethereum for Blockchain solutions. “Right now, the big banks, governments – they’re in love with Ethereum. They love the fact that Ethereum has all of these capabilities that seem much, much less weird than Bitcoin,” he continued. But they don’t realize that all of the weirdness is still there[…]. The whole point of Ethereum is to make unstoppable code, applications you cannot turn off – and the reason they can’t be turned off is because they’re decentralized apps – DApps. Why make a DApp unless you wanted to make a DApp that somebody wants to turn off and you want to continue working? What do you think about Andreas Antonopoulos’ views on Bitcoin versus Blockchain?

This decentralized technology is designed to be free and open to everyone. As such, trademarks and patents can cause a lot of unnecessary hindrances. In the United Kingdom, one company successfully trademarked the word ‘Bitcoin’. A Trademark With Major Implications Trademarking a commonly used term is not all that straightforward. Although one could obtain a trademark for the term “Bitcoin”, enforcing that trademark will be a different matter altogether. After all, the term Bitcoin has been ‘trademarked’ before, but it was never used to prosecute people using this term irrespective of their commercial interest. Even so, one particular company in the United Kingdom somehow managed to trademark the term “Bitcoin” in late 2017. It is a bit unclear how the company went about achieving this and what they aim to do with it moving forward. The current relationship between Monopolip Ltd. and the cryptocurrency industry also remains a bit unclear at this time. The bigger concern is what this approved trademark filing means for the cryptocurrency industry itself. For most people and companies, this will not result in any major changes. One Reddit user, however, explained that he had received a cease and desist letter when using the Bitcoin term in connection with his T-shirt business. Considering that most of his shirts pertain to Bitcoin, there is an issue here. Enforcing this trademark filing outside the United Kingdom will be pretty challenging. Within that nation’s borders, however, the situation is quite different. Considering that the aforementioned Reddit user is seemingly running a UK-based shop, there is some legal gray area to explore. There have been a few unsuccessful attempts at trademarking Bitcoin the US over the past few years. That doesn’t mean people will stop trying in the years to come, though. Cryptocurrencies are extremely popular right now, and it is only normal that more people will look to them in an effort to get rich. Using various methods to do so is to be expected, although opting for a trademark filing is pretty bothersome. It will be interesting to see how this situation plays out. The term ‘Bitcoin’ is far too generic to be trademarked, yet the UK government decided to grant the trademark regardless. Whether or not that decision will hurt the industry moving forward remains to be seen. It’s a very peculiar situation that will spark many debates moving forward.

Coinbase is getting into the decentralized exchange business with its acquisition of Paradex, potentially opening up thousands of ERC-20 tokens to traders, depending on what the SEC ends up doing with regulations. The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, Intercontinental Exchange, continues work to implement a system to allow large investors to trade bitcoin directly. And Germany’s Deutsche Boerse is looking at getting into the cryptocurrency game. Finally, the city of Memphis had its first blockchain conference, which included keynotes from FedEx and a hackathon for various market segments that included some great prizes.

Coinbase Takes Another Step Toward Trading ICO Tokens by Acquiring Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase just made an enormous play by acquiring decentralized relayer Paradex this week. Paradex bills itself as a decentralized exchange (DEX), meaning no third party is involved in holding the funds. Instead, users can use the platform to trade ERC20 tokens directly wallet to wallet. Paradex is built on top of the 0x (pronounced “zero x”) protocol . Right now, Coinbase trades four coins: bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH) and litecoin (LTC). Adding ERC20 tokens could significantly boost the number of digital assets it carries. Due to the ICO boom that has taken place over the last few years, thousands of different ICO tokens are now available. German Stock Exchange Eyes Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Frankfurt Stock Exchange parent company, Deutsche Boerse AG , appears to have begun work on technology that will allow them to offer their clients bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related products. Speaking at an industry event in London on May 23, 2018, Jeffrey Tessler, head of clients, products and core markets for Deutsche Boerse, said they are considering offering cryptocurrency products: \"We are deep at work with it.\" The Old New Thing: ICE and the Future of Bitcoin Trading and Regulation As reported earlier by The New York Times (NYT) and Bitcoin Magazine , Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is developing an online trading platform that would allow large investors to trade bitcoin directly. As news about the ICE platform continues to develop, Bitcoin Magazine spoke with lawyers Ben Sauter and Dave McGill of Kobre & Kim, a New York City law firm which specializes in disputes and investigations, to examine the regulatory issues surrounding the launch of such a platform, including swap contracts and the implications the ICE platform might have on cryptocurrency trading in the future. What Happened At Graceland’s Ethereum Conference In its first year, EthMemphis distinguished its place on the blockchain conference circuit for displaying an under-the-hood glimpse at what actually moves this young industry forward, specifically on the Ethereum network. The focus was on blockchain topics and projects applied to supply chain, healthcare, tourism/hospitality, education and law. Verge Cryptocurrency Suffers Its Second Hack in Less Than Two Months While Verge executives are claiming a DDoS attack is responsible for the recent serious delays on their blockchain, it appears that the problem may be more serious than the company is implying. The attack lasted more than a few hours and has resulted in over 35 million XVGs (worth approximately $1.7 million) being stolen. The theft occurred when hackers exploited a specific glitch in Verge’s technology by mining multiple blocks virtually one second apart using the same algorithm. This was the same tactic used in a hack just last month that saw over 250,000 XVGs disappear into thin air, forcing Verge to prepare a subsequent hard fork .

Known as Bitcoin Incognito, it is another attempt at fixing some of the glaring issues which Bitcoin presents. Whether or not this new fork will succeed is unclear, but more competition isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Anonymity and Bitcoin in one Package One of the biggest misconceptions people have about Bitcoin is that it is anonymous. That is anything but the case, though, as Bitcoin has neither anonymity nor privacy features. The currency allows one to be pseudonymous – similar to an online nickname – but not anonymous. Some projects are trying to address this lack of anonymity through various means. In the case of Bitcoin Incognito , there isn’t much information to go by at this time, as the project was only announced Friday afternoon. From what little information has been made public, it’s evident Bitcoin Incognito will primarily focus on proof-of-stake and masternode solutions. Anyone who has paid close attention to the various altcoins on the market will have noticed that masternodes are quickly becoming more popular. It is a system that many currencies are embracing, although it is not something one would ever see as being part of Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin Incognito thinks it is a good time to take the plunge in this regard, although it remains to be seen how this will pan out when combined with proof-of-stake capabilities. Additionally, the new project will make use of the Zerocoin protocol to provide anonymity features. It will convert publicly visible BTCi into fully anonymous zBTCi. Sending the anonymous version will appear as normal BTCi to the recipient, but there will be no traceable route indicating where the money came from exactly. It is somewhat similar to how other currencies using the Zerocoin protocol operate. Furthermore, it seems Bitcoin Incognito will make use of a feature known as SwiftTX. This is not a unique feature, as it is found in a fair few altcoins. Even so, it will allow Bitcoin Incognito’s users to send transactions faster and cheaper compared to Bitcoin and most altcoins. It is evident that the project has some interesting ideas, although it remains to be seen whether this particular altcoin will gain any major traction. Various newer versions of Bitcoin have popped up in recent months, yet none have made any lasting impact other than Bitcoin Cash. Changing this situation will not be all that easy, but that doesn’t mean launching new projects is no longer worth it.

This could be the last line of defense for buyers, as a break below support could signal that a longer-term selloff is underway.\nHowever, a reversal candlestick or a doji appears to have formed right on support, and it would need the next candle to close above the high to confirm the possible bounce. If so, bitcoin could still climb up to the top of the triangle around $8,750-9,000.\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA, though, so the path of least resistance is to the downside. In other words, the selloff is more likely to persist than to reverse. The gap between the moving averages is also widening to reflect stronger selling pressure.\nMeanwhile, RSI is already hovering around oversold levels to reflect exhaustion among sellers. Similarly, stochastic has reached the oversold region to signal that the drop may be over. Turning higher could draw buyers back in and allow bitcoin to pull up from its drop.\nThere are still no positive developments being reported from the industry so far, which might keep bitcoin exposed to risk flows throughout the week. In the previous week, geopolitical risk has led to some demand for the safe-haven dollar even as the FOMC minutes signaled a slower pace of rate hikes later on.\nUp ahead, the NFP report could be the main catalyst for the dollar, although market watchers will likely keep close tabs on US-China and US-North Korea talks. Further tensions could keep the lower-yielding dollar supported versus bitcoin.\nAnother factor that’s limiting bitcoin gains is the selling of Mt. Gox coins to pay off its creditors.

Now commuters riding the Prague Metro can purchase digital assets at various locations spread out across the fifth busiest metro system in Europe.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space General Bytes Installs Ten Bitcoin ATMs Across the Prague Metro\nThe Czech Republic-based firm General Bytes has revealed the installation of ten new cryptocurrency ATMs spread out across the Prague Metro. The subway gets more than 1.6 million people in daily foot traffic and is one of the busiest metro systems in Europe. The General Bytes machines are located at Můstek, Nádraží Veleslavín, Dejvická, Florenc, Černý Most, Zličín, Pankrác, Flora, Skalka, and Hlavní Nádraží. Moreover, General Bytes provides a detailed map and description of each location on the website. A map of the ten Prague Metro machines manufactured by General Bytes.\nThe new machines will likely get some use in the region as Prague is considered a booming cryptocurrency hub, as the area is filled with quite a lot of crypto-enthusiasts. For instance, the area is home to the Crypto Anarchy Institute, Paralelní Polis, and a few cryptocurrency businesses including the ATM manufacturer General Bytes. General Bytes Has Manufactured 27% of the World’s Bitcoin ATMs\nThe Czech government is relatively friendly towards cryptocurrencies and politicians haven’t regulated virtual currencies or defined them as a currency or commodity like other nation states. However, the subject is being discussed among tax officials and the Czech National Bank wrote a paper last year called “Don’t be Afraid of Bitcoin.” Last year the well known online retailer, Alza, added cryptocurrency payments and installed two Bitcoin ATMs in the company’s showroom. Just three days ago one of the largest energy suppliers in the Czech Republic, Pražská Plynárenská, announced it was accepting BTC for payments. Czech Republic map of cryptocurrency ATMs.\nWith the ten new machines, the Czech Republic will now have a total of 46 Cryptocurrency ATMs and 27 of those devices are located in Prague. A large majority of the cryptocurrency automated tellers in the region are manufactured by General Bytes. On the General Bytes site where they announce the newly added Prague Metro machines there’s also a video explaining how to use the BATM 2 automated tellers. According to Coinatmradar out of the 3,122 cryptocurrency ATMs, General Bytes now has 858 worldwide.\nWhat do you think about General Bytes installing ten cryptocurrency ATMs throughout the Prague Metro?

Bulls continue to defend this level but a short-term downtrend channel remains intact. A bounce off this area could lead to a test of the channel top, and an upside break could spur a move to the triangle top. Bitcoin price continues to hover at the major support zone, and bulls would need more momentum to sustain a bounce.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA remains below the longer-term 200 SMA on the 4-hour time frame to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This signals that the selloff is more likely to continue than to reverse.\nThis could also mean that a break of the triangle support around $7,350 is imminent. The 100 SMA lines up with the top of the short-term descending channel to add to its strength as resistance while the 200 SMA adds another dynamic resistance before the top of the triangle at $9,000.\nRSI is pointing up to signal that bulls could still push higher, though. Stochastic is also turning higher to reflect a return in bullish momentum, which might be enough for a test of the near-term resistance at $8,000.\nBTCUSD Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin and its peers have been on the back foot recently as the lack of positive updates and the liquidation of more bitcoin on Mt. Gox have spurred declines. This time, there is some degree of focus on regulation but developments in the industry could lead to positive sentiment.\nFor one, there's the mainnet launch for both Tron and EOS that would make them independent of the Ethereum network. Although this probably won't have a direct influence on bitcoin price, any improvement in investor outlook could still lift altcoins overall.\nBesides, the dollar has the NFP report to contend with and weak results could further dampen tightening expectations. Apart from that, overall risk sentiment in the financial markets, particularly relating to trade talks and political uncertainties, could lead to some volatility.\nThe post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Watch: Make or Break Situation appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T08:19:30.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "440f157dbed208335ab7a3f6ab77914dbcbb025a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXVMN_c4xQ.VG2ytH0ajGRQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why are banks and governments scared of Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why are banks and governments scared of Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-28T08:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "440f157dbed208335ab7a3f6ab77914dbcbb025a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmXVMN_c4xQ.VG2ytH0ajGRQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Fafabol", "published": "2018-05-28T08:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why are banks and governments scared of Bitcoin?", "text": "As we all know that Bitcoin is are based on the blockchain technology which relies on the principle of decentralization.

Now, for the bitcoin part, i think you need to do extra measures to protect your btc, may it be using a hardware wallet, putting 2fa on your wallets and the likes.\nAs mentioned everywhere there is some sort of issue. Similar way bitcoin too has got some flaws which makes it more risky than many other investments. In specific bitcoin is all about the trust, and we can make it secure with the better security options available. Even after that we cannot assure it is perfectly safe. Another thing found much is the scam investment schemes that easily make the people get trapped scamming the amount.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

move above the $1,000 and $1,050 resistances against the US Dollar. There is a connecting bearish trend line formed with resistance at $1,010 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is currently consolidating above the $950 level and is preparing for the next move. Bitcoin cash price is consolidating in a range against the US Dollar. BCH/USD has to move past $1,010 and the 100 hourly simple moving average for more gains.\nBitcoin Cash Price Resistance There was no major movement during the weekend above $1,050 in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price tested the $950-960 support zone on a couple of occasions. There was no downside break below $950 and the price remained confined in a range. There were a couple of swing moves, but upsides were capped by the $1,020 resistances and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nThe recent swing low was $976 with an upside move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,042 high to $976 low. However, there are many barriers on the upside waiting to prevent gains above $1,010 and $1,040. An immediate resistance is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,042 high to $976 low. There is also a connecting bearish trend line formed with resistance at $1,010 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair.\nLooking at the chart , the price is facing a tough challenge near the trend line, $1,040 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. A break above $1,010 and $1,040 could open the doors for more gains towards the $1,100 level in the near term. On the downside, the $950 level is an important support.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is mostly flat in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is struggling to move above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $950\nMajor Resistance Level – $1,040\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH/USD Consolidating Above $950 appeared first on NewsBTC .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-28T07:39:35.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d1d6355a6e04366c3ace3cf5a1e19a3e9ae10b25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSjVhkCbuFS0JlM9I1sctWDrqTu8sUOLl5t6SwS_le_b0H0KjxrTFj9pEHws1_yc4e2Eki3D_S5d_euy_jMb19fgWe8T1ONdX18L91BGDWEvDuzw1ml8uuT", "site_full": "peoplesvoiceindia.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://peoplesvoiceindia.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "TIPS NEWS", "title": "Delhi businessman promised '100%-profits' on bitcoins duped of Rs. 91L", "title_full": "Delhi businessman promised '100%-profits' on bitcoins duped of Rs. 91L", "published": "2018-05-28T07:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d1d6355a6e04366c3ace3cf5a1e19a3e9ae10b25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSjVhkCbuFS0JlM9I1sctWDrqTu8sUOLl5t6SwS_le_b0H0KjxrTFj9pEHws1_yc4e2Eki3D_S5d_euy_jMb19fgWe8T1ONdX18L91BGDWEvDuzw1ml8uuT", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "TIPS FOR INDIA (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-28T07:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Delhi businessman promised '100%-profits' on bitcoins duped of Rs. 91L", "text": "\nIn an elaborate plan, a fraud managed to dupe a Delhi businessman of a whopping Rs. 91L by promising him enormous profits on bitcoins .\nTo convince the victim to invest such a high amount, the cheat sold him lower-value bitcoins twice, which he could 'sell' later for massive gains.\nThe third time, he assured profits of nearly 100%, but fled with the money instead.\nMeeting The victim met the 'MNC employee' at a bank\nThe businessman, a Jamia Nagar resident, said he met the fraud at a bank in 2017.

FILE PHOTO | NMG Summary The fraud investigation involves a company named BTC Global, which told clients they would earn 2 per cent per day, 14 per cent a week and 50 per cent in a month. Local technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than $50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global. The investigation follows a case this week where kidnappers demanded a ransom in bitcoin of nearly $120,000 to release a South African teenage boy. Johannesburg South African authorities are investigating an alleged cryptocurrency scam that defrauded investors of 1 billion rand ($80 million) with promises of huge returns that never materialised, police said on Friday. The fraud investigation involves a company named BTC Global, which told clients they would earn 2 per cent per day, 14 per cent a week and 50 per cent in a month, the police said. A search for the company on the internet showed its services had been suspended. 'Primary trader' The website lists Steven Twain as the “primary trader”. A request for comment by Reuters sent to an email address listed on the website as belonging to Twain received no response. “Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by agents of BTC Global,” the police said in a statement. “Some of the investors got paid in terms of the agreement. However, the payments suddenly stopped.” Tip of the iceberg Local technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than $50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global. “This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they’ve lost money,” police investigator Yolisa Matakata said. The investigation follows a case this week where kidnappers demanded a ransom in bitcoin of nearly $120,000 to release a South African teenage boy. On Thursday South Africa’s central bank said it was in the process of determining whether cryptocurrencies complied with its financial surveillance and exchange control regulations.

With conventional currency, government decides when and where to print and distribute it. With \"miners\" use special software to solve complex mathematical problems and are issued a certain number of Bitcoin in return.\nBefore getting started, you will need to get yourself a wallet. You can do this easily enough by registering with one of the exchanges which will host wallet for you. And, although I think you are going to want to have one or more exchange wallets eventually, you should start with one on your own computer both to get a better feel for bitcoin and because the exchanges are still experimental themselves.\nInternet users transfer digital assets (bits) to each other on a network. There is no online bank; rather, White Bitcoin in Panama has been described as an Internet-wide distributed ledger. Users buy Bitcoin with cash or by selling a product or service. Store and use this digital currency. Users may sell out of this virtual ledger by trading their Bitcoin to someone else who wants in. Anyone can do this, anywhere in the world.\nIf you desire to be aware of just how much is worth, run a simple net search. If you want to essentially convert bitcoin to dollars, transfer them in an internet market and sell them to an interested consumer. The online marketplace might promptly and easily convert your bitcoins to dollars and transmit them to a debit card, bank account, or digital wallet of your determination.\nBitcoin is a type of electronic currency (CryptoCurrency) that is autonomous from traditional banking and came into circulation in 2009. According to some of the top online traders, Bitcoin is considered as the best known digital currency that relies on computer networks to solve complex mathematical problems, in order to verify and record the details of each transaction made.\nCreated in 2009 by an anonymous cryptographer, Bitcoin operates on the premise that anything, even intangible bits of code, can have value so long as enough people decide to treat it as valuable. Bitcoins exist only as digital representations and are not pegged to any traditional currency.\nDue to the anonymity the gambling industry has taken up bitcoin as a payment method. Bitcoin in Panama are coming to life and offering their players to make deposits, play with bitcoin at the tables and withdraw directly to their bitcoin wallet. This means that there's no taxes or possibilities for government control. Much like a regular Nevada casino where do you don't need to register anywhere and all your transactions are anonymous. Bitcoin in Panama are coming to life and offering their players to make deposits, play with bitcoin at the tables and withdraw directly to their bitcoin wallet.

International payments are extremely easy and very cheap. The reason of this is that bitcoins are not really tied to any country. They're not subject to any kind regulation. Small businesses love them, because there're no credit card fees involved. There're persons who buy bitcoins just for the purpose of investment, expecting them to raise their value.\nBitcoin in Panama uses state-of-the-art cryptography, can be issued in any fractional denomination, and has a decentralized distribution system, is in high demand globally and offers several distinct advantages over other currencies such as the US dollar. For one, it can never be garnished or frozen by the bank(s) or a government agency.\nYou can acquire a bitcoin wallet from a bitcoin broker such as Coinbase. When you open up a wallet through a certified broker, you are given a bitcoin address which is a series of numbers and letters, similarly to an account number for a bank account and a private key which is a series of numbers and letters as well, which serve as your password.\nEvery single bitcoin comes as the result of a previous transaction. Thus, the way to get them, when you don't have any, is by receiving a transaction from someone else, when you purchase them using cash or also by mining new bitcoins.\nA question that then arises is, is Bitcoin mining worth it. The answer is NO for the average person. It takes very sophisticated knowledge and a powerful computer system and this combination of factors makes it unattainable for the masses. This applies even more to bitcoin mining 2017 than in past years.\nWhen we get to that stage of the discussion, I will be advising that you get in the habit of moving your money and coins off the exchanges or diversifying across exchanges to keep your money safe.\nBitcoin is not held or controlled by a financial institution; it is completely decentralized. Unlike real-world money it cannot be devalued by governments or banks.Conversion services often ask for a fee.
