Bitcoin trademark registered in the UK, but experts say it's indefensible. 1,461 7\nVitalik, we‚Äôve got to talk. It has come to our attention that your foundation has been using the ‚ÄúEthereum‚Äù mark for several years now. However, my company has owned the ‚ÄúEthereum‚Äù trademark ever since we registered it last week. Since we have not given you permission to use our trademark, we‚Äôre going to need you to send us 3-5 Eth.\nBut don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll send you more ETH back.\nThe preceding paragraph might sound like a bad joke. But trademark law is no laughing matter, and a UK-based store has been ordered to stop infringing on another company‚Äôs trademark. The offending material? T-shirts with the word ‚Äú Bitcoin .‚Äù\nThe Cease-and-Desist consisted of several scary-looking pages of legalese from a law firm representing ‚Äúthe owner of the BITCOIN trademark.‚Äù\n‚Äú[Our client] has not authorized your use of the BITCOIN trade mark on and in relation to clothing,‚Äù the letter states, before threatening that they ‚Äúwill inevitably succeed should it be necessary to bring proceedings against you for Trade Mark Infringement,‚Äù with further threats of injunctions, damages and legal proceedings.\nIt‚Äôs usually nice to end letters on a warm note, and the lawyers extended a token of their clients‚Äô generosity. ‚ÄúOur client remains keen to refrain from bringing legal proceedings against you,‚Äù provided the seller adhere to a long list of demands, including sending the litigant their unsold merchandise and agreeing to pay ‚Äúany written demands.‚Äù A New Kind of Trolling\nAlthough our Etsy storeowner hid the identity of their litigious correspondent, it didn‚Äôt take much sleuthing to find the culprit. ABC IP Holdings SouthWest LLC registered the UK Trademark for BITCOIN back in December. The mark allows them exclusive use of the word ‚ÄúBITCOIN‚Äù in three categories, from ‚Äúadhesive bras‚Äù to ‚Äúyellow rice wine.‚Äù A full list of all the categories in which the trademark has been claimed is available in PDF form here .\nInterestingly, ABC IPHOLDING is also pursing a trademark for ‚Äú WESTWORLD ,‚Äù which is sure to please HBO.\nThis isn‚Äôt the first time someone tried to take credit for Bitcoin (lookin‚Äô at you, Craig Wright ). Patent trolling is more common‚Äîsince thinking up an idea is much cheaper than seeing it to fruition, many companies file patents and let others do the heavy lifting.\nCryptocurrencies are open-sourced, making them particularly vulnerable to trademark trolling. There‚Äôs no one company responsible for protecting the brand, the foundations have limited funds, and with trademarks, you use them or lose them.\nLitecoin has faced several similar cases, causing several headaches for the nonprofit Foundation. One would think that the fact that Litecoin already existed as a product and entity would be protection enough. ‚ÄúThat would make the most sense from a logical perspective,‚Äù wrote a review in CoinJournal , but logic isn‚Äôt enough where judges are concerned.\nDogecoin also got bitten by a few trademark fleas which resulted in some plaintive whimpering in the Shibe community. Can you really trademark Bitcoin? Really?\nThe short answer is, not for long. In the UK (as in the US) descriptive words cannot be trademarked. You could trademark a larger phrase, like ‚ÄúHODL BITCOIN,‚Äù or a specific font/color combo, but the word itself is fair game.\nThe distinction is explained by Sausser Summers PC, on a website helpfully titled onlinetrademarkattorneys.com . Because ‚ÄúBITCOIN is a common term to describe a type of digital currency,‚Äù the attorneys say, anyone can use the word ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù and no one can claim ownership of it.\nThat doesn‚Äôt stop people from trying, and sometimes they get lucky. The question has come up before, with a little company called Mt. Gox . Although the exchange successfully registered the name ‚ÄúBitcoin,‚Äù it probably shouldn‚Äôt have been granted. IP lawyers told CoinDesk that ‚ÄúIt may be that the trademark examiner looking at this application wasn‚Äôt really sure what it was, and just gave it to them.‚Äù\nHowever, challenging a trademark is no easy task, even if ABC IPHoldings is not the real name of Satoshi Nakomoto. Patent (and trademark) trolls rely on intimidating their opponents with legal fees, and the threat usually works.

While Nakamoto vanished from the internet in April 2011, the cryptocurrency creator left behind a slender trail of breadcrumbs in the form of emails exchanged with early bitcoin developers, commentary in online forums, and bitcoin‚Äôs original white paper.\nWhile there‚Äôs plenty of speculation regarding Nakamoto‚Äôs identity, all the guesses hazarded thus far have led to inconclusive dead ends. One bitcoin developer, Laszlo Hanyecz, best known for making the first real-world purchase in bitcoin for a pair of pizzas, told Business Insider he exchanged hundreds of emails with the bitcoin creator in 2010.\nTheir interaction began when Hanyecz, who had been mining bitcoins on his laptop, expressed interest in contributing to the cryptocurrency‚Äôs development online. Nakamoto agreed, Hanyecz said, and over the course of the year, Nakamoto sent tasks for Hanyecz to complete.\nHanyecz said his interactions with Nakamoto were always ‚Äúkind of weird.‚Äù Hanyecz said that even though his work on bitcoin was a side project he worked on for free, Nakamoto treated him as if he were a full-time employee.\nHanyecz said Nakamoto‚Äôs demands occasionally rubbed him the wrong way. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòHey, you‚Äôre not my boss,'‚Äù Hanyecz said.

Since 22.12.2017 the exchange rate fluctuates constantly between ‚Ç¨ 11,000 and 12,500 euros and is pulling the entire market down with it.\nOn 16.12.2017 (2 days before the Start of the CME), reached in the Bitcoin all-time high of 16614,25 Euro. The launch of the Futures had a strong negative impact and led to a decline up to 10246,77 Euro. The course of the Altcoins proceeded almost in parallel, and thus indicates the dependence of the reserve currency BTC to all other currencies in the crypto market.\nGiven the incredible Rally of the past few weeks a decline in this level seem to be quite as healthy and sustainable. A further correction would fall in the course of a further 20% or 30%, would also not be surprising and would fit in the picture of the current development of the crypto market.\nUnusually strong and stable and has shown the crypto-currency Ripple in the last few days.

And why should you care?", "text": "<iframe src=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2018/05/31/tech/are-traders-messing-price-bitcoin-why-care/popout\" Bitcoin‚Äôs wildly fluctuating price may not be the result of free market forces. The Department of Justice has reportedly opened an investigation into whether traders are manipulating the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies. And that's caused some market watchers to say that‚Äôs been clear all along. Peter Tchir, a market strategist at the investment bank Academy Securities, is one of those people. He talked with Marketplace Tech host Molly Wood about his piece for Forbes titled \" I Would Be Shocked If Bitcoin Prices Weren't Manipulated .\" The following is an edited transcript of their conversation. Peter Tchir: To me, there [are] three types of manipulation: One is where someone, through pricing, tries to put various prices on different exchanges or artificial prices to move the market price one way or the other. The other I think would be a more classic \"pump and dump\" type scheme, which was traditional on penny stocks, where people own a lot of a stock and then they talk it up trying to get new investors to come in in order to sell it to them at artificially high prices. And somewhere in between are when people own large stakes of it or take actions that may be to the detriment of other shareholders in an attempt to get a short-term price reaction. So I would view all those things as various types of manipulation. Molly Wood: There seems to be this viewpoint, and this is what you essentially articulated in your column, which is it might not be against the law, but it's a really good bet that these prices are being manipulated. Tchir: Yes, I have something that I've called the \" three rules of bitcoin ,\" but rule No. 2 has always been there are no rules. Which may be ironic, but I think we're trying to highlight the point that this is not a regulated environment. You do not know people's positions when they talk about it. There are relatively few very large holders of these cryptocurrencies. Most of the cryptocurrencies tend to have a small number of very large holders who are clearly very incentivized to keep the price up. So they may be trading in such a way to prop the price up. I think you have to be aware of it. It doesn't mean that you can't like bitcoin, that you can't think it's going higher, but I think you have to be aware of that. Wood: All cryptocurrency generally as a class has very passionate defenders, and I feel like I can hear them saying, \"You're an investment banker. There's every reason for you to say you don't like bitcoin because you're interested in protecting the status quo.\" Tchir: Yes, I could see that. On the other hand, I came from the credit derivatives background. I've always been in new product development. I would be very happy to bring to my institution, if we felt it was worthwhile, cryptocurrency. I come into this looking for opportunities for investors, and it's through my digging in this that I've become uncomfortable, that I'm not yet at the point of believing that this is something that should be traded actively or that fits into a bank. Wood: Is bitcoin a big enough part of the economy that wild price fluctuations or price manipulation could have other side effects or could have more far-reaching economic impact? Tchir: I don't think it's big enough quite yet, but if you go back, there was a spike in credit card default rates earlier this year, and shortly after you saw a lot of the big banks stop allowing people to buy bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies on their credit cards. So yeah, I think there were actually people speculating with credit card money to buy bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, and that's, I think, very problematic for those individuals. I think it's a very, very speculative asset class. It's not a currency, despite being called that. We hear stories of students using their student loans to buy bitcoin. And it does hit stocks, if you look at stocks like Invidia, where the chips that they use have been a very big part of [cryptocurrency] miners. You've also seen energy stocks hit.

Big businesses, including Intel, IBM and Microsoft, as well as countless startups, are betting hard on the technology. But scams, confusion, hype and gyrating valuations make it hard to assess what's a good idea.\nGarlinghouse is pretty clear he thinks the granddaddy of cryptocurrencies, bitcoin, is now in the bad idea category, at least for its original use, a replacement for ordinary money. Bitcoin's blockchain ledger records transactions on a global network of computers that no single entity controls. But actually buying something is a problem, he said.\n\"People talk about using bitcoin to buy coffee,\" Garlinghouse said. \"The average bitcoin transaction can take as much as 20 minutes. And the transaction cost is going to double the price of your coffee.\"\nGarlinghouse, unsurprisingly, thinks his company has a better alternative.\nRipple is one of the higher-profile startups in the world of cryptocurrency. Its XRP has the third-largest market capitalization after bitcoin and the Ethereum's Project's ether. The currency is set up for the finance world tasks like bank-to-bank money payments across borders that settle faster than conventional transfers. Ripple counts big names in banking like American Express, RBC, Santander and Credit Agricole as partners.\nThe value of Ripple's cryptocurrency, XRP, has fluctuated dramatically over the last year.\nCoinmarketcap.com XRP hasn't been immune to volatility, though. And Ripple faces a lawsuit alleging that it violated securities laws in its handling of XRP .\nCutting transaction costs and speeding transaction times for banks might not be something the average person understands or gets excited about. But that doesn't mean it's not important, he says. \"That's a multi-trillion dollar problem,\" Garlinghouse said. \"I don't think blockchain is solving consumer problems yet.\"\nCompanies want blockchain to revolutionize everything from concert ticket sales and online betting to car maintenance records and carbon emission tracking . But Ripple is focusing on the relatively narrow job of cross-border payments.\n\"Blockchain has its own peanut butter problem,\" he said, referring to his famous 2006 memo criticizing his then employer, Yahoo, for being spread too thin . \"There are lots of industries that can be touched, but it starts with one.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://events.recode.net/events/code-conference-2018/", "https://ripple.com/", "https://ripple.com/xrp/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brad garlinghouse ripple bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pandora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garlinghouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spotify", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad garlinghouse", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnet", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ibm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "napster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-31T00:22:15.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cc3867eec61c94cfce0bb5a80b60d43088aa2124", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisaGDq2UlHqrZpCpXL61UWvvcjFgSjAr1C.5cWlqunoADhslCBepMRzqGqNFTF0G.hg--", "site_full": "www.forexfactory.com", "site": "forexfactory.com", "site_section": "https://www.forexfactory.com/forumdisplay.php?f=137", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Interactive Trading @ Forex Factory", "title": "The rise of CRYPTO - Bitcoin, LTC, Ether, Dash, Monero 77", "title_full": "The rise of CRYPTO - Bitcoin, LTC, Ether, Dash, Monero - Page 77 @ Forex Factory", "published": "2018-05-30T23:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn-assets.forexfactory.net/images/misc/hotthread7.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2596, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cc3867eec61c94cfce0bb5a80b60d43088aa2124", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisaGDq2UlHqrZpCpXL61UWvvcjFgSjAr1C.5cWlqunoADhslCBepMRzqGqNFTF0G.hg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Not-KPMG", "published": "2018-05-30T23:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "The rise of CRYPTO - Bitcoin, LTC, Ether, Dash, Monero 77", "text": "Quoting Eur Usd Disliked {Quote: } Hopefully I am wrong and you are right ‚ò∫ Ignored I'm buying some more\nLook up folks.

government is moving to confiscate 191 bitcoins seized in a child-porn cybercrime case in which the perpetrator has now been sentenced to jail and a $640,000 fine.\nAccording to Korean news agency Yonhap, the move comes after South Korea‚Äôs Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that cryptocurrencies can be seen as property with value that can be subject to forfeiture in criminal cases.\nAs of press time, the nearly 200 bitcoins are worth a little over $1.4 million, according to CoinDesk‚Äôs Bitcoin Price Index.\nThe Supreme Court order backs up a previous ruling from an appeal that overturned a lower court‚Äôs decision to reject a prosecutor‚Äôs petition to forfeit the criminal‚Äôs cryptocurrency assets.\nAccording to Yonhap, the lower court denied the request based on the argument that cryptocurrencies only ‚Äúexist electronically and have no physical form.‚Äù However, the appeals court later concluded that cryptocurrency can be seen as ‚Äúprofit earned from trade in goods.‚Äù\nIt remains unclear, however, as to how the South Korea authority would handle the forfeited digital assets. That said, today‚Äôs decision marks a notable legal reference, since there are ongoing criminal cases in South Korea involving cryptocurrencies.\nAs previously reported by CoinDesk, prosecutors from the Incheon district filed a suit in December 2017 against a firm called Max Mining and 21 suspects in an alleged $250-million cryptocurrency mining fraud.\nMost recently, prosecutors in Seoul have also raided several local cryptocurrency exchanges over suspicions of fraud and embezzlement, reportedly seizing assets for further investigation.\nGavel and Korean won image via Shutterstock\nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It would really hard now to start mining with bitcoin because it is the very first coin and the market price is very high now, plus the electricity cost it would be really hard now to earn with bitcoin. If you like to do mining you can actually mine different coins out there and it would be more profitable then mining in bitcoin mining.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

it's transactions well I think it will be beneficial to have a little discussion on this .\nFirst of all if you own a bank account in a good bank then you should know that its very hard to hack one's bank account, it's almost impossible unless done due to personal flaws, like sharing your key or bank account details or something , you know the system behind Bitcoins and the system behind banking system is same .\nSomething by the name of cryptography whose Advance form is block chain . It's a complex code involving complex mathematics and the transactions are only completed through very complex and complicated steps impossible to penetrate.\nFor Bitcoins the same thing operates but with no intervening part or whatsoever , it's p2p direct transactions and this is even more secure and private.\nThe reason why you hear news like :- someone got their Bitcoins stolen or something is because they have personal flaws , they shared the private keys or the password with someone else..or they used a bad wallet.\nIt's on you how safe you make it .\nBitcoin is a consensus network that enables new payment systems ... Low risk for sellers - Bitcoin transactions are very secure, can not ....

In someway it won't happen because more on people who earn bitcoin only focuses on thier personal needs.\nFor me bitcoin is big help to us. If we like to help beggars using our bitcoin or using bitcoin I think you give help to them just like foods, shelter, clothes etc. Unlike bitcoin, because they dont know how to used bitcoin, and they confused what is really use of bitcoin.\nBegging is a term which represents the economic inability of a country to redistribute the income in the country. Giving money to beggars is an act classified in economic welfare and not economic improvement. Besides, what Bitcoin can actually do in this case is that it can provide investment opportunities to those less fortunate in a country and nothing else.

Hey, can you do this?'\" Hanyecz - Work - Bitcoin - Side - Project Hanyecz said that even though his work on bitcoin was a side project that he worked on for free, Nakamoto treated him like he was a full time employee.\"He'd say: 'Hey, the west side's down.'

Despite the increasing popularity of bitcoin mining around the globe, though, there are quite a few places where it‚Äôs illegal. In this article, we‚Äôll look at a few different cases to get a better picture of exactly why more governments are shutting down these operations.\nChina In many nations, owning and/or trading cryptocurrency has officially been banned. However, these rulings haven‚Äôt necessarily led to a shutdown of bitcoin mining. China is one of the few countries that has imposed nation-wide bans on both trading and mining.\nBefore the bitcoin mining ban was announced earlier this year, China accounted for more than 70% of the world‚Äôs bitcoin mining operations. Mining statistics aren‚Äôt available post-ban, so it‚Äôs difficult to tell the overall impact of the ban as of this writing. There have been a few coordinated raids, including one in April 2018 in Tianjin where 600 mining computers and eight high-power fans were seized.\nChinese officials are formulating strategies on how to shut down mining operations. This was made evident by leaked documents released earlier in 2018. According to an article published by Vice , ‚ÄúIn the documents, issued to the local offices of the internet-finance regulator, authorities were instructed to force mining operations out of business using measures linked to electricity pricing, land use, tax and environmental protection.‚Äù\nEnvironmental factors are important to consider as a legitimate reason for the bitcoin mining ban in China. While annual carbon emissions growth in China only grew by 1.4% (well short of the projected 2.0%) in 2017, China still accounts for around 30% of global carbon emissions. Considering that bitcoin mining now makes up 0.6% of the world‚Äôs total energy consumption, and possibly more in the future, it‚Äôs a real concern that the cryptocurrency community must address.\nNonetheless, others say that the reason for the mining ban is simply related to the goal of enforcing a shutdown of all cryptocurrencies in general throughout China. The ability to create a new financial system could be seen as a threat to the current one. Even though this possibility isn‚Äôt unique to China, it‚Äôs important to consider China‚Äôs reaction to these changes now that it‚Äôs the world‚Äôs top economy by GDP. In reaction to the ban, some bitcoin miners have moved their mining operations overseas to places where both bitcoin trading and mining are legal.\nPhoto Credit: Bloomberg\nUSA (Upstate New York) Even though the United States federal government hasn‚Äôt placed a ban on bitcoin mining, some local governments have enacted legislation of their own bans.\nFor example, Plattsburgh, New York, a 20,000-resident town located about 20 miles from the Canadian border, has placed an 18-month moratorium on bitcoin mining. In the past few years, Plattsburgh had become a hub for bitcoin miners due to cheap electricity prices thanks to hydroelectric power production on the St. Lawrence River.\nHowever, the introduction of bitcoin mining has led to higher electricity costs for all residents. This was because the hydroelectric facility had to produce more than the typical allotted amount of energy to support mining operations. For example, in December 2017 and January 2018, even some residents who didn‚Äôt mine saw electric bills rise by $300.\nThose who might consider breaking this new law may want to think again ‚Äì the penalty is set at $1,000/day of illegal mining. In Washington state Chelan County Public Utility District (PUD), there‚Äôs also a similar ban in place . One unauthorized bitcoin mining operation with electricity consumption of over 11,000 kWh has been shut down. Prior to authorities pulling the plug, this operation consumed about 20x the electricity of standard households.\nPhoto Credit: Bloomberg Malaysia As written in another concentral article , Malaysia has cracked down on illegal residential-based mining operations. In a coordinated raid, two of the country‚Äôs bitcoin mining farms were shut down. These operations were deemed illegal, not because of an overall ban on bitcoin mining, but because the individuals in charge of these operations didn‚Äôt have official business permits.\nEven though it‚Äôs not clear how easy or difficult it is to obtain government permission to run a mining operation in Malaysia, it is clear that complaints from neighbors were an important factor leading to the shutdowns. Neighbors reported that the operations caused power fluctuations and that the tenants were loud and disorderly.\nPhoto credit: coincentral\nEven Legal Bitcoin Mining Could Lead to Illegal Activities Many nations or cities don‚Äôt have any laws banning mining or even requiring business permits as in the cases detailed above; however, there are many individual operations that have been shut down due to a few different reasons that constituted illegal mining activity.\nOne such incident occurred in Orenburg, Russia in April 2018. In this case, two individuals were arrested after it was discovered that they had created a bitcoin mining farm within an abandoned rubber factory. They were charged with property damage and a few other crimes. Also, these illegal miners stole 8 million kW/h of electricity valued at around 60 million rubles (~$1 million).\nIncidents like this are more common than you might think. For example, in the US, state government officials in both New York and Louisiana unlawfully used government resources to set up mining operations.\nWorkers at an Australian weather reporting agency also committed similar illegal activities. In all of these cases, it‚Äôs important to note that bitcoin mining itself was not illegal. However, the ways in which mining operations went about mining were illegal. If individuals had used their own time, money, and resources to mine, they would most likely face no legal issues.\nAlthough there are still quite a few areas where bitcoin mining is illegal, it seems as if the banning trend is slowing down. As long as miners proceed in a way that doesn‚Äôt negatively affect the lives of those around them, it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising to see these governments reverse the bans they‚Äôve put in place.\nThis article by Delton Rhodes was originally published at CoinCentral.com\nOpinions expressed by techsutram contributors and partners are their own.

Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes.\nAt first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.\nA server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.\nThe bandwidth [required for running a network node] might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.\nVisa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth , or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.\nIf the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.\nSource\nThe existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide. Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost. It never really hits a scale ceiling. If you‚Äôre interested, I can go over the ways it would cope with extreme size .\nBy Moore‚Äôs Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 years and 100 times faster in 10. Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy adoption rates, I think computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of transactions .\nSource\nThe current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale. That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server. The design supports letting users just be users.\nThe more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be. Those few nodes will be big server farms. The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate .\nSource\nWhile I don't think Bitcoin is practical for smaller micropayments right now, it will eventually be as storage and bandwidth costs continue to fall [on the global market]. If Bitcoin catches on on a big scale, it may already be the case by that time. Another way they can become more practical is if I implement the client-only mode [which uses the \"Simplified Payment Verification\" described in the design PDF] and the number of network nodes [more rapidly] consolidates into a smaller number of professional server farms . Whatever size micropayments you need will eventually be practical. I think in 5 or 10 years, the bandwidth and storage will seem trivial .\nSource\nIt would be nice to keep the blk*.dat files small as long as we can.\nThe eventual solution will be to not care how big it gets.\nBut for now, while it's still small , it's nice to keep it small so new users can get going faster. When I eventually implement client-only mode , that won't matter much anymore.\nSource\nIt can be phased in, like:\nif (blocknumber > 115000) maxblocksize = largerlimit\nIt can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.\nWhen we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade.\nSource\n submitted by /u/fruitsofknowledge\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=532.msg6306#msg6306", "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.0", "https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/2/", "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=287.msg8810#msg8810", "https://nakamotostudies.org/emails/satoshi-reply-to-mike-hearn/", "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=287.msg7687#msg7687"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T18:47:35.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b8c6cb083e3ee39a25713ec67dc2198a29ef78c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisYyLGR85yITV5RLmJ8_Ky_uUgEUrxQA0644FPeCJaRqXUgO.EHCMpwd7GylcvH.IWhy64a91sFaUJdkRey5.k8nr9urMho0jWBMMVGctIr5s79udofDO94jd9FJZzGJU1UxYPVZ3afE172_yz4LJV.iqJC6B6mNdYg--", "site_full": "www.forexlive.com", "site": "forexlive.com", "site_section": "http://www.forexlive.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "Forexlive RSS Breaking News Feed", "title": "Bitcoin bears remain in control as the rally stalls against technical resistance", "title_full": "Bitcoin bears remain in control as the rally stalls against technical resistance", "published": "2018-05-30T22:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://az705044.vo.msecnd.net/20180530/2018-05-30_15-11-37.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 43953, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b8c6cb083e3ee39a25713ec67dc2198a29ef78c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisYyLGR85yITV5RLmJ8_Ky_uUgEUrxQA0644FPeCJaRqXUgO.EHCMpwd7GylcvH.IWhy64a91sFaUJdkRey5.k8nr9urMho0jWBMMVGctIr5s79udofDO94jd9FJZzGJU1UxYPVZ3afE172_yz4LJV.iqJC6B6mNdYg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Greg Michalowski", "published": "2018-05-30T22:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin bears remain in control as the rally stalls against technical resistance", "text": "Bitcoin bears remain in control as the rally stalls against technical resistance Wed 30 May 2018 19:28:22 GMT Author: share 200 hour MA stalls the rally The price of bitcoin moved higher yesterday and in the process moved above the 100 hour MA (blue line in the chart below). That was a bullish move as on May 27 AND May 28th, that MA stalled the rallies. Getting above was a change in the momentum/bias. The price moved higher. Where did it go? The 200 hour MA becomes one of the next targets. In trading today, the price moved to that MA line (green line) on a three separate occasions. Each found sellers leaning against the level. Finally, the buyers gave up. The sellers grew and started to win. The price moved lower. The fall has taken the price below the 100 hour MA now (blue line). That MA comes in at $7331.92. We currently trade at $7293, down $205 on the day. If the price can stay below that MA, the sellers are putting the pressure on the buyers again. A move back toward the lows at $7058 might be in the near future. Taking a broader look at the daily chart below, the low from yesterday did find support against a lower trend line on that chart. The buying against it, was a low risk trade. The price moved higher for the test of that 200 hour MA.

Everyone seems to be interested in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin now has a market cap of over $124.9 billion. People around the world regret not investing their money into Bitcoin when the digital currency was in its early stages, and cheap. But sadly Bitcoin is banned in several countries. Central banks and authorities remain skeptical of the new currency. Below is the list of countries where Bitcoin is banned.\nChina\nAlthough China has become the world‚Äôs largest Bitcoin trading market,the country has strictly banned digital currencies on banks because 70% of the central banking authority is owned by the Chinese government. Banks and their employees are prohibited to get involved in Bitcoin business through banking, as well as engaging in business or servicing with Bitcoin industry. For common citizens, trading using Bitcoin is not banned yet.\nBangladesh\nIn September 2014, Bangladesh mentioned that Bitcoin lacks any central payment system due to which they banned it. They believe that it could financially harm their citizens. Hence, if you are found using Bitcoin trading in Bangladesh, it would lead to legal actions under Money Laundering Control Act and Foreign Currency Control Act.\nNepal\nNepalese government banned Bitcoin, citing their inability to track the transactions. So, it is illegal throughout the country and individuals suspected for trading of Bitcoin are arrested.\nBolivia\nIn June 2014, Bolivian government officially banned all cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin as these are not controlled by the government.\nKyrgyzstan\nIn July 2014, Kyrgyz Republic‚Äôs National Bank banned and declared illegal all digital currencies including Bitcoin. They made it illegal because these digital currencies lack the control of government making private and public regulations unfeasible. It stated that only national currency of the country, Som, is legal to use.\nMorocco\nIn November 2017, Morocco proclaimed that it will no longer accept Bitcoin as a mode of payment. The reason for banning it was that it is a hidden payment system which is not regulated by any financial institution.\nEcuador\nIn July 2014, Ecuador‚Äôs National Assembly has outlawed digital currencies including Bitcoin as they laid outline for formation of new, state-run electronic cash system. They had to protect their nation system from something more superior like Bitcoin. The government is allowed to use electronic money for payments but other digital currencies like Bitcoin is banned and declared illegal for all citizens.\nIceland\nIn March 2014, the Central Bank of Iceland released a report stating the legal status of digital currencies in Iceland. If you purchase Bitcoin in Iceland, it will be considered a violation of Icelandic Foreign Exchange Act which states that Iceland currency cannot leave the country.\nThailand\nIn July 2013, the Bank of Thailand declared Bitcoin as illegal due to lack of existing laws in case of currency exchange license application by the Bitcoin Co. Ltd.\nRussia\nIn February 2014, Russian banned Bitcoin by declaring it as money substitute which cannot be used by legal entities or individuals. The use of Bitcoin in Russia is considered as a ‚Äúpotentially suspicious‚Äù activity as the Russian government has linked the usage of Bitcoin to illegal activities.\nList of Countries Where Bitcoin is Banned: Bitcoin is Illegal in these Countries\nFahad Saleem\nOriginal article: List of Countries Where Bitcoin is Banned: Bitcoin is Illegal in these Countries .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean islands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bangladesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-30T22:55:19.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d4fb507be56a6b4841dac991ad29a992159770d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRrQMwA9kyMdNPdmB157RA8Z7wLewMsoPT5pbI_ZS.SWeWSH8dN96W03BZj2x3mq3vPjVHRkaC1LzsMtPD8ig6ZIwkzn_SyiZZmhlhmP5FHKtnQxXYPm74Yssed54yuz3U-", "site_full": "www.businessinsider.com", "site": "businessinsider.com", "site_section": "http://www.businessinsider.my/feed", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Business Insider Malaysia", "title": "Satoshi Nakamoto was weird, paranoid, and bossy, says early bitcoin developer who exchanged hundreds of emails with the mysterious crypto creator", "title_full": "Satoshi Nakamoto was weird, paranoid, and bossy, says early bitcoin developer who exchanged hundreds of emails with the mysterious crypto creator", "published": "2018-05-30T22:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.businessinsider.my/sites/3/2018/05/5b0ed38e1ae6624c008b48c1.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 283, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d4fb507be56a6b4841dac991ad29a992159770d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRrQMwA9kyMdNPdmB157RA8Z7wLewMsoPT5pbI_ZS.SWeWSH8dN96W03BZj2x3mq3vPjVHRkaC1LzsMtPD8ig6ZIwkzn_SyiZZmhlhmP5FHKtnQxXYPm74Yssed54yuz3U-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Zo√´ Bernard , Business Insider US", "published": "2018-05-30T22:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Satoshi Nakamoto was weird, paranoid, and bossy, says early bitcoin developer who exchanged hundreds of emails with the mysterious crypto creator", "text": "May 30, 2018 caption A man once believed to be Bitcoin currency founder Satoshi Nakamoto is surrounded by reporters as he leaves his home in Temple City, California March 6, 2014. source REUTERS/David McNew\nSatoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, evaporated from the web seven years ago.
