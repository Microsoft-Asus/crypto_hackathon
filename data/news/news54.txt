So let me explain in a very simple way why Bitcoin and other digital currencies are globalist fronts. I’ll start by showing you the key elements of Bitcoin from the Simple English Wikipedia… “Bitcoin is a digital and global money system (currency). It allows people to send or receive money across the internet, even to someone they don’t know or don’t trust. Money can be exchanged without being linked to a real identity. The mathematical field of cryptography is the basis for Bitcoin’s security… One of the differences between using bitcoin and using regular money online is that bitcoin can be used without having to link any sort of real-world identity to it. Unless someone chooses to link their name to a bitcoin address, it is hard to tell who owns the address. Bitcoin does not keep track of users; it keeps track of addresses where the money is. Each address has two important pieces of cryptographic information, or keys: a public one and a private one… Sites or users using the Bitcoin system are required to use a global database called the blockchain. The blockchain is a record of all transactions that have taken place in the Bitcoin network. It also keeps track of new bitcoins as they are generated. With these two facts, the blockchain is able to keep track of who has how much money at all times.” So Bitcoin records EVERY TRANSACTION, which is something the Globalist Banksters have always wanted to do. But people think it doesn’t matter because they are supposedly protected by anonymity and encryption. THEY MOST DEFINITELY ARE NOT.

Hotels in many of the locations including Moscow, Kaliningrad, and St Petersburg have been accepting Bitcoin bookings since April, and it has proven to be an excellent way for fans to avoid the usual currency exchange headaches.\nAirline bookings are also available for crypto users, with budget airlines such as CheapAir and travel agency Destinia offering cryptocurrency bookings. For those wanting to take a gamble and bet on the outcome and results of matches, Bitcoin sportsbooks, reputed to be the future of betting, allows players from all over the world, without restriction, to participate regardless of what part of the globe they hail from. Users can make instant and free withdrawals and deposits whenever they want.\nUS companies Visa and MasterCard have blocked credit card services to some Russian bank customers in the past as a result of U.S. sanctions which have been in force since 2014. As this affects digital payments, it remains to be seen if fans from overseas are able to bypass such difficulties. Although, the Russian hospitality industry has become increasingly welcoming towards digital currencies with the increased customer traffic it is bringing as a result of the event.\nThe advantage of Bitcoin as a decentralized currency, free for political interference, is that users can make payments wherever they go using the internet. With an increasing number of merchants accepting bitcoin and other digital currencies, tourists to Russia should be able to pay for some goods and services using their digital currencies without too many difficulties.\nRussia’s overseas invasion of card-carrying bitcoin users is predicted to expand traffic of the network, should they decide to spend their money using digital currency.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at @BitcoinNewsCom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews\nThe post Will Bitcoin Score at 2018 FIFA World Cup as Russia Opens Doors to Crypto appeared first on BitcoinNews.com .

The company tried to reassure clients their funds were safe and that it has taken steps to increase the speed of the identity verification process. Additionally covered was the fact that the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has revealed it is investigating two dozen unauthorized cryptocurrency-related ventures and has also opened seven whistle-blower reports in 2018 alone.\nThe big news on Tuesday was that cybersecurity expert turned pump and dump guru John McAfee has issued another bullish prediction. Bitcoin (BTC) will surpass $15,000 in June, but will dip in July, McAfee predicted.\nHis prediction was in contrast with Russian analysts who expect that value of BTC will continue to drop, even below the psychological $6,000 USD threshold.

Here’s a brief rundown.\nThe word “Ethereum” has been referenced in more than 110 million Google searches in the last two years, the blog noted. On average, #ethereum gets tweeted 20,000 times daily.\nThe ETH network has processed about 240 million transactions. On Jan. 4, it set a record of 1.3 million transactions in a 24-hour period. Source: Etherscan\nNearly 17,000 nodes operating the Ethereum blockchain on six continents make it the most decentralized blockchain platform, one sign of this being 35 million unique addresses. The number of active addresses on Jan. 4 for the first time exceeded 1 million and created a record of more than 350,000 new addresses in 24 hours.\nIt is also the platform most involved with smart contracts, which are arguably one of the most dynamic tools in technology today. Ninety-four percent of the top 100 tokens based on market cap are built on Ethereum, as are 87% of the top 800 tokens. The tokens built on ETH are largely responsible for the $5.5 billion raised in 2017 token sales and $6.5 billion raised in the present year’s first quarter. The Largest Blockchain Developer Community\nEthereum’s estimated 250,000 developers also represent the largest blockchain developer community. Truffle, an ETH development framework, exceeded 200,000 downloads in October of 2017. Github cites 220,000 Ethereum commits and 14,000 repositories.\nThe MetaMask browser extension that permits users to operate Ethereum DApps without operating a full Ethereum node has exceeded 1 million users.\nFoundations, organizations, businesses and startups have joined alliances to benefit from the Ethereum ecosystem, the most visible being The Ethereum Enterprise Alliance has expanded to more than 500 members in one year.\nGovernments worldwide looking to utilize blockchain technology have largely used Ethereum. Brazil this year decided to place petitions on the coin’s network. Canada is testing Ethereum to enable citizens to have access to information about the use of government grants to address concerns about corruption. Zug, Switzerland has offered digital IDs registered on Ethereum, and Chile tracks energy grid data using it. Dubai is working to become a fully blockchain powered city by 2020, while Estonia became a “digital republic” using Ethereum.\nAlso read: More than 1,000 DApps have launched since 2017 1,552 dApps To Date\nDApps are the blockchain’s main selling point, allowing developers to create smart contracts. A total of 1,552 dApps have been created with more in development.\nNumerous scalability projects, meanwhile, are looking to provide layer 2 solutions, also known as “inter-blockchain protocols.”\nA permissionless network for developers called Cosmos enables interoperability and scaling of the blockchain. Loom Network has launched a layer 2 platform on Ethereum that allows social and gaming dApps to scale. CryptoZombies is an app allowing anyone to be able to code smart contracts. OmiseGO enables the sending of fast transactions across borders with plasma.\nSo what does this data mean for the future of cryptocurrency and decentralized networks in general? According to ConsenSys, it means that Ethereum will play an important role in the development of the next stage of the internet — Web 3.0.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "million times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eth", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-04T02:26:57.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fe99cc6a82bb5bc033e91c2d41f028cbe2693210", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWhOsjK58AjF1Nxal.ZWpjc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=67.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Altcoin Discussion", "title": "Why Bitcoin is top rank coin?", "title_full": "Why Bitcoin is top rank coin?", "published": "2018-06-03T22:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 16, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fe99cc6a82bb5bc033e91c2d41f028cbe2693210", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWhOsjK58AjF1Nxal.ZWpjc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kamengbate553", "published": "2018-06-03T22:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Bitcoin is top rank coin?", "text": "I think that aside from being the first crypto currency to be found, this is the first state coin offer to try to make it legally adaptable.

(GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota) Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman has made waves in the tech community in recent weeks with a series of statements attempting to cut through contentious topics like housing and taxation.\nDuring a call with analysts to discuss Redfin's quarterly financials, Kelman sounded off on the nation's housing market. Then he emerged as an alternative voice during the tense debate over a tax on Seattle big businesses, urging the business and tech community to offer solutions rather than just opposing every new policy.\nKelman's civic streak continued during a wide-ranging talk at the Technology Alliance annual luncheon Friday, where he talked about the need to solve Seattle's political challenges , lest the city turn into San Francisco 2.0, where no one but the highest paid techies can afford to live. He also delved into Redfin's past, present and future.\nKelman also has a knack for the off-beat comment. During his Tech Alliance talk, moderated by Seattle tech exec Liz Pearce, chief revenue officer at Streem Inc., he discussed family life, the phenomenon of cryptocurrency, Amazon and more. Here were some of the best moments from the talk:\nOn Bitcoin: \"I am not excited about Bitcoin. I think it's an outrage that in an era of global warming there are racks of servers next to the Columbia River. I wish I could explain to the salmon that we've created a dam generating hydroelectric power so that we can generate a fake currency.\"\nBuying too much on Amazon: \"You know how you go to the grocery store and think 'all of this is going to become poop?' In the same way, I see everything coming through the front door, and I try to explain that our house is of a finite size, so an equal amount has to be going through the back door. We now have a second recycling bin because of Amazon.\"\nLeaving your work stress at the door at the end of the day: \"You come home, you're really upset about something at work, and you're standing there in the rain and the water is streaming off your helmet and you see this bright scene in the kitchen with you and your kids and just think 'I can't F with that.

(GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota) Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman has made waves in the tech community in recent weeks with a series of statements attempting to cut through contentious topics like housing and taxation.\nDuring a call with analysts to discuss Redfin’s quarterly financials, Kelman sounded off on the nation’s housing market. Then he emerged as an alternative voice during the tense debate over a tax on Seattle big businesses, urging the business and tech community to offer solutions rather than just opposing every new policy.\nKelman’s civic streak continued during a wide-ranging talk at the Technology Alliance annual luncheon Friday, where he talked about the need to solve Seattle’s political challenges , lest the city turn into San Francisco 2.0, where no one but the highest paid techies can afford to live. He also delved into Redfin’s past, present and future.\nKelman also has a knack for the off-beat comment. During his Tech Alliance talk, moderated by Seattle tech exec Liz Pearce, chief revenue officer at Streem Inc., he discussed family life, the phenomenon of cryptocurrency, Amazon and more. Here were some of the best moments from the talk:\nOn Bitcoin: “I am not excited about Bitcoin. I think it’s an outrage that in an era of global warming there are racks of servers next to the Columbia River. I wish I could explain to the salmon that we’ve created a dam generating hydroelectric power so that we can generate a fake currency.”\nBuying too much on Amazon: “You know how you go to the grocery store and think ‘all of this is going to become poop?’ In the same way, I see everything coming through the front door, and I try to explain that our house is of a finite size, so an equal amount has to be going through the back door. We now have a second recycling bin because of Amazon.”\nLeaving your work stress at the door at the end of the day: “You come home, you’re really upset about something at work, and you’re standing there in the rain and the water is streaming off your helmet and you see this bright scene in the kitchen with you and your kids and just think ‘I can’t F with that. I got to go crazy when I get in there and say how excited I am to see my kids.’ If it was just me I’d probably go get a bag of Doritos and go down to the basement and cry myself to death.”\nThe misery of being driven: “Behind the driven person is just an enormous amount of misery. You have to be miserable with the status quo to want to change it.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "glenn kelman", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kevin lis", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "kelman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liz pearce", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "redfin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tech alliance", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "technology alliance", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T22:21:28.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7e5f9a806b4f9396d3223ee3be43f4b917f2731c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz4aVGmGbDsk9ozVXfHh1omg-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-03T22:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7e5f9a806b4f9396d3223ee3be43f4b917f2731c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu9aqhaxZYaTXSI3qgBZ4LYcsAfJhxa0Vz4aVGmGbDsk9ozVXfHh1omg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-03T22:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ June 3, 2018 NEWS Huobi Creates Its Own Cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) Bitcoin News (press release) ... has decided to create its own ETF style instrument based on its recently launched index of ten digital assets.

The video demonstrating Sweetbit can be found in the below tweet: Just finished my Bitcoin-enabled candy dispenser\n— David Knezić (@davidknezic) May 27, 2018\nIn the video, David Knezic scans a QR code attached to the Sweetbit machine with a Bitcoin wallet on his mobile phone, and this instantly tells his wallet which address to send the Bitcoin to. Using QR codes is an excellent way to avoid errors when sending Bitcoin, since missing one letter or number in a Bitcoin address can result in your Bitcoin payment getting lost.\nHe then enters the amount he wants to pay for the candy, in this example he uses 1 Swiss Franc (CHF). The transaction fee is 0.09 CHF, which is a bit less than the current average transaction fee of 0.19 CHF (USD and CHF are at parity as of this writing). Bitcoin transaction fees have been much higher than this in the recent past, and in general, a solution like the Lightning Network is needed to ensure Bitcoin micropayments will be feasible over a long term.\nWithin seconds of sending the Bitcoin, the Sweetbit machine dispenses the candy, showing just how incredibly fast and seamless a Bitcoin transaction can be. David Knezic designed it so that it dispenses exactly how much candy you pay for. Sweetbit uses information directly from blockchain.info to see if any payments come in, and is set to dispense candy as soon as a transaction comes in and does not wait for any confirmations.\nMost merchants wait for at least 1 confirmation on a Bitcoin transaction before giving a customer the goods or services they paid for, to prevent being scammed by double spend transactions from a 51% attack. Realistically though a 51% attack would take an incredible amount of mining power to perform successfully, and it is unfathomable that someone would do a 51% attack to rip off a candy machine. Generally, for micropayments like candy, coffee, and beer there is no need to wait for confirmations.\nDavid Knezic made the code for Sweetbit open source and released it on GitHub . He says he is looking to develop a similar program which uses the Bitcoin Lightning Network, which can process far more transactions per second at a lower fee.\nThis sort of technology is what’s needed for Bitcoin to become a global currency.

After a steep dip, we now see an equally steep uptrend materialize out of the blue.\nFor the Bitcoin Cash price, things are quickly moving up, as the value has increased by over $300 since May 29. A very positive trend, albeit one that will be difficult to maintain.\nSimilar to most other cryptocurrencies on the market today, this past week has proven to be both interesting and slightly confusing. To put this into perspective, the week was off to a terrible start, with most markets losing over 10% in a 24-hour span.\nFor the Bitcoin Cash price, this results in a dip from $970 to $889.57 in very quick succession. Although such dips are not entirely uncommon in the world of cryptocurrency, it is never a good sign. This time around, the situation has turned around once again, as the Bitcoin Cash price has recovered quite nicely ever since that dip.\nThanks to solid gains virtually every day since May 29th, the Bitcoin Cash price has now increased to $1,128 again. A very positive trend, although one that can always turn around at any given moment.

In the fiat gambling industry the sites and physical casinos don't compete on house edge, they compete to have the best promotions and comps.\nThis is just a personal view of the freebitco.in business model that I've always thought is why he does it the way he does. The higher house edge allows all the giveaways. The faucet, free lottery tickets, RP etc. is what is used to promote the site and bring customers in. That's the way it works on the Vegas strip, free drinks, free dinner and if you play enough a suite for the night. That's how the casinos try to outdo each other, you won't see them advertising lower house edge because that doesn't mean anything to 99% of potential customers.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T17:04:35.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3650aae7d432000f1a9ef3435df64bcd89a7936c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va73ubJ3PoFhu6sQSbyeOGo3eldpEGi2Xv7W91d0bFKH912bMRfpSIiEj_VOuW23LdVg--", "site_full": "bitcoin.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Bitcoin Stack Exchange", "title": "whats the use case of bitcoins?", "title_full": "whats the use case of bitcoins?", "published": "2018-06-03T21:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/bitcoin/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=462e8b9b382b", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 179, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3650aae7d432000f1a9ef3435df64bcd89a7936c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va73ubJ3PoFhu6sQSbyeOGo3eldpEGi2Xv7W91d0bFKH912bMRfpSIiEj_VOuW23LdVg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "KAKA BOOKIE", "published": "2018-06-03T21:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "whats the use case of bitcoins?", "text": "chytrik 3,115 2 3 20 i am asking on macro level, Say whole supply of 2.1 millions bitcoins are lent at 10%, from where does that 10% will come ? – KAKA BOOKIE 5 hours ago there will be increasing debt vs fixed supply – KAKA BOOKIE 5 hours ago In any system, not all loans will be (or perhaps can be) repaid. Indeed, in the legacy financial system, the derivatives and debt market is many, many times larger than the actual monetary supply. What you have described is a property of systems of debt, not an issue only inherent to bitcoin. In any case, if all of the system's liquidity is on loan, and then the loans are all called to be settled at the same time, then some loans will be unable to be repaid, and the debtor will lose out. Other loans will have made profit, and be able to settle fully. This is no different than the legacy system – chytrik 5 hours ago Put differently: A loan is always a risk, in that the loan maker may not be repaid later. A loan denominated in a deflationary aspect may present a larger risk, but it is the same type of risk, just amplified. This may change the willingness of someone to issue a loan, but it does not make the function of a loan obsolete. – chytrik 5 hours ago Do you agree to this : Due to Interest, bitcoins would be created out thin air by the banks/lenders, just like the current fait system which is said to be broken. And there will be defaults and market crashes etc.. So bitcoin is a good decentralised database, it has yet to find its usecase, in no way it can radically change the current system. – KAKA BOOKIE 4 hours ago up vote 0 down vote\nFirst of all I don't think it needs to be so binary (bitcoin or nothing). Fiat and lending will likely co-exist along with bitcoin.\nAdditionally, what if instead of creating a business based on debt, the business owner saved his money for a few years in the deflationary currency and thereby gains the needed funds and discipline to start a business? Debt can be used responsibly and irresponsibly. What we have seen over the last half a century is more and more debt instruments, and less true savings instruments via sound investments. As we saw in the 2008 crisis, banks and retirement money managers were investing/saving in mortgage debt, these bonds were given a value based on non-guaranteed future receivables. Then when the debtor (who has no idea that his mortgage payment is one of many pillars holding up a derivative people are using as a investment instrument) fails to make his mortgage payment, is now breaking the derivative's promise to investors.\nDebt can help fuel short term growth, but when everything is based on debt, even the world reserve currency, then eventually it can have devastating consequences later down the road when too many promises are left unfulfilled. Unfunded domestic liabilities such as social security, and pensions are only promises based on debt. If those promises are broken, you can be sure there will be riots in the streets the next morning.

Finally, as you’ll collect from the title, Bitcoin performs a reasonably grand function, supplanting gold because the historic reserve normal, however by constructing a groundwork understanding of cash’s emergence, historical past, and evolution, Saifedean Ammous makes a sober arrival at his ultimate vacation spot. Cash has historically had three aspects: medium of change, retailer of worth, and unit of account. Sound cash, Ammous’s argument goes, additionally requires salability (“the convenience with which an excellent will be offered available on the market at any time when its holder needs, with the least loss in its worth”) and a excessive stock-to-flow ratio (the ratio of present captured provide to what’s added to it over a given time interval). A lot consideration is dedicated to the significance of a excessive stock-to-flow ratio with the conclusion that Bitcoin will quickly have the very best stock-to-flow of any cash, overtaking gold within the yr 2022 and doubling gold’s in 2025. A excessive stock-to-flow ratio explains why gold has been a constant retailer of worth for millennia and why silver has been a second-place retailer. Demand for cash fluctuates in the identical means it does for items available on the market. When demand spikes, assets are diverted to producing extra of the demanded good — since now the hassle will probably be rewarded with a better worth. The very best cash maintains a excessive stock-to-flow ratio even by durations of excessive cash demand. And this has exactly been the case with gold. Prior to now seven many years, Ammous reveals, gold has averaged an annual development charge of 1.5%, by no means surpassing 2% even in the course of the highest durations of demand. Ramping up mining operations will after all on common lead to some improve in gold manufacturing, however this elevated provide must be measured in opposition to comparatively large present stockpiles, which have been accumulating for millennia freed from corrosion as a consequence of gold’s chemical properties. Silver’s stockpiles, alternatively, diminish by way of corrosion and better charges of commercial consumption. On the similar time silver manufacturing is extra amenable than gold to elevated demand, being extra plentiful and simpler to mine and refine. All of this accumulates to an general decrease stock-to-flow ratio. That is all antithetical to the Keynesian perspective which stipulates that governments management and handle the provision of cash, stimulating throughout downturns when consumption flags. To sum it briefly, Ammous isn’t all that jazzed about this angle. The ebook expands fairly a bit on this, however the main critique is that authorities management lowers cash’s stock-to-flow ratio. The Keynesian program isn’t senseless steady stimulation; at sure junctures it’s time to take away the proverbial punch bowl. But when these moments arrive nobody appears to have the nerve to do it. Alternatively, discovering ourselves in conditions just like the 2008 state of affairs the place the financial system doesn’t make the referred to as for turnaround following extraordinary stimulation, Keynesian economists come to the unfalsifiable conclusion that we merely didn’t stimulate sufficient. There’s no confirmed formulation for correct magnitude of stimulation and so no credible restraint mechanism to forestall a free-floating foreign money from inflating — whether or not it’s the Keynesian “proper time” for this maneuver or not. It seems {that a} cash which will be “managed” will probably be managed fairly closely upward; a superabundance of creativeness isn’t required to conceive of some incentive to create more cash given the flexibility. Milton Friedman too is culpable in all this as an advocate of free-floating currencies and for neglected causative components in his historic analyses. However criticisms listed below are restricted to Friedman’s skilled work, whereas Keynes’s whole life is open to reproach. Keynes devotees will probably be unimpressed, however these criticisms though bitter aren’t strictly advert hominem. In Keynes Ammous diagnoses (pretty or unfairly readers can resolve) persona traits which inform his whole financial philosophy. A significant side of the ebook’s argument for sound cash versus simple cash pertains to the time preferences biased by one in comparison with the opposite. A promoting level for sound cash is its low time choice bias, and Ammous paints Keynes as a excessive time choice particular person who consequently advocated excessive time choice cash. Ammous introduces the idea of time choice with the marshmallow take a look at (by 2018 most likely acquainted to at the least 80% of fashionable non-fiction readers or TED Speak watchers), whereby the youngsters who eat the primary marshmallow proper off the bat have excessive time choice (quick consumption is far more useful to them than future consumption), whereas the youngsters who forgo consumption with a view to double their reward have a decrease time choice (present consumption is just considerably extra useful to them than future consumption, and so when future consumption entails larger payoff than current consumption, they wait). Low time choice is extra more likely to prevail with monies that keep buying energy over time, whereas time choice will increase with monies whose buying energy declines. (Though “nudges” would suggest high down management — which Bitcoin intrinsically deactivates — when you like considering in these phrases, sound cash nudges towards decrease time choice whereas simple cash nudges towards larger time choice.)\nIf society had been slightly lady in that marshmallow experiment Keynesian economics seeks to change the experiment in order that ready would punish the lady by giving her half a marshmallow as a substitute of two, making the whole idea of self-control and low time choice seem counterproductive. Indulging quick pleasures is the extra probably plan of action economically, and that can then replicate on tradition and society at massive. The Austrian faculty, alternatively, by preaching sound cash, acknowledges the truth of the trade-off that nature supplies people, and that if the kid waits, there will probably be extra reward for her, making her happier in the long term, encouraging her to defer her gratification to extend it. The U.S. Federal Reserve targets a 2% inflation charge. This steady devaluation of saved wealth is meant as a gentle financial stimulant. As Ammous has it, information that your wealth’s buying energy isn’t preserved whereas saved in USD incents ranges of risk-taking past what folks would in any other case be disposed to in the event that they knew their wealth was secure. The dangerous investments that turn into vital for people to compensate for the drain on their wealth combination to systemic over compensation. Certainly, this stimulates the financial system, however the deliberate injection synchronizes native ups and downs into systemic oscillations of increase and recession. When, alternatively, wealth is preserved, folks stay free to take danger however with out being goaded into in any other case insupportable ranges. They’re staking actual wealth for the prospect of actual return slightly than lobbing round monetary sizzling potatoes. Beneath this extra Austrian specification we don’t get the systemic cyclicality of top-down injection. Deliberate inflation additionally quantities to an opaque tax — a tax {that a} inhabitants could be much less prepared to abide, for actions they may not approve of, had been all this publically tabulated for clearer inspection. Though this isn’t essentially a small authorities argument; funds will probably be allotted most optimally when all prices are most precisely accounted for regardless of the measurement of the governing physique in query. (Rather more on all of this because it pertains to fractional reserve banking, rates of interest, and Austrian enterprise cycle idea is printed within the ebook.) Nakamoto’s design selection of a 21 million provide cap for Bitcoin seems to be extra of a psychological anchoring level ( some quantity needed to be settled on, and shortage however not a degree of shortage intimidating to newcomers could be an excellent vary to shoot for with a sound cash experiment) than an financial consideration. The community would operate simply as properly with just one bitcoin as long as it had been divisible to the total extent of customers’ wants. (And right here’s the place Bitcoin begins to point out attainable superiority over gold: subdividing a block of gold is far more cumbersome than doing the identical to a bitcoin.) Whereas cash provide itself is the truth is inconsequential, adjusting it will increase unpredictability, destroying data alerts, creating distortions and bubbles, and harming what ought to actually be protected: buying energy. Tying again in with time choice, the concept is that when you spend your cash in ten years it can purchase simply as a lot or extra as it could spending it in the present day. If cash provide itself doesn’t matter (given sufficient divisibility), assets diverted to growing the cash provide may very well be put to extra productive use as a substitute. The better a cash is to create, the extra capital that will probably be unproductively diverted into growing its provide. The signal of an excellent cash is when intensifying efforts to create extra of it’s a unhealthy funding, and Bitcoin’s problem adjustment ensures that extra effort is not going to end result general in a better variety of newly minted cash, preserving holders’ buying energy. As Ammous reveals, the flexibility to govern cash provide is perpetually abused. It’s a lure that — whether or not stemming from tyrannical greed, strategic want for obfuscation, or ill-guided good intentions — doesn’t go unheeded for lengthy. There’s the instance of coin clipping the place metallic clipped from across the edges of formally minted cash allowed Sovereigns to lower the official weights of their cash with a view to mint extra for themselves. There’re additionally examples of remoted preindustrial societies whose previously steady currencies (corresponding to rai stones utilized by Yap Islanders and the glass beads at one time prevalent in west Africa) misplaced all worth when international industrial-scale reproductions flooded native markets. The devastation to native wealth and buying energy was so nice in Africa that they resorted to promoting their very own folks as slaves. Though these industrial-preindustrial uneven interchanges supply disturbingly vivid accounts of financial wreckage, they spotlight the risks of currencies that aren’t sturdy in opposition to provide inflation. Apparently although, these anecdotes paint cash as expertise , maybe not the primary designation everyone would think about. The very best type of cash to this point — by sound cash accounts — has been gold, which definitely doesn’t appear technological. However precisely this type of fruitful considering is how Bitcoin — not with out its personal IT ancestry — arose. Even with its rarity and chemical stability gold has its assault vectors. It’s not simply divisible for on a regular basis small transactions (the mythic cup of espresso). (Substituting silver or one other lesser metallic for on a regular basis transacting solves this drawback however opens the door to change swings between the 2 poles of a bimetallic system.) In the meantime, gold is comparatively transportable (it’s a denser retailer of worth than, say, cattle — one other historic foreign money from the ebook), but it surely’s actually not that handy to hold round with you. For that reason folks started storing gold in banks. The banks then started issuing paper notes to be traded instead of gold whereas the gold itself remained within the banks’ vaults. Whereas paper notes solved the divisibility drawback, the truth that the gold now remained within the banks was a brand new level of centralization — one which didn’t go unnoticed by governments. It’s specified by good element within the ebook however over the course of some many years of the 20th century gold made its means from these dispersed native banks to the official central banks of governments, accompanying our transition from a gold normal (paper notes backed by gold) to a system of free-floating change. Apart from destroying folks’s saved wealth this precipitated havoc for worldwide commerce:\nIt’s an astonishing truth of recent life that an entrepreneur within the yr 1900 may make world financial plans and calculations all denominated in any worldwide foreign money, with no thought by any means given to change charge fluctuations. A century later, the equal entrepreneur attempting to make an financial plan throughout borders faces an array of extremely risky change charges which may make him assume he has walked right into a Salvador Dali portray. However goals of a return to a halcyon gold normal, of gold as a world reserve foreign money, are misguided — and never merely as a result of technological limitations. Financial and monetary coverage are firmly established instruments of presidency — with loads of extra beneficiaries. It’s troublesome to see how any entity would willingly relinquish this type of management. Friedrich Hayek voiced some consciousness of this in a 1984 interview quoted by Ammous: “I don’t consider we will ever have an excellent cash once more earlier than we take the factor out of the arms of presidency, that’s, we are able to’t take it violently out of the arms of presidency, all we are able to do is by some sly roundabout means introduce one thing that they will’t cease.” The Bitcoin challenge should still fail, but when it might’t be Hayek’s sly roundabout introduction of one thing governments can’t cease it shouldn’t have had a lot worth within the first place. Whereas we’re nonetheless ready to see if Nakamoto was sly sufficient to tug it off, with every passing day the community turns into extra sturdy. Ammous invokes Nassim Taleb’s antifragility idea (and Nassim Nicholas Taleb followers will probably be to know that he wrote The Bitcoin Normal ’s ahead ), citing how assaults on the community have solely to this point strengthened it and inoculated it by code patches in opposition to repeat assaults on any given vulnerability. If capability for inflation won’t ever stay latent in a cash for lengthy, the technological side of cash is exactly the capability to withstand this. Bitcoin removes the flexibility to switch provide altogether. Critically, Bitcoin’s problem adjustment makes it in order that extra assets put into mining bitcoins is not going to lead to extra bitcoins being created than deliberate for by the code, however as a substitute lead to making the community itself safer and more durable to assault. Higher safety will increase its attractiveness as a retailer of worth, which raises the worth, which will increase attractiveness to mine bitcoin, which will increase community safety, and so forth. The protocol’s predictability guarantees to protect as a lot of the knowledge sign that travels by the financial medium as attainable. Bitcoin’s robustness, it’s resistance to modification, is achieved by way of mass distribution of its ledger on nodes internationally. However such excessive redundancy makes for a functionally slightly inefficient system. If so, why can we maintain listening to a lot about blockchain expertise as of late? Ammous paints the blockchain -not-Bitcoin rhetoric that’s popped up over the previous few years as a lot hype for doomed endeavors to wrest Bitcoin’s market and thoughts share over to tasks which haven’t any intention of ceding management or centralization and due to this fact haven’t any use for the core worth proposition of the blockchain (with its inherent inefficiency) within the first place:\n‘ Blockchain expertise,’ to the extent that such a factor exists, is just not an environment friendly or low-cost or quick means of transacting on-line. It’s truly immensely inefficient and sluggish in comparison with centralized options. The solely benefit that it presents is eliminating the necessity to belief in third-party intermediation. The one attainable makes use of of this expertise are in avenues the place eradicating third-party intermediation is of such paramount worth to finish customers that it justifies the elevated price and misplaced effectivity. And the one course of for which it truly can achieve eliminating third-party intermediation is the method of transferring the native token of the community itself, because the code of the blockchain has no built-in management over something going down outdoors it. Equally, the ebook has little optimistic to say close to altcoins, making the case that almost all tasks have zero grounds for his or her trumpeted decentralization claims: [V]irtually all altcoins have a staff in cost; they started the challenge, marketed it, designed the advertising materials, and plugged press releases into the press as in the event that they had been information gadgets, whereas additionally having the benefit of mining a lot of cash early earlier than anyone had heard of the cash. These groups are publicly recognized people, and irrespective of how arduous they could attempt, they can’t reveal credibly that they haven’t any management over the course of the foreign money, which undermines any claims different currencies might need to being a type of digital money that can not be edited or managed by any third celebration. With a lot debate over blockchain challenge governance as of late (be it on- or off-chain schemes), Ammous doesn’t appear to seek out a lot use in any of it. Bitcoin’s core worth proposition is once more in the end it’s resistance to modification. It’d solely undermine confidence within the foreign money as a retailer of worth if it may very well be modified willy-nilly. Ammous posits it as a advantage that the improve course of is sluggish and that persuading numerous factions of the advantage of community upgrades isn’t one thing that occurs in a single day. It’s a power of the community that there’s debate at each step of the method. So on this mannequin, whereas Bitcoin isn’t probably but in its ultimate kind, it’s not removed from it. There’ll be some effectivity upgrades, however so proof against modification is the protocol that we’re not more likely to see any wild boosts to on-chain capability (this dovetailing moreover with the evaluation that protocol-level scaling will increase centralization pressures). And so getting again to the Bitcoin normal of the title, Ammous envisions (not like a few of Bitcoin’s earliest adopter who foresee Wall Avenue in nothing however rubble in Bitcoin’s wake) a return to a system of banking related in type to that of the gold normal heydays however with Bitcoin taking up as reserve foreign money. In a system of sound cash banking,\nbankers carry out two extremely pivotal features for financial prosperity: the safekeeping of property as deposits, and the matching of maturity and danger tolerance between buyers and funding alternatives. Bankers make their cash by taking a reduce from the income in the event that they succeed of their job, however make no revenue in the event that they fail. Solely the profitable bankers and banks keep of their job, as those who fail are weeded out. In a society of sound cash, there aren’t any liquidity issues over the failure of a financial institution, as all banks maintain all their deposits available, and have investments of matched maturity. In different phrases, there isn’t any distinction between illiquidity and insolvency, and there’s no systemic danger that would make any financial institution ‘too huge to fail.’ A financial institution that fails is the issue of its shareholders and lenders, and no person else. The place transaction scaling is worried, Ammous sees banks minting their very own cryptographic tokens pegged full-reserve to their bitcoin shops in order to keep away from utilizing the scarce Bitcoin block area. The blockchain itself will operate as an final settlement layer in the way in which that gold was used to settle balances between banks within the pre-central financial institution days. This imaginative and prescient of Bitcoin’s future is much from uncontroversial throughout the Bitcoin group, however the argument is properly laid out and the ebook ought to be informative to no matter aspect the talk insiders fall on. If interested by how banks clearing in bitcoin as a substitute of gold will keep away from the centralization pressures gold ultimately caved to, it appears that evidently one of many important issues with gold is its cumbersome clearance course of — transporting it. Gold centralized as a result of gold clearance centralized. Transferring information across the Bitcoin community gained’t have gold’s similar transportability burdens and dangers. Though the vaunted lightning community is talked about, little is alleged about its potential function. Likewise, Bitcoin’s privateness/fungibility points are utterly unaddressed besides perhaps implicitly in the truth that Ammous counts main protocol modifications as particularly unlikely going ahead. You may also implicitly conclude from the ebook’s argumentation that protocol-level privateness options would diminish the transparency vital for Bitcoin to operate as ultimate settlement. Moreover, banks can fractional reserve on a gold base as a result of gold reserves are troublesome to audit; if blockchain exercise had been extra obfuscated banks would have a tougher time proving their bitcoin reserves, opening doorways to fractional reserve. Leaving a few of these points unaddressed might seem to be an oversight, however by not weighing in on each brewing debate and controversy the ebook higher meshes Bitcoin into the historic framework it begins with and preserves the impression {that a} decade or two from now it’ll nonetheless be a deeply related learn. Devoted altcoiners are unlikely to in the end be gained over by the ebook’s arguments however will nonetheless discover some worth within the learn and will maybe achieve a brand new appreciation (from a Bitcoiner’s eyes) of how Bitcoin’s worth proposition differs from different tasks within the area inside this techno-historical framework. And with this historic emphasis it’ll be an incredible learn for curious newcomers to the cryptocurrency scene and economics alike supplied they’ve the background information of a few YouTube Bitcoin explainer movies —  The Bitcoin Normal doesn’t delve to any extremes into the protocol’s technicals, but it surely at the least assumes you’ve the What’s a blockchain? sort of questions behind you. Readers of economics who’ve already absorbed and concluded in opposition to Austrian financial accounts would be the least probably of the reader base to be transformed to Ammous’s aspect, however within the Bitcoin challenge at the least there’s now another, sound, non-state foreign money, and if it doesn’t fail for technological causes we’ll all be capable of observe over the following few years whether or not it’ll fail or succeed on financial grounds. And all sides ought to at the least be keen about that.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://vk.com/share.php?url=https://amrank.info/2018/06/03/saifedean-ammouss-the-bitcoin-normal-the-new-normal-for-bitcoin-books/", "https://amrank.info/2018/06/03/saifedean-ammouss-the-bitcoin-normal-the-new-normal-for-bitcoin-books/&description=Saifedean+Ammous%E2%80%99s+The+Bitcoin+Normal%2C+the+New+Normal+for+Bitcoin+Books&media=https://amrank.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Saifedean-Ammous’s-The-Bitcoin-Standard-the-New-Standard-for-Bitcoin-Books-780x405.jpeg", "https://amrank.info/2018/06/03/saifedean-ammouss-the-bitcoin-normal-the-new-normal-for-bitcoin-books/&name=Saifedean+Ammous%E2%80%99s+The+Bitcoin+Normal%2C+the+New+Normal+for+Bitcoin+Books", "https://amrank.info/2018/06/03/saifedean-ammouss-the-bitcoin-normal-the-new-normal-for-bitcoin-books/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "saifedean ammous", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ammous", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T23:18:57.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7a6b5318fd8a2ec5e7a873734c9c6ec2a057878b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQutO.ducIV6KVWz_ARwouU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Will bitcoin go under regulation", "title_full": "Will bitcoin go under regulation", "published": "2018-06-03T21:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7a6b5318fd8a2ec5e7a873734c9c6ec2a057878b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQutO.ducIV6KVWz_ARwouU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FrueGreads", "published": "2018-06-03T21:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Will bitcoin go under regulation", "text": "Quote: from: rosstiller on June 02, 2018, 11:04:23 AM Many government are seeing Bitcoin or cryptocurrency as a threat to their financial system and they think it should be regulated to solve the problem.

I've found terms like BIP39 Mnemonic , BIP39 Passphrase , BIP39 Seed , BIP32 Root Key , Master Private Key , Derivation Path , BIP44 , m/44'/0'/0'/0/0 , and so on (see iancoleman.io/bip39 , for example). I'd like to be able to organize this into something that makes sense and I can understand.\nOnce I've created an HD wallet and I have a list of pairs \"address + private key\", how can I access it and spend funds from a specific private key from the list? Which software shoud I use and what is the easiest way to do it without compromising security?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://iancoleman.io/bip39/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T22:05:00.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "51b70fadfd482f4766c58c36e598313b536c2b11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ6Ubbs8F8Tk6YiOsfsAjhMwWJe8SVU0WydOShO8nLBD_11_DvCGjIO_aU50tompw_o9fVP9cb7WhycqUSgrGwtbBDdufuBuCYBZ1u0U90JI3AA8NJvmcSUJHvU58K75tY-", "site_full": "ebitfinder.com", "site": "ebitfinder.com", "site_section": "https://ebitfinder.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "eBitFinder – Repair Manuals – Digital Downloads", "title": "Bitcoin and Other Virtual Currencies for the 21st Century – J.

Tucker is of the view that the fear of quantum computing as an existential threat to bitcoin and other blockchain applications is based on scare-mongering and ignorance.\nIn actual fact he says, the entire basis of blockchain technology is to crowdsource solutions for problems including security threats potentially posed by quantum computing, and this is what makes Blockchain networks superior to centrally planned networks and platforms. Insisting that any potential security risks are solvable, Tucker references a research paper published by Dr. Gavin Brennen, a quantum physicist at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, who is a globally respected authority on the subject of quantum computing.\n“Still A Long Way Off” Dr. Brennen’s paper analyses the threats posed by advanced quantum computing to blockchain technology using a study to ascertain how possible it is for a quantum computer to ‘rig’ a blockchain by centralizing it’s hashing power, and whether it can crack a cryptographic key, which is currently the main security apparatus that protects blockchain users. The results indicate that quantum technology as we imagine it and quantum technology as it currently exists are still far away from each other.\nIn answer to both scenarios, the answer is no, based on current quantum computing capacity. Existing quantum infrastructure supports gate speeds that are relatively low compared to those needed to carry out an extremely complicated function like cracking a cryptographic key in a short period of time. In another ten years, there is a possibility that hardware permitting gate speeds of up to 100GHz may be in existence, but at the same time, the already extremely-fast ASIC hardware that is used for the Proof-of-Work blockchain functions will also continue to evolve and improve in that time.\nBitcoin isn’t vulnerable to quantum computing, research suggests. More In other words, any theoretical advantage that quantum computing possessed over the blockchain is canceled out in practice by the constraints of existing hardware and continued evolution of blockchain security. The technology that can successfully compromise a blockchain running currently, is always about ten years away from successful development, such that by the time it comes out, it is always effectively obsolete.\n“Red Herring” Both Dr. Brennen and Tucker agree that while there is certainly a security risk posed by quantum computing to blockchain networks, at least on paper, these fears are based on sensational reporting and scaremongering. Tucker’s opinion is that the conversation about quantum computing posing an existential threat to the blockchain is a red herring because it serves as a distraction from what should really be discussed. In his words,\n“…This quantum threat to Bitcoin is mostly a red-herring, not entirely false but a fixable issue, especially given the robust network behind cryptocurrency and the strong incentive to provide the best security possible.”\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.\nThe post Quantum Computing ‘Poses No Realistic Threat’ To Bitcoin: Research appeared first on CCN .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.ccn.com/quantum-computing-poses-no-realistic-threat-to-bitcoin-research/&quot;", "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10377.pdf&quot;", "https://www.aier.org/article/threat-bitcoin-quantum-computing", "https://www.aier.org/article/threat-bitcoin-quantum-computing&quot;", "https://www.ccn.com/quantum-safe-cryptocurrency-challenges-for-the-future/", "https://www.ccn.com/quantum-computing-poses-no-realistic-threat-to-bitcoin-research/", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bXTmtcLNYTUxW8jaJDKr9A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/e01ad358774688f99bf47ecbee93765a", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/bXTmtcLNYTUxW8jaJDKr9A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/e01ad358774688f99bf47ecbee93765a);", "https://www.ccn.com/quantum-safe-cryptocurrency-challenges-for-the-future/&quot;", "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10377.pdf", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Pg6AqjpDauuSlVNb9j81Hw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/ccn_656/a47a84ea49654f1d07c21c2270015108"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tucker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brennen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gavin brennen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeffrey tucker", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "macquarie university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american institute of economic research", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T20:49:12.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2dfa426c5fd5574ea07b9fc324fea6d3508a9bd5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSyfgcsY6PsousaDjbBEzpW3Ln0I1qcBXaR95W5EoSpNx6_x0CG4Lb9ewCnOUTZwzx.9zlDUgyVEQfWnph8plT_Y5.zWJwIHyYKWE.6HSWCeA--", "site_full": "kamvreto69.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://kamvreto69.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "everything about bitcoin", "title": "Let's Talk Bitcoin! #368 Blockchain Week and the Cash Crisis", "title_full": "Let's Talk Bitcoin! #368 Blockchain Week and the Cash Crisis", "published": "2018-06-03T21:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2dfa426c5fd5574ea07b9fc324fea6d3508a9bd5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSyfgcsY6PsousaDjbBEzpW3Ln0I1qcBXaR95W5EoSpNx6_x0CG4Lb9ewCnOUTZwzx.9zlDUgyVEQfWnph8plT_Y5.zWJwIHyYKWE.6HSWCeA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Himen Supritno (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-06-03T21:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Let's Talk Bitcoin! #368 Blockchain Week and the Cash Crisis", "text": "On Today's Episode of Let's Talk Bitcoin...

Users can now use tPART (testnet PART) coins provided by the developers to test the marketplace. Particl's cryptocurrency is the only altcoin keeping up with the latest changes in the Bitcoin codebase.\nMarketplace Built on Blockchain Technology Testing the alpha of the platform is the next step in rolling out a public version of the marketplace. Users can download this version from the project's GitHub page and use testnet coins to sample offerings.\nUsers must note that the products offered on sale are not real and only for testing purposes, nevertheless, you can buy a Particl t-shirt for free using the marketplace. Once users download and launch the application, they will be taken to the home page where they can browse products on sale. Particl will allow users to buy and sell on a person to person basis on the platform.\nTransactions can be made using 'Part' coins, the native digital token of the marketplace, but a variety of other altcoins will eventually be accepted, increasing their utility too. For now, only testnet coins can be used, and you can obtain some PART here for testing purposes. Some of the categories include; high-value goods, housing/travel and vacation, software, apparel, and more.\nSome of the tesetnet items on the Particl marketplace (alpha).\nParticl has announced that all the revenue it generates from its operations will be paid back to the nodes that are responsible for keeping the network running. The project was initiated back in 2014 initially as Shadowcash (SDC), until it decided to shift focus and rebrand to the Particl project and introduced a new crypto PART in place of SDC.\nParticl works on the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism which allows coin investors to earn passive income by staking their coins while at the same time, keeps the network secure. The platform uses Confidential Transactions (CT) and RingCT to ensure that the identities of the buyer and seller are not revealed.\nBlockchain Marketplace Against Online Marketplaces Amazon and eBay are two of the most successful online marketplaces on the web. A blockchain -based marketplace guarantees decentralization and security of user data.

Users can now use tPART (testnet PART) coins provided by the developers to test the marketplace. Particl’s cryptocurrency is the only altcoin keeping up with the latest changes in the Bitcoin codebase. Marketplace Built on Blockchain Technology\nTesting the alpha of the platform is the next step in rolling out a public version of the marketplace. Users can download this version from the project’s GitHub page and use testnet coins to sample offerings.\nUsers must note that the products offered on sale are not real and only for testing purposes, nevertheless, you can buy a Particl t-shirt for free using the marketplace. Once users download and launch the application, they will be taken to the home page where they can browse products on sale. Particl will allow users to buy and sell on a person to person basis on the platform.\nTransactions can be made using ‘Part’ coins, the native digital token of the marketplace, but a variety of other altcoins will eventually be accepted, increasing their utility too. For now, only testnet coins can be used, and you can obtain some PART here for testing purposes. Some of the categories include; high-value goods, housing/travel and vacation, software, apparel, and more. Some of the tesetnet items on the Particl marketplace (alpha).\nParticl has announced that all the revenue it generates from its operations will be paid back to the nodes that are responsible for keeping the network running. The project was initiated back in 2014 initially as Shadowcash (SDC), until it decided to shift focus and rebrand to the Particl project and introduced a new crypto PART in place of SDC.\nParticl works on the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism which allows coin investors to earn passive income by staking their coins while at the same time, keeps the network secure. The platform uses Confidential Transactions (CT) and RingCT to ensure that the identities of the buyer and seller are not revealed. Blockchain Marketplace Against Online Marketplaces\nAmazon and eBay are two of the most successful online marketplaces on the web. A blockchain -based marketplace guarantees decentralization and security of user data. Online sellers have come under criticism for manipulating prices, editing reviews and compromising user data.\nHowever, since decentralized marketplaces do not have a single entity controlling them, they do not need to store any user data locally on their servers – meaning that data can never be leaked or compromised.\nOnce fully released, sellers can list their products for sale on such a platform and have it accessible to potential buyers. A smart contract could then be programmed to manage orders, payment, and shipping.\nOnce a buyer places an order and it is confirmed by the network, an automatically triggered smart contract will deduct the exact amount of cryptocurrency from the buyer’s account.

Yes, I answered without hesitation, though it’s not nearly as much as I would like. My budget has been tight, and of course it is not growing like it was before. Photo shared with permission from Troy Emmi at Fanboy Collectibles My friend had sold his own stack of Ethereum, at a moderate gain from when he’d initially bought in, but a disappointing drop from the all-time-high. The price dropped much further and he was glad he’d sold, but obviously still thinking about it. I stopped short of advising he buy more soon, at those low prices. What do I know? I am not a financial adviser, so don’t even think about taking my advice on what to buy. I am, however, a specialist in human behavior. So if you want to succeed in crypto, listen up. I’m going to tell you something that’s been bothering me since I bought my first bitcoin (technically, my first 0.03 BTC). It began as a little fear we’ve all had at least once: “this isn’t real money.” I am convinced now that it is better than money , but there is still a big problem with Bitcoin. For simplicity, I’ll use “Bitcoin” to refer to cryptocurrencies in general. Bitcoin still rules the markets, as this month proved yet again. It may well remain the primary exchange unit as crypto catches on. The real problem with Bitcoin is you You, me, anyone who reads “you want to succeed in crypto” and thinks, “yep, that’s me.” We have several problems that run deeper than blockchain. Not problems of understanding, but of attitude. We’d better face them if we’re going to realize the true potential of this new technology. Photo by Andre Francois on Unsplash Problem 1: You don’t know if you are gambling or investing If you’re gambling, you are taking a chance on winning big. You decide how much you’re willing to risk, and when it runs out you go home. If you’re investing, you expect a return on the money you put in. Because you expect it to grow you don’t take the money out, at least not for a while. In fact, you usually add more over time. The money you invest is used by someone to produce something of value, and that’s how your investment grows. My friend and I each started buying crypto last year, well before the peak, but at a time when things were growing it was easy to believe in our investments. As prices fell, we each began to treat our portfolios more like a gamble. My friend hit his limit, cashed in his chips, and went home. I held on, but stopped adding more. Missing the growth I’d seen before, I played at swing trading, trying to catch the highs and lows. I won some and lost some. I learned a bit about altcoins, but my portfolio didn’t get any bigger. I didn’t do what is required to grow an investment; I didn’t invest. Photo by Mark Finn on Unsplash Problem 2: You want to get something for nothing I was waiting for the “right time” to invest more in Bitcoin. Last year, as I watched my investment double, twice, it seemed any time was the right time. 2018 so far has been different. We don’t know what will go up in value, and when. Looking for the best opportunity to grow your money, it’s easy to miss the whole point. Bitcoin, like all money, represents an exchange of value. Create something that people value, deliver it consistently, and you’ll have money. It might seem complicated in our current economy, but it’s really that simple . There are lots of ways to create value for people, but putting your money in an exchange and watching it daily isn’t one of them. This was the fear that nagged at me when I started to invest in cryptocurrency. Invest in what, exactly? In other people holding onto hope? This is why the old school financial folks talk about Bitcoin as a bubble . At some point, somebody has to do something to create value. It was fun watching money grow with no effort at all. I know you miss those days and long for their return. It happened before, and it could happen again. I hope it does, but hope is not a plan. You can get more out of this crypto economy than you put in, just be willing to put something in. Something of real value, like your time, your creativity, your craftsmanship. Photo by Nikola Jovanovic on Unsplash Problem 3: You keep looking for reasons why the markets do what they do I am no happier with that Mt. Gox trustee than you are. I agree that bitcoin futures trading was a sneaky way for big banks to get a big foothold in an asset they’d ignored for too long. While interesting to read about with my morning coffee, these external factors have almost zero impact on my own ability to build wealth. It is tempting to place responsibility for your current financial situation outside of yourself; it absolves you of having to do anything about it. Tune in to your reactions when you read about market influences. Does this news affect what you are going to do, or is it a distraction? Markets are still down. For anyone who believes in the role cryptocurrency has in shaping the new economy, this is a punch in the gut. However, if your strategy for building wealth and ushering in this new economy requires that the markets always go up, I urge you to reread problems 1 and 2. Excerpt from “Religion for the Nonreligious” on Wait But Why by Tim Urban Problem 4: You cannot imagine the true potential of cryptocurrency No one can. Even if you’re excited about its potential, your frame of reference comes from a past where blockchain didn’t exist. When the printing press was invented, new Bibles could be printed and distributed more cheaply and easily than ever. This was important, but it doesn’t even begin to describe the value that grew from that new information technology. In 2003–2005, cameras were added to cell phones . It seemed expensive and unnecessary at the time. It wasn’t easy for the average user, and it took a while to catch on. Yet within 10 years you were streaming video, and your phone was completely transformed. If blockchain currency seems about as clunky as camera on a phone, consider this: it wasn’t that a camera wasn’t useful on a phone. It just didn’t fit with our outdated concept of what a phone is and what it does. When blockchain applications are more widely used, I believe we’ll find our entire concept of currency has transformed. Photo by Quino Al on Unsplash How To Become Part Of The Solution If, like me, you really believe we are seeing the birth of a new economy, then let’s work at it. Even as prices seem stagnant, a lot is happening right now. Stop looking at prices and start looking at value. Real value is something you create through your actions and interactions. We don’t know what the crypto economy’s future might be, but one thing it’s not going to be is a future of magical internet money that you get just for logging in. What can you contribute today towards your own future? Are you making enough to put some fraction of each paycheck into savings? If not, don’t look to Bitcoin to save you. If you don’t have much to invest, even a 1000% gain cannot compare to a regular, steady investment into something that grows. I needed convincing of this, so I sat down with the calculator. After 3 years, even a small 2% of my income in monthly investment beats a one-time jump of 1000%. Besides, you and I both know that if I haven’t figured out how to save 2% of each check, I will spend that crypto windfall as soon as it appears. My fiat savings from 2017. You can contribute towards your future today through two practices: productivity and discipline . When you are productive, you create more value and earn more. When you are disciplined, you nurture and restore that which makes you productive. You take care of your health, your systems, and your relationships, so you don’t overdraw in any area. Notice I did not say “spend less.” Sure, it’s unwise to spend what you did not earn. So who is limiting what you earn? No doubt it’s someone from the old economy, who never would have put a camera on a phone. Isn’t that the whole reason you bought Bitcoin in the first place? How can you contribute to this budding crypto economy? Bitcoin was your gateway, and it continues to drive prices in part because it is the most widely accepted. Any crypto project you’d like to get into, it is likely you can buy in with Bitcoin. There are well over 1000 cryptocurrencies out there. Not all of them will make it, but some of them are giving rise to all sorts of innovations. Here is where we begin to diverge from our traditional notion of currency as “money.” People are meeting, sharing, building on each other’s ideas. In other words, they are doing the things that create value in an economy. The value is being created now , regardless of which coins “win.” In fact, one way I believe cryptocurrency will change the landscape is that we don’t need one coin to rule them all. “A bright neon on a brick wall in a store” by Austin Chan on Unsplash Three currencies have my attention right now: STEEM , MANA (Decentraland) , and EOS . Though they differ in their approach and application, they share an important distinction: the value is not created solely by “mining,” but through the meaningful interactions of their users. They invite users to build, create, and share. Their value depends not just on hodling and hope, but on people doing something worthwhile. Speaking of doing something worthwhile, I’ve long had a hobbyist interest in programming and so far I know nothing of DApps (decentralized apps). This summer, I plan to embark on a beginner’s course in coding with some creative input from my 6-year-old son. The course is CryptoZombies , offered by the Loom Network . I’m sure I’ll write about it. Bitcoin skeptics would surely call these investments risky. They are, from a worldview that says “money is finite and you either gain it or lose it.” This misses the real value that crypto’s diversity offers. I can invest money, attention, and skill, and gain returns from each. It is possible, though unlikely I’ll lose all of the money I put in, but even so I will retain the knowledge and skill, maybe even some of the relationships built through my efforts. Relationships and skill can be used to create value, which makes them more valuable than money. It’s the difference between having a fish and learning to fish. Photo by Andre Francois on Unsplash There is someone in your community, right now, who will gladly accept payment in Bitcoin for their services. In my town it is the local music shop . This summer, I’m signing my son up for some lessons. Likewise, there is something you can offer in exchange for the coin of your choice . If there is one thing you take away from this article, I hope it is this distinction between “money” and “value.” It will serve you well in the Crypto economy, and perhaps spare you the pain of anxious waiting for Bitcoin to rise. You have opportunity all around you, regardless of the BTC/USD exchange rate. Be part of the solution.

Posted on by usanews How the brilliance of blockchain overshadows Bitcoin\nWarren Buffett called Bitcoin “rat poison,” but the technology behind it is something everyone can agree on. Here are other life-changing uses you didn’t know about.\nBill Gates expressed deep skepticism about the prospects of bitcoin despite faith in the cryptocurrency’s underlying technology.\nGates told CNBC “Squawk Box” journalist Becky Quick on Monday in an interview that bitcoin is “one of the crazier, speculative things” he’s seen.\nThe technology titan, philanthropist and world’s second-richest person declined to reveal insight into a “fantasy” investment portfolio that he runs for fun to gauge his ability to beat the market. (His actual net worth is managed by a team of real-life investors.)\nBut he made an exception for bitcoin, which is billed as a way to safely store and exchange encrypted value online.\n“I’d short it if there was an easy way to do it,” he said.\n“Shorting” is a financial way of betting against an asset. If the asset declines in valuation, the investor’s bet pays off. If it increases, the bet loses.\nBitcoin fell by nearly $30 in the minutes after Gates’ comments.\nGates said he had been given bitcoin as a birthday gift a few years ago but sold it soon thereafter. He said he likes the underlying blockchain technology, which enables a safe and dispersed way to track and execute transactions.

Some of them better than what we could expect. China New Regulations\n“ There is a growing belief that simply saying no to Bitcoin will not be the final solution to the problem of cryptocurrency ” says Xiao Xin, from the Global Times. But really the fundamental approach being sought for China would be to adopt the new technology without putting the country’s financial system at stake.\nThis approach is indicative of the fact that Beijing is preparing to rethink the regulations on crypto to open up more to the market, as other powerful countries such as the United States, Japan and Korea have done.\nThe Central Bank of the Republic of China decided to ban Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) in 2017, something that caused panic in the crypto market. However, these facts should not be considered as disruptive to the potential development of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, on the contrary, with this type of measures governments seek to protect the public against market manipulation and guarantee financial stability. That is something that governments have been doing for years with conventional financial products and instruments.\nBut banning initial coin offerings and exchanges at the same time calls into question Bitcoin’s own legitimacy as a currency. It is known that Bitcoin undermines the monopolies of the government and the entire banking system.\nIf a competing currency like Bitcoin threatens the political system of a nation as large as China, why not to stop the development of crypto as soon as possible? Stopping Bitcoin also means stopping innovation. And it is precisely innovation what China constantly needs if it wants to become the world’s leading power.\nThe digital currency revolution is what can help China achieve its goals. For this reason, Beijing’s government is reconsidering the ban on Bitcoin. And it is quite possible that the ban would be lifted in the future. Blockchain Technology\nChina has also been investing in Blockchain technology and developing an index about virtual currencies. The main intention behind that is to start to prepare the way for the next regulations, which may allow exchanges and other crypto-related companies to operate within the country’s borders.\nAt the moment, China is one of the most important countries in the world investing in distributed ledger technology. Something that can be seen with the number of patents that the country has registered.

'Real traders' with suits, the talking heads, the IMF, the rothschildes for god's sake - everyone in fact - raving on about the ROI of Bitcoin 'investments'. TA, buy low sell high, price predictions, lambos etc dominated our feeds and our thoughts.\nWe were duped.\nTHEY (and again, we know who THEY are) fooled us into viewing Bitcoin not as the revolutionary leaderless, censorship/gov resistant, borderless, permissionless and transparent form of exchange this world has NEVER had, but rather just another thing to buy with substanceless, permissioned fake fiat currency to 'get rich'.\nIn short, we all, bitcoiners and nocoiners alike, viewed the whole phenomena from the perspective THEY decided for us.\nNot the perspective we were employing at the time - our perspective, our narrative. We allowed, in our own hearts and minds, OUR narrative to be replaced.\nThen came the divide and conquer - the apparent 'scaling debate'. It took us by surprise. We hurried to study up on it (some more than others) and consequently chose 'our team' without ever realizing it was THEIR idea, this debate.\nTheir 'agreements', their fork, their version of Bitcoin ensued. We got sucked into battling with the gullible few who fell for it and who consequently (and understandably) dug in their heals to defend their erroneous decisions.

So crazy that Steve O’Shaughnessy, the new town supervisor, says he hasn’t unpacked his office since he started his job in January. O’Shaughnessy says it’s a good thing, though. In the past decade, his town of about 13,000 on the St. Lawrence River has lost much of its main industry — as a powertrain plant closed and an aluminum manufacturing plant downsized. But now, one and possibly two bitcoin mining companies are moving in, and they have promised to create dozens of jobs. Across the United States, bitcoin miners — who set up computers to solve complex math programs and unlock new bitcoin — are rushing to small towns and wide-open states with cheap rent, land or electricity. Many places are shunning the bitcoin mining companies, saying they suck up too much electricity without producing jobs. But places such as Massena are putting out the welcome mat — not just for bitcoin miners, but for any and all “cryptocurrency” industries. The idea is to attract entrepreneurs who are developing new uses for blockchain technology, which records agreements and transactions on an open, online ledger. Bitcoin was the original blockchain technology, but enthusiasts envision a world in which the entire economy runs on the technology, allowing people to buy their homes, write their wills and even vote without the involvement of a third party. While bitcoin mining may not create many jobs, state officials and cryptocurrency advocates believe in the economic potential of the industries created through blockchain technology. To signal that they’re open for business, states — especially those with small or shrinking populations — are enacting laws that, for example, exempt certain cryptocurrency transactions from the licensing laws that apply to others who transmit money, like banks. At least six states — Kansas, Illinois, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Texas and Wyoming — have enacted laws or issued guidance in the past four years that exempt some digital currencies from money transmitter licenses. “There is a bit of a battle going on between states to be the next Silicon Valley for open blockchain networks,” said Peter Van Valkenburgh, research director at Coin Center, a nonprofit research and advocacy center based in Washington, D.C., that focuses on issues pertaining to cryptocurrency and related technology. Enthusiasts in small towns are advertising their cheap electricity, organizing meetups, and trying to get businesses to accept cryptocurrencies — even as the value of bitcoin has declined over the past four months, and despite warnings that the largely unregulated industry is vulnerable to fraudsters, hackers and money launderers. “We’re seeing a little mini-gold rush of blockchain companies right now,” said Wyoming state Rep. Tyler Lindholm, a Republican. “And I want them all.” Appearing ‘Crypto-Woke’ Blockchain technology enables people to make agreements and transfer value without a centralized system. Each transaction is secured and recorded through cryptographic functions, or high-tech math, and verified through a network of users. By design, it is meant to regulate itself. Examples include bitcoin, but also applications that allow people to come to contractual agreements without involving banks, courts or lawyers. Despite the system’s built-in protections, agreements and transactions made with blockchain technology are still susceptible to fraud, hacking and theft. That’s why some states have enacted regulations. New York, for example, in 2015 created a regulatory system, BitLicense, in which anyone doing \"virtual currency business activity\" must first get a license from the state. Justin Wales, chairman of the blockchain technology and digital currency practice at Carlton Fields, a law firm, said New York’s law is flawed because it forces nearly everyone in the “tokenized economy” to follow the same financial rules as banks, even though there are many different types of tokens and transactions. On the other hand, Wales and Van Valkenburgh say, the cryptocurrency-friendly laws that some states are rushing to enact don’t always make sense, either. Regulators “want to do something just to be seen as doing something,” Wales said. This is a risky approach, he said, because poorly written laws could restrict the technology and stifle innovation. Wales cites laws enacted by Arizona, Nevada, Tennessee and Vermont in the past two years as examples. The laws clarify that contracts secured on the blockchain are legally binding. The problem, Wales said, is that most states already have laws that verify that digital signatures are legally binding. Enacting new laws that make this technology-specific could have unintended consequences, he said. “That’s an example of states wanting to appear ‘crypto-woke,’” Wales said. Defining Cryptocurrency Van Valkenburgh and Wales say states need to clarify when a license is needed to exchange tokens for dollars or tokens for other tokens. “It could be good to get rid of the ambiguities,” Van Valkenburgh said, “a positive signal to the industry.” Wyoming is trying to lead the way in defining the new market as it tries to diversify its economy with new technology innovation, said Lindholm. Wyoming lawmakers last month approved five cryptocurrency-friendly bills cosponsored by Lindholm, including one that makes it clear that the state distinguishes digital tokens from typical currencies and securities. Another exempts cryptocurrencies from state securities regulations. “I don’t think hard regulations ever produced something that changed the world,” Lindholm said. “That’s what we are looking for and what everyone is looking for across the world.” But it may be too late for U.S. states to compete with other countries that have far fewer regulations, said New Hampshire state Rep. Keith Ammon, a Republican who cosponsored a money transmitter bill last year. Ammon thinks blockchain technology will transform human interactions. “It’s akin to Christopher Columbus discovering a new continent,” he said. Mining Moratoriums In Massena, there’s an advocacy group working to attract blockchain technology entrepreneurs, said Nancy Smith-Weller, a member of this group and a cryptocurrency enthusiast. But not everything is in the hands of local advocates. The Massena Electric Department recently put a hold on new mining projects until it can figure out how to meet the demand for power. The town has a limited capacity of cheap electricity, and according to one estimate, each bitcoin transaction consumes as much electricity as a U.S. homeowner uses in a month, about 900 kilowatt-hours. Also, in March, the New York Power Authority, which provides some of the town’s electricity, adopted a moratorium on approving cheap power rates for cryptocurrency businesses. After the announcement, Blockchain Industries, a large company that was considering locating in Massena, scrapped its plan, according to Smith-Weller. She says the company hired her to act as a liaison with the town. Not everyone in Massena is so sure that the benefits of having the cryptocurrency industry in town will outweigh the costs. Timmy Currier, the mayor of the village of Massena, which is located within the town, said he is worried that the increased demand for power will raise electric rates and make the power less reliable. Bitcoin companies promise jobs, he said, but there is no guarantee. \"They just expect us to believe them,\" he said. Despite the moratoriums, O’Shaughnessy wants the companies to come. He said there is plenty of power available from other sources, and the town has no qualms about attracting an industry that may not pan out. Smith-Weller said the businesses will help the town reinvent itself. “I do believe this technology will save Massena.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jen fifield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o’shaughnessy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve o’shaughnessy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. lawrence river", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T20:46:00.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2b7d81b22697454fc2c88915e020dc6a762e14ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5tjru1iIq8XfEUHxEHm1RrXJ5iWI8TpgGUOR5_ZufAATt8y_BQIo.LM44lVGBwFryEXF1oan1JgsVSn2wfJscRUP5R99D.dB_2lus1k9aO..xgrHpb3c8kmJ81y9EG3PENSOBcD_euuX7FS5o_J2kUM-", "site_full": "cryptogeeks.com", "site": "cryptogeeks.com", "site_section": "http://cryptogeeks.com/news/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "\"Chinese Google\" Baidu Uncovers Super Chain Blockchain Solution Which Could Solve Bitcoin Energy Issue", "title_full": "\"Chinese Google\" Baidu Uncovers Super Chain Blockchain Solution Which Could Solve Bitcoin Energy Issue", "published": "2018-06-03T19:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2b7d81b22697454fc2c88915e020dc6a762e14ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5tjru1iIq8XfEUHxEHm1RrXJ5iWI8TpgGUOR5_ZufAATt8y_BQIo.LM44lVGBwFryEXF1oan1JgsVSn2wfJscRUP5R99D.dB_2lus1k9aO..xgrHpb3c8kmJ81y9EG3PENSOBcD_euuX7FS5o_J2kUM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsbot", "published": "2018-06-03T19:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "\"Chinese Google\" Baidu Uncovers Super Chain Blockchain Solution Which Could Solve Bitcoin Energy Issue", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-03T19:57:04.067+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c30fa9e7be7aedff2a162fee712548b5be9ea597", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS6L7nbyxruQoasqYBKTT28-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "title_full": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "published": "2018-06-03T19:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c30fa9e7be7aedff2a162fee712548b5be9ea597", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS6L7nbyxruQoasqYBKTT28-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "xhomerx10", "published": "2018-06-03T19:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "text": "Quote: from: Phil_S on Today at 11:38:05 AM Quote: from: vapourminer on Today at 10:29:31 AM Quote: from: jojo69 on Today at 01:50:18 AM Quote: from: JayJuanGee on Today at 01:14:02 AM\nI don't see what is controversial about my statement... which part of my statement is controversial?\nmy doubting of the moon landing or my confidence that the earth is not flat?\ndoubting the moon landing...seriously, that shit is cray\ni find it hard to believe people that are otherwise reasonably intelligent can still believe that moon landings were faked.\nmental block? lack of knowledge the technical aspects? brain washing? wishful thinking? whatever it is.. well enjoy your beliefs.\nIt's funny, they're skeptical about landings, but not launches.
