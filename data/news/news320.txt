In both cases there is a risk to make money. Gaming platform Game Stars puts its token. Have GST have a chance to rise in the world of cryptocurrency, the owners of the token stake everything on success. The issue of tokens is limited to 500 millions. All of the issued tokens will participate in Tokencache on the official website. Unsold tokens will burn after sales. The fastest participants will benefit if they acquire GST.\nWhat is common between the gaming platform and online poker? The world's largest online platform for poker PokerStars controls ⅔ of the market of Internet poker. The platform provides a choice of playgrounds and conducts online tournaments. Game Stars can become the PokerStars of the market of eSports.\nThe difference between the two projects is that Game Stars developed on the blockchain. The platform supports all participants and provides opportunities for competitive players, sponsors, advertisers, and investors. Users earn in tournaments and to increase the value of the token. The project team has developed a strategy for the growth of GST. The value of the token depends on 2 factors: licensee and use the platform. Tocancel\n500 million tokens will be available for purchase. The platform will be in demand, and later learn why. The point is that after reaching Hard Cap the deficit of the token will occur if the platform registers was 14285 professional users. The cost of the token will increase and buy a GST only holders of tokens on the exchange. The use of the platform\nThe more people use the platform, the higher the cost of the token. Platform Game Starts gaining popularity among the participants,because it seeks to solve existing problems of eSports. What are the benefits of the platform to market participants of e-sports? Players\nPlayers earn participating in contests and selling personal token players, which are produced together with smart contract. Players receive funding for professional development, for example purchase of equipment or hiring of a coach. Sponsors and advertisers\nAdvertising agencies are choosing the athlete or team activities for product promotion. Sponsors invest in promising cyberathletes and receive a percentage of their income. Team managers\nManagers develop team players, looking for new and raise money for team participation in tournaments. Investors\nBy purchasing tokens during licensee and selling them on the exchange, professional traders and businessmen earn on the rising cost of GST.\nGame Stars will occupy a niche in the gaming industry, and a token GST will be in TOP50 world of cryptocurrency.\nDetailed information about the project is available on the official website.

Iran is facing renewed sanctions from the United States which could signal the start of new economic problems. There are also reports that the Iranian government is looking to create a state-owned cryptocurrency. Impending Economic Troubles\nFresh sanctions from the U.S. will adversely affect Iran’s exports especially oil which forms a considerable portion of its GDP. The country’s currency, the rial has lost a lot of ground on the U.S. dollar. This decrease in value follows several months of forex shortage and financial difficulties in the banking sector. As a result, the local economy has been declining with the situation expected to worsen with the issuing of fresh sanctions. The Central Bank of Iran (CBI) has tried to remedy the situation but seemingly to no avail. The apex bank unified the official and black-market forex rates, but the rial has continued to plummet. Iran Sanctions: People Are Turning To #Bitcoin To Get Money Out https://t.co/ascSmWuI17\n— Dennis Parker⚡️ (@Xentagz) May 10, 2018 A State-owned Crypto Solution.\nThere have been numerous reports that the Iranian government is developing a state-owned cryptocurrency. Jayad Azari-Jahromi, the country’s ICT Minister, announced in April that an experimental model of the local crypto project was ready. This announcement followed the ban placed by the CBI on Bitcoin and other cryptos. The country’s apex bank prohibited all banks and lending institutions from facilitating cryptocurrency transactions.\nIf Iran does develop a local crypto, it will be following in the footsteps of Venezuela. The Latin-American nation launched its petro cryptocurrency earlier in the year. Many see the petro as a way of circumventing economic restrictions affecting the country. In response, the United States has banned the petro, and this will likely diminish its exchangeability. If Iran decides to follow the same route, its local cryptocurrency will likely suffer the same ban. Bitcoin to the Rescue\nDespite the Bitcoin ban, Iranians are still using bitcoin to send money out of the country. According to reports in the local media, residents of the nation have spent more than $2.5 billion in acquiring cryptos in recent months. The CBI ban, however, is expected to significantly reduce the outflow by making more significant transactions a lot more difficult.\nMohammad Reza Pourebrahimi, the Chairman of the Iranian Parliament’s Economic Commission, believes most of the crypto activities in the country are speculative investments. He also said that foreign cryptocurrencies are a threat to Iran’s banking system. As such, it is necessary for the government to develop a national virtual currency.\nCan Iran navigate the problems brought about by economic sanctions using cryptocurrency?

REUTERS/Steve Marcus\nWenn Digital has created the blockchain-based system, called KODAKOne, which seeks to protect the copyright of images or photographs registered on the platform. Kodak has a minority stake in Wenn Digital, according to Wenn.\nU.S. photography pioneer Kodak has been active in developing the blockchain platform with Wenn, and its recent share performance has been strongly tied to the outlook for KODAKOne.\nKodak shares shot up in early January to as high as $13.25 when it announced its deal with Wenn Digital, falling after the token offering was delayed. The stock closed at $5.45 on Wednesday.\nBlockchain, the system powering cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet.\nWenn’s token will be called KODAKCoin, with the public offering due to take place on May 21. It was initially scheduled for January, but was delayed due to regulatory issues.\n“We really took a step back and decided that we would ensure that all Ts were crossed and Is dotted before we embark on a public sale,” Cam Chell, chairman and co-founder of KODAKOne, told Reuters in an interview. “We wanted to make sure that we got it right.”\nChell said KODAKOne’s coin offering will be legally compliant with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, using an instrument called the Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT).\nUnder a SAFT offering, the token is issued when the blockchain platform is launched, which Chell said was expected to be later this year.\nAnalysts said the SAFT structure makes token sales viable because it limits participation to accredited investors. As such, companies issuing SAFTs need not register with the SEC.\nIt was the same structure used by Filecoin’s offering in August and September last year, which raised approximately $200 million. Filecoin is a decentralized network that aims to facilitate the storage, retrieval, and transmission of data.\nWenn Digital has already conducted a pre-sale of its SAFT to accredited investors, raising about $10 million. The company’s capital requirement is $20 million, but Chell said demand was greater.\n“I think $50 million is our sweet spot,” Chell said.\nReporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien Just In ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wenn", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kodak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eastman kodak co", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wenn digital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcus wenn digital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin isle click", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T12:00:32.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a20c88d78faa791eea075a786c88b9b522c53af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQVnuM8.NLpOjSxvKSfnMQ4vB7uXSr_TwQt8ll6UY5bW7ygpByUR77yJ21NRWqJV_nEpW0Mb5fmoMBu4mMZpxnLhIK_2qIkvb8-", "site_full": "www.cnbc.com", "site": "cnbc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Barely any bitcoin left in Ark ETFs - Wiredfocus", "title_full": "Barely any bitcoin left in Ark ETFs - Wiredfocus", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.wiredfocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/104941023-RTX3WCTM.1910x1000.jpg?fit=1910%2C1000&ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 767, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3a20c88d78faa791eea075a786c88b9b522c53af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQVnuM8.NLpOjSxvKSfnMQ4vB7uXSr_TwQt8ll6UY5bW7ygpByUR77yJ21NRWqJV_nEpW0Mb5fmoMBu4mMZpxnLhIK_2qIkvb8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Edgar Su", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Barely any bitcoin left in Ark ETFs - Wiredfocus", "text": "Barely any bitcoin left in Ark ETFs May 18, 2018\nEdgar Su | Reuters\nA woman pays for her coffee with cryptocurrency at Ducatus cafe, the first cashless cafe that accepts cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, in Singapore December 21, 2017.\nJust over a month ago, the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) took home ETF.com’s “ETF Of The Year” award for delivering on its purpose of serving up access to disruptive technology in 2017, and doing so really well.\nCrucial to that recognition was its unique allocation to bitcoin.

Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Capital Management LP and Bloomberg will establish the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (BGCI). The index service will provide trusted asset tracking for 10 of the most liquid cryptocurrencies in the market. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index\nThe BGCI is part of the Bloomberg Index Services Limited catalog and is administered by the company. The platform offers institutional-grade benchmarking standards for cryptocurrencies.\nSpeaking on the launch, Alan Campbell, the Bloomberg Indices Global Product Manager, said:\nToday’s launch of the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index reflects our clients’ growing interest in cryptocurrencies. The index brings our rigorous approach to index construction to cryptos and will provide investors with a transparent benchmark to gauge the performance of the broader market. How the Index Works\nThe BGCI will monitor and track the performance of the ten largest cryptocurrencies based on their market cap. The index operates via a rules-based methodology. To ensure accuracy, all data used by the index must pass the due-diligence framework set by both Bloomberg and Galaxy Digital.\nNot all cryptocurrencies are the same. As a result, the BGCI’s cryptocurrency tracking pool covers the different classes of digital coins. These classes are privacy assets, mediums of exchange, stores of value, and smart contract tokens. The ten cryptos contained in the BGCI paradigm at its launch are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple , Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Dash, Monero, Ethereum Classic, and Zcash.\nThe maximum and minimum cap for any coin on the index is 30 percent and 1 percent respectively. At inception, both Bitcoin and Ethereum make up 30 percent of the BGCI while Zcash is at one percent. Commenting on the way the BCGI is structured, Steve Kurz, Asset Management Chief at Galaxy Digital, said:\nWe are thrilled to partner with Bloomberg on the BGCI. The index’s independent, rules-based methodology provides a strong foundation on which the cryptocurrency ecosystem will continue to grow and mature. The BGCI will Become the S&P 500 for Cryptos\nMike Novogratz, the founder of Galaxy Digital, expressed optimism at the new BGCI. He described the index as another milestone in the march towards the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin. He also said the platform adopts the rigorous approach utilized by mainstream benchmarking services to the crypto market.\nCommenting on the potential importance of the BGCI, Novogratz said:\nWe wanted an institutional player for the whole ecosystem, and I think it’s important for the crypto ecosystem. You’re starting to see more institutional participation, and what they’re looking for is this architecture — here’s an index that will feel like the S&P 500 in a few months, that people can benchmark themselves against.\nBloomberg and Galaxy Digital aren’t the first to launch a crypto benchmarking platform. Upbit, the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange, recently created a cryptocurrency index service.\nDo you think the BGCI will become the de facto crypto benchmarking service for mainstream investors?

The information will be added below, unedited:\nSource 1: “We weren’t sure about the first article you guys wrote about Tron last week. We checked it out and were surprised that it is further along than we thought and for good reason. Justin Sun id involved at just about every level. The talks are ongoing but if it doesn’t happen it certainly won’t be for lack of effort on his/their part.”\nSource 2: “Yes. True, JS (Justin Sun) involved daily. Been here in person once. Will have more info later.”\nSource 3: “I am not sure who you guys are talking to but I know of two different discussions that have involved Justin as well as the team there. He spins a narrative and expects to get results. Even here (Gemini) where things can be pretty buttoned up…there is serious respect for the guy.”\nAs we previously reported, Tron is working swiftly to be included on one of these larger and of scale institutional platforms. They want the publicity, but also the liquidity that it would provide.\nSome may claim that Justin Sun is nothing more than a self-promoting ‘dream catcher’ using the landscape to ‘shill’ Tron. Who knows. What we do know is the guy is hustling to move his brand into the crypto mainstream. Even more than mainstream, he wants to move it firmly into the Top Ten per market cap and keep it there.\nWhether or not this sort of exchange move makes that happen is yet to be known – but you can bet that Tron, Justin Sun, and the rest of their crew are hard at it.\n**And just a few minutes ago we picked up another tip from a fourth source: “Be on the lookout for an announcement after the airdrop completes. More news coming for Tron fans. Could be related to your exchange stuff. Just keep it on background.”**\nGiven that little piece of new info, these talks could be speeding up. Whatever and however it works out, we will be there to cover it.

There was a break above a crucial declining channel with resistance at $9,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is currently struggling to settle above $9,400 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\nBitcoin price is showing positive signs above $9,200 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD has to settle above the 100 hourly SMA to climb above $9,500 in the near term. Bitcoin Price Trend\nAfter a downside correction, bitcoin price found a strong buying interest near the $9,000 level against the US Dollar. The price formed a low at $8,969 and started an upside move. It climbed higher and cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $9,959 high to $8,969 low. It opened the doors for more upsides and the price broke a couple of key hurdles near $9,180 and $9,200.\nMore importantly, there was a break above a crucial declining channel with resistance at $9,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The pair tested the next major resistance at $9,450 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It seems like buyers struggled to break the $9,450 resistance since it is the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $9,959 high to $8,969 low. It is currently consolidating gains near the $9,350 level and the 100 hourly SMA. Once there is a successful close above 100 SMA and $9,450, the price may resume its uptrend.\nLooking at the chart , there are many positive signs above the $9,200 support. As long as the price is stable and holds the bullish bias above $9,200, it is likely to break $9,450. The next stop for buyers could be $9,600 and $9,750.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is slowly moving in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is now well above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $9,200 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T13:25:34.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "03a58eb999ecbc8d69c38267cc2e1dbff4d4f9b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTXew77WJHR.7ltvJYfqf0TJ9cCg63p5a04TN3t1VgosSdMHP_HPLm7GgssjBozRkQ65vswDFCCmIZxkyjG8SuC0buKBuePAwRNTI3MCWFnoQ--", "site_full": "okas.info", "site": "okas.info", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Developers Build Prototype for 'Dandelion' Privacy Tool 2018 – Crypto Addict", "title_full": "Bitcoin Developers Build Prototype for 'Dandelion' Privacy Tool 2018 – Crypto Addict", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "03a58eb999ecbc8d69c38267cc2e1dbff4d4f9b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTXew77WJHR.7ltvJYfqf0TJ9cCg63p5a04TN3t1VgosSdMHP_HPLm7GgssjBozRkQ65vswDFCCmIZxkyjG8SuC0buKBuePAwRNTI3MCWFnoQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Developers Build Prototype for 'Dandelion' Privacy Tool 2018 – Crypto Addict", "text": "Bitcoin Developers Build Prototype for 'Dandelion' Privacy Tool By okas Posted on May 10, 2018\nDevelopers hoping to bring a higher level of transaction anonymity to the bitcoin blockchain have built a prototype for their “Dandelion” privacy project.\nThe test, according to an email sent to the bitcoin development mailing list on Thursday, comes after the team behind the project added more theoretical analysis in a bid to address concerns that the initial Dandelion proposal may be exposed to a deanonymization attack.\nA variety of projects have focused on this question within the bitcoin network, all of which seek to improve privacy for users of the public – and pseudonymous – blockchain. As previously reported by CoinDesk, the Dandelion Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) was first published in June of last year, backed by Zcash advisor and University of Illinois assistant professor Andrew Miller, and several other faculty members and students from the school.\nThe proposal initially aimed to introduce a two-phase route for bitcoin transactions: “stem,” which is the transaction itself, and “fluff,” which is an obfuscation phase that would eventually obscure the original IP address of a bitcoin sender.\nHowever, following the proposal’s publication, Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell pointed out that the tech may run into deanonymization over time, which means attackers will still be able to identify the origin by cross-checking transaction patterns. RELATED : EU Eyes Blockchain Push With New FinTech Motion Plan\nYet in the latest update, the team behind the Dandelion project have suggested a “per-inbound-edge,” which essentially aims to ensure Dandelion transactions sent from one node will be routed in different paths in the network in order to block the identification of traceable data.\nSubsequently, the team has built a prototype and moved to test the project on its own small network, finding that so far Dandelion is compatible with existing versions of bitcoin, the team said.\n“Dandelion does not conflict with existing versions of Bitcoin. A Bitcoin node that supports Dandelion appears no differently to Bitcoin nodes running older software versions. Bitcoin nodes that support Dandelion can identify feature support through a probe message,” the team wrote in an implementation document.

Read: Indian Ponzi Scheme-Funded Cryptocurrency Mine Raided by Police RBI Crackdown Drives Crypto Businesses Overseas\nThe crackdown on cryptocurrencies initiated by the RBI has reportedly comprised a catalyst for the migration of numerous Indian cryptocurrency companies and ICOs seeking favorable regulatory jurisdictions.\nWith India’s banking sector prohibited from providing financial services to businesses dealing in cryptocurrencies, many of India’s crypto companies have been left with no choice but to relocate overseas. Estonian E-Residency Program Attracts Indian Crypto Entrepreneurs\nAccording to a report by Factor Daily , Estonia has emerged as a popular destination among Indian cryptocurrency entrepreneurs. Launched in 2014, Estonia’s e-residency programme provides a simple avenue through which companies can become based in the eastern-European nation. Estonia also offers favorable taxation and regulatory apparatus for cryptocurrency and blockchain companies.\nNilesh Trivedi, the founder of Indium, is currently completing his e-residency application for Estonia Mr. Trivedi states that he would “ideally like to diversify from India given the way things are moving here in regard to cryptocurrency and the blockchain space. It’s too uncertain.”\nMr. Trivedi states that the e-residency “will just cost me 100 Euros for three years and I can renew it again after that,” adding that “the tax regime there is good.” Mr. Trivedi also notes that “Being registered [in Estonia] will also allow [him] to offer other services and conduct business in the EU.” Analysts Warn of ‘Crypto Brain-Drain’\nJoel John, an analyst at Outlier Ventures, has warned that the RBI’s prohibitive policy regarding cryptocurrency companies risks creating a brain-drain among India’s cryptocurrency and blockchain specialists.\nMr. John stated “We are having talented people and companies from the blockchain space move out of India. There are enough countries out there who realize the importance and want to take a lead in the blockchain ecosystem.” Mr. John added that “Companies moving abroad is not a new trend but the regulatory complexities faced by blockchain companies have accelerated [the trend].”\nA number of other jurisdictions perceived to be hubs of innovation within the cryptocurrency and finance sectors have also been cited as popular destinations among India’s migrating crypto industry, including Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Japan.\nDo you agree that the RBI’s policies will lead to a ‘brain-drain’ among professionals specializing in the breakthrough industries of cryptocurrency and blockchain?

According to Funstrat, the hash power, which is the processing power used to find the solution to the mathematical equations to receive bitcoin rewards, will increase by 350 percent by 2019, according to CNBC .\nSam Doctor, head of data science research at Fundstrat, is reported as saying that:\nWe believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range.\nLast December, the price of bitcoin rose to within touching distance of $20,000 for the first time. Yet, such highs for the currency didn’t remain high for long. At the start of 2018, the first three months of the year saw bitcoin’s value drop to $6,200, representing its worst first quarter since it came into existence.\nSince then, though, the cryptocurrency has risen in price. At the time of publishing it is trading at $9,133, according to CoinMarketCap. Yet, while it has increased in value since the beginning of the year, the thought of it possibly rising to $64,000 by the end of 2018 seems inconceivable right now.\nFundstrat co-founder Tom Lee has also been bullish on the price of bitcoin. He thinks that the price of the cryptocurrency will reach $25,000 in five years , and is of the opinion that investors should hodl the currency during price drops. It remains to be seen whether or not bitcoin can attain new heights and what this will mean for the market as a whole.\nFor now, though, the industry patiently waits to see when, not if, bitcoin once again crests the $10,000 mark. It can only be a matter of time. Featured image from Shutterstock.

Dünyanın en değerli kripto para birimi olan Bitcoin, Kellyye göre artık önlemez bir yükselişe geçti, engel olmak ise son derece zor. Kelly bu düşüncelerini, nedenleriyle birlikte açıkladı.\nBitcoinin oldukça ciddi bir pazar olduğunu söyleyen Kelly, karşı görüşe sahip ekonomistlerle sürekli çatışma halinde. Kendisine göre artık kripto paralar, finansal konferanslarda eskiye nazaran daha çok yer buluyorlar. Diğer pazarlara kıyasla henüz değeri çok düşük olan kripto para pazarı, yavaş yavaş büyük oyuncuların da dikkatini çekiyor. Kelly, artık 460 milyar dolar seviyelerine yükselen kripto para piyasasının göz ardı edilemeyeceğini, büyük oyuncuların sürece dahil olacaklarını söylüyor.\nBitcoin dahil tüm kripto paralar, sayıları çok fazla ve harcadıkları tutarlar çok az olan bireysel yatırımcılara göre değerleniyorlar. Büyük yatırımcıların büyük miktarlarda gerçekleştirdikleri alım-satımlar, ani değer değişimlerine neden oluyor. Bugüne kadar yaşanan dalgalanmaların bir kısmı, Güney Kore gibi önemli pazarlarda oluşan devlet baskısı ile küçük yatırımcıların, toplu şekilde pazardan çekilmeleri olmuştu. Balina olarak tabir edilen büyük yatırımcılar ise sürece dahil oldukları anda oyunun kurallarını değiştirebilecek etkiye sahipler.\nYouTube\n2018in başlarında yaşanan ani düşüşler sırasında bir Çinli yatırımcının 10.000 Bitcoin birden aldığı biliniyor. Bunun gibi işlemler, piyasaya daha fazla para girmesini, dolayısıyla Bitcoinin değerinin artmasını kolaylaştırıyor. Kelly ise yakın zamanda Bitcoinin benzer yatırımlar alacağını, bu yatırımların da belirli düzenlemelerden sonra geleceğin söylüyor. Düzenlemelerle anlattığı şey ise uluslararası hizmet veren borsaların, piyasaya çekidüzen vermeleri.\nBitcoin tüm olumsuz yorumlara rağmen doğrudan kripto para piyasasında hizmet veren yatırımcılara göre artık önlemez bir değer.\n10 Mayıs Perşembe sabahı saat 08:30da Bitcoinin değeri 9.312 dolar olarak kaydedildi.

Some people expect big things, whereas others are convinced BTC will not stick around for that long. Nasdaq chief executive Adena Friedman is extremely bullish when it comes to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. In fact, Friedman is confident Bitcoin is the “next step in the space of currency”. Can Bitcoin Appease the Masses?\nIt has become apparent Bitcoin still has a public image problem. Despite a solid price change late last year, the first few months of 2018 have been far less successful. As such, there are a lot of people who claim Bitcoin will not succeed in the long run. Warren Buffett made that rather adamant by claiming how Bitcoin is worse than “rat poison”. A very strong sentiment which doesn’t sit well with the cryptocurrency community.\nBill Gates is seemingly convinced Buffett is right. If he had the chance, Gates would “bet against Bitcoin”. Even though Gates could easily short the BTC price, it seems he wants to do more “permanent damage” in this regard. Such opinions are not unique, as cryptocurrency has suffered from such negative comments for some time now. Nasdaq chief executive Adena Friedman has a completely different outlook on cryptocurrency.\nInstead, Friedman envisions a bright future for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A globalized payment mechanism is needed to deal with the cross-border digital economy. In Friedman’s opinion, cryptocurrencies are perfectly suited for this particular need. All cryptocurrencies operate in a completely borderless and decentralized nature with no intermediaries involved at any time. The Evolution of Cryptocurrency\nTogether with cryptocurrencies, Friedman is also high on blockchain technology. This technology allows for some unique business models and solution for pressing financial problems. With cross-border payments becoming a lot more common, a new approach needs to be taken altogether. Friedman explains how this situation can change as follows:\n“How it evolves and which of the cryptocurrencies may or may not be the one that ultimately gets embraced, I think that really the jury is still out on that. But I do think the idea of a more globalized payment mechanism that is more efficient than what we have today allows for money to transfer across countries and certainly supports the Internet economy.”\nSuch a bullish outlook comes at an interesting time for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. With the markets slowly recovering over the past few weeks, the sentiment toward this form of money has shifted once again.

It’s an opportunity for crypto celebs to tread the red carpet and for everyone from minnows to whales to mingle, network, and learn. But if you’re not careful, it’s also a chance to get your devices pwned and your cryptocurrency swiped.\nAlso read: Xapo Estimated to be Housing 6.25% of Total BTC Supply May Is the Month for Blockchain Conferences\nThere are cryptocurrency conferences all through the year, but May is when they reach their zenith. Last weekend saw Futurama in Dubai, a glitzy event whose guests included Brock Pierce and whose closing party took place on a yacht in the Gulf. Next week it’s the turn of Consensus NYC, the industry’s largest event that will welcome 7,000 attendees and hundreds of delegates.\nThe cumulative value of the portfolios swilling around inside New York’s Hilton Midtown will comfortably run into the billions of dollars. The vast majority of that wealth will have been left at home on hardware devices and paper wallets stashed in secure vaults, but that doesn’t mean attendees will be immune from thieves.\nFor one thing, you probably have more of your crypto holdings on an exchange, readily accessible via the 2FA app in your pocket, than you’d care to admit. And for another, hackers don’t have to strike at the event. They can phish or social engineer now and strike later when you’re on the other side of the world, or when you’re on the long-haul flight home and unaware that your SIM card has just been swapped. Keep Calm and Be Prepared\nThe first rule when attending any public conference, especially one as high profile as Consensus, is to avoid insecure wifi networks. How do you know if a network’s insecure? You probably don’t, which is why you’re best relying on mobile data only. That wifi point named after the conference you’re attending could just as easily be a honeypot.\nIf you must connect via wifi while at the conference or your hotel, be sure to use a VPN. In addition, keep your cellphone’s bluetooth and NFC turned off and don’t plug it into a USB point to charge. You don’t know what’s on the other end of that cable, and while it could be innocuous, it could just as easily be extracting your data. Be Careful What You Share and Who You Share It With\nThe best thing about blockchain conferences isn’t the panel discussions and it certainly isn’t the ICO pitches. No, the best part is the after-parties. All those networking opportunities and chances to bump fists with crypto bros you’ve previously only known as an avatar in a Telegram group. Some words of caution are necessary though.\nLiterally anyone can whip together a business card purporting to be an investor or OTC broker, pull on an expensive shirt, and extend a firm handshake. Due to the public nature of crypto conferences, there is no means of vetting participants, and no easy means of telling who’s legit and who’s a snake. That ICO whale who’s befriended you and returned to your room for drinks could be the real deal…or they could just be waiting for an opportunity to slip something in your vodka and pilfer your laptop once you’ve passed out. Crypto People Are Good People\nThis advice isn’t intended to be alarmist. Crypto people are some of the friendliest and most generous people you could ever hope to meet IRL (the less said about their Twitter personas the better). Provided you follow basic op-sec, you will be able to relax at the conference, enjoy yourself, and forge friendships that will last for years. Be careful, though, not to brag about gains, share portfolios, or engage in any other behavior that could mark you out as a target.\nIf possible, leave your primary laptop and smartphone at home and travel with a burner. That way, whatever happens, you’ll wake up regretting nothing more than that last shot of tequila. Be discrete, conceal your wealth, and remember that there’s no such thing as free wifi. Do all that and you’ll be sure to have a ball.\nWhat other precautions do you think conference delegates should take?

The mural painter known by the moniker ‘PBOY’ is incorporating bitcoin QR codes in his artworks. This allows him to receive donations from the public in crypto. Bitcoin Meets Art\nThe term “struggling artist” is an age-long trope. Not every artist is fortunate enough to have a wealthy patron financing their talents. Even with crowdfunded platforms like Ulule and Patreon, it is still difficult for many artists to eke out a living. For Boyart, the solution to the problem has been Bitcoin, the world’s most famous cryptocurrency.\nThe French street artist recently rose to prominence when one of his murals became a trending topic on the Bitcoin subreddit . Many Redditors were impressed not just with his talent but with the melding of art and bitcoin.\nApart from adding bitcoin QR codes to his paintings, Boyart also explores themes related to cryptos and decentralization in his work. The artwork that made Boyart popular on Reddit was a mural painting of Rembrandt, the famous Dutch painter.\nDespite his incredible talent, Rembrandt had severe financial troubles during his lifetime. He even had to sell his house due to mounting debt. There is an anachronistic component to the mural, Rembrandt lived in the 17th century but is depicted reading a newspaper.\nWhile this is the piece that shot Boyart to prominence, the artist says he has incorporated crypto themes in previous works. According to PBOY:\nI first included a Bitcoin QR code in my work in November 2017. I painted a street art piece of a child asking his father ‘Dad, what is money?’ And I placed a QR code at the side of my signature. I wasn’t sure if someone had done this already, but I wanted to see if people could support street artists with donations. I did it as an homage to Andreas Antonopoulos’ book The Internet of Money.\nSo far, Boyart has received more about 0.11 bitcoin (approximately $1,000) in donations. The artist describes himself as a crypto enthusiast saying that the creative industry has a lot to benefit from decentralization.

The current market value of the bitcoins is more than $140 million, according to the CoinMarketCap price index, which values one bitcoin at around $8,800 . The sale of such a large amount of bitcoins could have a significant impact on cryptocurrency markets. The Tokyo-based Mt Gox went out of business in 2014 after losing around 1 million of its customers bitcoins. At the time, the lost bitcoins were worth around $387 million but the price of the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency has since risen considerably. The moving of the funds, first spotted by The Next Web, is the first time in over three months that the former exchange has moved any of its assets. Mt Gox has previously offloaded around $500 million worth of bitcoin , with each sale usually being reflected by severe drops in cryptocurrency markets. “It appears that the Mt Gox trust… NYSE Isn’t Planning a Bitcoin Futures Market, But a Proper Crypto Exchange According to a report by the New York Times, the world’s biggest stock exchange New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is planning to operate a proper cryptocurrency trading platform.

Kelly is Shocked\nEarlier this week, as CCN reported , NYSE’s parent company ICE Exchange has been developing and testing a bitcoin exchange to serve investors from the traditional finance sector. Various reports revealed that ICE Exchange is not launching a futures market like CME and CBOE, rather a proper bitcoin exchange on which investors can buy, sell, and store bitcoin directly.\n“The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been working on an online trading platform that would allow large investors to buy and hold Bitcoin, according to emails and documents viewed by The New York Times and four people briefed on the effort who asked to remain anonymous because the plans were still confidential,” the New York Times reported.\nKelly emphasized that while he is “shocked” the cryptocurrency market did not surge in value based on the entrance of NYSE into the market, he stated that investors have missed out on an important element, which is that like Xapo and Coinbase, NYSE and its parent company ICE Exchange will start to operate a custody solution for institutional holders. The operator of the NYSE is planning to support bitcoin trading.\n“I’m actually a bit shocked that the market did not pick up on this. Dominic Chu of CNBC said that investors will get physical delivery of bitcoin. That doesn’t sound that interesting except for the fact that it means ICE Exchange has a custody solution. That has been the big hurdle. How do you hold onto these assets. These are generally bearer instruments, just like gold bearer bonds. That’s the big deal. They have come up with a custody solution for institutional holders,” said Kelly.\nHe further noted that the development of a bitcoin custody solution by ICE Exchange signifies cryptocurrencies have become an emerging asset class. More importantly, Kelly added that the growth of cryptocurrencies as an emerging asset class will allow multi-billion dollar pensions, endowment, and institutional investors to invest in the cryptocurrency market.\n“Finally, it opens the door for pensions and endowments. Up to this point, it has been very difficult for them to get comfortable compliance wise in holding cryptocurrency. If ICE has a custodian solution that is SEC compliant, that’s going to open the floodgates,” Kelly added. What Will Floodgates Look Like?\nThe cryptocurrency market has become a $0.5 trillion market with barely any capital from institutional investors, endowments, and pensions. If institutional investors begin to enter the cryptocurrency market with tens of billions of dollars in new capital, it will allow the cryptocurrency market to grow at a pace that is incomparable to its growth rate in the past. It could enable the cryptocurrency market to evolve into a multi-trillion dollar market, as many investors have expected since 2016.\nImages from Shutterstock.

Determining that “value” is not as straightforward as it seems. Thomas Lee of Fundstrat proposes a radical yet intriguing new idea. By determining the breakeven point for Bitcoin, a new metric can be established.\nIt is evident Fundstrat has been paying a lot of attention to cryptocurrency. Their focus on this industry has increased significantly since early 2018. It was a matter of time until the firm came up with its own “creation” related to this industry. Rather than creating their own coin, the firm is more interested in technical metrics. Known as price/ Miner’s Breakeven Cost and offers some unique insights. The new Metric by Fundstrat\nMost people are aware of how Bitcoin mining is intensive and expensive. Miners need a specific bitcoin price to break even, let alone make a profit. That exact value has been speculated upon far and wide. The end result is confusing, as the numbers are rather conflicting. For Fundstrat, the P/BE metric can provide an important support level.

Or that is what people would think. Tom Lee explains the firm expects the Bitcoin price will hit $39,000 by late 2019. This is not a wet-finger-prediction, as it uses the new metric to come to this conclusion.\nWhether or not this metric by Fundstrat will hold true, is a different matter altogether. The Bitcoin price is subject to massive speculation and manipulation. The bullish Fundstrat outlook is promising, but the reality often looks very different.

The Chinese Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer had earlier announced plans for an IPO outside of mainland China. If successful, Canaan will become the first blockchain enterprise to be listed on the Hong Kong Bourse. Hong Kong and Not the United States\nReports emerged in April that Canaan Creative was eyeing an IPO. At the time, the available narrative indicated that the IPO would take place outside of China. Based on this, the United States and Hong Kong were the two most likely locations suggested.\nNow, unnamed insider sources say the company has tentatively settled on Hong Kong. The sources, however, say that the decision isn’t yet final. Meanwhile, Canaan has yet to release any details concerning its listing plans. The company is reportedly expecting to raise $1 billion through the IPO. Previous IPO Attempts\nThe company will be hoping that its current attempt at an IPO is successful. In the last two years, Canaan has unsuccessfully tried obtaining listing status in China. The Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer decided to apply to the Chinese New Third Board Market. The company was looking to take advantage of the market’s less stringent regulatory requirements for startup enterprises. However, for unknown reasons, the plan fell through.\nIn 2016, the company tried to use a back-door listing approach. Luyitong, the electric hardware manufacturer, planned to acquire the company for $485 million. The deal failed to sail through due to regulatory red flags over the deal reportedly being “over-priced.” Canaan Creative: The Bitcoin Mining Giant\nCanaan is one of the major players in the Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturing arena. Despite stiff competition from Bitfury and Bitmain, the company still posted revenue of $156 million (1 billion yuan) in 2017, which amounted to a 600 percent increase from 2016. Canaan’s range of Avalon Bitcoin miners is one of the most popular units in the Bitcoin mining arena. Avalon 841 bitcoin miner\nThe Chinese government’s crackdown on cryptos in the past year does not seem to have slowed down Canaan’s growth. The company’s plans for the future include some blockchain-powered home appliances that also have passive mining capabilities. Canaan also wants to create legacy AI chips that can mine altcoins like Litecoin .\nWill Canaan Creative be able to carry out a successful IPO in Hong Kong? Do you think the continued Chinese crypto crackdown will affect Canaan’s profits? Let us know in the comments below.\nImage courtesy of Instagram Canaan Creative.

(Nasdaq: AAPL) shares and refusing to take a stand on gun control, the 87-year-old investing icon took a few shots at bitcoin, saying: “It’s probably rat poison squared.”\nAs a crypto investor, and one who believes in a better, more efficient world served by getting rid of the middleman … I’m going to (surprisingly) agree with Buffett here. Any reference to bitcoin as “rat poison” is an entirely appropriate metaphor.\nWhile rat poison might not be the best means of quenching one’s thirst, however, I don’t think that Buffett’s beverage investment, The Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) , constitutes a healthier alternative.\nRat poison, on the other hand, can be extremely useful for ridding oneself of a rodent infestation. In this case, the vermin-infested governments and corporations (especially banks) that plop themselves smack in the middle of economic transactions, and then extract a Big Gulp-sized toll on societies. Bitcoin Restores Power to the People\nBitcoin’s technological breakthrough allows anyone with an internet connection to buy and store something of value that’s neither tied to a state nor a bank. This allows the free market to decide what the demand (and price) should be for money, not a group of elitist, egghead economists who spectacularly fail once a decade.\nThis will be a liberating force as citizens are able to hold more of their own value and won’t be subject to the whims of a profligate government or monopolizing middleman.\nBitcoin can be a check on people in power. Citizens now have the option to swap their domestic currency for bitcoin, avoiding hyperinflation and currency debasements that threaten their purchasing power.\nVenezuela’s annual inflation rate is over 1,000%, and bitcoins are bought and sold at significant premiums as the locals ditch their worthless currency for something that can better store value.\nMost citizens simply can’t pick up and move to another country, thereby voting with their feet. And in corrupt democracies like Ivory Coast and Zimbabwe, voting is inconsequential anyway.\nHowever, the threat of millions of citizens voting with their wallets should worry dictators and autocrats from Caracas to Shanghai. A windfall of citizens moving out of their fiat currency into cryptocurrencies would be enough to spark a currency crisis and facilitate social unrest.\nThere’s a reason governments are fearful of bitcoin and have tried to suppress trading and ownership of the digital currency. When they lose control of the money, they lose control of their oppressed citizenry. The Digital Gold Rush\nNow, perhaps ol’ Warren simply got this one wrong. Hey, when you’ve got $84 billion in the bank, it’s hard to empathize with the little guy trying to put food on the table in faraway lands.\nMaybe he didn’t understand how investments in the new “internet of value” actually work. As he recently told Yahoo Finance:\nIf you buy something like a farm, an apartment house or an interest in a business … you can do that on a private basis … and it’s a perfectly satisfactory investment. You look at the investment itself to deliver the return to you. Now, if you buy something like bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don’t really have anything that has produced anything. You’re just hoping the next guy pays more.\nBuffett continued :\nYou aren’t investing when you do that. You’re speculating. There’s nothing wrong with it. If you wanna gamble, somebody else will come along and pay more money tomorrow. That’s one kind of game. That is not investing.\nFirst things first. I agree with the Oracle here that the crypto asset class is entirely speculative.\nMost of the 1,500-plus cryptocurrencies have no real-world product, and therefore no utility value. Many of them likely won’t even launch anything, and they’ll end up burning their investors.\nAs I’ve written before, there’s a digital gold rush happening here, and it’s attracting entrepreneurs with great ideas and charlatans with not-so-great ideas. As the world becomes digitally connected, we will need economies of scale to manage these new networks and provision digital and real-world resources.\nThis is par for the course. Most, if not all, early-stage investments are extremely speculative and difficult to value.\nIt’s the difference between buying a fully furnished home in a well-developed neighborhood and buying a piece of land in the middle of the woods. The raw land might have more upside if the surrounding area is developed, but there’s no guarantee you’ll get your money back.\nCrypto just happens to be the hottest piece of raw property on the market, and people are paying excessive premiums to get a piece.\nEarly-stage investments are notorious for either returning upward of 1,000% or zero. That’s why early-stage investors own large, diversified portfolios of very small bets. If they lose on 90% on them but hit a few home runs, they can still outperform the indexes.\nReality (and gravity) will drag most of these crypto assets down to $0. But some will deliver products that change the world. Keep More of Your Hard-Earned Wealth\nBitcoin obviates the need for a bank or government to create and store money, and this is only the first iteration in the crypto space.\nProjects like Ethereum and EOS are building the necessary infrastructure to power smart contracts, a method to exchange anything of value in a transparent way without the need for a middleman. Think about renting someone’s house without Airbnb or calling a taxi without needing Uber.\nOld valuation techniques can’t be applied to these new crypto assets. Discount cash-flow analysis is a futile endeavor. There are no companies here, just open-source software protocols. (Protocol is a fancy way of saying “way of doing things.”)\nThe value of a crypto asset relates to the demand for the digitally linked network. The tokens represent a fee for accessing the network, or a fuel to power a smart contract.\nImagine if you were charged a small fee, represented by an “email token,” to send an email. As more people move from the spying eyes of Google’s Gmail, the value of this token would increase in price.\nAdditionally, since crypto tokens facilitate economic transactions without the need for a middleman, they will allow those who provide value to keep more of their hard-earned wealth.\nIf there’s anything the world could use right now, it’s for workers to keep more of the fruits of their labor.\nI’m sure that’s something Warren Buffett would definitely agree with me on.\nRegards,\nIan King\nEditor, Crypto Profit Trader\nEditor’s Note: There’s a little-known investment program that’s the single most powerful way for an investor — regardless of how much or how little they have — to multiply their wealth tenfold over and over again.

Fundstrat’s Sam Doctor wrote earlier today that the price of Bitcoin could reach anywhere between $20,000 and $64,000 next year. Fundstrat Release Second Bullish Call in a Week\nSam Doctor’s prediction was explained in a note to Fundstrat’s clients. It set out the reasoning behind such a call, claiming the gains would be a product of the mining process used to verify transactions on the network and release the remaining Bitcoin of the 21 million total. The thinking is that the cost of mining a single Bitcoin has proved solid support in the past. As the difficulty of mining increases, so too will this level of strong support. According to Bloomberg , the note read:\n“Bitcoin miners verify and process transactions, supporting the network in exchange for mining rewards and transaction fees… We argue that the Price/Miner’s Breakeven Cost multiple has proven a reliable long-term support level, and further, that the likely trajectory of future mining infrastructure growth should underpin Bitcoin price appreciation into year-end 2019.”\nEarlier this week, Fundstrat managing partner Tom Lee predicted a short term rally in the Bitcoin price. He feels that the annual Consensus conference happening next week could cause the kind of gains that would push the asset back above the $10,000 mark – potentially by a fair bit.\nThe 2018 Consensus conference is being held in Manhattan from May 14-16. It’s thought that almost 7,000 cryptocurrency proponents will be in attendance making it one of the industry’s largest.\nLee highlighted in his note to Fundstrat clients that each of the four previous Consensus events had seen the price of Bitcoin gain between 10 and 70 percent over the course of the conference. In fact, he went further than this. He stated that since Bitcoin was currently down on its opening price of the year, the rally could be even greater than those previous. This could see the digital asset hitting close to its all-time highs of just short of $20,000.\nThis week’s double bull call from Tom Lee and Sam Doctor is far from the first time that Fundstrat have been optimistic about the price of Bitcoin. Lee has previously said that a long-term target of $100,000 is conceivable. He has also stated that by the end of 2018, one of the 21 million total BTC units will cost around $25,000. His predictions have been proved correct in the past too. The mid-2017 call of $6,000 within a year from him making it was smashed just months later – much before the parabolic bubble-like run that rounded off 2017. Featured image from Shutterstock.

When it kicks off this week, one ticket to CoinDesk’s Consensus three-day conference in New York City can cost roughly $2,000.\nWell over 4,000 are expected to attend, up from 2,700 attendees last year. So at a minimum, the conference is likely bringing in $8 million.\nMore than 20 other events, some with similarly high entrance fees, are also scheduled during the days around Consensus. The bitcoin conference that began with 400 attendees three years ago is now the centerpiece of a full-blown “Blockchain Week NYC,” an event run in partnership with the New York Economic Development Corporation.\nConsensus conference attendance growth over the years Last year’s conferences helped drive the surge of attention on cryptocurrencies. Around Consensus 2017 last May, Bitcoin accelerated its gains above $2,000, and was bolstered by the first TokenSummit and Ethereal Summit.\nPrices then skyrocketed over the rest of the year, drawing Wall Street’s interest and topping $10,000 for the first time after the “Consensus Invest” conference in November. Since then, however, Bitcoin has lost more than half its value since topping $19,000 in December, but it remains more than 4 times above where it was last May.

Essentia has implemented KYC/AML verification ahead of the public sale so participants wishing to contribute to the token generation event must follow the verification procedure Essentia has outlined in detail in its project blog.\nDuring the process of verification, interested parties will have the opportunity to experience the Essentia framework in action by creating their own dashboard through a series of quick steps. Here, documents can be uploaded in a secure environment and applicants can specify such details as the ETH wallet they wish to contribute from.\nAnyone wishing to contribute more than 10 ETH will be required to submit additional details, and to verify that they are not the US or Chinese resident. Having completed verification for the Essentia public sale, applicants may return to their dashboard at any time to check on the status of their application. Due to high demand, Essentia cannot guarantee that successful applicants will be able to receive the full allocation of tokens they have requested.\nEssentia co-founder Matteo Giancarlo Zago has stated: “The public sale marks the beginning of the next exciting phase for Essentia. Our community has been incredibly patient over the last few months, while the team has worked away behind the scenes to finalize everything in readiness for this moment. We look forward to welcoming applicants to our public sale, and to have them accompany us on the our journey building the infrastructure of the next web.”\nHaving recently signed an agreement with the Finnish government to develop a blockchain solution for the MTK ministry, one of Essentia’s first tasks following the public sale will be to recommence development on this initiative. In addition, the team will ramp up work on its enterprise solutions and fine-tuning the Essentia protocol, which they expect to grow into a thriving ecosystem of integrated dApps and other third party services.\nEssentia successfully hit the hard cap during their pre-sale at the beginning of May, raising over $20m by reaching the maximum allocation of ESS tokens. As a consequence, no more pre-sale applications can be accepted. The Essentia public sale will mark the final stage of the process, which aims to give the Essentia community a chance to get involved, with 595 million ESS tokens allocated for the general sale to be distributed to all participants.\nTo be a part of their growing community join their Telegram channel https://t.me/essentia_one/ .\nContact Email Address", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "essentia", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "essentia opens kyc verification ahead of public sale - bitcoin news may 16", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "essentia", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T12:37:45.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "475e961e14b017e0a7f86f8972b77fd597aae380", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg90J5ryLRQGL1xdpYtB6y8tsJ2wPJiUVmgPtd0flibUbM8NA0REB46rdZ5Uud.1vRpjZGCGw2j7thMRcGNttw8sm5D7dLyNnibrIGAnk_nEdJPgM4K2eDKIRt1gZdSyJ0UeXlt8UnP1Xw--", "site_full": "www.topix.com", "site": "topix.com", "site_section": "http://www.topix.com/forum/city/summerville-ga", "site_categories": ["entertainment"], "section_title": "Summerville Forum » Topix", "title": "\"....Bitcoin and the security of Cryptocurrency.\"", "title_full": "\"....Bitcoin and the security of Cryptocurrency.\" - Discussion on Topix", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1199, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "475e961e14b017e0a7f86f8972b77fd597aae380", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg90J5ryLRQGL1xdpYtB6y8tsJ2wPJiUVmgPtd0flibUbM8NA0REB46rdZ5Uud.1vRpjZGCGw2j7thMRcGNttw8sm5D7dLyNnibrIGAnk_nEdJPgM4K2eDKIRt1gZdSyJ0UeXlt8UnP1Xw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jojo12", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "\"....Bitcoin and the security of Cryptocurrency.\"", "text": "\"Edward Snowden talks about Bitcoin and the security of Cryptocurrency.\"\nhttps://youtu.be/_Iisu0snIL0", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://youtu.be/_Iisu0snIL0"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T10:07:59.039+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "60bcbd6167fb2994ff2d04dd1d7cd9ddea31a661", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpxX9LLOjzqT4RKR9pjet5Q7VzC_ydWg_g-", "site_full": "bitlyfool.com", "site": "bitlyfool.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bank Of America CTO Calls Bitcoin ‘Troubling’, Reconfirms Credit Card Purchase Ban – BitlyFool.com", "title_full": "Bank Of America CTO Calls Bitcoin ‘Troubling’, Reconfirms Credit Card Purchase Ban – BitlyFool.com", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://bitlyfool.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/images-17.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "60bcbd6167fb2994ff2d04dd1d7cd9ddea31a661", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpxX9LLOjzqT4RKR9pjet5Q7VzC_ydWg_g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "William Suberg", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bank Of America CTO Calls Bitcoin ‘Troubling’, Reconfirms Credit Card Purchase Ban – BitlyFool.com", "text": "William Suberg\nBank of America CTO Kathy Bessant has told mainstream media customers will continue to be banned from buying Bitcoin using its credit cards. Bank of America (BoA) doubled down on its decision to stop customers buying Bitcoin with its credit cards May 10. The bank’s official called cryptocurrency “troubling,” according to CNBC.\nSpeaking to CNBC in an edition of the network’s Squawk Box segment, BoA’s CTO Kathy Bessant said that cryptocurrencies are “designed to be not transparent” and thus hinder banks’ attempts to catch “bad guys.”\n“As a payment system, I think it's troubling, because the foundation of the banking system is on the transparency between the sender and the receiver, and cryptocurrency is designed to be nothing of the sort, in fact [it's] designed to be not transparent,” she told the program.\nBoA caused friction with its cardholders when it instigated the Bitcoin purchasing ban in February.\nThe move saw JPMorgan and Citigroup follow suit, the former nonetheless subsequently finding itself at the center of a consumer lawsuit in April over “fraudulent” purchase fees.\nFor Bessant, however, cryptocurrencies still represent the opposite of financial transparency.\n“The way we sort of quote-unquote catch bad guys is by being transparent in the financial moment of money. Cryptos is the antithesis of that,” she added.\n“Just like we don't allow stocks to be purchased on our credit cards, we're not going to allow cryptos or other currencies to be purchased on our credit cards.”\nWeeks after the initial ban, BoA produced a report conversely identifying future risks to its business, in which it highlighted its “inability to adapt” to the competition cryptocurrency poses.

However, suggestions are that it will be familiar to other crowdfunding models, with Bitcoin support the exclusive focal point for investments.\nThe platform will also reportedly include support for ShapeShift. While there are few details on that front at the moment, this is already fueling interest in the crowdfunding platform from investors and analysts alike.\nThe news is the latest positive development for Bitcoin Cash, and comes in the wake of several key technological developments. Key technical upgrades, combined with the upcoming second network upgrade, are already raising interest in Bitcoin Cash as the closest cryptocurrency to the vision in the original Satoshi whitepaper.\nWith Coinfundr poised to launch later this month, all eyes will now be on whether the platform can carve a niche for itself within the cryptocurrency, as well as the wider crowdfunding sectors. Twitter user @itsmaemon posted a screenshot of the crowdfunding platform, which promised that “anyone can get their campaign funded with cryptocurrencies and get paid almost instantly via Bitcoin Cash.”\n— Unit Maemon (@itsmaemon) May 7, 2018\nIt remains to be seen whether the first Bitcoin-powered crowdfunding platform of its kind can have a defining effect on crowdfunding, and the use of cryptocurrencies in raising capital beyond the increasingly regulated initial coin offering (ICO) model. Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (segwit) Chain are Referred to as BTC coins. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is today the only Bitcoin implementation that follows Satoshi Nakamoto’s original whitepaper for Peer to Peer Electronic Cash. Bitcoin BCH is the only major public blockchain that maintains the original vision for Bitcoin as fast, frictionless, electronic cash.

According to Electrum, the malicious knockoff, Electrum Pro, is designed with malware to hijack private seed keys. The platform is urging users to be wary of the fake bitcoin storage service. Electrum vs. Electrum Pro Bitcoin Wallet\nThe development team at Electrum has since been trying to alert users to the possibility that Electrum Pro is a fake. According to Electrum, the counterfeit platform has been cloning its brand image, even going as far creating a website on the dot-com domain. (In the interest of security, we will not link to the copycat site.) However, the official Electrum site is on the dot-org domain . Electrum also alleges that the knockoff platform has been claiming to be a fork of the Electrum project. Electrum's website is https://t.co/aHiZIZH54e . We do not own electrum dot com, and \"Electrum Pro\" is very likely bitcoin stealing malware. Please use https://t.co/Rne1yx5acw for a list of Bitcoin wallet websites.\n— Electrum (@ElectrumWallet) April 5, 2018\nIn April, Electrum alerted users to the fake platform via a tweet. The fact that the counterfeit service chose to use their brand name without permission raised red flags. The team then set about trying to prove its suspicions and has finally done so as seen in a recent GitHub document . Proof of the Bitcoin Stealing Malware\nOn May 8th, Electrum posted a tweet declaring that they had evidence that Electrum Pro was a malicious copycat platform. Also, the team published the hash of the alleged fake wallet with independent verification from archive.org and Virus Total . In the GitHub document detailing the elaborate scam, the Electrum Pro wallet appears infected with a malware that steals the private seed key of users. Seed keys are cryptographic keys that grant access to the bitcoins stored in a wallet across multiple addresses. Seed keys are usually mnemonic phrases. Here is a verifiable proof that \"Electrum Pro\", a fake version of @ElectrumWallet , is in fact Bitcoin-stealing malware: https://t.co/FvhkTp29wI\n— Electrum (@ElectrumWallet) May 9, 2018\nWhen a user manages any of their Bitcoin addresses via Electrum Pro, their seed key is automatically hacked and sent to the fake electrum.com domain. Once this happens, an unauthorized person can access the user’s funds and steal all the bitcoins in the wallet.\nThe platform also advises users who have inadvertently used Electrum Pro to delete the program and move their bitcoins immediately. Electrum users are urged to avoid downloading binaries from unofficial sources to prevent becoming victims of scams like Electrum Pro. Thus, it is best to visit the official platform website when downloading executables, binaries, and other software programs.\nDo you know of any other malicious cryptocurrency wallet platform?

At approximately 16:45, the bitcoin price entered a severe downward spiral — severe, at least, in comparison to its recent price movements.\nBy 17:00, bitcoin had fallen to $9,205, and it ultimately fell as far as $9,112 before experiencing a $65 bounce. At present, bitcoin is valued at $9,177 on Bitfinex, though it remains to be seen whether BTC will continue to defend the $9,000 barrier. BTC Price Chart\nToday’s movement marks a stark reversal from last Saturday when bitcoin appeared poised to triumphantly cross the $10,000 threshold for the first time since early March.

If an owner has a poor memory, the bitcoins can get locked for eternity in an electronic wallet, like a fly in amber.\nSome high-profile people have admitted this year to losing cryptocurrency, among them Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak.\nIn another case last month, a cryptocurrency promoter doing a livestream on his YouTube channel was notified by a viewer that digital currency was flowing out of the host’s virtual account. The host later acknowledged he suffered losses of “over $2 million.”\nIn the Wild West world of bitcoin and other digital currencies, many new investors may not fully grasp the challenges of keeping their crypto investments safe, whether on their own devices or lodged in accounts at exchanges around the globe.\n“I suspect many small investors may assume that their money is as safe as it would be in an online bank. But that’s not necessarily the case,” said Graham Cluley, a British security blogger and researcher.\nBitcoins first emerged in 2009, spawning the creation of dozens of other digital currencies that exist only in electronic form. They operate independently of central banks and have fluctuated wildly in value. A single bitcoin traded for around $9,130 Thursday afternoon.\nCryptocurrency exchanges, where buyers and sellers gather to trade digital currencies, are like honeypots for hackers. In the largest known heist to date, hackers in late January made off with around $530 million in cryptocurrency from a Tokyo-based exchange, Coincheck.\n“South Korea said they thought it could be North Korea (behind the heist) but I haven’t seen any other evidence of that, and it has the hallmarks of the typical cyber hack by thieves,” said Yaya J. Fanusie, a former economic and counterterrorism analyst at the CIA who is now at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a national security think tank in Washington.\nAn Italian-based platform, BitGrail, reported that hackers made off with more than $170 million of a cryptocurrency known as Nano in February.\nThe loss experienced by Wozniak stung, even though he is a multimillionaire.\n“I had seven bitcoins stolen from me through fraud,” Wozniak told the Global Business Summit in New Delhi Feb. 26, according to the Economic Times newspaper. “Somebody bought them from me online through a credit card and they cancelled the credit card payment. It was that easy! And it was from a stolen credit card number so you can never get it back.”\nBitcoins and many other digital currencies have public keys and private keys. The private key is a secret number that allows someone to access his or her cryptocurrency.\nWhoever has the private key controls what’s in an electronic wallet.\nCluley said there were “lots of reports of folks losing a small fortune (and sometimes a large one) following the loss of their private keys.”\nSometimes the method by which bitcoins are lost remains a mystery years later.\nTom Curry, who is a home builder in Massachusetts, still remembers his chagrin the day in 2013 when he lost 996 bitcoin, which at today’s prices would be about $9.2 million.\n“I woke up at 5:30 or 6 in the morning and I got a text message: ‘All the bitcoins have been removed from your wallet,’\" Curry said. Someone had gained access to his account and his private key.\nCurry bought the bitcoins for a few bucks each, he said, and still rues what they would be worth today if he hadn’t been ripped off.\n“I would no longer be doing construction. I would be in the Caribbean, that’s a definite,” he said in a telephone interview.\nIf a digital currency owner loses a private key — say, storing it on a laptop that melts down, or simply forgetting it — the bitcoins are essentially frozen in an electronic limbo.\n“Let’s say a guy dies and he never gave his wife the private keys, and she doesn’t know how to move that crypto,” Fanusie said. “She’s a millionaire in crypto but with no way to get it.”\nFanusie said problems around securing and managing private keys for electronic wallets is a major drawback to digital currencies, harder than dealing with ordinary passwords.\n“For cryptocurrencies to grow in adoption, someone’s going to have to figure out a better way for private key management, a way that’s more user friendly. Right now, that just doesn’t exist,” Fanusie said.

Telegram Passport will be used to keep personal details and copies of IDs, banking statements, and utility bills to identify users on Telegram’s blockchain platform TON.\nAlso read: After Telegram, Viber May Be Blocked, Russian Minister Says Telegram Passport to Prevent Anonymous Crypto Payments\nDevelopers at Telegram are conducting closed tests of a new service designed to store personal data, according to sources quoted by Russian media. Telegram Passport will be used to verify identities of users on the messenger’s Telegram Open Network. They will be able to buy goods and pay for services on the TON blockchain platform with Telegram’s crypto token called Gram.\nCustomers will provide their personal details and documents, such as copies of IDs, passports, drivers’ licenses, utility bills, bank statements, and possibly photographs. Once uploaded, the information can be potentially shared with Telegram’s partners within the platform, but also on their systems, Vedomosti reported, quoting two sources close to the company.\nTelegram Passport, which may be launched by the summer, is expected to effectively prevent anonymity associated with crypto payments, which is a worrisome aspect for regulators around the world, explained Alexander Filatov, partner at SP Capital. His consulting company has invested in TON and facilitated investments of other interested parties.\nA number of partner businesses will be able to take advantage of the service. The Russian payments services provider Qiwi has already been granted access to the system, according to the report. The company is said to be cooperating with the messenger on the launch of Telegram Passport.\nInitially, only the users, not even Telegram, will have access to their details and documents. They will be able to secure the data with a password and two factor authentication. The company will use the information only with the account holder‘s consent, according to information shared on the closed pages of telegram.org cited by the Russian outlet. Once Telegram’s partners receive the data, they can verify it according to their own standards. Others are Working on Similar Concepts\nTelegram’s main competitors in that field are mature systems that use authorization services provided by third-party platforms via Google, Facebook, or Windows Live, said Dmitry Ufaev, head of the Russian operations of Bitfury, a leading manufacturer of software and hardware blockchain solutions. In his words, Telegram Passport will allow the messenger to circumvent these established services, providing greater privacy and data security to its users. This will be a reputational advantage, Ufaev noted.\nOther major companies are working in the same direction as well, and Telegram is likely to face hefty competition. The Chinese messenger Wechat has already implemented money transfers for users and service providers on its platform. The company is currently testing a digital identity verification system with face detection functionality which should be more efficient than verification based on copies of documents. The tech giant Apple is also working on its Face ID system.\nAccording to Alexei Prokofiev, partner at two venture capital funds, states will eventually switch to identity verification based on biometrics. “It’s a matter of digital sovereignty,” he believes. In his opinion, if Telegram does not establish relations with government authorities, it may fail to acquire licenses for providing services in jurisdictions where biometric verification is required by law.\nNews that Telegram is working on its blockchain platform TON came out in January. The company founded by entrepreneur Pavel Durov was able to attract investments worth a total of $1.7 billion dollars to finance the project. Goods, services and other content on TON will be paid with Gram, Telegram’s own crypto. Recently, the messenger called off a planned public initial coin offering.\nDurov’s company has been involved in a bitter conflict with authorities in Moscow following its refusal to hand over its encryptions keys to FSB, the Federal Security Service. Despite some interruptions, attempts by Russian regulators to block the service in the country have been unsuccessful so far. Russia’s telecom regulator Roskomnadzor has been trying to restrict access to the messenger since April 16 after a decision by a district court in Moscow from April 13.\nWhat do you think of Telegram’s plan to introduce identity verification for users of services offered on its blockchain platform?

Bessant also said Bank of America customers are free to invest in cryptocurrencies so long as they're not using Bank of America credit cards to do so.\nFundstrat analyst Sam Doctor released a new report in which he predicted the price of bitcoin could hit $64,000 before the end of 2019.

His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.In the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: how much digital cash does it really hold?Two Xapo clients said it houses roughly $10 billion of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoin’s price, after all, is hardly steady.‘Patient Zero’Even in the colorful world of crypto the cache is remarkable -- amounting to about 7 per cent of the global Bitcoin supply. It would mean Xapo, just 4 years old, has more “deposits” than 98 per cent of the roughly 5,670 banks in the US But as a custodian it’s regulated differently. The Swiss subsidiary is overseen by the self-regulating Financial Services Standards Association, which audits members to ensure they comply with anti-money-laundering rules. Xapo serves US customers through a Delaware corporation that’s registered with the US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and is licensed in several states.The outsize holdings underscore the faith that Casares -- a serial entrepreneur nicknamed “Patient Zero” for stirring Silicon Valley’s interest in Bitcoin -- has garnered among his acolytes and at major crypto investment firms, such as Grayscale and CoinShares.“Everyone who isn’t keeping keys themselves is keeping them with Xapo,” said Ryan Radloff of CoinShares, which has more than $500 million of Bitcoin stored at Xapo. “You couldn’t pay me to keep it with a bank.”Xapo’s billionaire backers include LinkedIn Corp. co-founder Reid Hoffman and former Wall Street trader Mike Novogratz, who’s in the process of setting up his own cryptocurrency merchant bank. Their bet is that Bitcoin is here to stay, and so is its biggest scourge, theft.The first rule of owning Bitcoin is to securely keep your private key -- the code that lets you spend your coins. If thieves get it, they can loot your holdings in an instant, with no hope of recovery. Putting keys on a device connected to the Internet is both convenient and perilous: Hackers have proven adept at obtaining them from afar.The most popular alternative is called cold storage, keeping the key in an offline device such as a thumb drive. But risks remain: Hackers have also proven adept at setting traps on computers to access cold-storage devices the moment they’re online. More traditional criminals have committed home invasions and kidnappings. Some Bitcoin tycoons have resorted to hiding their identities, fortifying their homes and studying self-defense.Trading DeskXapo’s solution is to bury a cold-storage device in a mountainside and layer on electronic safeguards.“They’re the first folks who recognized custodial and security functions would be key,” said Hoffman, whose venture capital firm Greylock Partners led a $20 million investment in Xapo in 2014, a couple of years after Casares persuaded him to buy his first Bitcoin. “He made the pitch in the morning and in the afternoon I called him with an offer.” 64107419 At Xapo, retrieving Bitcoin from the vault takes about two days. The company verifies a client’s identity and authenticates the request before manually signing the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations. Approval from three separate vaults is required for any transactions to be authorized. The company also offers customers a trading desk to buy and sell Bitcoin and created the first Bitcoin debit card to spend it.Casares, 44, declined to comment for this story. After a flurry of publicity at Xapo’s launch, he has drawn big audiences at crypto conferences but largely shunned media interviews.Yet his persuasiveness is legendary. His evangelizing of Bitcoin is so pervasive in Silicon Valley that when Hoffman asked his family office to buy some, his banker asked when he’d spoken to Casares. Xapo’s advisers now include former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, ex-Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Officer John Reed and Visa International founder Dee Hock.Such salesmanship has been critical to Xapo’s success. First Block Capital, Canada’s first fully registered crypto firm, picked Xapo as its custodian after months of due diligence, including touring the Swiss vault.“Every part of their DNA is geared to security,” said Sean Clark, First Block’s founder, who noted the vault’s fingerprint scanners were equipped with a pulse reader to prevent amputated hands from being used. “Whenever we make big transfers they FaceTime us, we have duress words, if it’s big enough they’ll fly out to see us.”Xapo is doubling down on its pursuit of institutional clients, with President Ted Rogers enlisting Peter Najarian, a veteran of emerging-market trading at UBS Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, to oversee outreach to investors including pension funds, private banks, assets managers, family offices and hedge funds.‘Tidal Wave’The perceived lack of an institutional-grade custodial solution for Bitcoin has been one of the sticking points for many money managers looking to try the asset class. Xapo says its already offering precisely that solution. If it persuades them of its merits, the implications for Bitcoin would be profound.“A fraction of that kind of institutional money flowing into the space would be a tidal wave,” Najarian said.Casares has made acceptance of Bitcoin his life’s mission. Born to sheep ranchers in Argentina’s remote Patagonia region, he experienced the impact of inflation throughout his youth.That drove him to build a series of fintech startups that made him millions before he encountered Bitcoin. He sold 75 per cent of Patagon, a Latin American financial-services website, for $529 million in 2000 and digital wallet startup Lemon for $43 million 13 years later to focus on crypto. By then, he was already a big holder of Bitcoin.“I am personally allocating a per centage of my net worth to this that is borderline irresponsible because I believe in it so much,” Casares told Lemon board member Eric O’Brien, according to “Digital Gold,” a book by Nathaniel Popper. Two years ago, he joined the board of PayPal Holdings Inc.‘High Hurdle’Bitcoin’s meteoric rise in recent years has spurred the proliferation of rival currencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple that also have multibillion-dollar valuations. Yet Xapo only safeguards Bitcoin because of Casares’s belief that it alone will succeed. Such dogmatism has seen Xapo turn away customers looking to store rival currencies.Other purists say ventures such as Xapo have no place in the Bitcoin ecosystem, slowing down what’s supposed to be a seamless transfer.Xapo’s top brass wrestle with that paradox, too.“It’s a subject we discuss a lot, and we believe Bitcoin won’t reach the mainstream if people have to hold their own private keys,” Rogers said. “It’s a pretty high hurdle technically to be your own bank with lots of security.” 64074562 64106009 64106217\nFrom our friends over at the : The Economic Times\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom metcalfbehind", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wences casares", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T19:09:23.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ecc7e34a464654179f0a7605ba64fb90def8006d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mRlktelIWA5BP_k_YHtoeI1OYDBEu4KRwJ1u8bHZskouC_wYnLcnuhgxWYzGSmtnK8qz.BUG86BizVCbGlEfmrtShQ40GVZwIFp7bePDIvk5ZZODpTnxTfh8MBi3S8Ex_M-", "site_full": "1bitcoindaily.com", "site": "1bitcoindaily.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ziliqa Record Big Gains in Crypto Market Rebound – 1 Bitcoin daily", "title_full": "Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ziliqa Record Big Gains in Crypto Market Rebound – 1 Bitcoin daily", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.007, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ecc7e34a464654179f0a7605ba64fb90def8006d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mRlktelIWA5BP_k_YHtoeI1OYDBEu4KRwJ1u8bHZskouC_wYnLcnuhgxWYzGSmtnK8qz.BUG86BizVCbGlEfmrtShQ40GVZwIFp7bePDIvk5ZZODpTnxTfh8MBi3S8Ex_M-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "View All Posts", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ziliqa Record Big Gains in Crypto Market Rebound – 1 Bitcoin daily", "text": "1 Bitcoin daily Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ziliqa Record Big Gains in Crypto Market Rebound Since <b>bitcoin's</b> failed test of the $10,000 support level and the scheduled SEC hearing on Ethereum on May 7 did not occur, both <b>bitcoin</b> and Ethereum have struggled to record gains against the US dollar.

Determining that “value” is not as straightforward as it seems. Thomas Lee of Fundstrat proposes a radical yet intriguing new idea. By determining the breakeven point for Bitcoin, a new metric can be established.\nIt is evident Fundstrat has been paying a lot of attention to cryptocurrency. Their focus on this industry has increased significantly since early 2018. It was a matter of time until the firm came up with its own “creation” related to this industry. Rather than creating their own coin, the firm is more interested in technical metrics. Known as price/ Miner’s Breakeven Cost and offers some unique insights. The new Metric by Fundstrat\nMost people are aware of how Bitcoin mining is intensive and expensive. Miners need a specific bitcoin price to break even, let alone make a profit. That exact value has been speculated upon far and wide. The end result is confusing, as the numbers are rather conflicting. For Fundstrat, the P/BE metric can provide an important support level.

Or that is what people would think. Tom Lee explains the firm expects the Bitcoin price will hit $39,000 by late 2019. This is not a wet-finger-prediction, as it uses the new metric to come to this conclusion.\nWhether or not this metric by Fundstrat will hold true, is a different matter altogether. The Bitcoin price is subject to massive speculation and manipulation. The bullish Fundstrat outlook is promising, but the reality often looks very different.

In fact, there has been a lot of confusion about what Digibyte actually is with most people thinking it’s a new token. Well, Digibyte has actually been in the crypto game for over 4 years and unlike most cryptocurrencies that are forked from popular Blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, Digibyte boasts of its own proprietary Blockchain. There is more, as old as Digibyte is in the crypto space not once has the Digibyte team raised money through an ICO.\nBasically, Digibyte is a decentralized Blockchain that is rapidly growing its Digibyte assets (digital assets on the Digibyte Blockchain that cannot be hacked destroyed or counterfeited thanks to cryptography). The Digibyte can be used for more than just finance. It’s designed to be a digital asset that can securely protect information, digital property or any other important digital data. Digibyte now ready for cross Blockchain dApps\nYes, that’s right. The announcement first appeared in a tweet by Blocknet . Blocknet is built to be the “ internet of Blockchains .” The Blocknet protocol has a peer to peer protocol that enables cross chain interactions between nodes of different Blockchain networks. This means that data between different Blockchains can be exchanged with ease. For decentralized application and exchanges, this feature is quite powerful such that it can allow users to trade all their cryptocurrencies and tokens on a single decentralized exchange.\nBy allowing for this level of interoperability, Blocknet is enabling growth in the crypto community and also allowing for the development of decentralized applications and exchanges that are free from centralized control. This has been a major issue in the Blockchain space especially between the Bitcoin Cash community and the Bitcoin core (the original Bitcoin community). The lack of interoperability has centralized governance in the Blockchain space making it hard to come up with progressive developments. DGB sticking to the original principle of decentralization\nAlthough the original principle of Bitcoin and Blockchain technology was built on democratizing control, the opposite has become true in the last few years. For a Blockchain to process transactions on its network, nodes (miners) have to confirm and verify transactions while adding them to the block. Over time, however, Bitcoin’s Blockchain network has had millions of miners such that the competition to earn new Bitcoins by mining has skyrocketed.\nThis has attracted the attention of top-tier hardware manufactures and as a result, their more powerful technology has given them an edge over everyone else in the network. This is the problem that Blocknet and Digibyte are trying to solve. By adopting a protocol that promotes centralization and interoperability, governance over the network cannot be controlled only by those with powerful equipment as the cryptocurrency (in this case DGB) becomes acceptable on other Blockchain networks. Going forward DGB can be used on multiple Blockchains and on multiple decentralized applications, therefore, giving control over the digital asset to those that own and hold the DGB.\nAlthough Bitcoin is still at the top as the most valued cryptocurrency, coins such as DGB are making huge technological advancements by solving the problems that are currently top of mind of most crypto enthusiasts. After all, the possibilities for a cross Blockchain cryptocurrency are endless and Digibyte in conjunction with Blocknet are at the forefront of this new revolution.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

Applying the Fibonacci extension tool shows the next potential resistance levels.\nThe 38.2% extension is at $9462.7 then the 50% extension is near $9600 and the mid-channel area of interest. The 76.4% extension is at the swing high or $9927 then the full extension is just past the channel resistance at $10,174.1.\nThe 100 SMA is crossing below the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the downside. In other words, the selloff could still resume from here. These moving averages also seem to be holding as dynamic inflection points.\nStochastic is turning down from the overbought zone to signal a return in selling pressure. This could lead to a test of the swing low and a break lower could trigger a downtrend. RSI has some room to climb so there might be some bullish momentum left, but the oscillator is also approaching overbought levels and could draw sellers back in.\nBitcoin is struggling to keep its head above the $9000 area of interest but it looks like bulls are keen on defending this level. Stronger bullish pressure could be needed to take it past the next major barrier at $10,000 and sustain the longer-term climb, though.\nSo far, updates have been mostly positive, safe for remarks from Bill Gates and Warren Buffet on bitcoin’s value. It has been reported that ICE, NYSE’s parent company, is about to create a bitcoin exchange that could draw more liquidity and trading activity. This also represents another step in big financial firms recognizing the legitimacy of bitcoin.\nIn China, the country’s second-largest bitcoin mining company Canaan plans to seek an IPO on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. If this pushes through, it would be the first blockchain-related company to be listed on the city’s markets.\nThanks for reading! Let us know what you think.

Litecoin on the Move\nLitecoin slipped 1.35% on Wednesday, making it 4-consecutive days in the red, ending the day at $156.83.\nA morning slide, in line with the broader market, saw Litecoin fall through the day’s first major support level at $154.61 and 38.2% FIB Retracement Level at $155.5 to an intraday low $151.05 to call on support at the day’s second major support level at $150.27. A midday recovery led Litecoin to a day high $160.33 to break clear of the 38.2% FIB Retracement Level and avoid a bullish trend reversal, before easing to sub-$160 levels by the close.\nWith key resistance levels untested through the day, holding above the 38.2% FIB Retracement Level was key on Thursday.\nAt the time of writing, Litecoin was up 2.3% to a morning high $160.43, Litecoin breaking out from the 38.2% FIB Retracement Level of $155.5 to take a run at the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $165.8 and reaffirm the bullish trend, formed on 6 th April that has come under pressure in recent days.\nA move through the day’s first major resistance level at $161.09 would support a run at the day’s second major resistance level at $165.35 and the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $165.8, though we will expect a hold at $160 levels by the day’s end a satisfactory end to the day for the bulls.\nFailure to move through the day’s first major resistance level at $161.09 could see Litecoin under pressure later in the day, with any slide back through to the 38.2% FIB Retracement Level likely to lead to heavier losses and a reversal of the bullish trend formed at 6 th April’s swing lo $112.1.\nBuy & Sell Cryptocurrency Instantly Ripple back in the $0.80s\nRipple’s XRP slipped 0.84% on Wednesday, following Tuesday’s 2.59% slide, to end the day at $0.79876, making it 4 consecutive days in the red.\nA morning slide saw Ripple’s XRP fall through the day’s first major support level at $0.7780 and 38.2% FIB Retracement Level of $0.7731 with relative ease to an intraday low $0.75776, calling on support at around the day’s second major support level at $0.7518 before a mid-morning recovery.\nRipple’s XRP recovered to a morning high $0.8065, breaking out from the 38.2% FIB Retracement Level to hit an intraday high $0.8186 before easing back to sub-$0.80 levels by the day’s end.\nWhile Ripple’s XRP failed to test the day’s key resistance levels, breaking out from the 38.2% FIB Retracement Level was key in supporting the extended bullish trend formed at 6 th April’s swing lo $0.45716.\nAt the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was up 0.94% to $0.80146, which sits just shy of a morning high $0.80616 and well short of the day’s first major resistance level at $0.8256 and the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $0.8477.\nIt’s been a relatively choppy start to the day, in spite of the early gains, with Ripple’s XRP having called on support at the psychological $0.80 level with a morning low $0.78974.\nSteering clear of the day’s first major support level at $0.7648 and holding above the 38.2% FIB Retracement Level of $0.7731 supporting the upswing this morning.\nFor the day ahead, a run at the day’s first major resistance level at $0.8256 would support a move through the 23.6% FIB Retracement Level of $0.8477, though for Ripple’s XRP to continue on its extended bullish trend, a break out from $0.8477 will be needed later in the day.\nFailure to move through to $0.82 levels could see Ripple’s XRP pullback through the 38.2% FIB Retracement level to test the day’s first major support level at $0.7648, any material deterioration in market sentiment likely to see 62% FIB Retracement Level support come into play, while also seeing a reversal to the bullish trend formed at 6 th April’s swing lo $0.45716.\nWhile it’s been a positive start, Ripple’s XRP is going to need to make a move or face the prospects of yet another day in the red.

By MarketSlant Editor 0\nThe situation in the market has become one where Bitcoin is trading on relatively low volume without major moves. But the currency is in a very important place. Actually, Bitcoin is simmering slowly. Will it boil? Will this increase the profits on our hypothetical positions?\nThe Bitcoin market has its undeniable quirks. From the wild volatility of the currency, to a community of developers supporting it, to the fact that Bitcoin can be put in vaults. Putting Bitcoin in “cold vaults” usually means transferring the currency to a storage device without any access to the Internet or any outside networks. But sometimes Bitcoin is put in actual vaults. In an article on Bloomberg, we read :\nBehind the guards, the blast doors and down corridors of reinforced concrete, sit the encrypted computer servers -- connected to nothing -- that hold keys to a vast digital fortune.\nArgentine entrepreneur Wences Casares has spent the past several years persuading Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires that Bitcoin is the global currency of the future, that they need to buy some, and that he’s the man to safeguard it. His startup, Xapo, has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker.\nIn the rarefied world of wealth management, Xapo is known for a client list studded with family offices, and for occasionally letting a journalist peek into a stronghold to write about its security. But one secret has proven elusive: how much digital cash does it really hold?\nTwo Xapo clients said it houses roughly $10 billion of Bitcoin. Another person close to the venture called the figure an accurate approximation. Bitcoin’s price, after all, is hardly steady.\nIf this seems crazy, then maybe it is. A bit. On the other hand, if you have a sizable position in Bitcoin, then cold storage and, more specifically, an actual vault might be the way to go. This is mostly important for the insurance part of your portfolio . Even if don’t have access to services like Xapo, it might be a good idea to hold part of your coins in cold storage. A simplest idea would be an external USB stick or hard drive without connection to the Internet. The problem with this, of course, is that you have to keep track of where the drive is, unless you can put it in a safe location (e.g. an actual safe) and you have all the same problems you would normally have keeping large amounts of cash at home (risk of robbery, etc.) This is why other kinds of storage services might enjoy some interest in the future.\nEven if it’s not apparent at first sight, this has implications for Bitcoin traders and investors beyond the insurance part of one’s portfolio. For instance, the fact that 7% of the global Bitcoin supply is held at Xapo, and possibly more in other cold storage services, makes Bitcoin a bit more similar to gold, which has a similar curious characteristic that it’s mostly dug up from the ground only to be stored in vaults. Another implication which can be drawn from this is that it is the investment or speculative trading that determines the price of Bitcoin. In other words, for the time being, the fact that Bitcoin is used as a channel of payments or the fact that the supply of Bitcoin is fixed might not have a direct impact on the price of Bitcoin but rather an indirect impact of honing speculative moods.\nBitcoin Tests Retracement and Fails\nOn BitStamp, we’re seeing the rally from around $7,000 to $9,000. It seems that the move lost momentum around $9,500 and the currency moved to $10,000 on relatively small volume. This is a bearish sign, albeit not a particularly strong one.\nBut we have a stronger one in the form of the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. This level is not a deal breaker, but it currently is the closest level which might have implications for the short-term. First of all, a move above this retracement could result in a short-term rally. This is not what we’re seeing now, though.\nWhat we have seen so far is a move above the 38.2% retracement on April 24, 2018, denied one day later, a repeat of the move up on May 3, 2018, and a repeat of the invalidation on May 7, 2018. If you count the move on April 29, 2018, then we have three tests of the 38.2% retracement, all of which failed. The fact that Bitcoin is testing this level relatively frequently suggests that it might be an important one and the failed moves up hint at a possible decline in the weeks to come.\nOne More Factor Comes into Play\nOn the Bitfinex chart, we see that the recent rally brought Bitcoin around $10,000 but the currency stopped at that level. $10,000 is a psychologically important level, a resistance level at this time. The fact that $10,000 stopped the recent move is a bearish indication. But there is more than just $10,000 to the rally.\nGenerally, the rally from $7,000 to $10,000 is seen in proper perspective on the above chart. Bitcoin is above the 78.6% retracement level, which is a slightly bullish indication since this level is not a particularly important one. Perhaps more importantly, the 61.8% retracement level has not been touched and it still acts as a ceiling for the recent move. This is a bearish indication as not much has changed in the last couple of days.\nThere is one more factor that comes into play at the moment. It’s the support line based on the February and March lows. Bitcoin is now quite close to this level. If we see a move below, we might actually get an acceleration of the decline which has been simmering slowly for the last couple of days.\nSumming up, even thought we’re not seeing much volatility, a small move lower might trigger substantial declines, making the profits on our hypothetical grow even further.\nIf you have enjoyed the above analysis and would like to receive free follow-ups, we encourage you to sign up for our daily newsletter – it’s free and if you don’t like it, you can unsubscribe with just 2 clicks.

Why would I use Bitcoin ?\nThis question really encompasses three ideas, with the first being what makes Bitcoin better than any other currency? Then secondly, what can I do with Bitcoin? and thirdly, what value will it give me? Let’s take each one in turn.\nWhat makes Bitcoin better than any other currency? One of the key ideas behind Bitcoin is that it is decentralised. The networked nature of the blockchain – where every transaction is recorded – means that a central bank or a government cannot manipulate the currency. If you are in a country with an unstable currency and rampant inflation, for example, then this would be a significant advantage over the existing currency.\nA traditional, or ‘ fiat ’, currency is also prone to inflation. As more money is printed the value of existing money falls. In contrast, the number of Bitcoins is capped at 21 million, which means its value will increase rather than fall. This is one of the things making it an attractive investment for some.\nBitcoin was originally very popular for transferring money between countries because of its low transaction fees. Money transfer services have had to cut prices to compete, so this advantage has decreased recently. But Bitcoin remains attractive for any transaction, such as a credit card payment that comes with large fees.\nFinally, Bitcoin transactions are near-instantaneous and, thanks to the blockchain, virtually impossible to alter. This adds a layer of security and convenience that is missing from, for example, credit card transactions.\nWhat can I do with Bitcoin? Like any technology, Bitcoin has advantages and disadvantages. If you visit your local supermarket it’s unlikely that you will be able to pay with Bitcoin; it’s not ready yet to be used as cash.\nHowever, it can be used as payment in many places online. Microsoft accepts Bitcoin in its app stores, for example, while online retailer Overstock has accepted it since 2014.\nAs mentioned above, it can be used as an efficient means of transferring money across borders. Given that its value continues to increase, Bitcoin is increasingly being treated as an investment asset, though the volatility and lack of consumer protection can make this risky.\nWhat value will it give me? At its most basic, the value you get from Bitcoin could be its increasing price. The cost of a single Bitcoin at the beginning of 2017 was $1,000 and by the end of the year it was $14,000.\nAt the moment, there isn’t anything that you can do with Bitcoin that you can’t do with a traditional currency, so the value to you will depend on whether it makes certain tasks, such as transferring money, more efficient.

Last week, CFTC chairman J. Christoper Giancarlo stated he does not believe Bitcoin to be an “ideal” payment system . The chair has this mentality despite also saying Bitcoin has similarities to gold.\nThis week, the Bank of America CTO joined the conversation. Bitcoin as a Payment System\nOn Thursday, Catherine Bessant, Bank of America CTO, stated that Bitcoin as a payment system is very “troubling.” Not just Bitcoin, however, Bessant referred to the use of other cryptocurrencies as payment systems as well. Many recognize that the crypto sector comes with risk, with cryptocurrencies acting in illegal activity, such as money-laundering. The payment systems industry also has its trouble, with criminals using it for illegal purposes. Now, Catherine Bessant has said that virtual currencies are getting in the way of law enforcement closing in on the criminals using payment systems this way. UK Central Bank to Tackle Issues Like Crypto Money Laundering\nIn an interview with CNBC, Bessant said that Bitcoin as a payment system is “troubling” for one reason, in particular. According to Bessant, cryptocurrency is designed to not be transparent – and this is a problem. Why? Because this makes it more difficult to monitor business transactions in the cyber world. The chief technical officer went on to say that the way you catch financial criminals is by “being transparent in the financial moment of money.” Things get a little tricky, though, when virtual currencies are “the antithesis of that,” said Bessant. What are the Crypto Markets Saying?\nSo, that’s two people in a span of two weeks that have said Bitcoin as a payment system is not ideal. But what do the masses have to say about that? Let’s see what we can find out.\nOne crypto analyst seemed to be against Bessant’s statements, tweeting to his followers that blockchain is “more transparent than the current banking system.” Bank of America CTO just said on @CNBC that Bitcoin wasn't \"transparent in the financial moment of money.\"\nSomeone send her the definition of a blockchain so they realize it is much more transparent than the current banking system!\nThe crypto community on Twitter seemed to agree with the above-mentioned analyst, with one user tweeting that Bessant only said this because Bank of America “can’t figure out where their business model fits in this new world of money.” The Takeaway\nWhat do you think about both Bessant and Giancarlo’s comments about Bitcoin as a payment system?

Bitcoin Beats Gold\nIn the battle between Bitcoin and gold, the former certainly comes out the winner in a variety of categories.\nAs noted by Forbes , gold doesn’t function well as currency, is insecure, experiences price volatility not too far removed from digital assets, and cannot easily be digitized. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is steadily moving towards mainstream adoption as a viable currency, is highly secure, and allows for cross-border transfers of value in a matter of hours at most. Furthermore, mining real gold uses a tremendous amount of energy and has an environmental impact vastly more significant than Bitcoin mining .\nHowever, there’s one category in which Bitcoin trounces gold that has largely gone overlooked — it’s become the dominant form of flight capital. What Is Flight Capital?\nFlight capital, generally speaking, is money transferred abroad to either avoid taxes and/or inflation or provide for possible emigration — particularly in times of war.\nTo put it simply, if the brown stuff hits the fan and you’ve got to pack up and move, it’s a lot easier to take your Bitcoin with you than it is to lug around a bag of gold. As noted by Clem Chambers, CEO of ADVFN.com and author of Be Rich, The Game in Wall Street and Trading Cryptocurrencies: A Beginner’s Guide :\nWhen Little Rocket Man was wrestling Big Rocket Man, gold didn’t react, but Bitcoin went off the dial every night. You can’t head for the airport with gold bars these days, and opening a foreign bank account is a thankless task that can take months or never get done. A normal person sweating a war isn’t a billionaire with a private office, but in the old days they might have stashed a few thousand or even hundreds of thousands in gold if they thought the balloon was going up.\nToday you’d stash it in Bitcoin and be safe in the knowledge that you could fly away on holiday somewhere safe for a few months and your stash would be as safe as the place your hid you private keys.\nOf course, nobody wants a war — but should one happen, cryptocurrency investors and early adopters will be the ones set to remain most secure in their wealth. Concludes Chambers:\nNow Etherium, Bitcoin, Ripple, Litecoin and a myriad of crypto will get the attention that gold once enjoyed.\nIts bad news for grumpy old men but good news for crypto-believers and a new trading opportunity for us.\nWhat do you think about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as the new form of flight capital? Do you think conflict and war only increase the demand for digital currencies and assets? Let us know in the comments below!\nImages courtesy of Bitcoinist archives and Shutterstock.

According to these Billionaires, Bitcoin has no real use, it has no value and can’t be put to any use.\nBrian Kelly gives an interesting analogy in defense of Bitcoin against Warren Buffett’s comment by pointing out that previously Warren Buffett had earlier said that commodities are useless, so petroleum which runs the car according to him is useless. In the same way, Bitcoin or cryptocurrency which runs the blockchain technology is useless.\nAccording to him, Warren Buffett is missing key points about Bitcoin and that he does not really understand the potential of it. He adds on that Warren Buffett was wrong about Google and Amazon before this and he is wrong about Bitcoin too. He just makes stable investments which do not see a high rise or fall, which are secure and the future of it could be easily predicted whereas Brian Kelly believes in investing in more.\nHe further simplifies Bitcoin and says it is just a software, with hundred thousand lines of code, this code helps replace the middleman in the financial services.\nHe then attacks Bill Gates, who has not been supportive of Bitcoin or cryptocurrency but does believe that the blockchain technology is of great value and can be used. Brian says that unlike Microsoft which provides software and which is centralized, Bitcoin is a decentralized software. Bitcoin gives the users incentive to run this open source. making the internet itself a unique economic model.\nHe draws a parallel between the concept of Intranet and Internet and Cryptocurrency and blockchain.\nThe blockchain and cryptocurrency together are like the internet, free but the blockchain alone is more like the intranet. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies give it the power to be an all-powerful economic model.\nBrian ends with remarks that in his opinion, bashing from the billionaires do not cause the market to drop instead promote people to invest. So he does not think the bashing from the billionaires was responsible for Bitcoin’s drop after reaching close to its $10000 mark.\nHe adds:\nAman Swami is an Economics major from Christ University. He is very passionate about cryptocurrency and understanding of financial markets. Continue Reading Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment Bill Gates says he’d ‘short Bitcoin’ [BTC] : Tyler Winklevoss responds\nPublished Anirudh VK Source: Unsplash\nTyler Winklevoss fired back at Bill Gates after he said that he would ‘short Bitcoin if I could’. Tyler mentioned that there was a way to, specifying to Gates how to do so. He said in a tweet:\n“Dear @BillGates there is an easy way to short bitcoin. You can short #XBT, the @CBOE Bitcoin (USD) Futures contract, and put your money where your mouth is! cc @CNBC @WarrenBuffett”\nHe was talking about the futures contract signed between cryptocurrency exchange platform Gemini and exchange holding and futures trading company Cboe Global markets. This was the first US Bitcoin futures trading venture, allowing transparency, efficient price discovery, deep liquidity and centralized clearing.\nThe partnership with Gemini allowed it to trade Bitcoin assets with liquidity from the exchange. The coin was identified with the ticker symbol ‘XBT’.\nThe official post by Cboe says:\n“XBT futures provides a centralized marketplace for participants to trade based on their view of bitcoin prices, gain exposure to bitcoin prices or hedge their existing bitcoin positions.”\nBill Gates stated that cryptocurrencies are a “kind of a pure ‘greater fool theory’ type of investment” on CNBC’s “Squawk Box”. He stated that as an asset class, they aren’t producing anything so that investors shouldn’t expect it to go up. He also said that Bitcoin and ICOs are some of “the crazier speculative things”. While he did support the underlying technology of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, blockchain, he said:\n“I agree I would short it if there was an easy way to do it.”\n‘Shorting’ refers to the process of selling a stock (coin, in this scenario) taken as a loan from a broker at a high price in hopes that it will go down. The loan will be repaid by repurchasing the stock, optimally at a lower price. The profit is made from the difference between the prices it was sold at, and the price it was bought at after the stock goes down in value.\nUser R0b5ter on Twitter echoed the sentiments of Winklevoss, saying:\n“Gates and Buffet, dinosaurs neglecting the incoming asteroid.” Do centralized exchanges play a role in Bitcoin [BTC]’s failure to live up to its potential?\nPublished Aman Swami Source: Pxhere\nExchanges are the crux of any currency, stock. Exchanges play a major role in a currency’s lifetime, they help recognize the value of a currency and further help transact the currency in the market.\nThe US economy is highly dependent on its stock market exchanges. It is how men belonging to every economic class make money over their primary income. Millions of Americans are dependent on the stock market as their primary wealth-building tool. Without it, the ‘American dream’ would be even more unachievable than it is today.\nExchanges offer people a chance to invest in products, technology, and currencies that they believe in, it is how individuals, companies, and the economy grows financially. It connects the economy and allows people to grow at a higher pace with access to more capital.\nConsidering the importance of exchanges and the amount of money that exchanges host one believes its safety is of at most importance. The security must be well wrapped around an exchange so that the investment, the dream does not collapse.\nThe Cryptocurrency exchanges have not been as successful as the stock market exchanges in maintaining the digital security as required by an exchange considering it has developed in a time of decentralization, a more secure technological era. Before the readers start arguing in defense of Cryptocurrency exchanges, let’s look at some facts.\nThe stock market exchanges in the past have been hacked through the modes of phishing, the stock market exchanges run on a private network and the only available hacking tool is phishing. It allows hackers to access the data of the internal server. In the past, the US SEC has reported that their EDGAR was compromised multiple times.\nIn a statement, Clayton, the chairman of SEC said:\n“The system that was breached, known as EDGAR, is a popular way for investors to access the detailed financial reports companies that sell stock to the public must periodically release. It had a ‘software vulnerability’ that was exploited and resulted in access to nonpublic information.”\nAt the time, Clayton further added:\n“The breach didn’t lead to the release of personally identifiable information but may have provided the basis for illicit gain through trading. An investigation into the matter is ongoing.”\nSuch a type of hack in simple terms allows users to access non-public information prior to it becoming public and also allows them to generate fake information, giving them an advantage over the market.\nThe cybersecurity has been updated multiple times after such attacks and has become more secure but the point to notice here is that the government allows bailout on certain hacks and also that the security breach is fixed in a matter of hours.\nCryptocurrency exchanges have also been under attack multiple times, Bitfinex lost $72 million in 2016, Bitstamp reported that $5 million was stolen from the exchange in 2015, and Mt. Gox was also hacked. The thing common between these exchanges is that all of them operate on the same structure as stock market exchanges. They all utilize an internal server and third-party servers to host exchanges. They are centralized.\nHacking a cryptocurrency exchange is easy for many reasons. Firstly, they do not really hack the entire exchange but access the wallets of users and then utilize the stored fiat currency to purchase cryptocurrency and transfer it out. Next, the complicated process of storing cryptocurrency over a wide range of wallets which seem complicated to an everyday layman investor to differentiate between makes it easier for the hackers to make use of their vulnerability.\nBitcoin evangelists recommend steering clear of centralized exchanges, arguing that the whole point of decentralized currencies was to not hand over control to third parties, such as central banks, commercial banks, and exchanges, which raises the risk of mismanagement, scams or hacking.\nExperts say only money needed for upcoming transactions should be kept in hot wallets. Even then, trading one cryptocurrency for another can be done over decentralized exchanges, such as Shapeshift, Changelly or Waves Dex, directly from the holder’s wallet and not from a wallet controlled by an exchange in their name.\nRisks of fraud or hacking then only occur when a holder wants to exchange crypto assets for fiat currencies, but these can be minimized. Transactions can be done peer-to-peer in a safe, public place amongst members of the local crypto community rated by reputation on websites such as localbitcoins.com or via a centralized exchange, with the risk of hacking limited to the amount of time spent online to perform the transaction.\nRecently an investor, Kevin Pham reported,\n“Mt. Gox Hack, 750,000 BTC lost, No Bailout Bitstamp Hack, 19,000 BTC lost, No Bailout Bitfinex Hack, 120,000 BTC lost, No Bailout”\nSuch losses are of a huge concern because the entire argument of the crypto world is that it provides a safer, decentralized form of currency.\nYet another investor suggested the following precautions,\n“Never lose control of your seeds. Never input them into a close sourced wallet. Never reuse them after inputting them. Always move coins before attempting to split a fork. Never keep all your coins in one wallet.”\nNotably, he lost his Bitcoins while attempting to collect a fork. He tried all his old seeds, nothing happened and he forgot to move his BTC first and input his latest seed.\nBy now if you are new to cryptocurrency, you would have lost your way and be highly confused. That’s exactly why the crypto exchanges are more vulnerable than other traditional exchanges as the jargons and the complicated process causes people to make mistakes, these mistakes leave them wide open to hacks.\nIn January, Fortune reported instances where people were vulnerable and lost money as they did not understand the difference between hot wallet which is connected to the internet and cold wallet which is offline.\nBesides the point that the exchanges must be decentralized as a centralized exchange beats the point of a decentralized currency, it needs to be more easy to use and understand.\nThere lies an ideological difference between a centralized crypto exchange and a traditional exchange market. The government interference turns the light on the little, ordinary guy in traditional exchange markets, enabling a certain amount of security. The governments across the globe are trying to regulate the cryptocurrency exchanges to ensure little guy’s security.\nFor example, Japan’s government recognized bitcoin as a legally accepted means of payment and required exchange operators to register with the financial regulator.\nThe move which came in the wake of the 2014 collapse of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, the then largest bitcoin exchange was designed to protect consumers and clamp down on illegal use of cryptocurrencies. It also formed part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s push to stimulate growth via the fintech sector.\nThe Financial Services Authority’s requirements for would-be exchanges include robust computer systems and segregation of cash and cryptocurrency accounts, checks on traders’ identities and risk management systems.\nIn addition to this, the cryptocurrency community is also putting its best foot forward to make cryptocurrency more accessible and easy to use through its revolutionary wallets and crypto debit cards.\nIn a recent interview with CNBC, Nick Colas , a wall street analyst said that any new technology requires new money to flow in to cross its saturation point in reference to Bitcoin. He asked investors to be cautious as the rate at which new investors are coming in has reduced over the period of time.\nThe above issues and the comments of Nick Colas help us draw a parallel between the two issues. If cryptocurrencies manage to make transactions, exchanges and investments as easy as say, mutual funds, fiat currency exchange, stock market exchange and provide the public with the ultimate security of a decentralized platform that it was set out to give it will see a lot more investment from the various economic classes across the globe.\n[Author’s Opinion]\nGiven the nature of cryptocurrency being in between a security and a mode of payment.\nThe day a common man working 9-5 who does not have much understanding of technology and just wants to utilize his savings can invest without the need of going through jargons and also perform cryptocurrency transactions without worrying about how and where should he store it with the security that a decentralized currency promises, Cryptocurrency will enter the mainstream. This will, in turn, bring in new money that Nick Colas talks about into the cryptocurrency market.

Price has since pulled back to the broken support and completed the retest. The Fibonacci extension tool shows the next downside targets from here.\nBitcoin price seems to be caving to bearish pressure once more as it broke below the channel and completed the retest.\nTechnical Indicators Signals\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to signal that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This means that the selloff is more likely to continue than to reverse. Price has also fallen below the moving averages’ dynamic inflection points to confirm a pickup in selling pressure.\nHowever, RSI looks ready to pull up from oversold conditions to show that sellers are exhausted and ready to let buyers take over. Stochastic is still heading south so bitcoin price might keep following suit, but the oscillator is also dipping in oversold territory.\nSustained selling pressure could take bitcoin price to the next Fib extension level at $8750 or the 78.6% level at $8580. The full extension is located at $8359. A bit of a head and shoulders pattern can also be seen with price already trading below the neckline. BTCUSD 1-hour Chart from TradingView\nMarket Factors\nBitcoin wasn’t off to a strong start for the week as it was dragged down by profit-taking and remarks from Warren Buffet. However, a few positive developments were still reported, such as ICE’s plans to create a bitcoin exchange and another approval for the Winklevoss’ bitcoin plans.\nAnalysts continue to provide bullish forecasts for bitcoin price as well, with Fundstrat estimating that it could reach $64,000 by next year. For now, it looks like risk sentiment is winning out as investors continue to cash in their positions in favor of the dollar. BTCUSD has been unable to benefit from the selloff in the dollar on weak CPI, suggesting that the pair is moving on different dynamics.

This marks another subsequent drop since the currency rose to $9,800 over the weekend.\nAt press time, analysts are relatively mixed regarding where they think bitcoin is heading. North Island Chairman Glenn Hutchins, for example, believes that the top spot in the crypto arena – currently held by bitcoin – may be grabbed by another digital asset in the future.\n“What we should be talking about is something called the bitcoin protocol, which is the technology we’ll use to enable the internet to move value around the world at the speed of light the way we do everything else today,” he commented. “The bitcoin currency they are all talking about is an input on that process, but it is not the end. They are all focused on that because they think about it from a trading perspective, and that’s the object that looks like it trades.”\nHutchins further compared bitcoin to a type of metal, and said that adhering to bitcoin was the equivalent of choosing “copper rather than gold.”\n“I think it is more like copper,” he stated. “Like industrial metals used to drive an outcome. Bitcoin could turn out to be Betamax to another currency’s VHS and, in other words, you could have something like XRP or Ethereum or Litecoin that becomes the token that is used… The token of exchange at the heart of the math solution that leads the technology will be there – different tokens will be used for different applications.”\nDespite the negative hype, many remain bullish about the coin’s future, particularly the research staff at Fundstrat led by analyst and crypto-investor Tom Lee (no stranger to our price articles). Recently, the team released a report discussing newfound growth in the bitcoin mining arena. Processing power is consistently referred to as “hash power,” and the team suggests that this will grow by 350 percent through 2019. In turn, this could hike the price up big time.\n“We believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by the end of 2019, with a $20,000 – $64,000 range,” explains Sam Doctor, head of data science research at Fundstrat.\nAs we’ve mentioned, bitcoin has undergone a series of small, yet noticeable drops in the past week. Doctor believes they may not stop right away, though this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. He says that as the price continues to fall, bitcoin miners are more likely to hang onto their stashes to breakeven for operating costs, then sell as the price gets higher. This will lead to larger profits and jumps in the currency’s price.\n“The primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors,” Doctor added.\nBitcoin mining has attracted a huge following over the last two years, with Chinese ASIC developer Bitmain garnering over $4 billion in revenue in 2017 alone.\n“The release of the next generation of rig hardware should trigger a new round of capex as well as hash power growth, which could accelerate if BTC prices appreciate,” Doctor explained.

From the beginning of 2017 to its end, the combined value of all digital currency market caps soared by nearly $600 billion. On a percentage basis, we're talking about an increase in value of more than 3,300% in a single year. No other asset class has ever come close to these scorching single-year returns, and we may never see anything like it again, at least in our lifetime.\nEven though bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap, \" underperformed \" its peers by gaining 1,364% in 2017, it has vastly outperformed traditional equities since it debuted in 2010. Between March 2010 and mid-December 2017, bitcoin rallied from less than $0.01 to more than $20,000 per token. No stock has even come close to these returns. Image source: Getty Images. How volatile is the world's largest cryptocurrency?\nBut for as good as bitcoin has been for long-term investors, it has also weighed heavily on their nerves and tried their patience. Despite gaining almost 1,400% last year, bitcoin dipped by at least 30% on five separate occasions in 2017.\nWhat's more, between April 1, 2013, and Jan. 1, 2018, bitcoin underwent 20 corrections that saw its price fall by at least 22%. This included 52% and 59% declines in 2014 and 2015, respectively, as well as the 70% shellacking bitcoin took in 2013. Bitcoin wound up losing more than $8,000 per token at one point this year, shedding more than half of its value between Jan. 1, 2018, and April 6, 2018. That works out to four total corrections of greater than 50% in just five years. By comparison, there have only been three corrections surpassing 50% in the broad-based S&P 500 over the last 90 years!\nSo, just how much more volatile is bitcoin than traditional investments? For that answer, we'll turn to the Bitcoin Volatility Index, powered by CoinDesk, as well as data provided by the St. Louis Federal Reserve.\nThe Bitcoin Volatility Index examines the standard deviation of daily returns for a variety of assets, including bitcoin, for the preceding 30- and 60-day windows. In other words, it's a look backwards at historical price activity that allows us to see just how volatile an asset is relative to the U.S. dollar. For example, broad-based stock indexes tend to have a standard deviation of between 0.5% and 1%, while gold has a historical deviation of about 1.2%. In this instance, the lower the percentage, the less volatile an asset is relative to the U.S. dollar. Image source: Getty Images.\nWhat does the Bitcoin Volatility Index say about its namesake? According to the latest 30- and 60-day estimates (as of May 6, 2018) of 4.20% and 4.69%, respectively, it suggests that bitcoin is significantly more volatile than any commodity or traditional equity market. In fact, in April 2013, when bitcoin lost 70% of its value from peak to trough, its standard deviation of daily returns over the trailing-30-day period nearly hit 15%. By comparison, the next-largest deviation for any non-cryptocurrency asset class was gold at 2.83% in August 2011, based on the 30-day estimate -- and even then, gold very quickly came off of these levels.\nIn other words, bitcoin is many, many times more volatile than traditional assets, and it is certainly not for those with weak stomachs. Why is bitcoin so volatile?\nWhile there isn't a single answer that sums up why bitcoin vacillates as much as it does, there are four key factors that contribute to its well-above-average volatility.\nTo begin with, bitcoin has no traditional fundamental metrics that allow investors to come up with an \"appropriate valuation.\" Understandably, an \"appropriate valuation\" is in the eyes of the beholder for all equity types, including stocks. But at least with a publicly traded company, investors can pore through balance sheets, financial statements, investor presentations, and myriad financial metrics that can assist in their determination of whether a stock is worth investing in. This simply can't be done with bitcoin. Investors can examine its daily transaction volume or transaction processing speed, but that doesn't say a whole lot about bitcoin's ability to survive and thrive over the long term. Image source: Getty Images.\nSecond, the decentralization of trading platforms is to blame for bitcoin's volatility. Though decentralization -- the idea of having data stored on computers around the globe, rather than in a central location -- is a core principle of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a whole, having bitcoin trade at a different value on each exchange can cause wild swings in its price.\nNext, place some of the blame on bitcoin's piecemeal legislation around the globe. There are countries that have banned bitcoin completely , and there are those like Japan that regulate bitcoin like any other form of legal tender. The possibility that regulations surrounding bitcoin and bitcoin trading could change in its key trading markets, such as the U.S. and South Korea, has been known to increase volatility in the world's most popular virtual currency.\nLastly, retail investors are a likely source of volatility. Until recently, Wall Street had kept its nose clean of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, leaving nearly all trading to be done by retail investors. The issue is that retail investors are considerably more prone to allow their emotions, rather than logic, to dictate their trading activity. In short, retail investors often overshoot to the upside and downside when bitcoin makes a significant price move.\nIt's possible that bitcoin's volatility could wane in the quarters that lie ahead if institutional investors decide to get involved.

Therefore, it’s fair to ask whether Bitcoin ’s repeated failure to surpass the 200-day moving average is indicative of underlying weakness, or is confirmation bias fueling investors’ dreams of Bitcoin price above $10,000? Market Overview\nThe third time has not been the charm for bitcoin as it bounced off the 200-day MA after an exciting run up to $9,990. While a pullback from the $10,000 resistance was expected, the drop below $9,000 was a bit harsher than expected.\nA quick glance at the top 10 cryptocurrencies shows a handful recovering from 10 to 15% drops and BTC has recovered some ground to sit slightly above the $9,200 support. While the pullback from $9,990 is indicative of bullish exhaustion, general market sentiment remains positive as the cryptocurrency market capitalization steadily creeps towards $500 billion.\nMost investors appear unconcerned within the current correction and the majority of FUD seems to be wafting from a trio of cantankerous fuddy duddies who compare bitcoin trading with cow pats, casinos, rat poison , and ‘ harvested baby brains ’.\nAll FUD aside, encouraging developments that are likely to accelerate BTC momentum are occurring. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) recently announced that it intends to offer BTC swap contracts that will be settled in BTC rather than fiat.\nGoldman Sachs confirmed plans to open a cryptocurrency trading desk within weeks and Mike Novogratz has decided to have another go at opening a crypto trading index. Next week New York will host the world’s largest cryptocurrency conference (Consensus) and Fundstrat research analyst Tom Lee predicts BTC is in for a ‘massive ’ rally due to the excitement surrounding this momentous event. Highlights\nBTC was predominately bullish for most of last week as the cryptocurrency passed through multiple resistance levels only to run out of steam at $9,990. April’s rally brought back memories of the late 2017 cryptocurrency euphoria but hopes have been continuously dashed each time BTC failed to cross the 200-Day MA. The on May 9th Bitcoin price sunk to a weekly low below $9,000 as bears broke the support at $9,200 and continued their work on the $9,000 support.\nAs seen on the daily chart, BTC toppled out of the ascending trend line and set lower lows and lower highs, indicating short term weakness as the bears attempt to take charge. Daily Chart\nSince yesterday BTC has been working to recover lost ground, retaking the $9,200 support but struggling to reach $9,400. Various iterations of the simple moving averages highlight the dissolution of bullish bias and at the time of writing the RSI is turning down from 50 and the MACD is currently below bearish territory.\nThe 5 and 10-day MA have reversed course and appear to be closing the distance between each other but a turnaround won’t begin until BTC trades above the 50 MA. 4HR Chart\nBTC still needs to cross the 50 MA at $9,450 and previously, movement past $9,500 provided a path towards $9,700 and eventually $10,000. Gains above $9,780 would place BTC back into the ascending channel and a close above the 50 SMA ($9,450) would signal that the downtrend has finished.\nIf BTC is unable to recover, there is strong support at $8800 and $8350. It’s possible that BTC could trade in this range before the rally to $10,500 – $11,200 continues. Next Test for Bitcoin Price\nMomentum should improve when $9,500 is passed but the 200-day MA remains a major resistance. The next tests for BTC should be at $10,500, $11,250 and $11,750 levels of resistance.\nIf the downtrend continues and BTC closes below $9,000, a drop to $8,800 and below could take place. Bearing this in mind, aggressive traders should take caution and initiate 50% positions whereas longs could add to their positions.\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in this article are not intended as investment advice.

Cryptocurrency investors have been waiting for institutional money to come into the market.\nMany expected the launch of bitcoin futures on major U.S. exchanges in December would have helped, but bitcoin has lost more than half its value since then. The market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has halved from $800 billion in January to around $400 billion this month, according to CoinMarketCap.\nThree main hurdles — regulatory uncertainty, lack of market infrastructure and institutional-grade data sources — prevent institutions from participating in the cryptocurrency market at scale, the report said. That’s forced much of the institutional trading volume into over-the-counter trades, which range from $150 billion to $30 billion in daily trading volume, the analysts said, noting comparisons to the early ages of the now-$5 trillion spot foreign exchange market.\nBut “the newest technology providers entering this space are led by people from the wholesale financial markets who claim they have spotted a significant market gap waiting to be filled,” the analysts said. “The word on the street is that significant additional institutional money is being amassed and is waiting for the right conditions to enter the market — and expected to start doing so this year.” Read more from cnbc.com…\n cnbc.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tabb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monica summerville", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tabb group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T19:04:47.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "938ca1dd98bb757d8f108f0db866cf0558afc7fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeY4Qa_K8QLvUzkw1qO4gDqGJo3HLStVzyFnqjreQ7gZZ6O90bYpsnn2x5JwQNP_pKOxx_OnVlCYYIyOrHgRZQ", "site_full": "www.gadgetcouncil.com", "site": "gadgetcouncil.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["cell_phones", "tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash - How is Bitcoin Cash Different From Bitcoin? - Gadget.Council", "title_full": "Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash - How is Bitcoin Cash Different From Bitcoin? - Gadget.Council", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.gadgetcouncil.com/cryptocurrency/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/btc_bch-versus.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "938ca1dd98bb757d8f108f0db866cf0558afc7fb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTeY4Qa_K8QLvUzkw1qO4gDqGJo3HLStVzyFnqjreQ7gZZ6O90bYpsnn2x5JwQNP_pKOxx_OnVlCYYIyOrHgRZQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ricardo Martinez", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash - How is Bitcoin Cash Different From Bitcoin? - Gadget.Council", "text": "196.72 GB 196.72 GB The above chart compares both chains to see how they stack up statistically. BTC is on top and BCH is on the bottom. As you can see from the chart, BTC has more than ten times the transactions of BCH, and about ten times the USD amount of value being sent through the network. BTC also has about ten times the hashing power which means it’s 10 times more popular to mine BTC than BCH, and the BTC network is 10 times more secure, against attacks, and bad actors. These statistics were provided by bitinfocharts.com and were current as of the writing of this article. How decentralized is BTC vs. BCH?\nIn order to get an understanding of how decentralized each network is, we need to take a look at node distribution. The more nodes on the network, the more decentralized and secure the network. Miners process the transactions and include them in the blocks, but full nodes operated by users, verify, validate and relay the transactions, that the miners include in the blocks. We can’t have one without the other and both types of nodes are of vital importance to the network, and it’s security. First, we will take a look at BTC nodes\nFrom the map, you can see the concentration of nodes in North America and Europe, with less prolific concentrations in Asia, Australia, South America, and South Africa. The 10,365 nodes are spread out across all inhabited continents and there is even a satellite node that users can connect to if the governments of the world try to shut down the internet or there is a catastrophic power outage. That sounds very decentralized to me, and also pretty censorship resistant. Next, we will take a look at BCH nodes\nFrom these charts, we can see that BCH does not have as many nodes as BTC. It’s currently got 2179 nodes in a variety of implementations, of the protocol. It has about a 20 percent of the nodes as BTC. This means that the network has less security, but it’s proportional. If Bitcoin only had 2179 nodes it would have a similar level of security as BCH does, now. Keep in mind BCH has the same code for the most part so it’s very, very secure. Bitcoin has never been hacked, and that claim stands for both chains. That being said, BTC is orders of magnitude more secure than BCH at the moment. Unfortunately, these charts do not show the geographical distribution of the nodes, but I am willing to accept it’s mostly spread out about the same as BTC, with the vast majority being in North America and Europe, but with a lesser distribution throughout the rest of the inhabited continents. I will throw one caveat out there, but I can’t confirm or deny it myself. I simply put it forth because if true, the implications would be damning. 54% of reachable Bitcoin ABC (bcash) nodes are running on Hangzhou Alibaba virtual servers in China. Compare that to 2% of reachable Bitcoin nodes running on Hangzhou Alibaba servers. pic.twitter.com/hXuYuXkYrp\n— Jameson Lopp (@lopp) December 20, 2017\nBitcoin expert, developer, and evangelist Jameson Lopp claims That 54% of the Bitcoin ABC (a BCH implementation) nodes are being run by one web hosting web hosting service, compared to just two percent of BTC nodes. This suggests a high degree of centralization and that a large concentration of BCH nodes are being hosted by a single party or organization. I am not sophisticated enough to verify this, so take it with a grain of salt, but just keep it in mind when you decide which chain is more decentralized and secure. What does the future hold for BTC?\nBitcoin is not controlled by anyone, which means gaining consensus in the community is a must for any sort of change to take place with the protocol. This is not an easy task. The last issue that the community had to decide on, was the scaling debate which splintered the community into the BTC and BCH factions, each with their respective chains. That being said, now that both sides have their own coin, each community can pursue what the think is best. BTC has seen a hurricane of awesome technical innovation. Many new groundbreaking features are coming to the code, like MAST, Bulletproofs, Taproot, and Graftroot. The Lightning Network is already working in beta on the BTC main net. The future is looking really, really bright. Bitcoin is leading innovation for the entire cryptocurrency sphere. What does BCH have in store for the future?\nIn an effort to not be one-sided, I want to also mention some of the priorities that the BCH community has announced with the release of their 2018 roadmap. For starters, they want to further increase the block size to allow for even more on chain transaction throughput. They want to implement canonical transaction order which would help them add scaling solutions like Gavin Andreson’s Graphene. They want to try to fix the difficulty adjustment algorithm. They want to eventually make the block size adaptive similar to Bitcoin Unlimited. They want to re-enable opcodes that were disabled, that would allow colored tokens and simple smart contracts. They are going to change the address format for BCH wallets to make it less likely to mistakenly send BTC/BCH to the wrong chain’s addresses. The new addresses will be based on BTC’s Bech32 native segwit addresses. They want to implement something called Bobtail which prevents double spends and makes mining more efficient. They have already implemented “Memo” an on chain social media app, that lets users save messages on the chain.\nThe future is not looking all that bad for BCH enthusiast either it seems. The BCH team has definitely been very busy, working on improvements for the chain, and they are definitely taking it in a very different direction than BTC. We’ll see how it all plays out.

As previously reported by CoinDesk, the Dandelion Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) was first published in June of last year, backed by Zcash advisor and University of Illinois assistant professor Andrew Miller, and several other faculty members and students from the school.\nThe proposal initially aimed to introduce a two-phase route for bitcoin transactions: \"stem,\" which is the transaction itself, and \"fluff,\" which is an obfuscation phase that would eventually obscure the original IP address of a bitcoin sender.\nHowever, following the proposal's publication, Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell pointed out that the tech may run into deanonymization over time, which means attackers will still be able to identify the origin by cross-checking transaction patterns.\nYet in the latest update, the team behind the Dandelion project have suggested a \"per-inbound-edge,\" which essentially aims to ensure Dandelion transactions sent from one node will be routed in different paths in the network in order to block the identification of traceable data.\nSubsequently, the team has built a prototype and moved to test the project on its own small network, finding that so far Dandelion is compatible with existing versions of bitcoin, the team said.\n\"Dandelion does not conflict with existing versions of Bitcoin. A Bitcoin node that supports Dandelion appears no differently to Bitcoin nodes running older software versions. Bitcoin nodes that support Dandelion can identify feature support through a probe message,\" the team wrote in an implementation document.\nDandelion image via Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wolfie zhao", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "andrew miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zcash", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of illinois", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-10T21:18:19.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0dd51a5d5b29aeadb821231ae445da48dda7251f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQQGcQG3snF51ekmO5._VGIECxcfYy.vvByEMR_j3nVMdEEsXVDQhvCttDpcCEfPCZhtc8Ac7tgSAOtE2415Ve5VA.oPhDQETfpgyBijg4D1u7EE.8vcY5j", "site_full": "www.bnn.ca", "site": "bnn.ca", "site_section": "https://www.bnn.ca/news-wire", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "News Wire", "title": "Huawei Is About to Give Chinese Users Easier Access to Bitcoin", "title_full": "Huawei Is About to Give Chinese Users Easier Access to Bitcoin - BNN Bloomberg", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/img/tsn/logos/tsn-logo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 38530, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0dd51a5d5b29aeadb821231ae445da48dda7251f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQQGcQG3snF51ekmO5._VGIECxcfYy.vvByEMR_j3nVMdEEsXVDQhvCttDpcCEfPCZhtc8Ac7tgSAOtE2415Ve5VA.oPhDQETfpgyBijg4D1u7EE.8vcY5j", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bloomberg News", "published": "2018-05-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Huawei Is About to Give Chinese Users Easier Access to Bitcoin", "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Users of Huawei Technologies Co.’s mobile phones will be able to download Bitcoin wallets on their devices for the first time starting Friday.\nHuawei, the world’s third-biggest handset maker, is releasing BTC.com’s Bitcoin wallet in its AppGallery, according to Alejandro de la Torre, BTC.com’s vice president of business operations. The BTC.com wallet will be the first cryptocurrency app offered by Shenzhen-based Huawei. It will be pre-installed on all new Huawei and Honor phones and will be rolled out to older devices in the coming months, he said.\nThe move will likely have the most impact in the Chinese market, where Huawei is the biggest mobile phone seller. The nation has been a hotbed for cryptocurrencies. The Chinese government blocks Android’s Google Play Store and some sections of Apple’s iTunes, limiting access to apps like BTC.com’s. While China has shut down cryptocurrency trading platforms and initial coin offerings, people can still own virtual currencies.\n“It’s a good opportunity to tap into the Chinese market,” de la Torre said in a telephone interview. “The use of cashless payments with apps is very big and the traditional banking system is lacking, so there’s a good use case for crypto payments to grow there.”\nBTC.com, which also controls the world’s largest Bitcoin mining pool, is owned by mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain Technologies.

Although Bitcoin is only up marginally over the last 24 hours, it is worth noting that it has bounced 2.5% higher from its low during the period. This could be a sign that buyers are stepping into the market once again.\nThe Ethereum (ETH) price has fallen 0.5% during the period to US$746.96 per coin. Ethereum now has a market capitalisation of US$74.2 billion.\nThe Ripple (XRP) price has continued its slide and is lower by 1.8% since this time yesterday to 80.1 U.S. cents. Ripple’s market capitalisation has fallen to US$31.4 billion. Legal issues appear to be weighing on XRP.\nThe Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price has been the best performing major coin over the last 24 hours with a 2.5% gain to US$1,633.97 per token. This lifts the BCH market capitalisation up to US$28 billion. Bitcoin Cash came under pressure this week after a vulnerability was found its Bitcoin ABC software update.

From the beginning of 2017 to its end, the combined value of all digital currency market caps soared by nearly $600 billion. On a percentage basis, we’re talking about an increase in value of more than 3,300% in a single year. No other asset class has ever come close to these scorching single-year returns, and we may never see anything like it again, at least in our lifetime.\nEven though bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, “underperformed” its peers by gaining 1,364% in 2017, it has vastly outperformed traditional equities since it debuted in 2010. Between March 2010 and mid-December 2017, bitcoin rallied from less than $0.01 to more than $20,000 per token. No stock has even come close to these returns. Image source: Getty Images. How volatile is the world’s largest cryptocurrency?\nBut for as good as bitcoin has been for long-term investors, it has also weighed heavily on their nerves and tried their patience. Despite gaining almost 1,400% last year, bitcoin dipped by at least 30% on five separate occasions in 2017.\nWhat’s more, between April 1, 2013, and Jan. 1, 2018, bitcoin underwent 20 corrections that saw its price fall by at least 22%. This included 52% and 59% declines in 2014 and 2015, respectively, as well as the 70% shellacking bitcoin took in 2013. Bitcoin wound up losing more than $8,000 per token at one point this year, shedding more than half of its value between Jan. 1, 2018, and April 6, 2018. That works out to four total corrections of greater than 50% in just five years. By comparison, there have only been three corrections surpassing 50% in the broad-based S&P 500 over the last 90 years!\nSo, just how much more volatile is bitcoin than traditional investments? For that answer, we’ll turn to the Bitcoin Volatility Index, powered by CoinDesk, as well as data provided by the St. Louis Federal Reserve.\nThe Bitcoin Volatility Index examines the standard deviation of daily returns for a variety of assets, including bitcoin, for the preceding 30- and 60-day windows. In other words, it’s a look backwards at historical price activity that allows us to see just how volatile an asset is relative to the U.S. dollar.

If an owner has a poor memory, the bitcoins can get locked for eternity in an electronic wallet, like a fly in amber.\nSome high-profile people have admitted this year to losing cryptocurrency, among them Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak.\nIn another case last month, a cryptocurrency promoter doing a livestream on his YouTube channel was notified by a viewer that digital currency was flowing out of the host's virtual account. The host later acknowledged he suffered losses of \"over $2 million.\"\nIn the Wild West world of bitcoin and other digital currencies, many new investors may not fully grasp the challenges of keeping their crypto investments safe, whether on their own devices or lodged in accounts at exchanges around the globe.\n\"I suspect many small investors may assume that their money is as safe as it would be in an online bank. But that's not necessarily the case,\" said Graham Cluley, a British security blogger and researcher.\nBitcoins first emerged in 2009, spawning the creation of dozens of other digital currencies that exist only in electronic form. They operate independently of central banks and have fluctuated wildly in value. A single bitcoin traded for around $9,130 Thursday afternoon.\nCryptocurrency exchanges, where buyers and sellers gather to trade digital currencies, are like honeypots for hackers. In the largest known heist to date, hackers in late January made off with around $530 million in cryptocurrency from a Tokyo-based exchange, Coincheck.\n\"South Korea said they thought it could be North Korea (behind the heist) but I haven't seen any other evidence of that, and it has the hallmarks of the typical cyber hack by thieves,\" said Yaya J. Fanusie, a former economic and counterterrorism analyst at the CIA who is now at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a national security think tank in Washington.\nAn Italian-based platform, BitGrail, reported that hackers made off with more than $170 million of a cryptocurrency known as Nano in February.\nThe loss experienced by Wozniak stung, even though he is a multimillionaire.\n\"I had seven bitcoins stolen from me through fraud,\" Wozniak told the Global Business Summit in New Delhi Feb. 26, according to the Economic Times newspaper. \"Somebody bought them from me online through a credit card and they cancelled the credit card payment. It was that easy! And it was from a stolen credit card number so you can never get it back.\"\nBitcoins and many other digital currencies have public keys and private keys. The private key is a secret number that allows someone to access his or her cryptocurrency.\nWhoever has the private key controls what's in an electronic wallet.\nCluley said there were \"lots of reports of folks losing a small fortune (and sometimes a large one) €¦ following the loss of their private keys.\"\nSometimes the method by which bitcoins are lost remains a mystery years later.\nTom Curry, who is a home builder in Massachusetts, still remembers his chagrin the day in 2013 when he lost 996 bitcoin, which at today's prices would be about $9.2 million.\n\"I woke up at 5:30 or 6 in the morning and I got a text message: 'All the bitcoins have been removed from your wallet,' \" Curry said. Someone had gained access to his account and his private key.\nCurry bought the bitcoins for a few bucks each, he said, and still rues what they would be worth today if he hadn't been ripped off.\n\"I would no longer be doing construction. I would be in the Caribbean, that's a definite,\" he said in a telephone interview.\nIf a digital currency owner loses a private key -- say, storing it on a laptop that melts down, or simply forgetting it -- the bitcoins are essentially frozen in an electronic limbo.\n\"Let's say a guy dies and he never gave his wife the private keys, and she doesn't know how to move that crypto,\" Fanusie said. \"She's a millionaire in crypto but with no way to get it.\"\nFanusie said problems around securing and managing private keys for electronic wallets is a major drawback to digital currencies, harder than dealing with ordinary passwords.\n\"For cryptocurrencies to grow in adoption, someone's going to have to figure out a better way for private key management, a way that's more user friendly. Right now, that just doesn't exist,\" Fanusie said.\nOne solution is to store digital currency in a hardware wallet, a physical device a bit larger than a USB flash drive, which is not connected to the internet, kept in what industry experts call cold storage. Only when the hardware wallet is plugged into a computer can the currency be accessed.\nThe crypto promoter who suffered the loss of digital currency on an April 16 livestream is Ian Balina, a former IBM analyst who has drawn tens of thousands of followers on his YouTube and Telegram channels. Balina later tweeted an explanation.\n\"I ended today's live stream b/c I am being hacked,\" Balina wrote. \"I'm not worried about the money. I learned my lesson. I only care about catching the hacker.\"\nBalina said in a May 2 tweet that he'd gone to the FBI and \"we believe to have identified the hacker(s). Funds recovery is a super complex situation. When dealing with folks outside the US, the process can take a while.\"\nBalina did not respond to inquiries about the incident.\n(c)2018 McClatchy Washington Bureau\nVisit the McClatchy Washington Bureau at www.mcclatchydc.com\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://ads.memevideoads.com/sas/player/audio.php?sCampaignID=88888889&noSub=t&subColorTo=000000&subColorFrom=000000&inbanner=t&category=Business&page_url=www.arcamax.com&txt=Business%20News%20Sponsored%20Audio%20Content", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-2079169", "https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-2079169&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T10:34:53.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bbc0b0b4e680831a8c23606c39272f5e265dddf9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9zpNrFFAOBHI5LQPIInmPE9p9OJxFdjO6P1GgeP1M2Lgd9UsTLPPalsgSBIYw0_adO0Je3vcZR4HfjTpMZDJf9jjxsWwX.feDVvFrvu6WWhxD7j5u7bjQCe9VmpOQNg7n2BU4C.fQN.peJ5.TGTPSkrt9fisAByE-", "site_full": "www.elitetrader.com", "site": "elitetrader.com", "site_section": "https://www.elitetrader.com/et/forums/wall-st-news.44/", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Wall St. News | Elite Trader", "title": "Buffett and Gates are becoming frightened of Bitcoin.

This Firm Says It Could Test 64K Next Year Anna Golubova Thursday May 10, 2018 19:42\nKitco News\nShare this article:\n( Kitco News ) - With bitcoin stuck below $10,000 this year after losing half of its value in just a few months, one research firm still sees massive upside potential for the popular digital currency.\nThe estimate for next year is an impressive trading range between $20,000-$64,000 per bitcoin, with the year-end BTC price at $36,000, investment research firm Fundstrat Global Advisors said in a report published on Thursday.\nBitcoin, which was last trading at $9,027 , would have to rise sevenfold to see the higher end of that price range.\nFundstrat bases its analysis on how quickly bitcoin mining activities grow, including something called “hash power,” which refers for the speed at which computers solve mathematical problems to mine bitcoin.\n“We believe the current path of hash power growth supports a BTC price of about $36,000 by 2019 year end, with a $20,000-$64,000 range,” said Fundstrat’s head of data science research Sam Doctor.\nThe permanent investors and traders of bitcoin are the miners, CNBC quoted Doctor as saying. “The primary net sellers, in our view, are bitcoin miners, and the rest are transactions between investors,” the report stated. — Kitco NEWS (@KitcoNewsNOW) November 17, 2017\nThe cost of mining bitcoin — which is largely made up of high electricity bills — will be dropping with time and new technology. Lower mining costs in return will increase the number of miners out there, giving bitcoin solid support, the report pointed out.\nRight now, it costs about $6,003 to mine one bitcoin using an existing bitcoin miner Antminer S7. Fundstrat forecasts for that price to go down to $2,368 thanks to a newer machine known as Antminer S9.\n“The release of the next generation of rig hardware should trigger a new round of capex as well as hash power growth, which could accelerate if BTC price appreciates,” Doctor wrote.

The research found that 60 percent of the 5,000 were located within IT and IT-enabled service businesses, with the rest at software product companies and financial service providers.\nThe figures suggest that there is a huge gap in the market that needs to be filled in order to ensure that India doesn’t fall behind with blockchain development. Notably, though, at a time when different organisations are turning their attention to the technology, they are also struggling to find the right talent to meet their needs.\nThe research also discovered that of the 5,000 skilled blockchain developers, a further 10,000 had basic skills in the technology, while an additional 30,000 software developers required extensive training to be hired as experts in the technology.\nHowever, despite the lack of talent at the moment, Rishabh Kaul, co-founder of Belong, remains optimistic and said:\nThe demand for blockchain experts is only expected to grow.\nYet, while there is still optimism with the technology, another report suggests otherwise that it’s not the way forward.\nEarlier this week, it was reported that 34 percent of chief information officers (CIOs) had no interest in adopting the technology. Of the 3,000 CIOs surveyed worldwide by Gartner, only one percent indicated any type of blockchain adoption within their companies. Notably, 18 percent stated that the skills required for the technology were the most difficult to find.\nDavid Furlonger, vice president and Gartner Fellow, said:\nThe challenge for CIOs is not just finding and retaining qualified engineers, but finding enough to accommodate growth in resources as blockchain developments grow. Qualified engineers may be cautious due to the historically libertarian and maverick nature of the blockchain developer community. Featured image from Shutterstock.

Recently, a new wallet that goes by a similar name — Electrum Pro — popped up with the domain name, electrum.com, clearly attempting to divert users from the official website at electrum.org . The team behind Electrum now claims Electrum Pro is a malware meant to steal bitcoins. To make things worse, Electrum Pro comes above the legitimate Electrum on Google search because of Google Ads, a fact that will clearly trip up many users. The team behind Electrum has given a detailed explanation on Github which anyone can follow to find the rogue lines of code on Electrum Pro which steals recovery seeds and sends them to the attackers. Aecovery seed is a feature in most modern wallets where random words are generated that can be used to recover a wallet if the keys are lost. Once these keys are transmitted, the scammers can use it to retrieve user wallets along with all their funds. This is not the first time a fraudulent Electrum wallet has appeared. Scammers have registered similar domains, hosting an infected version of the software for users to download. However, this is the first time scammers have been able to use the electrum.com domain. The website looks reasonably professional, and it is hard to identify it as a fraud unless you have been to the original site before. They have a slightly different logo and claim to be a fork of the legitimate Electrum wallet. Electrum claims the malware is only available in the Windows and OS X versions of ElectrumPro. The Linux version remains unaffected, probably because the scammers did not want to have it in plain sight. To combat these problems, Electrum recommends users check the GPG signatures before they start using the wallet. In addition to GPG signatures, Electrum is working towards verifying the wallet using Windows native scheme. Also, some point, they intend to have the official app on Mac App Store to avoid similar scams. If you have recently installed Electrum, make sure you installed the official version from electrum.org and not from any other source. If you mistakenly used the malicious wallet, move your bitcoins immediately and remove the application from your computer.

Currently, the BTC/USD pair has again pulled back above the $9,000 levels, which is a positive development. This shows that the buyers are still keen to support prices at lower levels. Now, the bulls might attempt a rally back to $10,000 levels, which is a critical resistance. The digital currency will gain strength only above $10,000. On the downside, a confirmed break below the $9,000 levels will result in a drop to the 50-day SMA. The RSI has formed a negative divergence which is a bearish sign. We suggest maintaining the stops at $8,900 for now, we shall trail it higher in a couple of days. ETH/USD Ethereum has slowly clawed back to our purchase price. It should break out and sustain above the $745 levels to signal strength. A failure to do so will result in another retest of the 20-day EMA, which is currently at $693. A breakout above $745 can carry the ETH/USD pair to $838, which is the May 05 highs. Above this level, a rally close to $900 is possible. Though our target objective is $1,130, we shall take it one level at a time. On the downside, a slide below the May 07 lows of $685.18 will signal weakness. Therefore, we recommend raising the stops higher from $640 to $680. Let’s reduce our risk. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash broke below the support line of the ascending channel and triggered our proposed stop loss on half of the position at $1,500. The stops on the remaining half kept at $1,400 is still intact. Currently, the BCH/USD pair has climbed back into the channel and has broken out of $1,600, which is a positive move. If it sustains above $1,600, a rally back to the May 06 highs of $1,849 should be on the cards. Above this, the rally should extend to the resistance line of the ascending channel at $2,000. On the downside, a breakdown of the 20-day EMA will signal weakness. Therefore, we recommend holding the remaining position with the stops at $1,400. XRP/USD Ripple continues to trade inside the range of $0.76-$0.93777. Currently, prices are bouncing off the lower end of the range. If the support holds, we should see a move back towards the upper end of the range. However, we already have a few open positions, which are close to our buy levels. Hence, we need to wait for a couple of days before recommending a long position in it. A breakdown of the range gives the XRP/USD pair a pattern target of $0.58223 on the downside. Inside the range, trading will continue to be volatile. XLM/USD Stellar is trying to hold the 20-day EMA. If successful, it can rally back towards the $0.47766719 levels, which will form a cup and handle formation. A break below the 20-day EMA can extend the decline to the next support level of $0.334. Though the XLM/USD pair is showing signs of bottoming out, we suggest waiting for the pattern to complete with a breakout above the overhead resistance at $0.48. Such a breakout has a pattern target of about $0.8. If the bulls fail to push prices above the overhead resistance, the cryptocurrency can enter into a range bound action for a few days. LTC/USD Litecoin broke below the support line of the ascending channel and the 20-day EMA today, but the bulls purchased the dip close to $150 levels and pushed prices back into the channel. Now, a rally above $168 levels will indicate strength and a move to the May 06 highs of $184.794 is possible. If the LTC/USD pair fails to scale the overhead resistance, it can decline to the next support level of $141.026. Presently, we don’t find a high probability trade setup, therefore, we are not recommending any fresh long positions. ADA/BTC Cardano broke below the support levels and declined to 0.00003301 levels where buying emerged. Our suggested stop loss is placed at 0.000029 levels, just below the lows of the handle, in the cup and handle formation. If the ADA/BTC pair fails to break out of the 0.00003445 levels quickly, it will continue to slide lower. It has already broken below the trendline and is just about hanging on to the horizontal support. Due to the weakness, we propose raising the stops on half position to 0.000032 and retaining the rest at 0.000029. IOTA/USD IOTA held the support line of the ascending channel and the 20-day EMA on May 07. However, the resulting rally faced a stiff resistance at $2.55 levels. Currently, prices have again declined to the horizontal support at $2.2117. If this level holds, it will signal strength and we can expect a rally to the resistance line of the channel at $2.9. Traders can wait for a rally above $2.5 to sustain before entering long positions. If the IOTA/USD pair breaks down of the channel and the 20-day EMA, it will indicate weakness and the fall can extend to the next major support at $1.63. Right now, there are no reliable buy setups, hence, we have not suggested any specific buy and stop loss levels. EOS/USD EOS has largely been consolidating between $16 and $19.67 levels for the past few days. We like the way it has held above the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the rally from $5.9610 to $23.0290. This shows that the bulls are in no hurry to close their positions and are not waiting for a larger dip to buy. If the EOS/USD pair breaks out of $20 levels, the bulls will attempt to push it to new highs once again. On the other hand, a break below the $16 levels can sink the digital currency to $14.495 levels. We shall wait for the consolidation to end before suggesting any long positions.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.
