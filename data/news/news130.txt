A search for the company on the internet showed its services had been suspended. The website lists Steven Twain as the “primary trader”. A request for comment by Reuters sent to an email address listed on the website as belonging to Twain received no response. - Advertisement -\n“Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by agents of BTC Global,” the police said in a statement. “Some of the investors got paid in terms of the agreement. However, the payments suddenly stopped.” Local technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than $50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global.\n“This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they’ve lost money,” police investigator Yolisa Matakata said.

WHOIS contains the names, addresses and email addresses of those who register domain names for websites.\nMr Jevans adds that WHOIS data is a fundamental resource for investigators and law enforcement officials who work to prevent thefts and is crucial in performing investigations that allow for the recovery of stolen funds, identifying the persons involved and providing vital information for law enforcement to arrest and prosecute criminals.\nHe said: “So what we’re going to see is that not only the European market goes dark for all of us; so all the bad guys will flow to Europe because you can actually access the world from Europe and there’s no way you can get the data anymore.”\nIlia Kolochenko, CEO of web security company High-Tech Bridge told Express.co.uk that unregulated cryptocurrencies have become a “gold rush” for cybercriminals.\nMr Kolochenko described a well-prepared crypto attack as “un-investigable” with the “risk of persecution bordering on zero” for those involved.\nHe said: “While the stolen coins can be easily laundered and used for the niceties of life, we will likely see a continuous growth of attacks against cryptocurrency owners and processors – exchanges – by various means from trivial phishing to sophisticated APT attacks against the largest trading platforms.”\nHe advises that to reduce the risks, one should never entrust his or her wallet to third parties, remain vigilante for any incoming messages, emails or hyperlinks, have an updated AV and a machine with all security patches properly installed. He added “investments into dubious ICO projects should be clearly understood as high-risk”, with the chance of losing money at “above 99 percent.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.express.co.uk/latest/bitcoin", "http://www.express.co.uk/latest/ripple", "http://www.express.co.uk/latest/ethereum"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dave jevans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jevans", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ciphertrace", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T01:38:43.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3e5dfe930134693e8a0f77f13eeeed9202872bf8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSY5VS3UG4A4j2qtMT1UcxUKgt9z5U8PN.egaZ9dmsniFJN1uF4lHdwM5NiuzO1tKCLHz8ADyjbKoISB8Ni6C3wc79T4nh637682g5FBDetIjZ8amTp9Ye_SpR3qKsJxt5TC8tOtgXrHE4jIyH9EozXj_QugXGrL_2T1i4859iMdA--", "site_full": "www.firstorderhistorians.com", "site": "firstorderhistorians.com", "site_section": "https://www.firstorderhistorians.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin price manipulation leads to investigation by the American Ministry of justice", "title_full": "Bitcoin price manipulation leads to investigation by the American Ministry of justice", "published": "2018-05-26T21:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.firstorderhistorians.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/d847eee36ed6989b6fc0be29b1507d38.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3e5dfe930134693e8a0f77f13eeeed9202872bf8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSY5VS3UG4A4j2qtMT1UcxUKgt9z5U8PN.egaZ9dmsniFJN1uF4lHdwM5NiuzO1tKCLHz8ADyjbKoISB8Ni6C3wc79T4nh637682g5FBDetIjZ8amTp9Ye_SpR3qKsJxt5TC8tOtgXrHE4jIyH9EozXj_QugXGrL_2T1i4859iMdA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Top News", "published": "2018-05-26T21:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin price manipulation leads to investigation by the American Ministry of justice", "text": "Bitcoin, Crypto currency, Blockchain Bitcoin price manipulation leads to investigation by the American Ministry of justice\nSince Bitcoin’s price Explosion in the past year, the currency of price manipulation.

The justice Department is investigating possible price manipulation\nThe Ministry of justice of the United States has recently initiated a criminal investigation, to investigate traders who manipulate currencies, the price of Bitcoin and other Crypto. The market, in which there is already a devastating fraud cases will now be examined for the Virus that plagues the traditional stock market price manipulation.\nAccording to a Bloomberg report, this investigation aims to market manipulation tactics that are considered illegal, such as, for example, Spoofing or Flooding of the market with bogus trade orders to change the market mood, and to entice people to purchase or sale of your Tokens. This investigation is carried out in cooperation with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which had previously expressed the intention against fraudulent ICOs to proceed, the integrity of the crypto-currency market.\nThe wild price fluctuations, has shown Bitcoin in the last time, have aroused the suspicion of fraud, as the authorities believe that the speculative nature of crypto-currencies by a lack of regulations such as, for example, in the stock market can be fueled.\nSome of the more severe tactics that have tried the Ministry of justice to eradicate, includes Spoofing, and Wash Trading maneuvers, for which the authorities spent years trying to identify you on the Futures market, and stock market and to stop. Spoofing involves large investors, the stacking of a series of massive buy / sell orders in a certain direction and you can quickly remove, as soon as the price moves in that direction. On the other hand, Wash Trading is the act of trading with itself in the attempt to market activities to “fake” to entice other investors to Immerse themselves in a supposedly active market.\nAccording to John Griffin, a Finance Professor from the University of Texas, is the relative Immaturity of the crypto-currency market, as well as the lack of regulation one of the key factors for the dissemination of market manipulation tactics.\n“There is very little Monitoring of manipulative trading, Spoofing, and Wash Trading,” said Griffin.

The exact date is not yet disclosed, but it is expected that this will happen in June 2018.\nAccording to the BTCC Exchange, before the launch, the platform primarily focused on such key aspects as increased liquidity, faster confirmation of deposits and withdrawal of funds, as well as small spreads between bids for the purchase and sale of crypto currencies.\nAt the initial stage, traders will be able to trade with BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC and USD, but in the future, new pairs will be added regularly. In addition, in the first three months BTCC Exchange sets a zero commission for all pairs.\nFrom a technical point of view, the exchange will use a multi-level and multi-cluster system with an optimized high-speed engine. Traders will also be offered cold storage of crypto currency.\nAlso, users will be given the opportunity to earn points, including through the referral system. These points can be used inside the BTCC ecosystem, including the mining pool and Mobi’s bitcoin-purse.\nThe BTCChina exchange was closed in September 2017 after repressive measures by the Chinese authorities, after a total of 2,305 days. BTCC, nevertheless, continued its activity, focusing primarily on the mining pool, which now owns about 2% of the total bitcoin hash, and the Mobi wallet.\nIn January, BTCC acquired an unnamed investment fund from Hong Kong. The funds received as a result of the transaction were aimed at expanding the international presence of the conglomerate after leaving the Chinese market.

Due to this, a whole lot of ICOs these days are Ethereum-primarily based, and to take part within the sale, you normally should change your ETH for tokens. However tokens don't normally present their homeowners possession over part of the corporate that launched them. Compared to standard digital banking, when utilizing bitcoin one does not know the sender nor the receiver's true id, leading Kathy Bessant to remark that anonymous forex, flies in the face of every assemble known to transparency in the movement of money and the way we use it to prevent and detect different actually necessary forms of crime.\" The key issue, subsequently, is the de-centralised and pseudo-anonymised transmission of currency. A number of ICOs use existing cryptocurrency protocols to create their tokens on prime of them. Promoters might inform purchasers that the capital raised from the sales might be used to fund growth of a digital platform, software, or different initiatives and that the digital tokens or coins may be used to entry the platform, use the software program, or otherwise take part within the venture. Since The DAO had no proprietor, nobody was answerable for the funds that means that throughout the ICO or Creation period, users sent Ether to a smart contract tackle that may, in flip, create DAO tokens and send them to the tackle from which the Ether got here from. Each ICO is just a little bit completely different, but often there's a time limit for the sale, and a set variety of most tokens that will probably be supplied. Some ICOs provide bare-bone coins which do not incorporate any rights. That is as a result of Ethereum is greater than a cryptocurrency, it is a platform for intelligent contracts that makes ICOs easier to do (although, theoretically, you can have a token sale on a various platform; for example, Ethereum itself had a Bitcoin-based mostly token sale in 2014, raising $18 million). Although investing in a cryptocurrency ICO could be quite profitable, it's taking longer for tokens to get listed on first rate exchanges. Throughout the ICO project, lovers and supporters of the firm's initiative purchase a few of the dispersed cryptocoins with fiat or digital currency. As a substitute of inventory, in an ICO an organization gives a lot of cryptocurrency tokens. So investing in the high coins (bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum) is dangerous, however transferring money into new ICO tokens (within the case of KIN known as KIN\" or in the Case of Unikrn referred to as UnikoinGold) with the hope of appreciation after which (if all goes properly) transferring again to ethereum's ether and then to USD is… obviously much more risky. That's due to the fact that Ethereum is greater than a cryptocurrency, it is a platform for intelligent contracts that makes ICOs a lot simpler to do (although, theoretically, you can have a token sale on a varied platform; for instance, Ethereum itself echat for mining had a Bitcoin-primarily based token sale in 2014, raising $18 million). Bitcoin was the primary profitable implementation of a blockchain, and it is optimized almost completely for transferring worth securely over the Internet. Nonetheless, whereas IPOs cope with buyers, ICOs deal with supporters which might be eager to spend money on a brand new venture very similar to a crowdfunding event. If the money raised does not meet the minimal funds needed by the firm, the money is gone back to the backers and the ICO is deemed to be unsuccessful. By analyzing these and different Preliminary Coin Offerings now we have come to a easy conclusion, smaller ICOs usually have extra room to grow (like NXT and Stratis), but all that really issues is the underline expertise, as Ethereum has proven. It's also crucial to understand that despite the fact that the buyers have the complete possession of the purchased tokens, and might commerce them, they do not have an ownership over the project or a product. Whilst digital tokens provided echat for how to mine cryptocurrency 2017 in typical ICOs are often characterised as a virtual commodity\"1, the SFC has observed extra not too long ago that certain ICOs have terms and options that may imply that they're securities\". Since there are little or no rules around the ICOs from governments, they're uncovered to related points as cryptocurrency generally. mining at echat On October 2, B2Broker launches the ICO for the first cryptocurrency change challenge for institutional clients. If you have any issues concerning the place and how to use echat for mining , you can get hold of us at our own web site. Actually, the first token sale was held by MasterCoin (now OmniLayer ) in 2013 whereas the Ethereum protocol is arguably essentially the most widely identified example of a token sale that led to a profitable product that continues to appreciate in worth. Raised $12.5 million in 12 minutes on April 24, resulting in a market worth of almost $300 million despite having generated no revenue and having little more than a white paper describing what it intends to do. Its tokens, which would allow customers to wager on issues corresponding to election outcomes, soared 200 p.c over the summer time. As per the first milestone, 70% of all funds raised are immediatly used on the most profitable ASIC miners to create fast and constructive cashflows for the business to ensure payouts to our token holders after the primary quarter of energetic mining. ICOs are similar to IPOs and crowdfunding Like IPOs, a stake of the startup or firm is sold to boost money for the entity's operations throughout an ICO operation. Depending on the information and circumstances of each particular person ICO, the virtual coins or tokens which are offered or sold could also be securities. Official whitepapers will embrace how the raised funds will be spent and how many will probably be available to the public by way of the crowdsale. ICOs are easy to construction due to innovations mining craft like the ERC20 Token Normal, which abstracts lots of the development process necessary to develop a model-new cryptographic asset. Organizations and individuals that have completed fundraising through ICOs should make relevant arrangement to return funds, in an effort to protect the pursuits of traders and correctly take care of dangers. The ICO raised virtually US$150m, almost 70% of 2016's total capital raised by means of ICOs. And eventually, inventory exchanges and firms listed by IPO are heavily regulated, whilst the echat for mining blasting exchanges on which ICOs are launched are quite the opposite.

Today: What Investment bubbles?\n“Money alone does not make you happy. It shares, Gold and land are included in this.“\nDanny Kaye\nThe comparison with the soap bubble is not by chance: it seems, contains in principle only air, has a short life span and bursts. Investment bubbles are similar. Something is artificially inflated, so that it appears from the outside very much important, and especially valuable, as it actually is. In the hope to get rich quick, pay people to high prices , without it, the actual value would justify.\nEverything shines so beautifully colorful, but what’s behind it? Tulip mania – expensive tulips, greedy investors\nA popular example of speculative Tulip mania is a bubble in the Netherlands of the 17th century. Century. Tulips were a popular piece of jewelry – especially members of the richer houses decorated their pompous gardens with the beautiful Lily plants. First of all, the members of the noble houses exchanged with each other – after all, you want to get a high level of diversity in its gardens.\nThen took the market is the thing – more and more people realized that the tulips and their bulbs, a high value is attributed to . So a wild trade, based on speculation began: people paid money for Tulip bulbs. It moved ultimately, through all layers of the population; behind every Tulip bulb, the promise to get rich hiding all of a sudden. From the Bursting of the bubble\nThe bladder swelled up – while the price rose more, the value is the same, apart from the promise to grow into a piece of jewelry, the cuff much. (You like, you can eat, but the nutritional value is very low). Accordingly, the price declined again quickly. Many speculators had gambled away the house and yard, and now sat there with your worthless Tulip bulbs – the bubble was burst.\nA factor was largely responsible. The difference between the fundamental value and the bubble component. While the former is the material eigenvalue of the tulips, the latter is strongly broken down – the Option to make a profit. But we continue to in the future.\nAll bubble or what? From the Tulip mania to the dot-com BubbleDie Dotcom bubble\nA bubble that is significantly less far back as the Tulip bubble, the dot-com bubble. If it is also a much more recent phenomenon, the mechanism is the same: Many were greedy, invested (in) a lot of money and lost it.\nThe talk is this Time from the numerous Start-ups, which brought the New Economy. While the Internet began in the 1990s, his triumph, sprouts are the new company from the ground up. And all they promised, as it were, a Golden future, without having sufficient technical Back-up, in order to fulfill this promise ever. Gold-rush mood\nAnd yet, people invested plenty of. Everywhere movement was underway in terms of new technology. Most of the Start-ups went directly to the stock market, most investors bought the shares – in part, just as blind and deluded as so many Dutch investors for centuries before. The Investment property share was socially acceptable – whether or Lieschen Müller or Franz next door – everyone could suddenly buy stocks. This led to the stock market, the eighth in the rating of many companies, from mid – 1999 multiplied-the bubble inflated.\nA lot of fuss about Nothing – Little return, despite the gold-rush mood Shut up and take my money!\nThe Dotcom was a fill-in bubble with the hopes and greed of many investors, as well as the Expansion drive of many companies. Who was the IPO’s value, the more invested the funds, while new investors from a double-digit rate in the gate-curly brackets. As a result, established were a lot of day traders, the bubble component were (at least partly) aware of, but, at least, of the daily price increases still benefit. The sentiment was clearly bullish: All ran with the head in the direction of the Investment –“Shut up and take my money” was the currency in many places.\nIn the year 2000, the bubble was filled to bursting – it was nothing. The stock market value of many companies was not covered by material assets – the capital was not in the classical sense of material goods is tangible. Many of the companies filed for insolvency, there have been reports of bogus sales. During the air out of the bubble already escaped, clinging, many investors still hope that it would fill up again – and missed the point of the exit.\nShut up and take my money – Blind investments are rarely advisable The value of the bubbles\nWhat these two examples show us now? A speculative bubble is a market situation in which prices of (speculative)objects that (are far) above their value. At the beginning, many people expect that you can rich with the sale of objects large profits. That’s why you buy one ultimately a lot of it. As a result, the demand is large. If the investors notice that the price is significantly higher than the value of the goods, uses FUD to sell Fast, as long as there is not a total loss. As a result, the supply increases and prices fall – the air escapes from the bladder. The result: those Who sold in time, winner is the one who comes too late, the capital to be punished. Many losers, few winners\nWhether the ups is in tulips or Tech Start -: people think that you can earn money with daredevil investment in a short period of time, a lot of money, with the Goods, their actual value is not you can know and assess. The prices are volatile – they rise and fall in a short period of time in up to two-digit range. If the bubble bursts then lose a lot of their invested capital, while the few left who had the right touch.

A Satoshi is 1/100 millionth of a Bitcoin (0. 1), and is the smallest possible unit for the cryptocurrency.\nIt is remarkable that a Satoshi far exceeds the value of a VEF, and is a good indicator of just how extreme hyper-inflation has gotten in the South American nation. A Satoshi is not a lot of money, only equivalent to 0.000075 USD. One USD is equivalent to a whopping 80,000 VEF, which is quite close to the largest denomination VEF banknote of 100,000.\nThe economic crisis in Venezuela started under the reign of Hugo Chavez due to overspending and price controls, and drastically deepened in 2014 when the price of oil collapsed since most of Venezuela’s income was from oil drilling.\nIn order to balance overspending and debts, the government of Venezuela began printing VEF at will, leading to a rapid rise in inflation starting in 2012. By late 2014 the currency lost over 90% of its value, sending the economy into a tailspin as citizens lost their life savings. This is one of the problems Bitcoin was made to solve, since it is decentralized and can’t be printed at will like governments so often do with their local fiat currencies. This characteristic of Bitcoin conserves its monetary value and makes it safer than most fiat currencies in the world.\nInflation rates have been increasing in Venezuela ever since the crisis started in 2012, now exceeding 7,000% annually and on track to reach 13,000% this year according to the United States Department of Labor Statistics. The end result is people using wheelbarrows full of cash to go grocery shopping.\nThe Venezuelan Bolivar Fuerte is obviously near the point of total collapse and could end up going the way of the Zimbabwean Dollar which was abandoned and became completely worthless in 2015 . In Zimbabwe, citizens sought out other currencies to use for their money, mainly the USD, but Bitcoin has become another popular monetary refuge.\nIndeed, this past year Bitcoin trading volume in Venezuela has skyrocketed on Localbitcoins, which is a peer to peer Bitcoin trading website. Over 3.9 trillion Bolivares Fuertes were traded for Bitcoin last week on the website, and of course, this doesn’t include all the other Bitcoin transactions outside of the website. Clearly, Venezuelans are moving their money into Bitcoin more so than ever before.\nBitcoin is in a good position to become a primary currency for desperate Venezuelans who have been tortured by years of hyperinflation. While Bitcoin can be quite volatile and sometimes drops overnight, Venezuelans will rest a lot easier at night knowing their money is in Bitcoin since it does not drop each and every night with the consistency or magnitude that the VEF does, and in the long-term Bitcoin has been going up.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at @BitcoinNewsCom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews Image Source: Pixabay", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://t.me/bconews", "http://bitcoinist.com/satoshi-bitcoin-worth-5-venezuelan-bolivar/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_in_Venezuela_(2012%E2%80%93present)", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_dollar", "https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom", "https://www.google.com/search?q=0.00000001+btc+to+vef"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hugo chavez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bolivar fuerte", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T21:52:35.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1eca1ad6cf20bfadc0bf935151f8b95044ccf587", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9GpoK49ucKkRXWUnl5lOwQ.lA8pKylV72CHS6cE56cd0a18iGpm6pru9tJoYHy9HGbgAw_dHqnchtoUA_2Z9YG6mh4Nls8jZRTqR9jJwtYxlrA8Q5hoBundaT_Bc3I6_lSvWGudTF87w--", "site_full": "www.bitcoin.name", "site": "bitcoin.name", "site_section": "http://www.bitcoin.name/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News", "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis, 25th May 2018: BTC/USD Met With Resistance Below $7500", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Analysis, 25th May 2018: BTC/USD Met With Resistance Below $7500", "published": "2018-05-26T21:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1eca1ad6cf20bfadc0bf935151f8b95044ccf587", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9GpoK49ucKkRXWUnl5lOwQ.lA8pKylV72CHS6cE56cd0a18iGpm6pru9tJoYHy9HGbgAw_dHqnchtoUA_2Z9YG6mh4Nls8jZRTqR9jJwtYxlrA8Q5hoBundaT_Bc3I6_lSvWGudTF87w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "adminbtc", "published": "2018-05-26T21:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis, 25th May 2018: BTC/USD Met With Resistance Below $7500", "text": "Bitcoin appears to be coming under a bear market with signals indicating dramatic shifts in the sentiment of traders. Prices keep being in a downward spiral now with volumes also coming down. The Day’s Signals Bitcoin prices fell from the day’s peak at USD 7,700 price levels with a drop down to USD 7,300 levels earlier today. While a recovery was realized above USD 7,500 prices, a selloff had traders taking consideration at USD 7,400 levels. Selling pressure now seems to be forming a resistance level below USD 7,500.\nGDAX BTC/USD charts are indicating the shattering of support levels with today’s downward spike. While markets did recover, the downtrend keeps prices from rising. Through more recent hours, a fall further down to USD 7,300 levels keeps seeming more plausible. It’s obvious that consideration after the recovery didn’t manage to last too long. Traders succumbed to a bearish breakout with the downward spiral even continuing after it. It’d be safe to assume that resistance levels might be starting to form below USD 7,500 levels with the markets even being vulnerable to further price falls as volumes remain low.\nOKEX BTC/USD charts showcase that futures traders are continuing to support closely mirroring spot prices. There hasn’t been much space for a difference between the two markets with so much uncertainty around. Traders in markets for bitcoin futures have surely gotten wind of the worsening market sentiment that’s driven by uncertainty. With trading volumes continuing to go down from being already low in previous trading sessions , not much confidence can be placed in markets.\nAll in all, traders seem to be preparing for even worse outcomes in spite of the already worsening conditions experienced in bitcoin markets. Volumes kept going down in spite of already being low in previous trading sessions. It is such signals that lead traders to exercise more caution and ultimately markets end up with even thinner support. With new lows reached through yet another day, indicating that there’s no positive sign showing that the downtrend might be close to an end.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at @BitcoinNewscCom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews\nThe post Bitcoin Price Analysis, 25th May 2018: BTC/USD Met With Resistance Below $7500 appeared first on BitcoinNews.com .

dead 2018 ? Is crypto dying? If you’re asking these questions and are a cryptocurrency investor, this video should help!\nPROOF CRYPTOCURRENCY IS **NOT** DYING | Prices Bottoming Out ? | Altcoins. and Bitcoin.\nFROM THE ARTICLE: Bitcoin, Etehreum, and Ripple, have reached critical technical levels but are holding on nicely. The Directional Movement Index on all three digital coins show sellers are retreating and buyers are gaining ground. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and other big institutional players are readying for entering the crypto markets. The price of Bitcoin (BTC/USD) peaked at ,745 on May 4th. The value of Etehreum (ETH/USD) hit a high of 7.53 on May 6th. And the price of Ripple had already topped out on April 24th at .9649. Since then, these three cryptocurrencies have been losing ground with occasional corrections that proved to be dead cat bounces.\nMany have asked: where is the bottom? There are growing signs that we are getting close to a turnaround in all three.\nDMI and ADX point to a tentative turnaround Our technical expert Tomas Sales examined the recent drops and noted that they are playing a dangerous game with critical technical levels. However, the charts show that in the three cryptos, BTC, ETH, and XRP, the same phenomenon is seen: Directional Movement Index (DMI) is showing a loss of momentum for sellers and an increase in buying. Another technical gauge, the ADX, is pointing to a loss of inclination which is another hint of a potential change in direction.\nHere is a quote regarding Bitcoin and the similar technical patterns are noted on Ethereum and Ripple:\nDirectional Movement Index in the same chart is showing how sellers keep losing strength while buyers are increasing, although slightly, as price keep falling. ADX is losing inclination and supports the possibility of a change of direction in the mid-term.\nWhen something cannot go down, the path of least resistance is up.\nGoldman Sachs, JP Morgan going crypto, Coinbase going establishment Apart from the prices on the charts, fundamental analysis on the crypto world could add some perspective. Goldman Sachs, one of the best-known banks sometimes known as the “Vampire Squid” recently announced plans to launch a cryptocurrency derivatives trading. The big financial institution is only taking a small step: GS will trade Bitcoin futures in a market-making capacity and provide non-deliverable forward products.\nJP Morgan also recently moved deeper into the crypto-sphere. JPM CEO Jamie Dimon is well-known for bashing Bitcoin and other digital currencies. However, the financial behemoth’s central ideology is making money. They recently hired 29-year old Oliver Harris as the head of the crypto asset strategy.\nAnd the movements are not unilateral. Coinbase, which operates one of the most significant exchanges in the US, is considering applying for a banking license. The firm met with regulators, and the news recently became public. This is a move from the crypto world into the heart of the establishment. And perhaps the establishment is about to up its game.\nGoldman and JP are not only market makers or analysts, but they also need to make money for their clients, which, in turn, means more money for themselves. In the past, financial big boys have been waiting on the sidelines in various financial markets, waiting for them to dry up before they wet their feet and jump in.

Monetization Plans Giving the New PoS System Bchpls.io a Test Run\nThis week we decided to test out a new PoS system specifically designed for merchants who want to accept Bitcoin Cash (BCH) at any physical location. The application called Bchpls.io is free, and there are no servers needed as all it takes is an internet connection and two devices (cashier & customer). Merchants can accept the funds into any wallet of their choice and set up the name of their business on the invoice. Funds are sent to a one-time-only address as a new address is used for each sale so incoming revenue is kept private. Setting Up a Store Name and Fiat Currency Pair for Pricing\nWhen entering the website users are greeted with a purple-orange themed page that asks the user to sign up. After hitting the register tab the merchant enters a valid email address and sets a strong password to set up their account. The next screen asks the merchant to add the store name and the fiat currency they wish to use to calculate BCH invoices. Following this step the user has to tether a Bitcoin Cash wallet to the store account and Bchpls uses the Xpub (extended public keys) to generate a receiving address on the cashier side. Tethering a Wallet to Bchpls.io With Extended Public Keys\nUsing the Bitcoin.com Wallet simply create a new wallet with the store’s name and go to the section called “wallet information.” The next screen will reveal the BCH wallet’s Xpub keys, after scrolling down to the bottom. Tap the Xpub section and the Bitcoin.com Wallet will automatically copy and paste the extended public keys. Paste this text into the Bchpls page where it says ‘derivation path,” and hit next.\nAfter that, the merchant is all set, and a page is created which shows information for an access key, cashier screen, and the customer screen. Both screens provide a URL with a QR code created on the invoice page. Unfortunately, there is no address section yet available to copy and paste, as the invoice only supplies a QR code that needs to be scanned.\nAfter the merchant set-up is complete the account holder simply registers a sale on the platform which calculates a new invoice every time. Merchants can also cancel the invoice as well before it is paid just in case there happened to be an error during the process. The Softwares’ Roadmap and Monetization Plans\nThe Bchpls developer explains in the future they plan to monetize by adding custom features or the “ability to operate more than one PoS session at the same time.” Down the line, Bchpls plans to add products management, custom designs, receipts, multiple PoS, and a merchant directory.\nCurrently, the beta program is not open source nor does it offer a client-side (trustless) option but the developer says he will provide these things soon.\n“This is not available on Github at the moment — It is currently a hosted service — The site does not store any private keys or BCH on your behalf,” explains the Bchpls developer. “You provide your Xpub (public key), then any orders made will be made directly to addresses generated from your Xpub.”\nNote that this is not an e-commerce payment gateway solution, it is a POS system for a brick-and-mortar setup. It is also not a solution for people who want automatic settlement into Fiat. It only settles in BCH directly into your wallet — The client-side-only implementation will be open sourced once it is ready.\nBchpls is yet another application that helps promote Bitcoin Cash infrastructure and adoption and most BCH proponents seem to like the platform. Some individuals will likely wait for a more reliable release and others will also wait for a client-side open source version. All in all, Bchpls was extremely easy to set up and any brick-and-mortar business could start using it at their shop.\nWhat do you think about Bchpls.io?

This marks the beginning of their adoption of cryptos as payment for real estate.\nThe offer in question is for a piece of land measuring around 27 acres, or close to 100 sq. km, in the heart of Silicon Valley. The property is located on Shannon Road, on top of the Los Gatos Hills. The offer is exclusive to Propy and is on sale for $16 million.\nInvestors can build up to 10 homes on the property, which overlooks some of the “most pristine lands in Northern California”. The soil of the property is said to be ideal for growing a vineyard, an olive farm or horses. It is close to the headquarters of prominent tech companies such as Netflix, Google, and Apple.\nThe property also boasts proximity to prominent educational institutions such as Stanford University and Harker, America’s top private high school. The official listing says:\n“This is one of the largest pieces of land left that are for sale in Silicon Valley. Its location, view, and community make it a rare opportunity for buyers who want to build their roots in one of the most preferred places to live in the country.”\nOn Propy’s Twitter account, Twitterati praised the company and its move to cryptos. User Kehinde Lawal said:\n“Propy is really doing a great job when it comes to purchasing real estate with cryptocurrency seamlessly and securely.”\nUser hastytoro said:\n“Well done Propy! Adding a enterprise asset for property purchases. You will however have to wait till I give you my #xrp”\nThe company also teased that they might add Litecoin [LTC] to their roster of accepted coins when user Paalsky said:\n“Need to add Litecoin!”\nThey said:\n“Perhaps one day!”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "harker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "propy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "netflix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanford university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "los gatos hills", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shannon road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T03:36:46.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a247ca25714ad6a1438899b29a16052dcb5d300a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdLTAgLP2_inOlCWV5wAQvg-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=8.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Trading Discussion", "title": "How Much Should You Invest in Bitcoin?", "title_full": "How Much Should You Invest in Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-26T20:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.013, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a247ca25714ad6a1438899b29a16052dcb5d300a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmdLTAgLP2_inOlCWV5wAQvg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "TrollinU", "published": "2018-05-26T20:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "How Much Should You Invest in Bitcoin?", "text": "I suppose, that BTC isn`t the best choice to invest, cause you need to wait before its price gets to the moon.

There aren’t a lot of people who understand bitcoins. That means the Venn diagram of people who understand both is likely to have a pretty small slice that contains both. The people in the slice are telling the rest of us it’s time to buy bitcoins because is moving from Aires to Taurus and that’s a good sign for cryptocurrency. The people who don’t know their crypto from their Taurus are saying, “Wait … what?”\n“Uranus is the planet of innovation, invention, change and technology. Whenever it does something big in the sky like change signs, we know something exciting and unexpected is about to happen.”\nIn an article in Market Watch , Annabel Gat, an International Society for Astrological Research-certified astrologer, tells why Uranus moving (if you just giggled, grow up!) is a zodiac change that could be a good sign for technology. But why bitcoins in particular? The answer to that comes from someone who sits right in the middle portion of the astrology/cryptocurrency Venn diagram – Marcus Thomas, an investor who has been making money using astrological signs to guide his investments since 2008.\n“I knew then that astrology may not be an exact science but it has the ability to predict trends by casting a big net focusing on certain themes in present day. Uranus in Taurus — until 2026 [represents]revolutionary innovations in areas of finance, climate, banking, farming and other earth-related things.”\nOkay … but why did Thomas switch to bitcoins in 2017? For that answer, you have to create another Venn diagram of people who understand astrology, people who understand bitcoin, people who won the Heisman Trophy, played in the NFL and played minor league baseball. No, not Tim Tebow. That tiny dot in the Venn diagram is Ricky Williams , the pot-smoking one-time star running back for the Miami Dolphins and other NFL teams.\n“When I look at things, I tend to look at astrology to get insight. The insight that got me interested in bitcoin was the planet Uranus is about to enter into Taurus. [Uranus] is about revolution; it’s about a change in the way we do things; it’s about innovation, [Taurus] is about resources and finances.”\nWilliams added that, at the same time, Pluto is passing through Capricorn, which “is about our structures, like banks for instance.” Put that all together and it explains why Williams invested $50,000 in bitcoins and Marcus Thomas invested $11,000.\nStill skeptical about a connection between investing and astrology? Maybe Merriman Market Analyst can help.\n“Working from the premise that all human activity works in conjunction with certain immutable laws of time and space, The Merriman Market Analyst (MMA) utilizes advanced research techniques to uncover patterns and trends that you can use to understand the present; and, from this method of understanding, gain valuable insight into the future.”\nAstrologer-investor Richard Merriman, president of MMA, notes that the last time Uranus was in Taurus was in 1944, when the Bretton Woods Agreement tied the dollar to the price of gold. And in the late 90s and early 200s, Uranus was in Aquarius at the same time as the dot-com boom. Then Uranus oved to Pisces, matching the oil boom.\nWill Uranus in Taurus trigger a bitcoin boom?\n“In the next few years, there are going to be major changes in currency valuations and leadership, and new forms of currency.”\nIs that a yes or a no? Merriman is astrologically predicting that bitcoins will drop in price between now and March 6, 2019, when Taurus finally moves out of Aries. He’s advising his clients to with until the price drops to 77% of its high of nearly $20,000 in December 2017, 0r around $4,500. One bitcoin is worth $8,100 today.\nWhat will happen on March 6, 2019? Merriman estimates that 20% of investors make decisions based on their horoscopes and over half of young adults believe astrology is a science. Then again, a lot of people like that lost their shirts (literally and figuratively) in the Age of Aquarius .\nThis review is not meant to endorse astrological investing so don’t blame us if you lose your bitcoins out Uranus.

Bchpls is currently in open beta which means the public can test the software at their own discretion, so news.Bitcoin.com decided to test the program’s feature services.\nAlso read: Chinese Exchange Launching Southeast Asian Crypto Trading Hub Giving the New PoS System Bchpls.io a Test Run\nThis week we decided to test out a new PoS system specifically designed for merchants who want to accept Bitcoin Cash (BCH) at any physical location. The application called Bchpls.io is free, and there are no servers needed as all it takes is an internet connection and two devices (cashier & customer). Merchants can accept the funds into any wallet of their choice and set up the name of their business on the invoice. Funds are sent to a one-time-only address as a new address is used for each sale so incoming revenue is kept private. Setting Up a Store Name and Fiat Currency Pair for Pricing\nWhen entering the website users are greeted with a purple-orange themed page that asks the user to sign up. After hitting the register tab the merchant enters a valid email address and sets a strong password to set up their account. The next screen asks the merchant to add the store name and the fiat currency they wish to use to calculate BCH invoices. Following this step the user has to tether a Bitcoin Cash wallet to the store account and Bchpls uses the Xpub (extended public keys) to generate a receiving address on the cashier side. Tethering a Wallet to Bchpls.io With Extended Public Keys\nUsing the Bitcoin.com Wallet simply create a new wallet with the store’s name and go to the section called “wallet information.” The next screen will reveal the BCH wallet’s Xpub keys, after scrolling down to the bottom. Tap the Xpub section and the Bitcoin.com Wallet will automatically copy and paste the extended public keys. Paste this text into the Bchpls page where it says ‘derivation path,” and hit next.\nAfter that, the merchant is all set, and a page is created which shows information for an access key, cashier screen, and the customer screen. Both screens provide a URL with a QR code created on the invoice page. Unfortunately, there is no address section yet available to copy and paste, as the invoice only supplies a QR code that needs to be scanned.\nAfter the merchant set-up is complete the account holder simply registers a sale on the platform which calculates a new invoice every time. Merchants can also cancel the invoice as well before it is paid just in case there happened to be an error during the process. The Softwares’ Roadmap and Monetization Plans\nThe Bchpls developer explains in the future they plan to monetize by adding custom features or the “ability to operate more than one PoS session at the same time.” Down the line, Bchpls plans to add products management, custom designs, receipts, multiple PoS, and a merchant directory.\nCurrently, the beta program is not open source nor does it offer a client-side (trustless) option but the developer says he will provide these things soon.\n“This is not available on Github at the moment — It is currently a hosted service — The site does not store any private keys or BCH on your behalf,” explains the Bchpls developer. “You provide your Xpub (public key), then any orders made will be made directly to addresses generated from your Xpub.”\nNote that this is not an e-commerce payment gateway solution, it is a POS system for a brick-and-mortar setup. It is also not a solution for people who want automatic settlement into Fiat. It only settles in BCH directly into your wallet — The client-side-only implementation will be open sourced once it is ready.\nBchpls is yet another application that helps promote Bitcoin Cash infrastructure and adoption and most BCH proponents seem to like the platform. Some individuals will likely wait for a more reliable release and others will also wait for a client-side open source version. All in all, Bchpls was extremely easy to set up and any brick-and-mortar business could start using it at their shop.\nWhat do you think about Bchpls.io?

Tethering a Wallet to Bchpls.io With Extended Public Keys\nUsing the Bitcoin.com Wallet simply create a new wallet with the store’s name and go to the section called “wallet information.” The next screen will reveal the BCH wallet’s Xpub keys, after scrolling down to the bottom. Tap the Xpub section and the Bitcoin.com Wallet will automatically copy and paste the extended public keys. Paste this text into the Bchpls page where it says ‘derivation path,” and hit next.\nAfter that, the merchant is all set, and a page is created which shows information for an access key, cashier screen, and the customer screen. Both screens provide a URL with a QR code created on the invoice page. Unfortunately, there is no address section yet available to copy and paste, as the invoice only supplies a QR code that needs to be scanned.\nAfter the merchant set-up is complete the account holder simply registers a sale on the platform which calculates a new invoice every time. Merchants can also cancel the invoice as well before it is paid just in case there happened to be an error during the process. The Softwares’ Roadmap and Monetization Plans\nThe Bchpls developer explains in the future they plan to monetize by adding custom features or the “ability to operate more than one PoS session at the same time.” Down the line, Bchpls plans to add products management, custom designs, receipts, multiple PoS, and a merchant directory.\nCurrently, the beta program is not open source nor does it offer a client-side (trustless) option but the developer says he will provide these things soon.\n“This is not available on Github at the moment — It is currently a hosted service — The site does not store any private keys or BCH on your behalf,” explains the Bchpls developer. “You provide your Xpub (public key), then any orders made will be made directly to addresses generated from your Xpub.”\nNote that this is not an e-commerce payment gateway solution, it is a POS system for a brick-and-mortar setup. It is also not a solution for people who want automatic settlement into Fiat. It only settles in BCH directly into your wallet — The client-side-only implementation will be open sourced once it is ready.\nBchpls is yet another application that helps promote Bitcoin Cash infrastructure and adoption and most BCH proponents seem to like the platform. Some individuals will likely wait for a more reliable release and others will also wait for a client-side open source version. All in all, Bchpls was extremely easy to set up and any brick-and-mortar business could start using it at their shop.\nWhat do you think about Bchpls.io?

While most of his social media posts can be ignored, a recent Bitcoin price prediction attracted a lot of attention. In his opinion , BTC will hit $15,000 again this year. This is supposed to happen in June, albeit the current market conditions tell a different story.\nThe Bitcoin price is subject to speculation and manipulation at all times. This most recent bearish pressure wave further illustrates that point. In situations like these, one always has to keep the bigger picture in mind. Easier said than done when things are looking rather gloomy. For John McAfee, there is absolutely nothing to worry about. He predicts a Bitcoin price of $15,000 by June 2018.\nA Remarkable Prediction by John McAfee Compared to the current Bitcoin value, that would be a 100% increase. It is not unfeasible, as Bitcoin has seen some interesting price rollercoasters for some time now. However, given the current sour sentiment, such an increase seems highly unlikely. Stranger things have happened in the cryptocurrency world over the years. Additionally, the momentum will turn against the bears at some point this year. June may be a bit too early, though.\nWhat is rather interesting is how McAfee doesn’t use any technical analysis for this prediction. Unlike other speculators, he simply calls things as they happen and goes with the flow. He does claim to use some “algorithms”, but no one really knows what that means exactly. It is a good an indicator as any other we have seen being thrown around. Predicting is not part of humans’ skill sets, unfortunately.\nEven so, it remains to be seen what the future holds for the Bitcoin price. Since the crazy end of 2017, there has been no positive momentum to speak of. Instead, the Bitcoin value has only dropped further and further. Such a massive correction cannot go on indefinitely by any means. However, it may take years until we see $15,000 or more again.\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock\nThe post John McAfee Expects a Bitcoin Price of $15,000 by June 2018 appeared first on Bitcoin Network, News, Charts, Guides & Analysis .\nfrom Bitcoin Network, News, Charts, Guides & Analysis https://ift.tt/2GRCoqZ\nvia IFTTT https://ift.tt/eA8V8J ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john mcafee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "addi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T20:04:26.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "56948d1062c30e0beeacf80e7d4a09965f1b0947", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.srK64ss9YTB59HhhI3jdPqE0ucapSFm1FQtzL1wDGS26CLX112ySa4YB9jVFtdfM7A--", "site_full": "bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinsloverr.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Free Bitcoins", "title": "Bchpls.io Enables Free Bitcoin Cash Point-of-Sale Platform", "title_full": "Bchpls.io Enables Free Bitcoin Cash Point-of-Sale Platform", "published": "2018-05-26T20:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "56948d1062c30e0beeacf80e7d4a09965f1b0947", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtP0nm44TWpSY6hL0NM2uF5rXDwhDCzn.srK64ss9YTB59HhhI3jdPqE0ucapSFm1FQtzL1wDGS26CLX112ySa4YB9jVFtdfM7A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Official Blogger (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-26T20:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bchpls.io Enables Free Bitcoin Cash Point-of-Sale Platform", "text": "Bchpls.io Enables Free Bitcoin Cash Point-of-Sale Platform\nJamie Redman\nThere's a new Point-of-Sale (PoS) service the Bitcoin Cash community has been talking about called, Bchpls.io, an app that enables any brick n' mortar merchant to accept BCH with just two devices by providing a customer screen, and a cashier view. Bchpls is currently in open beta which means the public can test the software at their own discretion, so news.Bitcoin.com decided to test the program's feature services.\nAlso read: Chinese Exchange Launching Southeast Asian Crypto Trading Hub\nGiving the New PoS System Bchpls.io a Test Run This week we decided to test out a new PoS system specifically designed for merchants who want to accept Bitcoin Cash (BCH) at any physical location.

Merchants can also cancel the invoice as well before it is paid just in case there happened to be an error during the process.\nThe Softwares' Roadmap and Monetization Plans The Bchpls developer explains in the future they plan to monetize by adding custom features or the \"ability to operate more than one PoS session at the same time.\" Down the line, Bchpls plans to add products management, custom designs, receipts, multiple PoS, and a merchant directory.\nCurrently, the beta program is not open source nor does it offer a client-side (trustless) option but the developer says he will provide these things soon.\n\"This is not available on Github at the moment — It is currently a hosted service — The site does not store any private keys or BCH on your behalf,\" explains the Bchpls developer. \"You provide your Xpub (public key), then any orders made will be made directly to addresses generated from your Xpub.\"\nNote that this is not an e-commerce payment gateway solution, it is a POS system for a brick-and-mortar setup.

Market manipulation has been an increasingly popular topic in crypto world – particularly since prices started their historic surge.\nLast summer, the SEC established the legal precedent that all digital tokens should be treated like legitimate securities and required them to be registered with the agency. Meanwhile, the CFTC, which is also working with the DOJ, declared bitcoin a commodity back in 2015, and is responsible for regulating bitcoin futures.\nInvestigators will likely look to bring charges against traders who engaged in spoofing – flooding the market with fake orders to push a price up or down depending on one’s position. Another illicit tactic that the DOJ is looking into is called wash trading, which is also prevalent in equity and futures markets. Wash traders trade with themselves to create the illusion of volume in an otherwise illiquid market.\nThe probe is reportedly focusing on bitcoin and ether, according to Bloomberg’s sources.\nThe investigation, which the people said is in its early stages, is the US’s latest effort to crack down on an industry that was initially embraced by those who were distrustful of banks and government control over monetary policy.\nBut Bitcoin’s meteoric rise – it surged to almost $20,000 in 2017 after starting the year below $1,000 – has been a lure for mom-and-pop investors. That’s prompted regulators to grow concerned that people are jumping into cryptocurrencies without knowing the risks. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission has opened dozens of investigations into initial coin offerings, in which companies sell digital tokens that can be redeemed for goods and services, due to suspicions that many are scams.\nCryptocurrency trading is fragmented on dozens of platforms across the globe, and many aren’t registered with the CFTC or SEC. As a derivatives watchdog, the CFTC doesn’t regulate what’s known as the spot market for digital tokens — which is the trading of actual coins rather than futures linked to them. But if the agency finds fraud in spot markets, it does have authority to impose sanctions.\nGiven the pressure that the IRS has put on companies like Coinbase to turn over customer information, the DOJ investigation could also ensnare a few exchanges – particularly after the collapse of Mt Gox, the former Tokyo-based exchange has been liquidated after losing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its customers’ bitcoin.\nAccording to Bloomberg , the limited oversight of the crypto market (the same reason given by the SEC for rejecting a proposed rule change that would’ve cleared the way for an ETF) makes it vulnerable to fraud. And exchanges are increasingly realizing that if manipulation isn’t eliminated, or at least suppressed, that customers could start walking away from what they now believe to be a rigged market… then again, investors have stuck with stocks and bonds through every financial crisis in the history of modern, post-central bank “capitalism.”\nThe limited oversight of crypto trading makes it a target for crooks, said John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor who has studied manipulation, including in digital-coin markets. “There’s very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading,” Griffin said. “It would be easy to spoof this market.”\nSigns are emerging that some crypto exchanges realize the industry’s growth could be constrained if large swaths of investors conclude that trading platforms have a “buyer beware” approach to oversight.\nThat said, good luck : determining who is manipulating prices and who has inside information would be next to impossible in the anonymous world of bitcoin, which is subject to different regulations in different markets. Japan and the Philippines have already developed their own legal framework for crypto markets.\nStudies have shown that 1,000 people own 40% of the bitcoin market. Given this naturally top-heavy concentration, it could be difficult for prosecutors to prove that there’s anything illegal going on when the largest players step up to trade.\nIronically, most of the recent “manipulation” has been to the detriment of bulls: for example, when the Mt. Gox bankruptcy trustee who has earned the nickname “the Tokyo Whale” for his ability to crash prices while unloading massive quantities of bitcoin decides to sell tens of thousands of bitcoins in a single block – crashing the price – is he manipulating the market?\nBut that doesn’t mean spoofing isn’t happening. For years, the twitter user @bitfinexed (who has since switched his account to private) has documented the work of “spoofy” ( who was also profiled here ) – a nickname he used for a group of traders who would place, and then cancel, large orders on different exchanges. He has also highlighted other shady behavior, like the Bitfinexed tether token, which is supposed to allow crypto traders to go from cash to coin more quickly. But we imagine – particularly as more institutions become exposed to the bitcoin market – that the Feds will investigate every scrap of potentially nefarious activity in due time.\nMeanwhile, we imagine crypto enthusiasts will be less than delighted at this news, with accusations that the US is turning into China set to emerge as crypto doomsayers claim the US government is finally making its move against bitcoin.\nThis article ( DOJ Launches Criminal Probe Into Bitcoin Price Manipulation ) was originally published on Zero Hedge and syndicated by The Event Chronicle .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "doj", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T20:10:55.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "79744f385804d03abb9a139cd9709d14997bc1f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va780wfH7VUOLl8IS65Xb2zZ4PLJSeW5Q96Xvm.KqW0QEEImFG9R4tvwIyalXWlCI0qobkVhd9Z_0VHjbDgUeypQ8-", "site_full": "bitcoin.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Bitcoin Stack Exchange", "title": "I think my bitcoin wallet was hacked.

The pet owner said that she knew it must be a scam because she already had her dog back.\nWhen Happy went missing, Howell posted details of the lost pet on Facebook and a service called Pawboost. It is believed that the criminal found her details on social media, and tried to take advantage of the pseudonymity that bitcoin affords consumers.\nThe caller said that they were using a burner phone that could not be traced by the police. The matter has been reported to Granville County Sheriff’s Office, who said that this was the first time they had dealt with such a case, but that they had heard of similar instances in other areas of the country.\nHowell said that the criminals “need to find a better way to make money”.\nBitcoin has developed a reputation for being used in scams and blackmail attempts, both because transactions are not reversible and many people mistakenly believe that they are always untraceable.\nThey are also used in ransomware attacks on computers, with some attacks netting millions of dollars for the perpetrators. Victims are told that if they do not pay a ransom fee, usually equivalent to around $200, their personal files will either be deleted or shared online.\nAlthough the method of contact and finding the victims was different, the rest of the details of this attempted ransom sound the same.\nOn Wednesday, 13 year-old South African schoolboy, Katlego Marite, was snatched by a gang in Mpumalanga on Sunday. Katlego was taken by three men while he played with two friends. As the kidnappers left with Katlego, they dropped a ransom note. The note demanded a payment of $120,000 worth of BTC be paid in order for the boy to be returned to his parents. The ransom has not yet been paid.\nIn December 2017, kidnappers made $1 million in bitcoin in exchange for the life of Pavel Lerner, a blockchain expert and an executive at a UK-based cryptocurrency exchange. Once the ransom was paid, Lerner was released by the Ukranian kidnappers.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.cbs17.com/news/local-news/scammer-demands-bitcoin-in-exchange-for-safe-return-of-lost-granville-county-dog/1195087271", "https://hacked.com/continue-reading"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "patricia howell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "howell", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "granville county sheriff’s office", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youngsville", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T02:24:07.018+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ae5d41b36b0c7d24e98f4a896ab37325beadabbd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHIjvCU4EBLDgawmQSlGc7EWM9QMCt203M4p0iTLnSej8HKt2laUA5mu3hxLLwacX0hwse.kmsEfybHLK76a5NYIJe1BBbEbFic-", "site_full": "wegobusiness.com", "site": "wegobusiness.com", "site_section": "http://wegobusiness.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "WeGoBusiness – Top business stories from around the internet", "title": "Bitcoin – World’s Largest Diamond Retailer Joins De Beers Blockchain Project", "title_full": "Bitcoin – World’s Largest Diamond Retailer Joins De Beers Blockchain Project", "published": "2018-05-26T19:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://wegobusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin-World’s-Largest-Diamond-Retailer-Joins-De-Beers-Blockchain-Project.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ae5d41b36b0c7d24e98f4a896ab37325beadabbd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHIjvCU4EBLDgawmQSlGc7EWM9QMCt203M4p0iTLnSej8HKt2laUA5mu3hxLLwacX0hwse.kmsEfybHLK76a5NYIJe1BBbEbFic-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "WeGoBusiness - Digital Business Academy", "published": "2018-05-26T19:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin – World’s Largest Diamond Retailer Joins De Beers Blockchain Project", "text": "Bitcoin – World’s Largest Diamond Retailer Joins De Beers Blockchain Project 26 May 2018 24\nGet exclusive analysis and cryptocurrency insights on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nSignet Jewelers, the world’s largest retailer of diamond jewelry, has joined Tracr, the diamond blockchain program being developed by South African gem juggernaut De Beers Group.\nSignet is part of a growing chorus of industry giants that are part of the Tracr pilot program, which will track each diamond that gets mined on a shared distributed ledger.\nThe blockchain project will ensure that the gems are not illegal “conflict diamonds” mined by slaves in African war zones by providing comprehensive mine-to-customer traceability. Mine-to-Customer Traceability\nTracr also ensures there’s no theft or illicit substitution along the way, so the end user — the consumer — can be assured of their diamond’s authenticity and provenance. It is the first program that digitally tracks each diamond from mine to retail.\n“Tracr is focused on bringing the benefits of blockchain technology to the full diamond value chain – providing consumers with confidence, the trade with increased efficiency and lower costs, and lenders to the industry with greater visibility,” De Beers CEO Bruce Cleaver remarked in a statement.\nVirginia Drosos, the CEO of Signet, agreed: “Responsible sourcing of diamonds has always been an integral part of Signet’s corporate ethos, and this will be further strengthened through our cooperation with Tracr.” Source: Pixabay\nTracr is expected to launch in late-2018. It gives each diamond a unique ID code that stores the stone’s weight, color, and clarity. All the information is shared on a joint database.\nIn early-May 2018, De Beers — which is responsible for one-third of the global supply of diamonds — announced that it had successfully tracked 100 high-value diamonds through Tracr. Market leaders applaud the use of the technology underpinning bitcoin to bolster transparency.\n“Technology has already significantly contributed to improving transparency within the diamond industry,” said Amit Bhansali, managing director of Rosy Blue, one of the world’s largest diamond jewelry manufacturers. “Initiatives that use blockchain can drive this process even further.” Even Bitcoin Skeptics Embrace Blockchain\nThis novel use of blockchain reaffirms the potential game-changing applications of distributed ledger technology. The diamond industry isn’t the only sector that has taken notice.\nRetail giant Walmart recently filed a patent for a blockchain-based digital marketplace. Walmart’s system would track the products that stores sell to a particular customer.\nSimilarly, major banks in Southeast Asia recently completed a cross-border transfer of funds from Thailand to Singapore in “a matter of seconds” using blockchain, as CCN has reported.\nEven avowed cryptocurrency skeptics and bitcoin bears have conceded that blockchain could transform healthcare, banking, supply-chain management, and the entertainment industry.\nThat’s why even Old Money like the Rockefeller family is investing in blockchain startups through its venture-capital arm, Venrock. David Pakman, a Venrock partner, said the fund is less concerned about turning short-term profits than in making long-term investments in blockchain and the cryptocurrency industry. “There are a lot of cryptocurrency hedge funds,” Pakman said. “This is different.”\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tracr", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "diamond retailer joins de beers blockchain project", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "signet jewelers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "signet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de beers group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-27T03:23:00.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0a6c91c678df96582a2d992edc21a0f766695657", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSfGp2oLwsUvYNmOb.WIUtr_Nri_ejEslJJ31V0wP_ZTOI0svj2OIGUWsQ6Q33CAjCdflvBpyuhLi6Q8rJwSIGFa9qXqn4aygPOf.rx4bPMNiSEGphJ3UN3Y09FZSmsp3ZA1mDHe4GrqSJPLOozkcWa", "site_full": "www.namepros.com", "site": "namepros.com", "site_section": "https://www.namepros.com/forums/web-hosting-reviews.245/", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Web Hosting Reviews - NamePros", "title": "$1 Start: CurrenciesBuy.com Crypto / Bitcoin / Currency Business Web Domain Name", "title_full": "$1 Start: CurrenciesBuy.com Crypto / Bitcoin / Currency Business Web Domain Name - NamePros", "published": "2018-05-26T19:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "https://www.namepros.com/data/avatars/fb/965/965502.jpg?1444854329", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 12601, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0a6c91c678df96582a2d992edc21a0f766695657", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSfGp2oLwsUvYNmOb.WIUtr_Nri_ejEslJJ31V0wP_ZTOI0svj2OIGUWsQ6Q33CAjCdflvBpyuhLi6Q8rJwSIGFa9qXqn4aygPOf.rx4bPMNiSEGphJ3UN3Y09FZSmsp3ZA1mDHe4GrqSJPLOozkcWa", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Daniel Owens", "published": "2018-05-26T19:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "$1 Start: CurrenciesBuy.com Crypto / Bitcoin / Currency Business Web Domain Name", "text": "CurrenciesBuy.com (Godaddy March 2019 - GD Push Only)\nStart: $1\nIncrements: $1\nBin: TBD\nEnds: 168 hours after final highest bid or if bin is added and claimed.\nPayment: Paypal Only Due Within 24 hours (or less) after win.

Miners receive freshly minted from the block reward and transaction fees in return for their efforts, and this has become a very popular source of income in the cryptocurrency world.\nThe hash rate is the amount of cryptographic hashes processed by computers per second and is a good measure of the total processing power Bitcoin miners are contributing and is perhaps a good measure of the health of the Bitcoin network for a couple of reasons. The difficulty of hashing increases as hash rate rises, and therefore as hash rate rises Bitcoin becomes more cryptographically secure. Also a rising hash rate indicates that Bitcoin is becoming more popular, since more people are dedicating processing power to trying to obtain Bitcoins through mining.\nIn the long term the hash rate has been rising practically exponentially, going from about 800,000 TH/s at the beginning of 2016, 2 million TH/s at the beginning of 2017, to 16 million TH/s at the start of 2018, and now sits near 31 million TH/s. This is a good metric of how Bitcoin has been spreading globally and it’s use rising exponentially during that time.\nBitcoin’s price hit an all-time record high near 20,000 USD per coin in early December 2017, and since then has been on a pretty swift decline which has brought it down to 7,500 USD per coin at the time of this writing. Hundreds of billions of dollars have exited the Bitcoin market as a result. Despite this huge 60+% price drop, the network hash rate has gone up approximately 140% from 13 million TH/s to 31 million TH/s at the same time.\nThis rapid rise in mining power on the Bitcoin network indicates that the consensus of miners think Bitcoin won’t be dropping in the long term , or they wouldn’t be investing tremendous amounts of money into their Bitcoin mining equipment.\nThe rise in hash rate also suggests that Bitcoin continues to be the #1 cryptocurrency and is the cryptocurrency that most miners decide to focus their efforts on since it has been and continues to be the gold standard of the cryptocurrency world.\nBitcoin is by far more widely used than any other cryptocurrency, since it is the first and truly the essence of what a cryptocurrency should be from the time it launched in 2009. It is cryptographically secure, and allows users to send money anywhere in the world instantly for anything they want to purchase, and is a lot more private than any other long-distance payment method like banks or Western Union.\nFollow BitcoinNews.com on Twitter at @BitcoinNewsCom\nTelegram Alerts from BitcoinNews.com at https://t.me/bconews\nImage Source: Pixabay", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2018/05/25/bitcoin-hash-rate-telling-a-bullish-story/#14071cc11fea", "https://t.me/bconews", "https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate?timespan=all", "https://twitter.com/bitcoinnewscom"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T21:52:52.045+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5497dce169c7de290388ad5a4afb4b1ed2b274f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHLz4JnItHwuokpLssHrYUUXYnnc54WiX44fZ_mI9ZIm5aRaVHTtC1C6VM8nIjDKXf3u2vNdea2jArr0iGA9cXAX", "site_full": "wegobusiness.com", "site": "wegobusiness.com", "site_section": "http://wegobusiness.com/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "WeGoBusiness – Top business stories from around the internet", "title": "Bitcoin – 331 High-Income Traders Declared Crypto Profits in Japan", "title_full": "Bitcoin – 331 High-Income Traders Declared Crypto Profits in Japan", "published": "2018-05-26T19:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://wegobusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bitcoin-331-High-Income-Traders-Declared-Crypto-Profits-in-Japan.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5497dce169c7de290388ad5a4afb4b1ed2b274f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8DnnkQ7bVX9oMNvmu5KroeDxOcCSBnAHLz4JnItHwuokpLssHrYUUXYnnc54WiX44fZ_mI9ZIm5aRaVHTtC1C6VM8nIjDKXf3u2vNdea2jArr0iGA9cXAX", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "WeGoBusiness - Digital Business Academy", "published": "2018-05-26T19:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin – 331 High-Income Traders Declared Crypto Profits in Japan", "text": "Bitcoin – 331 High-Income Traders Declared Crypto Profits in Japan 26 May 2018 8545\nThe Japanese tax authority has for the first time revealed the number of high-income taxpayers who declared cryptocurrency profits in the year 2017. Out of the total number of taxpayers with miscellaneous income of 100 million yen or more, excluding public pension, 60% of them reported income from crypto transactions.\nAlso read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Declaring Crypto Income\nThe Japanese National Tax Agency announced on Friday the number of people with 100 million yen (~US$914,000) or more miscellaneous income that includes income from cryptocurrency transactions, according to local media. Nikkei elaborated:\nIt is the first time that the agency announced the result of the counting of virtual currency related declarations.\nThe tax agency revealed that 21.98 million people filed income tax for the year 2017. Last year, “The number of taxpayers with miscellaneous incomes of 100 million yen and over from sources other than public pensions jumped from the previous year’s 238 to 549,” according to Jiji Press. Of these 549 people, more than 60% or 331 of them “gained income from cryptocurrency transactions,” the news outlet conveyed.\nThe “total income [reported for all taxpayers] was 41.4988 trillion yen [~$379 billion] (up 3.4% from the previous year),” the Sankei Shimbun detailed, noting that the “declared tax payments amounted to 3.0207 trillion yen [~$28 billion] (a 4.6% increase), which was the highest in 10 years.”\nAccording to Nikkei, tax reporting of crypto transactions is challenging because each crypto exchange reports transaction data differently. According to industry stakeholders, some exchanges do not separate purchase and sale transactions and “there may be upper limits on the number of transaction records that can be acquired,” the publication added. 55% Tax Possible\nThe National Tax Agency released guidance on how cryptocurrency profits are taxed in December last year. “In Japan, profits from cryptocurrency trading are categorized as miscellaneous income,” Jiji Press explained. The Japan Times described:\nIf you earn ¥200,000 [~$1,828] or more from cryptocurrency trading, you must pay tax.\nThere are seven tax brackets based on taxable income. Those earning 1.95 million yen (~$17,823) or less are taxed at 5 percent, the news outlet described, adding that the highest tax rate is 45 percent for taxpayers who earn more than 40 million yen (~$365,600). However, the publication pointed out that “your income is also subject to a residential tax of 10 percent. Together, the maximum tax rate is 55 percent.”\nWhat do you think of how Japan taxes crypto transactions?

even try to keep up. Residential customers, meanwhile, worry that their rates will go up.\nPublic hearings for rural electric utilities are rarely sellout events. But the crowd that showed up in Wenatchee two weeks ago for a hearing about Bitcoin mining in Chelan County was so large that utility staff had to open a second room with a video feed for the overflow.\nThe turnout wasn’t surprising. Chelan County, along with neighboring Douglas and Grant counties, has been at the center of the U.S. Bitcoin boom since 2012, when the region’s ultracheap hydropower began attracting cryptocurrency “miners.” These entrepreneurs earn Bitcoin by solving increasingly complicated mathematical problems established by the shadowy creators of the digital currency.\nThe process, which the industry calls mining, involves trillions of computer calculations and sucks up huge amounts of power. As a result, an area famous for apples, wheat and conservative politics has been transformed into a kind of cyber-boomtown, with Bitcoin mining operations that range from large-scale, state-of-the-art warehouses to repurposed cargo containers to backyard sheds.\nBy the end of this year, according to some estimates, the Mid-Columbia Basin could account for as much as 30 percent of the global output of new Bitcoin and large shares of other digital currencies, such as Litecoin and Ethereum. But as in any boomtown, success has come at a cost.

Bitcoinist recently caught up with Rafael Cosman, CTO and Co-Founder of TrustToken, to talk about the company’s new USD-pegged stablecoin, it’s relationship to other stablecoins like Tether, and the price spike following TrueUSD’s listing on Binance. Here’s what he had to say.\nBitcoinist: TrustToken is a platform to create asset-backed tokens, such as gold to gold tokens or dollar to dollar tokens. How exactly does this process work?\nRC: The TrustToken Platform deposits the asset into a fiduciary partner’s escrow account as collateral and then creates tokens that are equal to the value of the asset. For example, TrustToken’s smart contract is designed so that we do not mint new TrueUSD unless the corresponding amount has been received from market-makers in the escrow account. The tokens are then available for 24/7, low-cost trading.\nBitcoinist: How do you maintain price stability for TrueUSD?\nRC: Generally, our policy is that “redeemability leads to stability.” The value of a TrueUSD token is that it can be redeemed for one US dollar. There will only be as many tokens in circulation as there are dollars in the escrow account to collateralize the tokens. In the long run, this feature precedes price stability, since the price will return to $1.00 as long as the token continues to be redeemable.\nThe TrueUSD token structure is such that we have no incentive to arbitrarily increase the supply of TrueUSD, even during times of temporarily excessive demand. The regular independent attestations by the accounting firm Cohen & Co. would alert the community to any arbitrary printing of TUSD. Tether is an example of a collateralized stablecoin that appears to arbitrarily print tokens to meet demand – a model that has not proven trustworthy.\nBitcoinist: Will TrueUSD tokens be classified as securities?\nRC: Our outside legal counsel has taken the stance that TrueUSD (TUSD) is not a security, because it does not provide any expectation of profits. Also, TUSD was not pre-sold to any investors to fund its development. With analysis from outside legal counsel, we have been advised that we are taking the proper precautions to stay in line with the current regulatory landscape.\nBitcoinist: Do you plan on tokenizing other fiat currencies?\nRC: We’ve been fortunate to receive significant inbound interest from major cryptocurrency exchanges that want to list TUSD. We’re preparing for even more investors to be able to purchase, redeem, and trade TrueUSD. Given the positive reception from the market so far, we’re also exploring the tokenization of currencies such as TrueEuro or TrueYen.\nBitcoinist: Do you see TrueUSD as a competitor to stablecoins like Basecoin or MakerDAO?\nRC: No, given that each stablecoin is taking a different approach, we think they will be complementary. The cryptocurrency market will benefit from having a diversity of options. Given that we are still in the early days of stablecoins, we are just as curious as everyone else to see how algorithmic or crypto-based approaches perform. The value of TrueUSD is that investors and traditional financial institutions have reassurance in knowing that our stablecoin is fully collateralized with fiat currency held in a fiduciary partner’s escrow account.\nBitcoinist: What about Tether (USDT)? What differentiates TrueUSD from USDT?\nRC: Tether has proven trader demand for a stablecoin with over $2.5 billion in market cap. TrueUSD provides trust that Tether does not by eliminating counterparty risk with full collateralization of funds held in escrow by trust companies, providing 1-for-1 redemption of TUSD into US dollars, and publishing monthly attestation reports by Cohen & Co. (an independent third-party accounting firm).\nBitcoinist: Goldman Sachs-backed Circle recently announced its plan to release a USD-pegged stablecoin. What is your opinion on that?\nRC: TrustToken welcomes Circle’s announcement of their plans to enter the space; it further validates that there is a large addressable market for USD-pegged stablecoins.\nAri Paul, a crypto thought leader and investor in TrustToken said, “I’ve eagerly awaited the launch of a regulatory compliant stablecoin. TrueUSD will make it easier for BlockTower Capital to trade cryptocurrency across exchanges.”\nTrueUSD’s price spiked to upwards of $1.30 per token after Binance announced trading of the stablecoin — which seems counterintuitive to TrueUSD’s purpose. How did this happen, and how do we know this won’t happen again?\nRC: Generally, our policy is that “redeemability leads to stability.” The value of a TrueUSD token is that it can be redeemed for one US dollar. There will only be as many tokens in circulation as there are dollars in the escrow account to collateralize the tokens. In the long run, this feature precedes price stability, since the price will return to $1.00 (as it did within 24 hours of reaching the high of $1.30) as long as the token continues to be redeemable.\nThe TrueUSD token structure is such that we have no incentive to arbitrarily increase the supply of TrueUSD, even during times of temporarily excessive demand. The regular independent attestations by Cohen & Co. would alert the community to any arbitrary printing of TUSD. Tether is an example of a collateralized stablecoin that appears to arbitrarily print tokens to meet demand – a model that has not proven trustworthy.\nWhen TrueUSD was listed on Binance, many expected a large spike in price. However, the market adjusted and stabilized itself – the price never went above $1.02 or below $0.99 after the listing.\nFor more information, we just published a blog post on why demand may exceed supply during big exchange listings. This is not counterintuitive to TrueUSD’s purpose because the value of TrueUSD lies in that you can redeem it 1-for-1 for US dollars. The TrueUSD smart contract will only mint as many TrueUSD tokens as there are dollars in the third-party fiduciary’s escrow account. It will never print more than there are collateralized dollars in the bank, even during times of high demand.\nBitcoinist: What is your opinion on the current state of the cryptocurrency market?\nRC: The market is still relatively new, so we’re looking forward to seeing how it develops. The potential for fractional ownership and 24/7 trading gives investors access to entirely new asset classes. The cryptocurrency market is truly global, providing more democratized access to financial opportunities.\nBitcoinist: Where do you see blockchain technology and cryptocurrency in the next 5 years?\nRC: Currently, most blockchains are used to trade crypto-assets or tokens for various blockchain networks. Over time, the types of assets traded on blockchains will include not only cryptocurrencies but digital rights, intellectual property, datasets, and even real estate. Blockchains are secure, trustworthy ways to keep track of “who owns what” using immutable ledgers and can eliminate the friction associated with buying and selling many types of assets today.\nBitcoinist: What excites you the most about working on TrueUSD?\nRC: Michael Novogratz of Galaxy Digital Capital Management recently spoke to Laura Shin on her Unconfirmed podcast about how he is bullish on the opportunity for US dollar-backed stablecoins.\nWe agree that there is a huge opportunity ahead. It is exciting that TrueUSD is the leader in the category because we are the fully compliant stablecoin that is live today for trading on the top cryptocurrency exchanges. By mitigating price volatility, TrueUSD can help cryptocurrencies reach mainstream adoption through commerce, remittances, and trading.\nDo you have any questions for Rafael Cosman, CTO and Co-Founder of TrustToken?
