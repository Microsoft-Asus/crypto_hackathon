If there will be way to create let´s say Hard core mode where instead of UAC you will have to use BTC or other suitable cryptocurrency than it will bring new level to the game. People will allow to do less atractive things to do because they could be paid. I can imagine full time job a a transporter (because he got paid). It is very rough idea but if you can create demand for it, than it will bring absolutely new level to multiplayer gaming as it is. I imagine it like: You pay with BTC for your ship and training of desired proffesion. Afterwards it is up to you if you make profit or loss, either way you will make some work which should in mmo create demand/supply. Although I would not limit investing in the game as it is only for starter ships. If you can afford paying for Reclaimer than why not. Maybe because of its price there will not be enough of those types of services and price of your sevices will then go to the moon, so better ROI for you. Only thing I am afraid is the creation of natural demand and bots. so what do you think ? Am I completely wrong or is there something which could be interesting in the future ?

Tom begins by explaining what bitcoin is, how it originated, and how it compares with other cryptocurrencies. Next, he explains how to get started by creating a bitcoin wallet, buying and selling bitcoin, and protecting your transactions. He discusses other top cryptocurrencies-Ripple, Ethereum, and IOTA-and explains how \"initial coin offerings\" (ICOs) have changed the investment landscape.

He stated that crypto is “facilitating trade that would not otherwise occur. Some of that’s illegal, but some of that is avoiding costs that would otherwise be there.”\nAsked whether Bitcoin was a threat to the US dollar, Bullard voiced uncertainty about the potential competition the leading cryptocurrency could pose, saying, “I don’t think so at this point [...]. We don’t know how the future’s going to unfold.”\n“My idea is that there’s a lot of currency competition going on right now,” Bullard meanwhile continued on the topic of dollar supremacy, adding:\n“The dollar has been the winner historically because it’s backed by the largest economy and a relatively stable policy in terms of low inflation and that’s going to be tough to beat. But a lot of people here want to beat it.”\nOn the topic of blockchain, Bullard was much more openly bullish, saying:\n“we think blockchain technology is very interesting [..] we want to be very engaged and thoughtful as this proceeds.”\nHe also responded to a question of whether or not the Fed was considering issuing its own cryptocurrency, saying noncommittally, “we can certainly look at that as a possibility. And there are different parts of the Fed that look at all kinds of applications of blockchain technology. But I wouldn’t say there’s any plan at this point.\nThe comments continue the trend of general crypto support from the St. Louis Fed. In January this year, the reserve bank published a dedicated paper titled “A Short Introduction to the World of Cryptocurrencies” in which researches forecast it was “likely” that Bitcoin and altcoins would “emerge as their own asset class.”\nhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-could-emerge-as-a-threat-to-us-dollar-in-future-suggests-st-louis-fed-chief via @Cointelegraph\nALL comments are In My Own OPINION.

Most of the other top cryptocurrencies joined bitcoin in its price decline.\nHere's what you need to know in crypto for Tuesday, May 15.\nFed's Bullard on 'Non-Uniform' Risks Speaking at the Consensus 2018 event in New York on Monday, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard explained that cryptocurrencies have begun to operate as non-uniform currencies , as there are more than 1,800 cryptocurrencies, many of which trade at different prices at the same time in the same local markets. Non-uniform currencies such as these have, at least historically, been rejected and replaced in financial markets, Bullard suggested. That means bitcoin and its crypto cohorts have quite a ways to go on the road toward ubiquity in global financial markets. \"They've got to compete just like everybody else ... welcome to the currency competition game,\" Bullard said. \"Cryptocurrencies may be unwittingly pushing in the wrong direction in trying to solve an important social problem, which is how best to facilitate market-based exchange,\" Bullard said. The dollar, on the other hand, is backed by a stable government with direct and sensical monetary policy and persistently low inflation -- because of that, it can better achieve the goals and meet the needs of the market. \"The dollar is in great shape and will stay in great shape because it's been the winner for a long time,\" Bullard said. \"Unless we screw up, I think the dollar is going to remain the dominant currency.\"\nBlockchain as 'Magic Dust?' After Amber Baldet, former blockchain head at Action Alerts PLUS holding JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM ) , introduced a new project called Clovyr at Consensus this week, the venture sparked a fierce debate over the merits of blockchain technologies. Clovyr is a decentralized app store that allows users to access projects both public and permissioned plus enterprise networks. According to Jimmy Song, Blockchain Capital partner and noted bitcoin maximalist, the app is nothing more than a collection of \"buzzwords.\" Speaking on a panel with Baldet and Joseph Lubin, founder of ethereum startup Consensys, Song argued that companies can't use \"magical blockchain dust\" to solve their problems. He illustrated how many are using buzzwords including blockchain, interoperability, open-source, enterprise-focused, etc., to draw in investment and cover blemishes. After Song said he doesn't see much other than bitcoin gaining traction in the next decade, Lubin said he would bet Song \"any amount of bitcoin\" he's wrong. The two said they would work out the bet on Twitter.\n\"In 5 years most of the projects in this space will have been for nothing. Especially the enterprise ones,\" says @jimmysong to which @ethereumJoseph soon says he'll bet \"any amount of bitcoin\" Song's wrong �� #Consensus2018\n— Kinsey Grant (@KinseyGrant) May 14, 2018 Mayweather-Backed ICO Founders Indicted The founders of Floyd Mayweather-backed cryptocurrency firm Centra Tech have been indicted by a grand jury and accused of fraud, a U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced this week. Raymond Trapani, Sohrab Sharma and Robert Farkas allegedly planned to defraud investors through a token sale labeled as a \"scheme to induce victims to invest million of dollars' worth of digital funds for the purpose of unregistered securities.\" Authorities recovered more than $60 million in funds from the founders. Centra Tech's token sale had been endorsed by heavyweight boxer Mayweather, and the company claimed to have relationships with Visa Inc. ( V ) and Mastercard Inc. ( MA ) , which authorities said never existed.\nConsensus Could Rake in Big Bucks As the Consensus event nears its close, the total attendee count has proven staggering. The flagship conference, regarded by most as the biggest industry event of the year, more than tripled attendance in 2018, with the total nearing 8,500 people. The final estimate came from Barry Silbert, CEO and founder of Digital Currency Group (DCG). Silbert's DCG owns Coindesk, the firm behind Consensus. About 2,700 people attended the Consensus event in 2017, meaning the annual summit grew nearly 215% in a year. Most tickets for the conference cost about $2,000, and Consensus could rake in $17 million in ticket sales alone.\nFinal attendee count for #Consensus2018 : ~8,500\n— Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) May 14, 2018", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/Consensus2018?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/ethereumJoseph?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/KinseyGrant/status/996133102643830786?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/barrysilbert/status/996008327648657408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/jimmysong?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bullard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james bullard", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "st. louis federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fed", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T01:48:32.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "04c0570444e3224dc2d56d4dc2ba36de55defefe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWAkegs2rOArah2FjsxQXnQ-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=240.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Tokens (Altcoins)", "title": "🔥🚀🚀[ANN][Pre-ICO] Bitcoin Crown - Cryptocurrency for online game lovers🔥🚀🚀", "title_full": "🔥🚀🚀[ANN][Pre-ICO] Bitcoin Crown - Cryptocurrency for online game lovers🔥🚀🚀", "published": "2018-05-16T00:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "04c0570444e3224dc2d56d4dc2ba36de55defefe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWAkegs2rOArah2FjsxQXnQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bjornandre", "published": "2018-05-16T00:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "🔥🚀🚀[ANN][Pre-ICO] Bitcoin Crown - Cryptocurrency for online game lovers🔥🚀🚀", "text": "The solutions to the challenges are clearly stated.\nBitcoin Crown will surely dominate the scene spaecially for the game lovers.

As mentioned then, ETH/USD was showing relative strength among the major cryptos, which still remains the case. Although last week’s pullback saw Ethereum go below the $700 support level, it has now risen back above it and price never broke below the invalidation level of $627 to tilt the bias back to bearish. With Ethereum also back above the 200-day average, the bullish bias thus remains intact for the time being. We had also identified the area between $800 and $835, which was formerly support, as the next resistance zone. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Source: TradingView and FOREX.com UK* As it turned out, this area did in fact turn into resistance. However, the resulting sell-off from this area has been mild thus far, pointing to modest profit-taking there. Going forward, the bulls will be hoping that it clears this $800-$835 resistance range in order to confirm that the buyers are well and truly in control again. If this happens to be the case then the next bullish objective would be the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $1016/7. Alternatively, if Ethereum goes back below the aforementioned $700 support level and holds below it for a while then this would increase the likelihood of a breakdown below that $627 level. In this potential scenario, Ethereum’s next stop could very well be around the next support at $535 or lower. *Please note, this product is not available to US clients. 1", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://on.forex.com/2Im83lA"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T02:28:15.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a569a9d14d79ef3f805f4c9082c0d57746087f5b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jfjJwoN0WVO1ETTcDvvjRktHt5BHMSBG_ML2FkgBPX7hU20adtW1dsttFkE0vXyJ93DVCif24tb9A--", "site_full": "carigold.com", "site": "carigold.com", "site_section": "http://carigold.com/portal/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=86", "site_categories": ["investing", "non_standard_content", "finance", "adult"], "section_title": "Forex Articles - CariGold Forum", "title": "An Explanation for Trendy Bitcoin Prices", "title_full": "An Explanation for Trendy Bitcoin Prices - CariGold Forum", "published": "2018-05-16T00:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 29476, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a569a9d14d79ef3f805f4c9082c0d57746087f5b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jfjJwoN0WVO1ETTcDvvjRktHt5BHMSBG_ML2FkgBPX7hU20adtW1dsttFkE0vXyJ93DVCif24tb9A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "painofhell", "published": "2018-05-16T00:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "An Explanation for Trendy Bitcoin Prices", "text": "Multiplier effects exist in the economy because a dollar saved is a dollar earned, but a dollar spent that doesnt get consumed grows. For example, when a film goes into production, most of the financing is done with pre-tax dollars that are sold to free investors at a discount. The incentive is the tax savings. Its hard to say how the investment is creating a specific multiplier, but it is well understood that these local tax savings create pockets of spending where the production is shot. Lets say a film has just received a local grant or stipend of $10,000. This money will be spent almost entirely in the local region where the film set is at. If the production goes to Germany, which is common due to good tax incentives, that money is exchanged for £8,300 and spent in the location of where the film is being produced, in this case, somewhere in Germany. That is a new injection of cash, which goes into the entire cycle of a multiplier for consumption. One important part of the divisor for calculating the multiplier is the Marginal Propensity To Consume. The multiplier for consumption is calculated as follows:\nLets say the marginal propensity to consume is equal to 95% of a single dollar of earnings or new capital, cash, etc. The formula would be calculated as follows:\nTheoretically, every dollar injected into the economy would result in $20 of new income that gets added to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\nOther multipliers exist, for instance, there are multipliers for imports and tax savings.\nThe concept of the multiplier effect is important to understand because this is how industry is able to create the illusion of better discounts and/or credits for the products. A good example is the grocery store.

For example, when a film goes into production, most of the financing is done with pre-tax dollars that are sold to free investors at a discount. The incentive is the tax savings. Its hard to say how the investment is creating a specific multiplier, but it is well understood that these local tax savings create pockets of spending where the production is shot. Lets say a film has just received a local grant or stipend of $10,000. This money will be spent almost entirely in the local region where the film set is at. If the production goes to Germany, which is common due to good tax incentives, that money is exchanged for £8,300 and spent in the location of where the film is being produced, in this case, somewhere in Germany. That is a new injection of cash, which goes into the entire cycle of a multiplier for consumption. One important part of the divisor for calculating the multiplier is the Marginal Propensity To Consume. The multiplier for consumption is calculated as follows:\nLets say the marginal propensity to consume is equal to 95% of a single dollar of earnings or new capital, cash, etc. The formula would be calculated as follows:\nTheoretically, every dollar injected into the economy would result in $20 of new income that gets added to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\nOther multipliers exist, for instance, there are multipliers for imports and tax savings.\nThe concept of the multiplier effect is important to understand because this is how industry is able to create the illusion of better discounts and/or credits for the products.

BitcoinCash.org also wrote that this is the first of several planned upgrades for the currency.\nAn explanation of the new upgrade on Reddit says that the upgrade is “paving the way for future adoption as well as new functionality being added such as op codes.” User Steve Shadders-a co-author for reenabling disabled Op codes – posted on his blog that the reactivation of formerly disabled Op codes is compelling to developers and could bring value to the BCH economy.\nThe arguments against an increase in block size include making operation of full nodes more expensive, leading to less decentralization of the network, as well as lower propagation speeds, according to BitcoinWiki .\nAlthough outspoken BCH advocate Roger Ver did not directly mention the upgrade today, he did post on Twitter about his belief that BCH–above all Bitcoin forks–follows Satoshi’s vision: There are multiple Bitcoins, just like there are multiple blockchains but only #BitcoinCash conforms to the version of Bitcoin described by Satoshi in his white paper. pic.twitter.com/dXSqPO5ePA\n— Roger Ver (@rogerkver) May 15, 2018\nBCH, which is a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain from August 2017, touts itself as the original Bitcoin (BTC) and superior to BTC due to its lower transaction fees. However, at the end of February this year, BTC’s transaction fees were cheaper than those of BCH.\nBCH’s large block size is another characteristic that sets it apart from BTC. This is due to Satoshi Nakamoto’s attempt to avoid splitting the blockchain in the case of some miners produced big blocks that other miners couldn’t accept. In order to solve the scalability problem caused by BTC’s block size limit, the Segregated Witness (SegWit) upgrade was proposed, with many crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Bitfinex , and GDAX exchange having already accepted the upgrade.\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle":

Follow him on Twitter @bitentrepreneur.\nIt’s another hard fork day! Today, Bitcoin Cash is creating a new blockchain with 32 MB block size limits and added smart-contract functionality. This is the third hard fork that the Bitcoin Cash community has undergone in under a year, and declares their undeterred commitment to change whatever necessary to grow their blockchain’s transaction abilities. Bitcoin Cash strives to provide an inexpensive and fast medium of exchange for everyday payments.\nA ‘hard’ fork refers to software changes that require the creation of a new blockchain from a previous one, whereas ‘soft’ forks can impute software updates without the creation of a new blockchain. A hard fork therefore is only implemented when there needs to be changes made at the most fundamental level of the blockchain architecture: the consensus protocol layer.\nBitcoin Cash was born out of a hard fork with Bitcoin’s blockchain last summer. After much debate amongst various parties of the Bitcoin ecosystem over how to scale the Bitcoin network, a group of developers organized under the name ABC Bitcoin, wrote the code for a hard fork to create a new blockchain with 8MB block limits. On August 1st, this new code was implemented to copy the entire Bitcoin block history onto a new network to begin mining its own transactions separately, as a distinct currency and under different mining parameters. Bitcoin Cash promises to be a peer to peer cash system. This system should be popular in areas where the traditional financial system has been unable to reach the unbanked.\nIn the case of last summer’s hard fork, not only was a new blockchain created, but also a new coin was introduced to the market to represent value exchanged on this new transaction ledger. However, not all hard forks create new coins. For example, Bitcoin Cash hard forked again last November to fix their algorithm adjusting mining difficulty because the network was producing wildly fluctuating hash rates.\nTo patch the system, various developer teams running different clients on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain agreed to implement a hard fork where they all copied the old ledger onto a new chain, with the software updated, and abandoned the old chain. Although technically November was also a ‘hard’ fork, it was obviously very different than the previous split in community generating not only a new blockchain, but also a new network, and a new coin. Another Bitcoin Cash hard fork took place on May 15 in an effort to quadruple the BCH block size and lay the groundwork for adding smart contracts.\nHowever, it shouldn’t be understated that blockchain developers, including Bitcoin Cash, treat hard forking with caution, it’s a delicate process with potentially serious financial consequences. Though while many in the community treat hard forking with outright fear, this is a key part of how Bitcoin Cash operates, so the Bitcoin Cash community is not afraid of hard forks.\nThis time around is more similar to the November hard fork, but slightly different. Today’s fork neither creates a new coin, nor does it correct an existing problem, but rather strictly innovates in two ways. The first major change is the tripling of the block size limit from 8 to 32 MB that is a forward-looking adjustment to accommodate greater transaction throughput per block. I feel better that this block size growth is occurring now, while the usage of Bitcoin Cash still has a ways to grow, rather than later when the network is at full throttle.\nThis the larger block size gives Bitcoin Cash some room to scale, something that other blockchains have been looking to tackle in other ways, e.g. Lightning Network and Proof of Stake. This makes Bitcoin Cash somewhat unique because it attempts to solve the scaling problem at the consensus protocol layer while maintaining the Proof of Work model.\nHowever, larger blocks won’t in effect grow the network in terms of usage. It does however provide the ability for unprecedented growth. Growth in usage depends not on the block size but more on the community and businesses supporting Bitcoin Cash. Products, services and merchant adoption are key. After the block-size increase, the next advancement that Bitcoin Cash is putting forward is to add new and re-enable old, previously inactivated, machine-scripting operation codes, or more simply ‘op-codes’, that give developers tools to create smart contracts.\nThese machine codes, called “Satoshi Op-codes” by the Bitcoin Cash community, allow developers to create different types of metadata implementations. By having the ability to call these functions, developers can create “colored coins” or representative tokens. These are tokens that can be tagged in a specific way to correspond to bonds, stocks, precious metals, commodities, and any physical or virtual object.\nIt is hard to say what might come out from this new functionality, but if we base our assumptions on what Ethereum has been able to accomplish from its second layer implementations, then I believe it will give Bitcoin Cash a lot of space for creative and productive ideas to blossom. To that end, we will shall have to see what the developers of the Bitcoin Cash community do with these new functionalities, and if the market decides to settle in this newfound block size that has yet be driven to scale.\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in the article are solely that of the author and do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to CCN.\nImages from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://hacked.com/continue-reading"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alejandro de la torre", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T02:47:22.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bc753cb4dfc45a67332fcfa4869b562f25690b04", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ3mFWHy3HzDbCefHuYL_t.LLYyBQo91.0FH7b_5n9rR28lbQdFw1DPg9bO.Tc.zu9ze7yfTi7avlgWzFumfAi6", "site_full": "qarikature.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://qarikature.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Technology Tec", "title": "Convert bitcoins to Paypal", "title_full": "Convert bitcoins to Paypal", "published": "2018-05-16T00:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bc753cb4dfc45a67332fcfa4869b562f25690b04", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ3mFWHy3HzDbCefHuYL_t.LLYyBQo91.0FH7b_5n9rR28lbQdFw1DPg9bO.Tc.zu9ze7yfTi7avlgWzFumfAi6", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Anonymous (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-16T00:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Convert bitcoins to Paypal", "text": "Convert bitcoins to Paypal\nThe best website to convert bitcoin to PayPal\nWe are providing the exchange service to our clients.

BTC.com consists of a team of 60+ employees in Amsterdam and Beijing, and built an open-source mining pool and wallet, which help to further build Bitcoin’s decentralized ecosystem.\nBTC.com provides an interesting perspective on the fork, as it was recently acquired by Bitmain , a Beijing-based bitcoin miner, designer of ASIC chips, and operator of one of the largest Bitcoin mining pools.\nThe proposed fork would increase Bitcoin Cash’s block size from 8MB to 32MB, and will also enable developers to build smart contracts on top of the Bitcoin Cash network. Alejandro de la Torre\nAlejandro noted differences between the 2017 hard fork and the one today.\nThis time around is more similar to the November hard fork, but slightly different. Today’s fork neither creates a new coin, nor does it correct an existing problem, but rather strictly innovates in two ways. The first major change is the tripling of the block size limit from 8 to 32 MB that is a forward-looking adjustment to accommodate greater transaction throughput per block. I feel better that this block size growth is occurring now, while the usage of Bitcoin Cash still has a ways to grow, rather than later when the network is at full throttle.\nThis the larger block size gives Bitcoin Cash some room to scale, something that other blockchains have been looking to tackle in other ways, e.g. Lightning Network and Proof of Stake. This makes Bitcoin Cash somewhat unique because it attempts to solve the scaling problem at the consensus protocol layer while maintaining the Proof of Work model.\nWhy Bitcoin Cash and not another coin? What will this fork accomplish that Bitcoin Cash can’t?\nBTC.com is coin agnostic. We are not trying to say that you should buy Bitcoin Cash over another coin. We have an opinion over some of the benefits that the new product features enable.\nFor example, the block size limit increase gives Bitcoin Cash the largest block size limit of any of the big coins. This comes with some potential risks that the Bitcoin Core team warned against back in the days of the SegWit hard fork, but the fact remains that the easiest way to scale the Bitcoin network using Proof of Work is to increase the block size limit to allow more transactions per block.\nThe second main feature that we see as being beneficial to the Bitcoin Cash development community is the enabling of new and some old op-codes that permit colored tokens, second-layer automated processes, and smart-contract scripting.\nWhat are the drawbacks of constantly increasing the block size?\nThe block size was originally restricted to prevent DDOS attacks from clogging the network. Therefore, in theory larger block sizes can be more vulnerable to spamming attack.\nHow will the smart contracts function?\nAfter the block-size increase, the next advancement that Bitcoin Cash is putting forward is to add new and re-enable old, previously inactivated, machine-scripting operation codes, or more simply ‘op-codes’, that give developers tools to create smart contracts.\nThese machine codes, called “Satoshi Op-codes” by the Bitcoin Cash community, allow developers to create different types of metadata implementations. By having the ability to call these functions, developers can create “colored coins” or representative tokens. These are tokens that can be tagged in a specific way to correspond to bonds, stocks, precious metals, commodities, and any physical or virtual object. Final Thoughts\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently the 4th largest token with a market cap of around $23.3B.\nIt will be interesting to see how the Bitcoin Cash hard fork unfolds, and hopefully more scandal-free than the first Bitcoin Cash push.\nTime will tell if this proposed hard fork is able to offer faster transaction speeds, lower costs, as well as a smart contract feature, and earn a high level of usability among developers, miners, and users.\nAlejandro comments with a grounded optimism, “It is hard to say what might come out from this new functionality, but if we base our assumptions on what Ethereum has been able to accomplish from its second layer implementations, then I believe it will give Bitcoin Cash a lot of space for creative and productive ideas to blossom. To that end, we will have to see what the developers of the Bitcoin Cash community do with these new functionalities and if the market decides to settle in this newfound block size that has yet be driven to scale.”", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://coincentral.com/bitmain-history-projects-scandals/", "http://www.btc.com/", "https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/04/24/bitmain-antpool-artificially-boosting-bitcoin-cash-bch-price/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitmain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alejandro de la torre", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amsterdam", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T01:27:42.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c45a6b4928b6b4e2211714effb6049d1bb11ff25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhPONXBuCU.Bmvdv6T8L16TM-", "site_full": "bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "https://bitcoinnewsonline.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Bitcoin News Online", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "title_full": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-16T00:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c45a6b4928b6b4e2211714effb6049d1bb11ff25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR9FVz94Zxt2gEzeXym7GFz4XGe0LOq0soJOgRQTWrtu_._46xrYfawnep4aH9JeLje.Cic2UXVhPONXBuCU.Bmvdv6T8L16TM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Whimes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2018-05-16T00:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Alert - bitcoin", "text": "bitcoin As-it-happens update ⋅ May 15, 2018 NEWS Bitcoin fans troll Warren Buffett with 'Rat Poison Squared' clothing line MarketWatch 'We don't know exactly what 'rat poison squared' is supposed to mean.

The company has about 15 percent share of the global market for bitcoin mining chips and computer equipment, trailing Chinese rival Bitmain, according to a February report from Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.\nCanaan, founded in 2013, sells computer equipment under the “Avalon” brand with fast customized chips that win digital coins by solving complex math problems. The company’s hardware often ends up in remote locales housing large mining pools that depend on cheap electricity, Co-Chairman Jianping Kong said in an April interview.\n#lazy-img-327766081:before{padding-top:66.64 %;}\nCanaan Creative co-chairman Jianping Kong, right, with founder and CEO N.G. Zhang in April.\nPhotographer: Billy H.C. Kwok/Bloomberg\nThe company also announced last year it was developing dedicated chips for use in artificial intelligence applications.\nNo final decisions have been made, and details of the offering could change, the people said. Kong, the Canaan co-chairman, declined to comment on details of the IPO preparations.\nCanaan was preparing last year to list on China’s National Equities Exchange and Quotations, an over-the-counter market known as the New Third Board, before opting to pursue a Hong Kong IPO.\nIn 2016, electrical equipment manufacturer Shandong Luyitong Intelligent Electric Plc attempted to acquire Canaan, according to filings at the time.

However, the data inside the ledger is not since:\nWe define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures.\nThe question that came in my head is if it would be possible to create another appendix since the one from Blockstream isn't unanimously loved.

VCloud Mining is a bitcoin mining program based on hosted technology, and unlike competition, has introduced just the features that both new and experienced miners would love. Digital currencies such as Bitcoin are ‘mined’, not physically, but by using computing power (called hash rate) to solve complex mathematical problems. Bitcoin cloud mining is a legal activity, and is the other alternative to buying and trading cryptocurrencies. Since it is practically worthless today to use desktops and graphics cards to mine Bitcoin, investors and crypto fans use hosted mining services such as VCloud Mining, where they can buy hash power, rent equipment and see their dollars convert into digital gold. VCloud Mining has introduced some novel features to make bitcoin mining even more enticing and profitable. Instead of renting, investors actually own the mining hardware and chips, thus keeping full control. The mining platform is open 24/7, and offers a life-time contract, unlike one or two year contracts offered elsewhere. All hardware is maintained and kept in the US in optimal working conditions for maximum performance. “ The profitability of mining depends on hash power, and VCloud Mining offers a global mining pool that works on more power so as to mine more Bitcoins at a faster rate. All Bitcoin rewards are distributed daily into the investor’s wallet ,” said a spokesperson for VCloud Mining. The lifetime, open ended contract offered by VCloud Mining gives investors ownership of ASIC chips at a specified hash rate. Rewards continue to be delivered as long as mining stays profitable, and investors have the option of getting the ASIC hardware shipped to them by paying a s/h fee. VCloud Mining has also included MLM marketing into its platform, and the Bitcoin Affiliate program partners earn recurring commissions for bringing in new clients without having to invest. As a brand new company, VCloud Mining is looking forward to a period of scaling up, co-locating its mining hardware at other places around the world.

It’s transparent, immutable, distributed and doesn’t require that a single administrator or group of administrators be trusted.\nIt also provides more value than just the foundation for a type of currency, said Kylen McClintock, founder of Blockchain for Sustainable Development.\nPossible social good applications include peer to peer lending, digital identities (ideal for refugees), protection against runaway inflation, campaign finance reform, direct democratic votes, solar energy trading and freedom of speech free from censorship.\nThe social impacts of blockchain are numerous, but several local adopters already are considering ways to use blockchain for social good. Native Token is a company that provides a protocol for community economics. People can join a network, called a Tribe, for a cause they care about. The Tribes are backed by their community members, which are in turn in possession of tokens. Tokens are generated through completing tasks. Tribes are also backed by a reserve of tokens and have a development fund that can be spent on projects. Native has a liquidity pool of Ether and Bancor Network Tokens, which provide the convertibility for their in-house tokens. The Distributed Giving Project is a Denver-based initiative that gives cryptocurrency to the homeless so that it can be spent on goods. The project was started by Sasha Shtern, who wanted a way to give directly to homeless teens, rather than have them wait in line for food at a shelter they might not be able to get to, but realized there’s a belief that when given money those who are homeless will spend it on things other than food and necessities. A small pilot incentivized members of the Denver Rescue Mission’s recovery program to continue in the program by giving them $10 of Bitcoin every other day and found a food mart that would accept Bitcoin. The project is now considering a phase two, where they create their own cryptocurrency. The plan would be that nonprofits helping the homeless that have partnered with DGP would incentivize behavior by providing the DGP cryptocurrency. The homeless could spend that on goods and services at vendors, who in turn would be getting a new revenue stream they didn’t previously have. DGP cryptocurrency would have a one to one ratio with the dollar, and dollars would be provided by donors who were looking for a safe secure way to provide money to the homeless, as all purchases would be tracked on the DGP ledger.

They are mining ‘digital gold’, or cryptocurrencies, and helping them succeed (think ‘moon’ and ‘lambo’) is the newly launched mining program, VCloud Mining . VCloud Mining is a bitcoin mining program based on hosted technology, and unlike competition, has introduced just the features that both new and experienced miners would love. Digital currencies such as Bitcoin are ‘mined’, not physically, but by using computing power (called hash rate) to solve complex mathematical problems. Bitcoin cloud mining is a legal activity, and is the other alternative to buying and trading cryptocurrencies. Since it is practically worthless today to use desktops and graphics cards to mine Bitcoin, investors and crypto fans use hosted mining services such as VCloud Mining, where they can buy hash power, rent equipment and see their dollars convert into digital gold. VCloud Mining has introduced some novel features to make bitcoin mining even more enticing and profitable. Instead of renting, investors actually own the mining hardware and chips, thus keeping full control. The mining platform is open 24/7, and offers a life-time contract, unlike one or two year contracts offered elsewhere. All hardware is maintained and kept in the US in optimal working conditions for maximum performance. “ The profitability of mining depends on hash power, and VCloud Mining offers a global mining pool that works on more power so as to mine more Bitcoins at a faster rate. All Bitcoin rewards are distributed daily into the investor’s wallet ,” said a spokesperson for VCloud Mining. The lifetime, open ended contract offered by VCloud Mining gives investors ownership of ASIC chips at a specified hash rate. Rewards continue to be delivered as long as mining stays profitable, and investors have the option of getting the ASIC hardware shipped to them by paying a s/h fee. VCloud Mining has also included MLM marketing into its platform, and the Bitcoin Affiliate program partners earn recurring commissions for bringing in new clients without having to invest. As a brand new company, VCloud Mining is looking forward to a period of scaling up, co-locating its mining hardware at other places around the world. There is a free sign up, and plenty of choices for miners and investors when it comes to attractive deals and packages, ranging from a free affiliate account to the life-time Platinum package.

Now, a new court filing has thrown a wrench into a recent high-stakes lawsuit that attempts to shed light on the mysterious origins of the cryptocurrency.\nThe new amended complaint submitted late Monday in the ongoing case of Kleiman v.

Here's a run down of everything you've missed so far from the biggest yearly event in Bitcoin.

We are working to reduce the wait time.\"\nIt's not just Consensus which is bringing the crowds of course, with this week the first Blockchain Week New York .

That volatility has seen the Bitcoin price climb to almost $20,000 per coin late last year before more than halving just a couple of months later.\nBullard told the Consensus audience:\nYou've got this kind of special problem of who's going to issue the currency and what are those promises about future issuance and can you really maintain the credibility of those promises. If you can't, the value of your currency is going to zero the same way the Venezuelan bolivar has.\nBullard also played down the possibility the U.S. Fed will introduce its own digital currency.\nConsensus 2018: Joe Lubin and Jimmy Song made a bet about the future of blockchain tech\nJimmy Song, a partner at Blockchain Capital, and Joe Lubin, the founder of the Ethereum startup studio Consensys (not to be confused with this event), took part in a fiery on stage debate yesterday which ended in a bet over the future of blockchain tech.\nSong, sceptical about the potential benefits of many of the blockchain applications paraded at Consensus, said they all sound to him like \"magical blockchain dust\".\nSong said: \"I don't really see much of this stuff gaining much traction. Bitcoin is the real innovation here.\"\nLubin went to bat for blockchain, challenging Song: \"I'll bet you any amount of bitcoin that you're wrong.\"\nThe details of the bet -- which the pair shook on -- are still to be worked out, it seems, but Song should probably note that Lubin is worth between $1 billion and $5 billion, according to Forbes .\nConsensus 2018: Former JPMorgan Chase bankers are starting over\nAmber Baldet and Patrick Mylund Nielsen, two former JPMorgan Chase bankers, announced their latest venture: Clovyr, billed as a \"pragmatic connection between enterprise and public chains\".\nLubin and Song's bet was made as a direct result of Baldet's Clovyr demo, which must have been awkward.\nBaldet, the former head of blockchain projects at the US bank, told Fortune Clovyr will act as something of an app store for decentralised apps and services.\nClovyr is currently raising funds from investors.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/14/new-york-cryptocurrency-conference-triples-in-size-tracking-for-17-million-in-ticket-sales.html", "http://fortune.com/2018/05/14/blockchain-jpmorgan-chase-amber-baldet-clovyr/", "https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/989528945195237376", "https://www.coindesk.com/fedex-moves-forward-blockchain-logistics-plans/", "https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2018/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T18:37:13.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "68ec633044638456de621041b1d3c7a6837989d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS6L7nbyxruQOZJAYWthW8U-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Speculation", "title": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "title_full": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "published": "2018-05-15T23:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "68ec633044638456de621041b1d3c7a6837989d6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS6L7nbyxruQOZJAYWthW8U-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bitChipper", "published": "2018-05-15T23:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Wall Observer BTC/USD - Bitcoin price movement tracking & discussion", "text": "Quote: from: bitChipper on Today at 03:09:43 PM The addition of 3 new assets on Gemini and being licensed by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) shows Gemini is making a wider spectrum of crypto available to institutional investors, also they offer custody of the institutions investments which has been a big concern for many.\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2018/05/14/winklevoss-brothers-bitcoin-exchange-adds-zcash/#54449efc6b98\nToday another news article was released in regards to coinbase offering 4 new services that will include a custody service for institutional investors.\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/15/coinbase-bets-big-on-institutional-investors.html\nI don't think its a coincidence that both of these big name crypto exchanges are pin pointing their target market to attract institutional clients, it really does show that there is interest from big money investors.

Did you know that if you send them a reply, and you explicitly say that some part is off the record, that's explicitly on the record unless you go through a request/approve dance first?\"\nConsensus 2018: FedEx CEO calls blockchain the next \"big disruption\"\nFred Smith, chairman and chief executive of the U.S. logistic giant FedEx, yesterday said : \"Blockchain has the potential to completely revolutionize what's across the border.\"\nLogistics is thought to be one of the industries that blockchain tech could be most effective in, with increased efficiency and transparency improving the system from warehousing, to delivery, to payment.\nSmith has previously signalled his interest in blockchain, with FedEx joining the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) earlier this year .\nAccording to Smith, countries' different standards, regulations and terminologies cause a \"massive amount of friction\" in cross-border logistics and blockchain's \"chain of custody\" might be able to help.\nConsensus 2018: Bullard isn't so bullish on Bitcoin", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/14/new-york-cryptocurrency-conference-triples-in-size-tracking-for-17-million-in-ticket-sales.html", "https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/989528945195237376", "https://www.coindesk.com/fedex-moves-forward-blockchain-logistics-plans/", "https://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2018/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T03:17:23.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1db3bbce4c7b8bef1e54d0db691f05dd8f6ac6a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5uVLlyanVHNtYx2k38Oj6rlio7zjT2tUZJkS70sspZXPUD0DfKYG4e1gRIWWWB0cloKdgiYf.dOnV6CVQqz0RVFDCr3grL7k.08JTwXYf8MEr374mRdtzSnNuuRC6jwZcrMMywSjGrrH", "site_full": "cryptogeeks.com", "site": "cryptogeeks.com", "site_section": "http://cryptogeeks.com/news/feed", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin: Gemini Still Does Not Support Segwit despite Claiming to be Segwit Ready for almost a year now", "title_full": "Bitcoin: Gemini Still Does Not Support Segwit despite Claiming to be Segwit Ready for almost a year now", "published": "2018-05-15T23:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1db3bbce4c7b8bef1e54d0db691f05dd8f6ac6a9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jc3bkwbK4jO5uVLlyanVHNtYx2k38Oj6rlio7zjT2tUZJkS70sspZXPUD0DfKYG4e1gRIWWWB0cloKdgiYf.dOnV6CVQqz0RVFDCr3grL7k.08JTwXYf8MEr374mRdtzSnNuuRC6jwZcrMMywSjGrrH", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "newsbot", "published": "2018-05-15T23:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin: Gemini Still Does Not Support Segwit despite Claiming to be Segwit Ready for almost a year now", "text": " ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://purl.org/dc/terms/", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#", "http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T23:25:10.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2a2bc42cc4ce11f45c972b4dcba01a1961b51420", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY1yfFtVd3J8a9KSuwOtKSlJLxz8pUxOr4HKnnQO8ZOtXamLOnIxZ0oROxDYKyRsag1mIAW6uGyysQHzanARFMiqglS5Udxjz0-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin -
