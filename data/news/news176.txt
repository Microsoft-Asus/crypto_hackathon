During the first three weeks of May, fraudsters copied our pages, including profile photos, to push Ether swindles onto our 17,000 collective followers. And in spite of multiple requests to Twitter Inc. to have them removed, at least one of our doppelgängers—and a host of other bot-driven fakes targeting individuals and companies—are still out there offering unbelievable deals. “Setting up a bot is easy-peasy,” says Roger Kay, president of Endpoint Technologies Associates. “The sign-up probably takes longer than the programming.”\nTwitter is a hotbed of crypto gossip and one of the preferred places for promoters to hawk their products, so it makes sense that scammers are crowding onto the platform. We discovered @LilyKatz5 first, after the impostor tweeted at the real account’s followers with a promise of up to 100 Ether to anyone who sent in a small quantity of cryptocurrency. Twitter shut down the copycat once Lily uploaded a photo of her passport as proof of her identity, but that’s a step many privacy-minded users don’t feel comfortable taking.\nThen the digital grifters got smarter: Two weeks later, another fraudster using Lily’s photo and name, with the handle @subidetu4692 , first blocked her so she wouldn’t see the tweets, then spammed her followers with too-good-to-be-true Ether offers. Lily didn’t know about the tweets until a fellow reporter alerted her. A quick look at the blockchain suggests that the scammer has made progress; the account linked to @subidetu4692 received Ether in 10 separate transactions over the past couple of weeks, typically in amounts of 0.5 to 1.\nOlga discovered her evil twin on May 10, when @o1gakharif tweeted at her to try to reach her followers, touting Ether offers. She twice notified Twitter on its website but didn’t feel comfortable sharing personal documents online to prove her identity. Neither did Lily on her second go-round. We’ve both since worked with Twitter to become verified without having to share our private documents. Twitter suspended the second counterfeit Lily account on May 22, about a week after it first tweeted scams targeted at her followers. Olga’s spoof account was still up as of that date.\nElon Musk and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin are among the more prominent public figures targeted by the bot army. Since cryptocurrencies have grabbed the public’s attention, Twitter has become a free forum for people to hype their offerings, says the Texas State Securities Board’s Joe Rotunda, whose enforcement division is cracking down on scammers. “Promoters of cryptocurrency offerings typically don’t employ a sales force,” he says. “The business model simply doesn’t contemplate boiler rooms and call centers, where telemarketers frantically dial for dollars.”\nAs day traders and newbies sift through posts to try to find the next coin that will surge 1,000 percent in a week, screaming headlines can grab them, and the fear of missing out may lead to poor choices. And unlike credit card transactions or most other payments, coin transfers usually can’t be reversed, says Luke McNamara, a principal analyst at FireEye Inc. “This is a space where individuals are responsible for their own security,” he says. “That’s why we’ve seen so many bad actors gravitating into this space.” There isn’t much hard data to quantify the extent of the spoofing, but Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research, estimates the rate of phishing likely reaches up to 5 percent of all crypto-related conversations on Twitter.\nTwitter says it’s aware of the problem and is working on fixes, according to an email from a spokesman. Over the past few months the company has cracked down on bots by limiting users’ ability to perform coordinated posts across multiple accounts, which could mean a bot is at work. At the Consensus 2018 conference in May, crypto entrepreneur Elizabeth Stark jokingly warned Twitter Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey onstage that she wasn’t giving away any free Ether. He promised her the company is “trying to fight scams.”\nIndividuals are doing their part, too. Buterin has since inserted a disclaimer into his handle stating he’s not giving away Ether. Many cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase, have also issued warnings. But some observers say Twitter, looking to hold on to its average 336 million monthly active users, may not have enough incentive to dump the fakers. “My impression is that Twitter could do much more,” says Endpoint Technologies’ Kay. “The problem is that cleaning up the platform is detrimental to its business model.” To address problems of spam and bots, Twitter has made more than 30 changes to its product, policies, and operations in the past 16 months, and its systems are already identifying and reviewing more than 6 million suspicious accounts per week, said an email from the company.\nPeople like Zooko Wilcox want to see more help from Twitter in the war on bots. “It’s not something we can solve ourselves,” says the founder of Zcash Co., which supports the network running the Zcash token. He too has been impersonated by scammers, and as he sees it, the process for getting rid of them is too invasive and time-consuming, and it’s too easy for them to create more bogus handles. In the meantime, don’t send anyone Ether on our say-so; it’s definitely a scam.

The U.S. agencies may define digital currency owners as a ‘security risk’ in order to protect foreign and domestic classified information.\nAlso read: BCH Miners Discuss Funding Development With a Fraction of Block Rewards If You Own Bitcoin and Have U.S. Security Clearance Then You Might Have a Problem\nAmerican bureaucrats are deliberating on whether or not they should flag cryptocurrency investors who have special security clearances to classified government information. An individual who owns a cryptocurrency like bitcoin or ethereum, may be considered “risky” in the eyes of the Pentagon. This past February the Defense Security Service (DSS) and the Pentagon revealed they were working on guidelines for reporting cryptocurrency ownership. According to another report published on May 22, the debate is currently being argued and government contractors are already upset about the backlog of other security clearance issues.\nA director for Financial Services Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University, Param Vir Singh, believes cryptocurrencies do have security risks.\n“There are a lot of good things about cryptocurrencies, but at the same time there are these security risks,” explained Param Vir Singh this week.\nThink about a knife: It could be used for good things and it can be used for bad things as well. DSS Recommends Cryptocurrency Owners With Security Clearance Should Report Their Virtual Currency Holdings\nFurther, the columnist Adam Reese recently reviewed an email by a DSS employee named Chad M. Campbell — which indicates that the security specialist recommends individuals who apply for U.S. security clearance need to report their cryptocurrency holdings on the agency’s Standard Form 86 (SF86). Additionally, the reporter received a reply from Defense Security Service Public Affairs which stated:\n“DSS has fielded a number of questions from industry as to whether ownership of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, should be reported by cleared persons or security clearance applicants,” explains the Defense Department.\nThere is no current Department of Defense guidance related to the reporting of ownership of cryptocurrencies. DSS is working with DoD policy offices for further clarification and once such guidance is issued, DSS will ensure the widest dissemination to industry. Additionally, the email [Campbell’s email] was an internal discussion document which was not intended to serve as policy guidance. University of California Researcher: ‘Bitcoin Owners Deserve Suspicion’\nIndividuals and organizations see the security clearance/cryptocurrency discussion as a controversial subject as opinions differ depending on who is discussing the matter. Steve Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists believes holding cryptocurrencies or other behaviors don’t necessarily make a person risky. “I don’t know if the government has a clear understanding of what makes a person actually a security risk — Instead they look at proxy factors like excessive debt, drug use and contact with the criminal justice system, which don’t necessarily translate to risk,” Aftergood explains.\nHowever, a researcher at the University of California, Nicholas Weaver, disagrees and thinks digital currency holders should be suspects. “Since Bitcoin’s only real use is to buy drugs, etc., it deserves suspicion,” Weaver said this week. It’s also worth noting that some of these DSS and Pentagon officials who firmly believe cryptocurrencies are a ‘security risk’ have no problem with defense contractors who shill centralized blockchains. The DSS is not calling blockchain projects sponsored by Booze Hamilton Allen or the company’s employees suspicious — Nope just bitcoin and public blockchains seem to be a threat at the moment.\nWhat do you think about the DSS and Pentagon’s discussion about bitcoin classification and raising suspicion against cryptocurrency owners?

The founder and CEO of cryptocurrency trading firm, BKCM LLC envisages an increase in the value of the most popular bitcoin fork. Value Creation will Drive Price Increase\nSpeaking to CNBC , Kelly predicted an impending bull run for Bitcoin Cash. He based his assertions on the decisions reached during the recent meeting of Bitcoin Cash miners in Hong Kong. The miners agreed to set aside as much as five percent of the block reward for mining towards funding Bitcoin Cash development projects.\nAccording to Kelly, this decisions by the miners is a positive development for Bitcoin Cash, saying :\nThat’s how blockchains gain value. You’re going to be getting more use cases to the extent that usefulness translates into value. That could be a positive for Bitcoin Cash.\nThe BKCM CEO expects the increase in use cases of the Bitcoin Cash blockchain to drive prices up. With more utility on the blockchain, developers will be incentivized to create useful solutions that run on the network. Thus, Kelly thinks now is the time for traders to consider Bitcoin Cash seriously. The crypto has surged from $760 in April to crossing the $1,000 threshold in May, reaching a high of $1,600 on May 6. The Bitcoin Cash Development Fund\nThe fund is aimed at supporting programmers who develop useful protocols on top of the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. During the meeting a few days ago, the top figures in the Bitcoin Cash community including Calvin Ayre and Roger Ver tabled discussions about the funding mechanism for the initiative. Apart from the percentage block rewards contribution, participants also agreed to a voting process to determine what projects to implement. The decision to adopt a treasury model for accruing donations for the development fund bears a striking resemblance to the one used by Dash developers.\nNo decision has been made on the specific percentage to be used for the donations. However, a simple analysis shows that a one percent block reward contribution amounts to about $650,000 per month on average, provided Bitcoin Cash prices do not fall below $1,200. At the time of writing this article, BCH prices have declined by six percent in the last 24 hours.\nDo you agree with Brian Kelly’s analysis that more use cases will provide value for BCH thus driving prices upward? Will the Bitcoin Cash Development Fund initiative lead to the creation of intuitive protocol solutions on the BCH blockchain?

A wave of panic selling seems to have washed across crypto land once again and markets have hemorrhaged $27 billion in 24 hours. Bitcoin has plummeted below the psychological $8k barrier and shed 4.6% on the day trading at $7,930 at the moment. Further losses look inevitable. Altcoins as usual have all collapsed, many losing double figures in the last few hours. Only one is in the green in the top 50 at the time of writing and that coin is Zcash.\nCoinmarketcap is reporting a paltry gain of 2.8% on ZEC but it is a gain nevertheless while all around it have crashed. Zcash is currently trading at $330, up from $319 this time yesterday. On the week there have been no gains as this coin was trading at the same level last Wednesday. The monthly picture shows a gain of 22% for ZEC from $270 this time last month. Since Bitcoin has fallen below $8k ZEC is up 8% at 4166700 satoshis from 3855000 sats this time yesterday. Over the month Zcash has gained 35% on BTC from 3075000 satoshis this time last month.\nThe Gemini Exchange support gave this coin its initial boost on May 14 and trading was made available on the 19 th . According to the blog Zcash has invested in Agoric, which is a Javascript based programming layer. Zooko Wilcox, CEO of Zcash said, “This founding team are pioneers of some of the fundamental science of secure programming and distributed systems. And, some of them are my personal friends and mentors who have been among the biggest influences on my scientific career.” Zcash Company invests in Agoric to build better and more secure, javascript-based smart contracts. https://t.co/lZOp10yWBM\n— Zcash Company (@zcashco) May 21, 2018\nZcash is traded across a range of exchanges with Bitfinex and Binance being the two most popular. Trade volume over the past 24 hours has doubled from $85 million to over $170 million. Market cap for ZEC currently stands at $1.3 billion positioning it at 21 st in the charts.\nOverall crypto markets have plunged 6.4% in the past 24 hours to $353 billion, bearish pressure is still strong so further losses are looking likely. All altcoins have been hammered today with Cardano, Monero, Bytecoin and Icon taking the biggest hits.\nMore on Zcash can be found here: https://z.cash/\nFOMO Moments is a section that takes a daily look at the top 25 altcoins during the Asian trading session and analyses the best performing one, looking for trends and possible fundamentals.

Back then, following an identical crossover in June 2014, the cryptocurrency subsequently dropped by 70 percent (from $580 to $166) in the seven months leading up to January 2015.\nThis time around, the bearish crossover will likely occur at the turn of the month, if bitcoin extends the current decline towards the $7,000 mark, and would open the doors for a deeper sell-off towards the $5,000 mark. Monthly chart\nCurrently, the five-month MA is seen at $8,916 and the 10-month MA is located at $8,379, according to Bitfinex data. Meanwhile, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,820 - down almost 5 percent in the last 24 hours. Daily chart\nThe observed lower-highs and lower-lows pattern (marked by circles) and the downward sloping 5-day and 10-day MAs indicate a bearish setup. The chart also shows a bearish crossover between the 10-day and 50-day MAs.\nFurther, the relative strength index (RSI) is below 50.00 (in the bearish territory), but holding well above 30.00 (oversold territory), indicating enough room for a sell-off towards $7,000. Weekly chart\nAcceptance below the 50-week MA, currently seen at $7,620, would only bolster the already bearish daily chart technicals and increase the odds of the bearish five-month/10-month MA crossover.\nThe 50-week MA worked as a strong support in April, so a break below that level could yield a sharp sell-off. View BTC risks deeper pullback towards $7,000. In such a case, the 5-month MA will cross the 10-month MA from above, signaling a bearish crossover and opening doors for a drop to $5,000. Bullish scenario : A solid rebound from the 50-week MA at $7,620 and a convincing break above $8,644 would signal a bullish reversal.\nDown arrow image via Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T12:02:11.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "435f1d5cc8db67de35c8eeb2c7241f9783d2ffca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS0DxTrdU_LyyyZ9RI77kHMI-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoins", "title_full": "Bitcoins", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.062, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "435f1d5cc8db67de35c8eeb2c7241f9783d2ffca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS0DxTrdU_LyyyZ9RI77kHMI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoins", "text": "Our Bitcoins address is: 19mhZ6NVW3Xbge1Zjkxy31VVEQ9LNWRwNr\nWe will upgrade your Pastebin account to a LIFETIME PRO account if you transfer $30 USD worth of bitcoin, or more.\n1.

This feature is different than an index fund in a few crucial ways, perhaps most importantly being available to everyday investors not just the rich and trading professionals.\nAlso Read: Economics Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller Examines Bitcoin in Historical Context Buy the Market Circle Internet Financial Ltd., the Goldman Sachs-backed Boston-headquartered company that acquired Poloniex earlier this year, has announced a new feature on Tuesday called “Buy the Market.” It allows users to buy seven assets at once including BTC, BCH, ETH, ETC, LTC, ZEC and XMR. Aiming for simplicity, all a user has to do to create a crypto portfolio with this feature is to enter the amount of USD they want to invest and the app will automatically calculate and distribute the investment sum according to each asset’s market cap.\nThis type of automatic or passive management investment tool will most likely be compared to existing crypto index funds. However, it is different in a few ways as it is just a technical feature allowing to buy a number of assets at once with one click not a real fund. These include no management fees, no re-balancing when market caps change, and a very accessible minimum investment sum of just $1. Better Than Crypto Index Funds?\nWhen comparing to crypto index funds such as those offered by Coinbase or Bitwise , the first thing to pop out is that the new Circle feature is available to all its normal users, not just to so called accredited investors. To be considered an accredited investor in the US, an individual must first report to the SEC that they have a net worth of at least $1,000,000 excluding the value of their primary residence or have a yearly income of at least $200,000. And companies need to have total assets in excess of $5 million or be recognized as a bank, insurance company, business development company, or registered investment company.\nCircle’s Rachel Mayer commented: “This is one of the first experiences of its kind for consumers. Other crypto products that allow you to invest in market weight distributed fashion are accompanied by high minimums and 3% management fees. Circle Invest removes all this friction, making investing in multiple coins at once available for anyone at the same competitive pricing we deliver on all of our coins.” Only last week Circle announced it had raised $110 million in a Series E fundraising round led by the Chinese firm Bitmain Technologies. It now looks it intends to use this money to expand its services in more ways than just issuing a new Tether alternative, like challenging index fund providers.\nWould you prefer using such a feature over investing in a crypto index fund?

Regulatory Moves Impact Bitcoin’s Price And it’s not just Bitcoin, many other top cryptocurrencies were also in the red today despite bullish calls that coin prices would soar following major blockchain events in New York City that have been taking place over the past week. Some in the cryptosphere have pointed to recent regulatory news as the key driver of the sell-off. This Monday, financial authorities in the U.S. and Canada announced a cooperative crackdown on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and other cryptocurrency investment schemes, led by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA). More than 40 state and provincial watchdogs are participating in ‘Operation Cryptosweep,’ which has triggered at least 70 investigations so far . “This [Operation Cryptosweep] cleaned out a lot of the bad projects,” said CNBC’s Brian Kelly. “That has people a little concerned, and is a short-term hit to sentiment.” Moving forward though, Kelly points out that these regulatory steps are all part of the maturation that the market needs in order to attract institutional investors. “The projects that they shut down they appear to be junk, they had a real reason to shut them down,” he said. This week’s crackdown from the NASAA comes amid growing attention from U.S regulators. Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) brought several fraud cases against operators of ICOs and also launched a website to help investors recognize ‘red flags’ when looking for cryptocurrency investment opportunities. Tom Lee Predicts Rebound Despite these recent price woes, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee still believes Bitcoin will reach $25,000. In an email to CNBC , Lee attributed today’s drop to ‘typical crypto volatility.’ He also identified three key factors that have him believing the coin will more than triple its current value moving forward. The first is related to the cost of producing and replicating the cryptocurrency. When Bitcoin was trading at around $8,000 yesterday, Lee appeared on CNBC’s ‘Futures Now,’ where he expressed the belief that the digital currency was actually ‘trading at cost’ because the price of production was actually around that number. With this, it is likely Lee is referring to recent data from Morgan Stanley that puts the Bitcoin mining profitability at just over $8,000. This means that if miners want to turn a profit, the coin in theory has to stay above this number. Lee’s second factor relates to the catalyst that institutional investors will bring to the cryptocurrency space. “I think institutional investors have gained a lot of interest, and they haven’t really come into crypto yet because there is still some regulatory uncertainty,” he said. Lee’s third factor relates to data compiled by Fundstrat, which show a historical trend that has him encouraging investors to hold onto the coin. “Historically, 10 days comprise all the performance in any single year of bitcoin’s price,” he said. “If you just took out those 10 days, bitcoin’s down 25 percent a year.” Lee continued: “So as miserable as it feels holding bitcoin at $8,000, the move from $8,000 to $25,000 will happen in a handful of days.” Featured image from Shutterstock.

As a cryptocurrency, Bitcoin only exists due to its revolutionary blockchain technology which creates a self-contained giant ledger keeping track of all transactions with 100% accuracy and without a third party. In the cryptocurrency economy, Bitcoin Cash has become a highly sought-after digital currency over the past few months and seems to be gaining support and momentum all the time.\nMany people have used the peer-to-peer trading platform Shapeshift to trade Bitcoin (BTC) for Bitcoin Cash (BCH). In the recent past, the Bitcoin Cash network has managed to accumulate a massive amount of support and infrastructure. FEATURES OF BITCOIN CASH Bitcoin Cash has a much larger block size (8MB) than Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash has a different transaction signature as well as wipeout and replay protection. If the hash rate is low, Bitcoin Cash can quickly adjust the difficulty of its proof-of-work. Bitcoin Cash network fees are cheaper than those of most other blockchain networks. Moreover, the BCH network fees seem to be consistent, and they may remain low when the network upgrades to a 32MB block size. Hence, there will be plenty of room for cheap transactions. There is no need for BCH network users to rely on privacy-invasive techniques like transaction batching. ISSUES WITH BITCOIN’S TECHNOLOGY\nCompared to banks and credit card transactions, Bitcoin’s technology is said to be very slow, as it can process only seven transactions each second. Over 150 million transactions are handled by Visa every day, which is roughly equivalent to 1,700 transactions per second.\nBitcoin needs to scale and increase the speed of its transaction verification process, which is considered a central problem. There’s a solution to this problem. Either the amount of data verified in each block should be made smaller, or the blocks of data should be made larger. Transactions would thus be made cheaper and faster, and more transactions would be processed at one time. DIFFERING TRANSACTION FEES\nBitcoin’s transaction capacity is limited by its high fees, as a user’s transaction won’t be processed until he or she pays for it to go through. Otherwise, the transaction may get stuck for months, which is nothing short of frustrating for all parties involved.\nIn the case of Bitcoin Cash, this unbearable situation is not present. There’s plenty of space in the blocks, which assures that transaction fees are always low and there’s no chance of users’ digital assets being in limbo for long periods of time.\nBitcoin Cash has a long way to go before overtaking Bitcoin, but it’s well on its way. When and if it ever does, it will likely lose its stigma as a fork and be considered the real Bitcoin. Perhaps one day it might even be referred to as just cash.

According to Banco Masventas Facebook and Medium announcement, it will be the first bank to offer settlement services using BTC.\n“The service allows you to reduce costs associated with international transfers as there are no international banks as intermediaries,” explains the Bitex and Banco Masventas announcement .\nOur fund logistics solution allows reduced settlement times and send or receive transfers up to 24 hours. Argentina Becomes More Friendly Towards Cryptocurrencies Every Day\nIf a Banco Masventas customer wants to utilize the BTC settlement service an account representative will help facilitate the transaction explains the bank. The financial institution also details that if an individual is a current account holder it’s likely they already qualify to use the BTC payment service. The bank announcement reveals the international transfer commission for BTC settlement is 3.00% + VAT.\nArgentina government officials are very friendly towards public cryptocurrencies like BTC unlike neighboring countries such as Ecuador. Recently the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (BCRA) allowed the installation of Bitcoin Automatic Teller Machines (BTMs) in the country and residents may see an influx of BTMs this year. Further last December Tim Draper told the Argentine President Mauricio Marci he should invest in cryptocurrencies. Digital asset proponents think the Argentina-based Banco Masventas creating cryptocurrency services will prompt other Latin American banks to follow the company’s lead.\nWhat do you think about Banco Masventas allowing customers to settle in BTC as an alternative to Swift?

IGST will be levied on cross-border supplies.”\nThe move is not the first targeting taxation of cryptocurrency in India. In February, letters were sent to around half a million traders demanding they report profits on exchange activities.\nMeanwhile, CoinTelegraph notes a new report issued by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, reiterated the Chinese government’s concerns about “certain risks that cannot be ignored” in regards to ICOs, pyramid schemes, and fraud, with a new government-led study detecting 421 fake cryptocurrencies in China’s crypto space.

The U.S. agencies may define digital currency owners as a ‘security risk’ in order to protect foreign and domestic classified information. Also read: BCH Miners Discuss Funding Development With a Fraction of Block Rewards If You Own Bitcoin and Have U.S. Security Clearance Then You Might Have a Problem American bureaucrats are deliberating on whether or not they should flag cryptocurrency investors who have special security clearances to classified government information. An individual who owns a cryptocurrency like bitcoin or ethereum , may be considered “risky” in the eyes of the Pentagon. This past February the Defense Security Service (DSS) and the Pentagon revealed they were working on guidelines for reporting cryptocurrency ownership. According to another report published on May 22, the debate is currently being argued and government contractors are already upset about the backlog of other security clearance issues. A director for Financial Services Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University, Param Vir Singh, believes cryptocurrencies do have security risks. “There are a lot of good things about cryptocurrencies, but at the same time there are these security risks,” explained Param Vir Singh this week.

There is a new connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $655 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair may correct higher in the short term, but upsides are likely to be capped by $650-655.\nEthereum price declined heavily against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. ETH/USD is now well below $655 and is eyeing more downsides in the near term. Ethereum Price Resistance\nThe past few sessions were pretty bearish as ETH price failed to break above the $700 resistance level against the US Dollar. The price started a major downside move and broke the $685 and $655 support levels. The decline was such that the price settled below $650 and is currently trading below 100 hourly simple moving average. It traded as low as $625.45 recently and is currently in a bearish zone.\nIt may correct a few points towards the previous support near $655. An initial resistance is around the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $697 high to $625 low. Moreover, there is also a new connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $655 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The same trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $697 high to $625 low. Therefore, if the price moves higher, it is likely to face sellers near $655, $661 and $665.\nLooking at the chart , the price was clearly rejected from the $700 zone. It fell sharply and the bias turned bearish with a close below $655. On the downside, a break below the $625 low might push the price towards the $600 level.\nHourly MACD – The MACD is placed heavily in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI – The RSI is now near the oversold levels.\nMajor Support Level – $625 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T08:07:50.036+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "59c92910404d60dcb4d327ed87eae1d75147274b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVmEdARpFC5_DHrHMmdhpO..sRTyBQH2RuRbZHMHRgm7XF12FMkGIA70Ka7nbgYOjl", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Blockchain Skills?

Posted on May 23, 2018 in Bitcoin , Cryptocurrency , News | 0 comments\nBlockchain this and blockchain that might be so much hype, but no one can deny hundreds of millions of dollars, some say billions, sloshing around the ecosystem in search of advancing technology undergirding cryptocurrencies. There’s a battle in even the broader employment market as Facebook, Amazon, IBM and others search for blockchain development talent, pushing salaries and bonuses into the stratosphere.\nAlso read: CNBC Shows Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Love, Predicts Mooning Blockchain Jobs Need Talent with Know-How\nThe Wall Street Journal recently profiled the booming blockchain industry, honing-in on the demand from employers for a seemingly small pool of qualified candidates. And basic economic theory holds when the supply is at a premium and being chased by more and more dollars, the relative price will inevitably increase.\nKatheryn Griffith Hill of Blockchain Developers, a headhunter, confirmed, “We are seeing people who are making half a million dollars,” she’s quoted, adding those with as little as three years experience are fetching “definitely well over $120,000” to start. The Journal continues, “Some 4,500 job openings with the terms ‘blockchain,’ ‘bitcoin’ or ‘cryptocurrency’ in the title were posted on LinkedIn this year through mid-May, according to the company. That is up 151% over the total in all of 2017. Just 645 such job openings were posted in 2016.”\nBlockchains are simply a spin on database technology, and really aren’t all that new or even novel. That they’re used as accountancy in distributed ledger form, and decentralized in the cryptocurrency context, makes them valuable when attached to a currency such as bitcoin cash (BCH). Within the crypto world, such ledgers act as payment settlement systems, and, in the case of BCH, have solved the notorious bugaboo of creating a digital currency: double spending. For years, inventors were foiled by this problem. Satoshi Nakamoto’s insight, then, was to make coins like bitcoin cash become not only a medium of exchange and store of value but also contain a payment system, allowing for relatively trustless transactions between private parties to occur all over the globe.\nStill other wags within the financial technology industry have seized on the neologism “blockchain,” a descriptive term to help explain how miners connect it all together, and stress the tech can solve virtually any problem. Animal spirits being what they are, the corporate world has dutifully swallowed the hype whole, and so nearly any company attaching itself to the mere mention of the word can sit back and watch their valuations climb. Too Rich for Traditional Employment\nYuliya Chernova writes of a paradox as employers seek blockchain devs, describing how “many of the more experienced crypto developers already have made money trading bitcoin and Ethereum.” Indeed, hammering home the point Daniele Sileri, CEO of Blockchain Studios, insisted most “of the developers are millionaires already, so they don’t really care about money.”\nInitial coin offerings (ICOs) and venture capital have combined to lure many an accomplished dev away from traditional employment. Ripple’s David Schwartz underscores the fact “ICOs dumped a bunch of money on the industry,” to the degree that even money is “devalued” in the blockchain employment market, according to the Journal . Mr. Schwartz remarked how compensation has become “insane,” as he’s witnessed blockchain devs, at least two, receive “$1 million signing bonus offers,” the Journal notes.\nDearth of top dev talent is a global problem, and companies are struggling to distinguish themselves from the pack. Remote working arrangements, along with killer remuneration schedules, reveal work that “might have been free, there’s now a market for that work,” a dev at Augur said. Even “Augur itself has posted rewards of up to $100,000 for developers to complete certain tasks,” the Journal explained.\nDo you think the blockchain employment market is overblown, or is it a good sign?

May 23, 2018\nQuestions have been mounting around Bitcoin’s ability to scale effectively since its inception. As a cryptocurrency, Bitcoin only exists due to its revolutionary blockchain technology which creates a self-contained giant ledger keeping track of all transactions with 100% accuracy and without a third party. In the cryptocurrency economy, Bitcoin Cash has become a highly sought-after digital currency over the past few months and seems to be gaining support and momentum all the time.\nMany people have used the peer-to-peer trading platform Shapeshift to trade Bitcoin (BTC) for Bitcoin Cash (BCH). In the recent past, the Bitcoin Cash network has managed to accumulate a massive amount of support and infrastructure. FEATURES OF BITCOIN CASH Bitcoin Cash has a much larger block size (8MB) than Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash has a different transaction signature as well as wipeout and replay protection. If the hash rate is low, Bitcoin Cash can quickly adjust the difficulty of its proof-of-work. Bitcoin Cash network fees are cheaper than those of most other blockchain networks. Moreover, the BCH network fees seem to be consistent, and they may remain low when the network upgrades to a 32MB block size. Hence, there will be plenty of room for cheap transactions. There is no need for BCH network users to rely on privacy-invasive techniques like transaction batching. ALSO READ Malta is the New Leader in Global Cryptocurrency Trading Volume ISSUES WITH BITCOIN’S TECHNOLOGY\nCompared to banks and credit card transactions, Bitcoin’s technology is said to be very slow, as it can process only seven transactions each second. Over 150 million transactions are handled by Visa every day, which is roughly equivalent to 1,700 transactions per second.\nBitcoin needs to scale and increase the speed of its transaction verification process, which is considered a central problem. There’s a solution to this problem. Either the amount of data verified in each block should be made smaller, or the blocks of data should be made larger. Transactions would thus be made cheaper and faster, and more transactions would be processed at one time. ALSO READ Bitcoin Gold Price Weekly Analysis – BTG/USD Facing 100 SMA DIFFERING TRANSACTION FEES\nBitcoin’s transaction capacity is limited by its high fees, as a user’s transaction won’t be processed until he or she pays for it to go through. Otherwise, the transaction may get stuck for months, which is nothing short of frustrating for all parties involved.\nIn the case of Bitcoin Cash, this unbearable situation is not present. There’s plenty of space in the blocks, which assures that transaction fees are always low and there’s no chance of users’ digital assets being in limbo for long periods of time.\nBitcoin Cash has a long way to go before overtaking Bitcoin, but it’s well on its way. When and if it ever does, it will likely lose its stigma as a fork and be considered the real Bitcoin. Perhaps one day it might even be referred to as just cash.

The founder and CEO of cryptocurrency trading firm, BKCM LLC envisages an increase in the value of the most popular bitcoin fork. Value Creation will Drive Price Increase\nSpeaking to CNBC , Kelly predicted an impending bull run for Bitcoin Cash. He based his assertions on the decisions reached during the recent meeting of Bitcoin Cash miners in Hong Kong. The miners agreed to set aside as much as five percent of the block reward for mining towards funding Bitcoin Cash development projects.\nAccording to Kelly, this decisions by the miners is a positive development for Bitcoin Cash, saying :\nThat’s how blockchains gain value. You’re going to be getting more use cases to the extent that usefulness translates into value. That could be a positive for Bitcoin Cash.\nThe BKCM CEO expects the increase in use cases of the Bitcoin Cash blockchain to drive prices up. With more utility on the blockchain, developers will be incentivized to create useful solutions that run on the network. Thus, Kelly thinks now is the time for traders to consider Bitcoin Cash seriously. The crypto has surged from $760 in April to crossing the $1,000 threshold in May, reaching a high of $1,600 on May 6. The Bitcoin Cash Development Fund\nThe fund is aimed at supporting programmers who develop useful protocols on top of the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. During the meeting a few days ago, the top figures in the Bitcoin Cash community including Calvin Ayre and Roger Ver tabled discussions about the funding mechanism for the initiative. Apart from the percentage block rewards contribution, participants also agreed to a voting process to determine what projects to implement. The decision to adopt a treasury model for accruing donations for the development fund bears a striking resemblance to the one used by Dash developers.\nNo decision has been made on the specific percentage to be used for the donations. However, a simple analysis shows that a one percent block reward contribution amounts to about $650,000 per month on average, provided Bitcoin Cash prices do not fall below $1,200. At the time of writing this article, BCH prices have declined by six percent in the last 24 hours.\nDo you agree with Brian Kelly’s analysis that more use cases will provide value for BCH thus driving prices upward? Will the Bitcoin Cash Development Fund initiative lead to the creation of intuitive protocol solutions on the BCH blockchain?

If they were speculating they wouldn’t have donated to my campaign in Bitcoin. They didn’t HODL, they donated to my campaign in Bitcoin because they believe in the technology.”\nForde, who formerly advised the Obama administration on crypto and headed MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, is a stalwart crypto advocate, leading Bloomberg to dub him “the crypto candidate for Congress.” According to Bloomberg, his campaign has attracted support from the likes of crypto community giants Mike Novogratz and the Winklevoss brothers. His opponent Min on the other hand is a former SEC attorney and current professor of law at the University of California, Irvine.\n“While [Min’s] ad disparages a technology he clearly doesn’t understand, the United Nations uses it to address human trafficking,” Forde told Bloomberg, referring to a UN initiative for a blockchain-based digital identity system designed to combat child trafficking globally. “We need more rational scientists and technologists in congress armed with evidence-based policymaking, not politicians making irrational decisions based on their emotions,” he stressed.\nAs VICE notes, back in 2014 the US Federal Election Commission (FEC) ruled unanimously in favour of allowing political action committees to accept BTC donations, provided donors identify themselves. New Hampshire was the first US state to implement the FEC 2014 rulings, with Colorado suggesting it will follow suit just this week.\nThe FEC currently treats Bitcoin contributions to campaigns as as in-kind donations, meaning that candidates have 10 days to put the BTC raised into their official campaign depository. As Cointelegraph has reported, the FEC has been assessing whether to amend its regulations so that virtual currencies would in future be treated like cash.

The Shacklewell Lane Mosque in Dalston, East London, also known as Masjid Ramadan, partnered with local Blockchain startup Combo Innovation to set up a Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet for the Ramadan practice of Zakat, or almsgiving. The UK’s only Turkish-owned mosque, Shacklewell Lane is going against the rulings of various Islamic scholars and the Turkish government , who previously determined cryptocurrency to be “incompatible” with Islam. Interpretations are far from unanimous, however, with other sources suggesting cryptocurrency is indeed suitable for use by Muslims due to its global nature. Gurmit Singh, CEO of Combo, which provides “Islamic compliant blockchain financial solutions,” is among those adhering to this more permissive stance. “If Muslims, who make up a quarter of the world’s population, hold just 1 percent of bitcoins – or £1.04 bln ($1.39 bln) – then £26 mln ($34.6 mln) in Zakat contributions is due,” he told the Hackney Gazette, financially-able Muslims being obliged to donate 2.5% of their wealth during Ramadan. “It’s likely the actual figure is much higher.

Just like with other major cryptocurrencies, BCH/USD is now on a long-term bearish trend. On the downside, BCH/USD could slide to $950 later this week. BCH/USD Breaks Below $1,000\nOn Wednesday morning, Bitcoin Cash broke below the pivotal $1,000 price level, now trading at around $995. BCH/USD could still slip further later in the day, where the downside could take its price toward $950 later this week. On the upside, a retest of the $1,000 level may still be possible.\nAt the moment, Bitcoin Cash is holding a major resistance level around $1,080, while its support is at $960. If sellers remain in control, a movement past $960 could happen any time. The moving averages show that this downward price movement could still continue.

CFO Rainey Points Finger at Volatility\nSpeaking to CNBC in an edition of the network’s Mad Money segment, John Rainey, PayPal’s CFO, claimed that volatility was the reason PayPal did not “see a lot of interest” from its merchants regarding cryptocurrency acceptance.\nRainey told Mad Money host Jim Cramer:\nBecause of the volatility of the cryptocurrencies, if you’re a merchant and you have, let’s say, a 10 percent margin on a product that you sell and you accept Bitcoin, for example, and the very next day it moves 15 percent, you’re now underwater on that transaction. Lightning Network to Beat Processors on Fees\nThe perspective comes as little surprise from PayPal, as the company toyed with Bitcoin acceptance via its Braintree integrated payments solution since 2015.\nSince that time, Bitcoin volatility has curbed considerably, while merchant practices of instantly converting funds to fiat – a practice Rainey also highlights – could also soon change.\nAs Bitcoinist reported this week, advances in Bitcoin’s currency capabilities in the form of the Lightning Network continue to pressure both merchant processors and fiat-based solutions with conspicuously lower fees and near-instant transaction processing times.\nBraintree, which charges on average 2.9% plus a $0.30 flat fee per transaction, became the subject of a direct comparison to Bitcoin payments via Lightning-enabled payment tools, which incur zero costs to the merchant.\nLightning remains in its infancy, with a total network capacity of just under $170,000.\nRainey meanwhile signaled that PayPal was not about to give up on Bitcoin. He added:\nRight now, we don’t see a lot of interest from our merchants. But if it’s something that stabilizes in the future and is a better currency, then we’ll certainly support that.\nWhat do you think about PayPal’s future relationship with Bitcoin?

as much as 69 percent as a result of \"Blockchain Week,\" yet the cryptocurrency has fallen about 13 percent since those conferences kicked off.\nSome pundits pointed to regulatory news as the key driver of this week's sell-off.\nOn Monday, regulators in the U.S. and Canada announced a widespread crackdown on some cryptocurrency investment schemes, led by the North American Securities Administrators Association. More than 40 state and provincial watchdogs are participating in what's being called \"Operation Crypto-Sweep,\" which has triggered at least 70 investigations so far.\n\"This cleaned out a lot of the bad projects,\" said Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM, an investment firm focused on digital currencies. \"That has people a little concerned, and is a short-term hit to sentiment.\"\nLong-term though, Kelly said it's part of the maturation this market needs for institutional investors to buy in.\n\"The projects that they shut down they appear to be junk, they had a real reason to shut them down,\" Kelly said.\nUnlike stock markets, the nascent cryptocurrency market typically takes a few days to digest news before it triggers a sell-off, Kelly said.\nThis week's crackdown comes amid growing attention in the U.S. to cryptocurrency scams by U.S. regulators. The Securities and Exchange Commission has brought several fraud cases against operators of initial coin offerings and last week launched a website to help investors recognize scams.\nBitcoin has lost nearly 40 percent of its value this year, after an epic 1,300 percent rise to near $20,000 in 2017.\nThe top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization also sold off significantly Wednesday. Ethereum dropped 13 percent, XRP was down 11 percent and bitcoin cash fell 14 percent.\nJack Tatar, co-author of \"Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond,\" said this sell-off could be a sign that a shakeout is coming for digital currencies.\n\"I think you're going to start to see some consolidation around many of the smaller cryptoassets,\" Tatar said. \"That may not be a bad thing for the overall crypto community as I'm seeing more critical examination of altcoins, their utility and overall value.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaap arriens", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bydgoszcz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T20:44:17.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "97f20af4d3af36919bc360174d6b398b042f44fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.XwUR_0P3kSul07m6RFNBril0bgOWfP0ZaE9eHhm4XpkbZxOVGlZFLrqizG.oajA5_9nonMiMVI4pPIjJuuSVp.wQ3d5uUEHhC0mnNfb56OuA--", "site_full": "kplr11.com", "site": "kplr11.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin used to buy 2 pizzas in 2010 now worth $82 million | kplr11.com", "title_full": "Bitcoin used to buy 2 pizzas in 2010 now worth $82 million | kplr11.com", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://localtvkplr.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/bitcoin2.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "97f20af4d3af36919bc360174d6b398b042f44fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/3_Ka6nIrU.XwUR_0P3kSul07m6RFNBril0bgOWfP0ZaE9eHhm4XpkbZxOVGlZFLrqizG.oajA5_9nonMiMVI4pPIjJuuSVp.wQ3d5uUEHhC0mnNfb56OuA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tribune Media", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin used to buy 2 pizzas in 2010 now worth $82 million | kplr11.com", "text": "\nHallmark may need to update its official list of holidays .\nTuesday was Bitcoin Pizza Day, or what Business Insider calls “the most celebrated day in crypto,” marking the eighth anniversary of when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz made what’s thought to be the very first purchase with bitcoin.\nThat purchase, per Quartz : two large pizzas from Papa John’s for 10,000 bitcoins, an amount worth about $30 back then. Hanyecz sent his hoarded cryptocurrency to a fellow “bitcoiner,” who then placed the order.\nThe price of bitcoin has spiked just a tad since then. If Hanyecz had kept those 10,000 bitcoins, they’d be worth $82 million or so—an amount Bloomberg has figured out would buy about 6.5 million pizzas.\n“If you stacked the pizza boxes you can get for that many bitcoins today, they’d rise to outer space,” it notes.\nIf you’re going by the slice for those original two pizzas, each portion would be worth about $5 million today.\nHanyecz, now 36, is celebrating this eight-year milestone in “the perfect way,” per Forbes : by cajoling his employer, an online apparel and gear startup, to start accepting bitcoin.

The Californian online travel agency embarked on this venture back in 2013. It seems the rate of success is quite high, as the firm is enabling altcoin support as well. This is a move to help CheapAir solidify its position as a leading merchant for cryptocurrencies. An Interesting Decision by CheapAir\nThe newly supported coins are rather interesting. It includes Bitcoin Cash , which is only to be expected. Similar to Bitcoin, BCH has become very popular with its own community backing this venture in a meaningful manner. As such, it is only normal merchants pay attention to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Integrating Bitcoin Cash has only become the new normal in this regard.\nCheapAir CEO Jeff Klee comments :\n“Our cryptocurrency customers tend to be very vocal about what they want, something we appreciate very much. Over the last six months, we’ve seen a huge uptick in the number of customers requesting alternative currencies, so we’ve worked hard to integrate the three that were most requested.”\nThe other currencies accepted by CheapAir include Dash and Litecoin . While one can understand the choice for LTC. Dash is a different creature. Its focus on privacy and anonymity has attracted attention from regulators. In Japan, exchanges are removing Dash support because of these specific traits. Whether or not this will impact CheapAir in any way, remains to be seen.\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cheapair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-24T09:34:55.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ef1d0df6ac1f2c172c69a90e947fe06799b43f77", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtEWPanDEImBOPNpNFJiryB5pgfSaAzyXYcJ0t6Ta3g0kk.U1geBamzHgPkhjlAasjUeOdPDklVNoPx8QC8PseLiijSJhy7RuCUPkU5G5amssyZjzUeOGu0k-", "site_full": "bitcoinschannel.com", "site": "bitcoinschannel.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Norway and England Contemplate Central Bank-Issued Cryptocurrencies | Bitcoin Insight", "title_full": "Norway and England Contemplate Central Bank-Issued Cryptocurrencies | Bitcoin Insight", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.798, "main_image": "https://bitcoinschannel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_63811075-1068x1068.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ef1d0df6ac1f2c172c69a90e947fe06799b43f77", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRIn2mnbB1MtEWPanDEImBOPNpNFJiryB5pgfSaAzyXYcJ0t6Ta3g0kk.U1geBamzHgPkhjlAasjUeOdPDklVNoPx8QC8PseLiijSJhy7RuCUPkU5G5amssyZjzUeOGu0k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Norway and England Contemplate Central Bank-Issued Cryptocurrencies | Bitcoin Insight", "text": "Norway and England Contemplate Central Bank-Issued Cryptocurrencies May 23, 2018 | Bitcoins Channel | Shares: 1\nEconomy & Regulation The central banks of Norway and England have published reports exploring different models for central bank-issued cryptocurrencies.

As a cryptocurrency , Bitcoin only exists due to its revolutionary blockchain technology which creates a self-contained giant ledger keeping track of all transactions with 100% accuracy and without a third party. In the cryptocurrency economy, Bitcoin Cash has become a highly sought-after digital currency over the past few months and seems to be gaining support and momentum all the time.\nMany people have used the peer-to-peer trading platform Shapeshift to trade Bitcoin (BTC) for Bitcoin Cash (BCH). In the recent past, the Bitcoin Cash network has managed to accumulate a massive amount of support and infrastructure. Features of Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin Cash has a much larger block size (8MB) than Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash has a different transaction signature as well as wipeout and replay protection. If the hash rate is low, Bitcoin Cash can quickly adjust the difficulty of its proof-of-work. Bitcoin Cash network fees are cheaper than those of most other blockchain networks. Moreover, the BCH network fees seem to be consistent, and they may remain low when the network upgrades to a 32MB block size. Hence, there will be plenty of room for cheap transactions. There is no need for BCH network users to rely on privacy-invasive techniques like transaction batching . Issues with Bitcoin’s Technology\nCompared to banks and credit card transactions, Bitcoin’s technology is said to be very slow, as it can process only seven transactions each second. Over 150 million transactions are handled by Visa every day, which is roughly equivalent to 1,700 transactions per second .\nBitcoin needs to scale and increase the speed of its transaction verification process, which is considered a central problem. There’s a solution to this problem. Either the amount of data verified in each block should be made smaller, or the blocks of data should be made larger. Transactions would thus be made cheaper and faster, and more transactions would be processed at one time. Differing Transaction fees\nBitcoin’s transaction capacity is limited by its high fees, as a user’s transaction won’t be processed until he or she pays for it to go through. Otherwise, the transaction may get stuck for months, which is nothing short of frustrating for all parties involved.\nIn the case of Bitcoin Cash, this unbearable situation is not present. There’s plenty of space in the blocks, which assures that transaction fees are always low and there’s no chance of users’ digital assets being in limbo for long periods of time.\nBitcoin Cash has a long way to go before overtaking Bitcoin, but it’s well on its way. When and if it ever does, it will likely lose its stigma as a fork and be considered the real Bitcoin. Perhaps one day it might even be referred to as just cash.

The U.S. agencies may define digital currency owners as a 'security risk' in order to protect foreign and domestic classified information.\nAlso read: BCH Miners Discuss Funding Development With a Fraction of Block Rewards\nIf You Own Bitcoin and Have U.S. Security Clearance Then You Might Have a Problem American bureaucrats are deliberating on whether or not they should flag cryptocurrency investors who have special security clearances to classified government information. An individual who owns a cryptocurrency like bitcoin or ethereum, may be considered \"risky\" in the eyes of the Pentagon. This past February the Defense Security Service (DSS) and the Pentagon revealed they were working on guidelines for reporting cryptocurrency ownership. According to another report published on May 22, the debate is currently being argued and government contractors are already upset about the backlog of other security clearance issues.\nA director for Financial Services Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University, Param Vir Singh, believes cryptocurrencies do have security risks.\n\"There are a lot of good things about cryptocurrencies, but at the same time there are these security risks,\" explained Param Vir Singh this week.\nThink about a knife: It could be used for good things and it can be used for bad things as well.\nDSS Recommends Cryptocurrency Owners With Security Clearance Should Report Their Virtual Currency Holdings Further, the columnist Adam Reese recently reviewed an email by a DSS employee named Chad M. Campbell — which indicates that the security specialist recommends individuals who apply for U.S. security clearance need to report their cryptocurrency holdings on the agency's Standard Form 86 (SF86). Additionally, the reporter received a reply from Defense Security Service Public Affairs which stated:\n\"DSS has fielded a number of questions from industry as to whether ownership of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, should be reported by cleared persons or security clearance applicants,\" explains the Defense Department.\nThere is no current Department of Defense guidance related to the reporting of ownership of cryptocurrencies. DSS is working with DoD policy offices for further clarification and once such guidance is issued, DSS will ensure the widest dissemination to industry. Additionally, the email [Campbell's email] was an internal discussion document which was not intended to serve as policy guidance.\nUniversity of California Researcher: 'Bitcoin Owners Deserve Suspicion' Individuals and organizations see the security clearance/cryptocurrency discussion as a controversial subject as opinions differ depending on who is discussing the matter. Steve Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists believes holding cryptocurrencies or other behaviors don't necessarily make a person risky. \"I don't know if the government has a clear understanding of what makes a person actually a security risk — Instead they look at proxy factors like excessive debt, drug use and contact with the criminal justice system, which don't necessarily translate to risk,\" Aftergood explains.\nHowever, a researcher at the University of California, Nicholas Weaver, disagrees and thinks digital currency holders should be suspects. \"Since Bitcoin's only real use is to buy drugs, etc., it deserves suspicion,\" Weaver said this week. It's also worth noting that some of these DSS and Pentagon officials who firmly believe cryptocurrencies are a 'security risk' have no problem with defense contractors who shill centralized blockchains. The DSS is not calling blockchain projects sponsored by Booze Hamilton Allen or the company's employees suspicious — Nope just bitcoin and public blockchains seem to be a threat at the moment.\nWhat do you think about the DSS and Pentagon's discussion about bitcoin classification and raising suspicion against cryptocurrency owners?

Paxful is using Bitcoin to do good in the world, and I am proud to become an integral part of that.”\nThis is however not Paxful’s first engagement with Africa. It is worth noting that late last year, Paxful launched a charitable program called #BuiltwithBitcoin whose aim was to encourage those in the cryptocurrency industry to contribute funds for humanitarian projects with the first project being in Rwanda.\nPaxful will sponsor several blockchain and crypto-focused events in Nigeria, and it also mentioned that it plans to sponsor and speak at others in Ghana, Cameroon and Kenya.\n“We are where we are now because people gave back and it helped us tremendously.

The value of those 10,000 bitcoins nowadays is close to $84 million.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n“It wasn’t like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,” Hanyecz famously said in a 2013 interview with The New York Times. “No one knew it was going to get so big.”\nHanyecz also christened the nascent Lightning Network (LN) with a similar purchase later on, but this time around it cost him only 0.00649 BTC (~$53).

Witnesses said a Toyota Corolla pulled up nearby and the teenager was dragged in and driven away.\n“We are investigating a case of kidnapping that happened on Sunday in Witbank.

Show Hide\nBitcoin is the first, and the biggest, “cryptocurrency” – a decentralised tradeable digital asset. Whether it is a bad investment is the big question. Bitcoin can only be used as a medium of exchange and in practice has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses. The lack of any central authority makes bitcoin remarkably resilient to censorship, corruption – or regulation. That means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person.\nWas this helpful?\nThank you for your feedback. “This is a kidnapping … We demand ransom of 15 bitcoins to be paid into the below bitcoin wallet address to secure your child’s safe release – non-negotiable,” the note reportedly read.\nThe first deadline for payment of part of the ransom passed on Monday night. In the note, the kidnappers threatened to kill the boy if their demands were not met. A police official said boy’s parents were “going through trauma”.\n“They don’t even know what this bitcoin is. They’re devastated and you can see they’re worried and asking themselves: ‘Where’s our son?” local media quoted the official as saying. The boy’s mother made an emotional appeal on Tuesday, pleading with the kidnappers to “bring back [her] son”.\nPolice in South Africa have reported a recent rise in kidnappings, although it is usually wealthy businesspeople who are targeted. The latest case appears to be the first ransom demand in made for a cryptocurrency in the country.\nIn December 2017, an employee at a cryptocurrency exchange in Ukraine was released by kidnappers after a ransom of more than $1m worth of bitcoins was paid.\nTopics South Africa Bitcoin Africa Cryptocurrencies news", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ukraine-kidnapping/ukraine-kidnappers-free-bitcoin-analyst-after-1-million-ransom-paid-idUKKBN1EN1QE", "https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/kidnappers-demand-a-bitcoin-ransom-for-abducted-mpumalanga-teen-20180522"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "leonard hlathi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "toyota corolla", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mpumalanga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "witbank", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T22:06:22.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "81d9c75d5f3aad914ba2f475605be9734eddf843", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmY83RND7ug9uc9BwdpxgllY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Safe wallet for bitcoin ?", "title_full": "Safe wallet for bitcoin ?", "published": "2018-05-23T02:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "81d9c75d5f3aad914ba2f475605be9734eddf843", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmY83RND7ug9uc9BwdpxgllY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cryptoblue", "published": "2018-05-23T02:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Safe wallet for bitcoin ?", "text": "There are a lot of safe wallets, but hardware wallet is the best of them.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T22:50:55.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8c498495cfad280ebe60ce26e10a5c07d0572791", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaQdK0GYa6bKrYFvymxkzcM-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Best way to earn bitcoin ?", "title_full": "Best way to earn bitcoin ?", "published": "2018-05-23T02:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 6, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8c498495cfad280ebe60ce26e10a5c07d0572791", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmaQdK0GYa6bKrYFvymxkzcM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "faizzeybutt786", "published": "2018-05-23T02:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Best way to earn bitcoin ?", "text": "bounty and Minning Best way to Earn bitcoin", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-22T22:50:16.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f818e642994b805dd8c883dd491464dfdd875016", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTr0s_L4enTgnAeAmIKm3yJwCAIWBsFf4cZ.270UrG7CXIJedTBAsP10JRJRQiI3tOAkn6H53chXCSbsOxOtvd3xSwv_WeDivy.f9NXjxWCH7u.K68oJC1LF8gRy5lGnFHTAAlxpbQBN8Q.7ua6iviqs1LYwXIMRq0-", "site_full": "www.thenational.ae", "site": "thenational.ae", "site_section": "https://www.thenational.ae/business", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Business -

Venture capitalist Michael Jackson spent almost half a million dollars in buying the piece. Courtesy Studio Kevin Abosch Last month, Michael Jackson, the venture capitalist and former Skype executive, spent $400,000 on a 6 metre long neon sign consisting of 42 yellow letters and numbers that make up the blockchain contract address of a crypto-themed work of art called Yellow Lambo .\nArtist Kevin Abosch conceived it as a symbol of success, a way to physically manifest the wealth a digital coin can represent. Mr Jackson doesn’t know whether the work is, or ever will be, worth the money. And yet this Yellow Lambo went for more than many real Lamborghinis.\n“Crypto assets - they are so difficult to understand,” Mr Jackson said. “A Lambo in real life is something the guys want to look up to. They are only doing it to show off, it symbolises wealth. But a token - no one can see it.”\nCrytpocurrencies boast a market cap of $430 billion, leading people to question the actual worth of invisible assets unconnected to any traditional store of value. So while Bitcoin appreciated 14-fold last year, billionaire investor Warren Buffett is still calling the currency “rat poison squared”. Now artists are weighing in, raising their own questions about value, ownership and crypto’s underlying technology.\nWhen JP Morgan chairman Jamie Dimon called crypto a “terrible store of value”, artist “cryptograffiti” responded with a piece with the same name. Terrible Store of Value is a portrait of a “disintegrating” Mr Dimon - “mirroring the public’s trust toward traditional banking institutions”, according to cryptograffiti’s website - executed on a bank deposit box that’s connected to a Bitcoin wallet. The piece sold for $33,000 at auction this year.\nBlockchain, the ledger technology underlying many cryptocurrencies, has “huge potential” and is attracting dozens of established artists, said Christiane Paul, director of the Sheila C Johnson Design Centre at the New School’s Parsons School of Design in New York.\n“Artists have always been engaging with the latest technologies,” said Ms Paul, who is also adjunct curator of digital art the Whitney Museum of American Art. “It’s important that artists capture a certain kind of moment in cultural and technological evolution.”\nIn June, the Whitney’s website will start showing a three-minute film by Jennifer and Kevin McCoy that offers clues to a Bitcoin address where the first 50 people can claim part-ownership of the piece, which the artists plan to donate to the museum. The owners will be able to resell their shares in the work, allowing other people to get their names associated with the piece - in the museum world, donors typically can’t be added after the fact.\n“This piece rips the existing infrastructure apart, and that to me was incredibly interesting,” Ms Paul said.\nAbosch, of the Yellow Lambo , has put himself into his work, selling more than 2.5 million tokens for as much as $10 a throw as part of his “Iama Coin” project. Each Iama coin represents a piece of the artist, he said.\n“I imagined if I were a coin, how would I distribute myself to the masses?” Abosch said.\nUsing his own blood and a rubber stamp, he imprinted 100 physical artworks with the contract address on the Ethereum blockchain “corresponding to the creation” of 10 million virtual works titled IAMA Coin .\nRead more:\nStart-up uses art of blockchain to protect artists' work\nHow not to paint yourself into an art market corner", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kevin abosch", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "michael jackson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jackson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "skype", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T06:52:26.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3036c0bfa135cfbd896f345d9a25183cb9922b32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStvi8eu_a2YyBAJP5EKWQLA0kPg6qGpBR75WX9tLNN5UxDJbWuEbE6HtbpdnY6Qi6FK1zd1zBEgYz8A8B_w8Yo9EdQjatWnOg_PHpUQHxSEmQgxG_QMVfg", "site_full": "gazettereview.com", "site": "gazettereview.com", "site_section": "http://gazettereview.com/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Gazette Review", "title": "South Africa: Kidnappers of Boy Make Ransom Demand In Bitcoin", "title_full": "South Africa: Kidnappers of Boy Make Ransom Demand In Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-23T02:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://gazettereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/images.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 79619, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3036c0bfa135cfbd896f345d9a25183cb9922b32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZStvi8eu_a2YyBAJP5EKWQLA0kPg6qGpBR75WX9tLNN5UxDJbWuEbE6HtbpdnY6Qi6FK1zd1zBEgYz8A8B_w8Yo9EdQjatWnOg_PHpUQHxSEmQgxG_QMVfg", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sean Farlow", "published": "2018-05-23T02:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "South Africa: Kidnappers of Boy Make Ransom Demand In Bitcoin", "text": "South Africa: Kidnappers of Boy Make Ransom Demand In Bitcoin By - May 22nd, 2018\nSouth African authorities have revealed that the kidnappers of a boy have demanded a ransom of about $123,000. The ransom demand hasn’t been made in cash or transfer but in bitcoin, confusing the family since authorities say they don’t know about the payment system.\nThe boy was kidnapped at a playground over the weekend. The incident happened in the town of Witbank when he was with two friends. Authorities believe a gang is behind the kidnapping. Witnesses say a Toyota Corolla was seen stopping by and the teenager was dragged to the vehicle.\nLocal media reports that the kidnappers left a note at the scene. The note reportedly mentions that it is a kidnapping and that they demand a ransom of 15 bitcoins for the safe release of the boy. A police spokesman said earlier today that they are investigating the case and confirmed that the kidnappers have demanded a ransom in bitcoins.\nSouth African authorities believe this is the first case in the country in which kidnappers ask for bitcoins in exchange for a release. The kidnappers reportedly set a Monday deadline for part of the payment. Local media quoted an official as saying that the family doesn’t even know what bitcoin is.\nThe case is believed to be a first in South Africa but it has already happened in other countries. In December 2017, officials confirmed that a bitcoin analyst had been released in Ukraine after his ransom was paid in bitcoins. Officials said this was the first case in Ukraine in which kidnappers demanded a ransom in bitcoins. Local media reported that he had been pushed into a minibus with a stolen license plate. Officials did not reveal who paid the ransom but the analyst was released with no injuries.\nEarlier this year, Mexican authorities arrested five people over the kidnapping of a lawyer in the city of Chihuahua. The lawyer was kidnapped by two armed men after leaving her office. The men later demanded a ransom in bitcoins and it was paid by the family shortly after.\nAuthorities did not reveal how much the kidnappers asked for but did confirm that the family had made the payment. Police later arrested the five suspects and rescued the woman at another location.

Instead of comparing bitcoin to past technological solutions, as has been done many times before, he puts it in the context of time-based and electricity-backed experimental forms of alternative money.\nPutting the technology of Bitcoin on the same level as primarily political movements, he also compared it to attempts to reshape how governments and economies operate.

Shiller\nAfter reviewing these past examples, Shiller explains that: “Each of these monetary innovations has been coupled with a unique technological story. But, more fundamentally, all are connected with a deep yearning for some kind of revolution in society. The cryptocurrencies are a statement of faith in a new community of entrepreneurial cosmopolitans who hold themselves above national governments, which are viewed as the drivers of a long train of inequality and war.”\n“And, as in the past, the public’s fascination with cryptocurrencies is tied to a sort of mystery, like the mystery of the value of money itself, consisting in the new money’s connection to advanced science. Practically no one, outside of computer science departments, can explain how cryptocurrencies work. That mystery creates an aura of exclusivity, gives the new money glamour, and fills devotees with revolutionary zeal. None of this is new, and, as with past monetary innovations, a compelling story may not be enough,” he concluded.\nWhether it’s true or not that only computer scientists understand cryptocurrencies today, it is certainly accepted that having a story is not enough by itself, which is why bitcoin entrepreneurs continue to work on exciting use cases that are only made possible with this revolutionary technology.\nWhat should the bitcoin community make of the professor’s observations?

However, ask any bitcoin enthusiast, and he is sure to point you towards the story of Laszlo Hanyecz.\nThe Multi-million Dollar Pizza On May 18, 2010, Hanyecz, a Florida-based computer programmer, set out to prove the world that bitcoin can be used as a real transfer-of-value, and is not mere magic internet money.\nFor the task, Hanyecz posted on the Bitcointalk forum and offered 10,000 bitcoins, worth around $40 in May 2010, in exchange for two pizzas:\n\"I'll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas. Maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later.\"\nWith the current price of bitcoin near $8,000, the amount paid for two pizzas now totals to more than $80 million.\nA 4-day Wait to Trade Bitcoin for Pizza While the post rapidly drew attention from bitcoin enthusiasts, developers, and forum members, several of the currency's disbelievers considered the Bitcointalk entry as a bid to get a free meal, in turn of digital pennies which was unknown beyond a minuscule set of \"cyberpunks.\" Others pointed out that they might not be able to pay from outside the U.S. with their credit card.\nA slice of Bitcoin history . Source: Bitcointalk\nAt one point on May 21, Hanyecz wrote on the forum \"So nobody wants to buy me pizza? Is the bitcoin amount I'm offering too low?\"\nHowever, Hanyecz proved the digital currency's newfound role as a medium of exchange on May 22, 2010, with a comment stating that he had \"successfully traded 10,000 bitcoins to acquire them,\" along with a picture.\nThe 10,000 bitcoin pizzas . Source: Heliacal\nAt the time of writing, the two pizzas are valued at approximately $80 million, which proves the massive augmentation of bitcoin's rise in value, stepping out of obscurity in 2009, to an emergent digital asset in 2018.\nThe transaction remains historic and is the earliest known example of using bitcoins to purchase an everyday sustenance. For these reasons, May 22 of each year is remembered as the \"Bitcoin Pizza Day.\"\nHanyecz Reveals His Bitcoin Story Speaking to The New York Times in 2013, when the pizzas were worth $6 million, Hanyecz said :\n\"It wasn't like bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool. No one knew it was going to get so big.\"\nAt the time, bitcoin was not easily available on exchanges and had to be mined to be possessed. To this effect, the programmer made a custom-built mining rig that used his personal computing power to solve the Bitcoin network's complex puzzles, in turn of receiving units of the cryptocurrency upon the successful mining of a block.\nFurthermore, Hanyecz does not lament over the purported lost wealth, instead of considering the transaction as a historical use-case which proved its capabilities as an obscure technology. However, he reveals that he bought a computer for $4,000, when the value of his bitcoins reached $1.\nThe computer programmer ardently follows the Bitcoin protocol, and was instrumental in replicating the experiment after the network's Lightning upgrade, which introduced fast transactions speeds to an oft-criticized slow network.\nAs reported by BTCManager , Hanyecz paid 0.00649 bitcoin for two pizzas to test the Lightning Network on February 27, 2018, equivalent to $53 at the time. The bitcoin pioneer has not stopped there, he has also convinced his employer GoRuck to start accepting the cryptocurrency.\nBitrefill Commemorates 'Bitcoin Pizza Day' In celebration of Bitcoin Pizza Day on May 22, Bitrefill announced a surprise feature. Those based in the U.S. can now pay with bitcoin to buy a gift card for Italian restaurants Bertucci's and Buca Di Beppo. Bitcoiners in the States can also use the online delivery service Menufy to order their own 'Bitcoin Pizza.'\nCryptocurrency hardware wallet providers also offered promotions; Ledger announced a Ledger Nano S – Pizza Day edition while Trezor offered a ten percent sale on all of its products.\nThe post \"Bitcoin Pizza Day\" Shows Pioneer Cryptocurrency's Impressive Price Rise appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laszlo hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanyecz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T02:39:31.053+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3ab447dda0d09d8bd511e661a0f96040b302a309", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbPMVMSdwD3wvsoBbwG4vWY-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "In Germany, bitcoin was recognized as legal tender", "title_full": "In Germany, bitcoin was recognized as legal tender", "published": "2018-05-23T02:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3ab447dda0d09d8bd511e661a0f96040b302a309", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmbPMVMSdwD3wvsoBbwG4vWY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "fatema", "published": "2018-05-23T02:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "In Germany, bitcoin was recognized as legal tender", "text": "It's really a great news.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency networks are bound to surpass the majority of the failed attempts to popularize its value-added benefits, leading to global adoption.\nA very popular video game called ‘The Simpsons: Tapped Out’ are inculcating crypto references into their game’s website. The Tapped Out game version of Simpsons have their own version of ‘Springfield’ where Homer Simpson has to bring back his town members and re-built the city. The game is available in six languages including French, Turkish, Italian, making it more globally recognizable.\nThe game has had several purchasers as for its players and thus has earned more than $100 million. There’s a point in the game where Martin refers to Bitcoin mining as a part of the story’s plotline. He casually brags about mining “some Bitcoin” through his computer, to which is next statement goes like “and then the value went through the roof,” so once the player completes the task he asks more users to join in together to mine Bitcoin.\nBoth players and crypto-space enthusiasts are excited about this first-ever portrayal of any cryptocurrency in the world of Cartoons and graphic.\nIn other news, Bitcoin has successfully made references in popular Netflix shows like Supernatural, House of Cards and even The Big Bang Theory! The episode 9 from season 11’s Big Bang Theory, that was aired last year in November follows up with Sheldon announcing that he had mined some Bitcoin almost seven years ago with using Howard’s old laptop, to which he adds that its worth has increased more than expected it to. Stuart then agrees to be supportive of him as he remembers doing the same. A scene from Big Bang Theory\nIn a flashback included in the plotline of episode 9, Sheldon asks Stuart if he ‘accepts the new virtual coinage Bitcoin’, to which he explains how one needs to solve “complex mathematical problems” to earn them. Raj later realizes that Sheldon had warned them that ‘someday they would regret it’.\nAs far as the show ‘Simpsons’ goes, it has mentioned Bitcoin more than once. Even back in 1997, the Simpson’s had a mention of a ‘Place for codes’ or a ‘Crypto Barn’. Marvel comics have had their share of crypto-mention with its ‘Hunt for Wolverine- Adamantium Agenda 1’, where they consider Bitcoin as a universal delivery body that is used for delivering power and are often used by robots.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "homer simpson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "simpsons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "springfield", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-23T02:18:27.036+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6de2b63c52edb567472e234004bdd4dbc0b3f81b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS4wjRtdxs5CFlfysOZMOhU-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "What do you mean when you say Bitcoin is number 1", "title_full": "What do you mean when you say Bitcoin is number 1", "published": "2018-05-23T02:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 8, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.019, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6de2b63c52edb567472e234004bdd4dbc0b3f81b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS4wjRtdxs5CFlfysOZMOhU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "malbterxic", "published": "2018-05-23T02:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "What do you mean when you say Bitcoin is number 1", "text": "Personally it seems to me that bitcoin will be number one in two of the listed directions - Investment/speculation and Freedom from globalist control.
