This is largely a concern of public interest; a consensus will show you what I mean. The public interest index rate has fallen from 100% interest in December to 12% now.”\nStatistics show that there is more than 600 thousand bitcoins exchange occurring every day.

Now the Localbitcoins organization has updated its terms of service agreement which comes with a few new guidelines concerning ID verification and data retention.\nAlso read: Markets Update: Cryptocurrencies Lose Steam During the Weekend Localbitcoins Updates its ToS, Highlighting ID Verification and the Organization’s Privacy Policy\nLocalbitcoins the peer-to-peer exchange founded in June 2012 in Helsinki, Finland has been a very popular trading platform for quite some time. For a while, users could trade in a fairly anonymous manner as it wasn’t required for traders to upload their identification. However a few years ago the organization added the ability for users to verify their state ID or license through a system called Jumio Netverify . A user could voluntarily upload their ID, adding more trust to the trading situation if the person is a real individual. Then this year traders who have been trading “significant” amounts of BTC volume reportedly were being asked to upload their ID to proceed to trade further using the platform.\nNow the business has updated its terms of service (ToS) , and explains much of the changes are due to EU regulation, specifically the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation 2016/679) . Cryptocurrency enthusiasts thought that it was odd that Localbitcoins suddenly announced changing its ToS this month, due to this specific regulation which is supposed to actually limit data harvesting, and allow citizens ownership over their identity rights online. Localbitcoins new ToS highlights a few things users should know about identification requirements. Some Situations May Prompt ID Verification\nLocalbitcoins states the organization still does not enforce ID verification as a mandatory procedure for users but says there could be situations where you are required to submit an ID.\n“We don’t require ID verification for all users, but in some situations, you may be asked to verify your ID with us,” explains the website .\nThe following situations will prompt the company to ask the user to upload an ID such as trading over certain volume limits and when advertising, or if someone hacks your account, fraud investigations, and account recovery.\n“It is our top-most priority to ensure that Localbitcoins is a safe and secure bitcoin marketplace and that no one is able to use our service for money laundering or other unlawful activities,” the web page states.\nMost fraud on Localbitcoins stems from users attempting money laundering. We believe that taking a strict stance in this regard is in the interest of our users and important for our brand as a trustworthy marketplace. The Quest for Decentralized Exchanges Continues\nAs far as retaining user data and the organization’s privacy policy, Localbitcoins says they had to rewrite their entire policy. After people began to digest the latest Localbitcoins statements and how the ToS which will be enforced on May 25, many bitcoin enthusiasts again talked about platforms like Shapeshift , and decentralized exchanges like Barterdex , Bisq and others. Again, most cryptocurrency proponents understand the problem with Localbitcoins is the fiat exchange process, which is something you cannot do with Shapeshift.\nWhat do you think about Localbitcoins new ToS?

This “experiment in philanthropy ” has seen many great successes, but the time has come to move on. It will be interesting to see which venture takes its place. Donating $55 million worth of Bitcoin to charities around the world is nothing to sneeze at. The Success of the Pineapple Fund\nFor those unfamiliar with the Pineapple Fund , it was a project meant to bring Bitcoin to charities all over the world. The person responsible for creating this venture donated the majority of his or her own cryptocurrency holdings to various charities and good causes. Anyone in need of funding could apply through the project’s website and have their organization vetted. It was a simple business model which seemingly worked out quite well.\nSince its launch, the Pineapple Fund has successfully contributed to charities big and small. Any legitimate cause that the owner believed in – or that at least had a chance of succeeding – received a contribution in the form of Bitcoin. By taking this route, the world’s leading cryptocurrency received positive attention. It also highlighted the benefits of dealing in cryptocurrency rather than traditional payment methods.\nWith $55 million in Bitcoin donations to date, it is safe to say the Pineapple Fund has been a success. During last year’s massive price bubble, the owner converted a total of 5,104 BTC to $55 million, which was then distributed among the eligible charities. Even though no one knows who is behind this charitable venture, the success of this project cannot be denied. Unfortunately, it will not be continued.\nOne has to acknowledge the Pineapple Fund has always been a rather unique philanthropic effort. Most people who contribute to charities want to be in the spotlight. The individual known only as “Pine” has no such desire, which makes him or her a very unusual individual among both philanthropists and Bitcoin enthusiasts. People generally like to highlight their wealth, but Pine has always maintained a completely different mindset.\nIt remains unclear why the Pineapple Fund will cease to exist. Ending on a high note is always a smart idea. Additionally, Pine made it a goal to donate $55 million worth of Bitcoin to charity, and that goal has been reached. Whether it was done well ahead of schedule, or perhaps took longer than Pine expected, will remain a bit of a mystery. Either way, the end result is still the same, which is all that matters in the end.\nWith 60 different charities having been supported , the Pineapple Fund achieved the goal it set out to accomplish. Among the supported charities were Charity: Water, OpenBSD, Quill, The Reagent Project, WildMe, and many others. In all, the Pineapple Fund received over 10,000 applications for funding, which further shows how much interest this venture generated. It was a remarkable feat, and a valuable addition to the history of Bitcoin.

Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.\"\nClients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally.\nAlbrecht's service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013. His office employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month.\nMost clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don't exceed 50,000 dollars. In 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since.\nAdoption of Bitcoin has been rapid in Germany. It trails only the U.S., according to Bitnodes, which tracks the location of all the Bitcoin nodes that transmit data about new transactions.\n(Writing by Laura Dubois,; Editing by Joseph Nasr and Matthew Mpoke Bigg) More From Technology ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "radoslav albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prenzlauer berg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters tv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de berlin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T14:57:46.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ac1bd39971d761067787e268b40b8ab36cff81ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS27sTgup2Z441XwJO35F8Tc-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Win $200 in BTC, earn 4% annual interest on your Bitcoins", "title_full": "Win $200 in BTC, earn 4% annual interest on your Bitcoins", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ac1bd39971d761067787e268b40b8ab36cff81ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS27sTgup2Z441XwJO35F8Tc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Win $200 in BTC, earn 4% annual interest on your Bitcoins", "text": "https://goo.gl/qait9X", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T17:54:41.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8db8ad27e7a2058c348daa38bf01d0bc6c90fa13", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSj9kks7Ck.pNtTb.jXR9LA12JR8Kvke6f6Qk5NUJO1TKy.6wZAs5qClCBTqpTMGZXKF1Bl4pG3RR0s9rVxo0WGOZDVHjdSJGA-", "site_full": "medium.com", "site": "medium.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech"], "section_title": "", "title": "Why Bitcoin Price Drops Again? – Marko Vidrih – Medium", "title_full": "Why Bitcoin Price Drops Again? – Marko Vidrih – Medium", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.015, "main_image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*ErBnkgolMeP5_sWjWGSVjw.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 380, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8db8ad27e7a2058c348daa38bf01d0bc6c90fa13", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSj9kks7Ck.pNtTb.jXR9LA12JR8Kvke6f6Qk5NUJO1TKy.6wZAs5qClCBTqpTMGZXKF1Bl4pG3RR0s9rVxo0WGOZDVHjdSJGA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Bitcoin Price Drops Again? – Marko Vidrih – Medium", "text": "May 12 Why Bitcoin Price Drops Again? When it comes to blockchain prospects, it’s always a roller-coaster ride for investors. Bitcoin, whose price had remained over $9,000 for most of this month, once again dipped below $8,000 yesterday and today. In fact, the price recently hit a three-week low. One potential reason for the drop may be Mt. Gox, the now-defunct crypto exchange, which is in the process of paying off its creditors. Some have speculated that its trustee sold a large chunk of the bitcoin it had in its coffers, according to Bloomberg . What’s more, South Korean authorities recently raided one of the country’s biggest exchanges, UPbit, which likely impacted bitcoin’s price. Nevertheless, some are still bullish on the bitcoin market overall. A recent report from Fundstrat predicts that the price of the cryptocurrency will hit $64,000 by the end of 2019.

Yesterday’s price stood at $8,600 – a nasty drop from last weekend’s high of $9,800. Many were expecting bitcoin to test the $10,000 mark, which didn’t occur. In fact, last week has been the worst in bitcoin’s history since early April, when the currency dropped to $6,600. Bitcoin has fallen from $9,800 to $9,500, and then $9,300. This, in turn, led to slides to $9,100 then $8,600 respectively.\nNow, bitcoin stands at $8,400, which believe it or not, is an improvement over where it was trading during the morning’s early hours ($8,250).\nDuring yesterday’s price piece, we discussed the probability that Mt. Gox trustees had moved several bitcoin funds to approximately four separate wallets, which may have affected the price in the long run. In the past, these trustees have admitted that their actions of moving funds and selling off their stashes do, in fact, bear repercussions on bitcoin’s price and overall value, yet this hasn’t necessarily stopped them from performing such actions, which they’ve been doing since last September.\nWe’re almost certain the questions everyone has for these trustees are, “What the hell?” and “Why do you continue to move funds in such a way that the price is easily manipulated?” They clearly admit that what they’re doing has consequences, yet they haven’t stopped. Haven’t bitcoin enthusiasts and traders suffered enough from their actions? Is it that hard to relinquish power? Is this all part of a scheme to mold the bitcoin price to their liking so they can somehow cash in further on their respective sell-offs?\nAnother reason behind the recent drop may be Nvidia Corp , which recently broke out its cryptocurrency sales for the first time in quarterly earnings. Sadly, the company didn’t strike a particularly bullish tone. While prices have moved up initially during the year’s first quarter, the company’s executives claim that prices are now starting to come down, and thus revenue could diminish by approximately two-thirds during the present period.\n“Crypto miners bought a lot of our GPUs during the quarter, and it drove prices up,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang claimed in a recent interview. “And so, we’re starting to see prices come down. We monitor spot pricing every single day around the world, and the prices are starting to normalize.”\nThis isn’t a great sign, considering the price of bitcoin is once again below the $8,600 mark. This, according to Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, is the final price edge where bitcoin mining can remain profitable (which we’ve discussed in past price articles), but a drop to $8,400 where it currently stands, and any additional falls after that could potentially bring the profitability of bitcoin’s mining sector down to new lows. We’ve already seen enough damage to the industry when bitcoin stood at $6,600 about a month ago. Could we see further struggles in the immediate future?\nAside from bitcoin, the digital currency appears to be taking all its crypto -cousins along for the ride. At press time, Ethereum is down by approximately seven percent. Ripple has dropped by 10 percent, while smaller coins like EOS are down a whopping 15 percent.

From July 1, 2019, any business transaction over $10,000 has to be done using electronic payments. Handing over a hundred $100 notes or more will be illegal, as the government tries to flush out tax avoiders, drug dealers and the rest of the underground economy.\nBitcoiners and other cryptocurrency fans predicted this, and the government is playing into their greedy little hands.\nGRINDING ON UP\nBitcoin surged to $US20,000 last year and then quickly plunged back down to about $6700. Many thought it would continue back down close to zero. Instead, it has rebounded about 40 per cent in the past month to more than $9000, as this next graph shows.\nThe volatile Bitcoin has rebounded in the past month.\nThe recommendation of a ban on cash comes from the government's Black Economy Task Force. The head of the task force, Michael Andrew, described the reasons people use cash in a recent podcast, giving as an example a shopkeeper who runs two tills, keeping some money out of sight of the taxman.\n\"It's basically paying people cash who want to maintain their welfare, their visa status or avoid their child maintenance,\" Mr Andrew said. \"That is widespread in certain areas particularly … the services-based economy, security industry, hospitality, cleaning, couriers, personal trainers, hairdressing and nail salons for example.\"\nGovernments around the world are interested in cracking down on cash, and not just to get those dodgy nail salons paying tax, but also to kill off terrorist financing, to reduce money laundering, and even to let them reduce interest rates below zero. (If you make interest rates negative, people will just take cash out of the bank, but if you also make cash illegal, that's not possible.)\nANARCHY IN THE BLOCKCHAIN\nAll these anti-cash trends are giving life to Bitcoin, and other digital currencies that could serve as an alternative to cash. For some people, that's the whole point of cryptocurrencies. A big part of the early adopters of Bitcoin were people who are deeply worried about government. Many early Bitcoin adopters were libertarians and anarchists who feared an Orwellian world where government constantly monitored and controlled you.\nWhen Mr Morrison bans cash, those libertarians and anarchists get their \"I told you so!\" moment. But these days, as Bitcoin aims for mainstream acceptance, the industry is keen to distance itself from those people.\n2 LEGIT 2 BIT\n\"It is not about encouraging a black market economy,\" says Caleb Yeoh, the co-founder of Travel by Bit, which has made buying things with cryptocurrencies possible at about 150 Australian businesses, including mainstream outlets such as Red Rooster.\n\"We signed up over 150 businesses across Australia. Each one of them gets a tax reporting functionality on our platform, so they declare taxes even thought they take payment in Bitcoin.\"\nYeoh, whose business is part-funded by government grants, points out that Bitcoin maintains a record of every transaction in its Blockchain.\n\"People often have this impression that if you take payments in Bitcoin you're creating a cash economy, under the table, can't be monitored by government. That's not true at all. It is transparent on the Blockchain. If you are doing something bad with Bitcoin you should be able to be caught.\"\nWhile this is true of Bitcoin, it is not the case with every other cryptocurrency, some of which are designed to be anonymous.\nSo the big risk is not when businesses agree to take Bitcoin, like this labour hire firm has. (\"You could be forgiven for thinking that accepting Bitcoin payments is a publicity stunt,\" the firm's website says, insisting it will actually be efficient. However, you can check its Bitcoin address on the Blockchain and see that no customers have paid bitcoin to that address yet).\nThe big risk is when the guy who is installing your new kitchen asks if he can be paid in anonymous cryptocurrencies like Monero or Dash. That's when the government's cash ban could really backfire.

Subverting SWIFT\nFounded by German Radoslav Albrecht, Bitbond is an online bank which now affords its customers the ability to transfer loans internationally — specifically, by using Bitcoin.\nThe platform uses Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to subvert SWIFT — the self-proclaimed world’s leading provider of secure financial messaging services — by lending money around the world instantly and at virtually no cost. Albrecht explained to Reuters TV :\nTraditional money transfers are relatively costly due to currency exchange fees, and can take up to a few days. With Bitbond, payments work independently of where customers are. Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.\nWhat makes this service even more remarkable is the fact that Bitbond became an officially licensed bank in 2016. How it Works\nBitbond works by letting clients hold their loans in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies for extremely short periods of time before they are exchanged back into the receiving countries’ native fiat currency. This method keeps exchange rates relatively fixed and prevents the cryptocurrency market’s infamous volatility from undermining the process.\nAs noted by Reuters , this isn’t the first time Bitcoin has been used as loan collateral. However, Bitbond is reportedly the first to offer the transfer of credit in currency internationally. As such, the company has become increasingly popular since it originally launched in 2013 — currently managing 100 clients’ loans for a rough total of $1 million each month.\nThe majority of said clients, Albrecht told Reuters , are small business owners or freelance workers, while the loans are less than $50,000 each. Germany Loves Bitcoin\nAs a side note, Germans have been particularly keen on adopting Bitcoin. According to Bitnodes, Germany has the second most Bitcoin nodes in the world — behind only the U.S.\nHowever, authorities in the European country haven’t historically been too keen on cryptocurrency. In February, interim German Finance Minister Peter Altmaier signed a letter to fellow G20 finance ministers, in which he claimed cryptocurrencies are not only risky for investors but also threaten long-term global financial stability.\nNevertheless, Germany did join 21 of its European neighbors in signing a Declaration on the Establishment of a European Blockchain Partnership on April 10.\nWhat do you think about a certified online bank subverting SWIFT by sending loans internationally with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?

Assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash are all seriously in the red, having dropped anywhere from a few hundred dollars to over $1,000 since experiencing monthly highs last week.\nThe price of Bitcoin has fallen dramatically over the last 24 hours. At press time, the currency is wallowing at $8,477 – roughly $600 less than where it stood yesterday afternoon. Prior to that, the currency had experienced a weekend high of $9,800 but subsequently dropped to $9,500 and $9,300 respectively within a 48-hour period.\nThis ultimately marks a $1,200 drop in only five days.

She explained on CNBC ‘s “Squawk Box” on Thursday:\nAs a payment system, I think it’s troubling, because the foundation of the banking system is on the transparency between the sender and the receiver, and cryptocurrency is designed to be nothing of the sort. In fact [it’s] designed to be not transparent.\nBessant has apparently never visited one of the many websites tracking Bitcoin’s very public ledger . If she had, she might realize that it’s extremely transparent – significantly more so than private banking ledgers. Nevertheless, Bessant claims police forces are incapable of tracking criminal transactions on the public ledger, stating:\nThe way we sort of quote-unquote catch bad guys is by being transparent in the financial moment of money. Cryptos is the antithesis of that.\nBank of America is one of the many institutions which banned cryptocurrency purchases via credit card. She explained:\nJust like we don’t allow stocks to be purchased on our credit cards, we’re not going to allow cryptos or other currencies to be purchased on our credit cards.\nBessant also took the time to praise traditional banking’s security, stating:\nI do actually think we’re in a better position every day. Awareness is higher, the sophistication of our defense and detection efforts are growing every day. There are more players in the mix with a lot of expertise, and the threat environment is beginning to show patterns that make prediction and even automated prediction something we can do every day. So I do believe we’re in a better place. ‘It’s Never Going to Work’\nBank of America’s CTO isn’t the only one throwing FUD at Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nEconomist Nouriel Roubini, most widely known for correctly predicting the global financial crisis, claimed digital currencies create “chaos” in the world of traditional payments. He explained at the Fluidity Summit in Brooklyn on Thursday:\nIt’s totally inefficient. It’s never going to work. You are going to the world of the Flintstones to buy any good you have to exchange, you go back to the Stone Age of bartering.\nAs noted by CNBC , Roubini loves digital payment platforms like Alipay, Venmo, PayPal, and Square. Interestingly, he doesn’t think blockchain technology will have any significant impact on the future of finance He stated:\nI’m affirmative on that significant disruption, but most of this has nothing to do with blockchain, nothing to do with cryptocurrency.\nDo you agree that blockchain technology won’t have a future in the financial sector? Do you think cryptocurrencies are preventing authorities from catching criminals? Or do you think both of these experts are mistaken?

May 13, 2018 12:46 PM by Phoenix Capita… - May 12, 2018 10:57 am\nLet’s talk about Gold as an actual investment in our current debt-based financial system. May 12, 2018 10:57 AM 0 SHARES\n( Global Intel Hub ) -- 5/12/2018 -- Bitcoin is now the talk of the town (Wall St.) and yet we don't know who created it. There's lots of theories, but we haven't seen any documented evidence. Having experience in this business looking at the FX markets melt down over the last 10 years in a fraud climax, we wrote Splitting Pennies and explained the world isn't as it seems . That was before Bitcoin. Because like for any investment you want to do your due diligence, we started peeling back this onion and wanted to start from inception - and find out who created this (as just like with any investment analysis, it's another data point). What we found was astonishing - nothing! No documents, no photographs, no reports, from Satoshi. Whoever it was created a real pseudonym in order to mask their real identity. But why? Now the value of Satoshi's original coins would be in the tens of billions - why not claim them? It is our logic that it can only be someone or some group connected to the US Government, an employee perhaps - not necessarily that Bitcoin is the brainchild of the government, although that is possible as NSA has the best mathematicians in the world. We compiled this research into our leading hypothesis in an article here: EXPOSED: The real creator of Bitcoin is likely the NSA as One World Currency\nOur point is not that we know 100% that this is the case, simply that it's the most plausible story, and we haven't uncovered any evidence to the contrary. Lots of people have different opinions, but they haven't produced any document proving otherwise. So we wrote the NSA and asked them, did you create Bitcoin? Hey, we are taxpayers. They work for us. Don't forget that! Their response was not surprising, they said \"That's Classified\" -\nWhile this is no surprise what we have started is a paper trail, hopefully that will lead to the revealing of the creator or creators of Bitcoin. For those who are not from the financial services community, it is important to note why anyone would go through such trouble - it's called due diligence. When investors make investments they want to know every single detail about that investment. Some of these DD questionnaires can be 100 pages they can have 300 questions! It can take months, require multiple flesh meetings, they may bring in external advisers - it may seem like a circus but if someone is investing $100 Million then it's really the least one can do. Anyway, do Bitcoin investors really understand what they are getting themselves into?\nThis article deserves a full read: Bitcoin Founder Satoshi Nakamoto was probably an NSA Employee — and the NSA may destroy Bitcoin Bitcoin has a huge risk few consider: it can be destroyed overnight\nMy second NSA related theory and prediction, is that the NSA will be tasked to take down Bitcoin. While relative to the Internet, blockchain is very secure and effectively unhackable for a criminal group — it is in fact quite capable of being cheated and manipulated if you have enough computing power. NSA probably has plenty of computing power and expertise to take the Bitcoin blockchain down. Why would the NSA want to take down Bitcoin? What NSA wants is irrelevant — it’s what government leaders want. And there are many scenarios that could lead to an order to take the Bitcoin blockchain down, with either minor disruption (letting it come back with just a few accounts robbed) or totally destroyed (stealing from many accounts and screwing it up so badly it is impossible to restore):\n1. North Korea is a major owner, user, exploiter (for computer ransomware) of Bitcoin. As a sanction, punishment, or means of waging war, NSA could be ordered to rob accounts suspected of being NK owned.[1]\n2. Bitcoin and many of its owners and advocates are Libertarian and anti-government. Bitcoin is an affront to national “fiat” currencies and handy for evading government rules and taxes. Big Government is very motivated to destroy Bitcoin.\n3. Bitcoin has been used as ransom payments for computer hacking. I predict it will soon be used for human ransom as well. Rather than the high risk of transferring dollars, kidnappers may demand digital payment in Bitcoin. This could be a motivation, or excuse, for Big Government to take Bitcoin down.\nChina or Russia also have the computing power to take down Bitcoin, and may want to do so. Why? China has outlawed Bitcoin, may want to take North Korea’s wealth down a peg (keeping them more dependent on China), and could make a huge profit doing this.\nThe point is that it is 1) POSSIBLE and 2) NOT PROBABLE this is a low-probability high-impact event but one that any Bitcoin investor needs to understand - it is possible. Just as it was very weird and surprising how Bitcoin suddenly rose to 20,000 it certainly is possible, that it can really go to zero. Not because of selling but because the network can be brought down. Whether NSA created Bitcoin or not is really irrelevant, they are the only agency in the world with the computing power and intellectual human capital (Cryptographers) capable of 1) understanding Bitcoin and 2) through their surveillance network identifying the real Satoshi if it was in fact NOT NSA and 3) Capable of actually monitoring Bitcoin users and identifying a real human based on Stylometry, a technique for analyzing big data.\nTo understand how the NSA really operates, they record both data and raw data such as encrypted and un-encrypted internet traffic IN BULK for later analysis. The computing power of the NSA is ridiculous, China and Russia don't come close, nor do any corporations.\nGoing back to their answer; what did we expect them to say? Yes, we did it? Well if they did it certainly would be easy to say it, they have thousands of active projects who cares about MONKEYROCKET. NSA was created and NSA can be destroyed, if it no longer serves the purpose for which it was originally intended. And practically if NSA was doing useful projects like Bitcoin it may be a benefit to their argument proving the need for their existence. As most of us know, there are no real enemies anymore to fight, so having such a big and complex military intelligence apparatus is harder and harder to justify as the new generation of global idiots gets more and more peaceful and dumbed down.\nSo, we'll appeal it, but will likely get another canned response. In the meantime, we ask anyone who has any documents pertaining to the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto to come forward.\nBloc10 is releasing this week Blockpad software; Blockpad is a private encrypted personal ledger, notepad, password manager, secure browser to access exchanges, one time pad, and more.

Exchanges such as Bitfinance (Private) Limited (Golix) and Styx24 are not licensed or regulated by the Reserve Bank.”\nHe said the Reserve Bank will continue to closely monitor regional and global cryptocurrency developments in order to inform policy direction.”\nLocally, the largest cryptocurrency exchange is Golix which is registered under Bitfinance (Private) Limited.-Newsday Share this:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "norman mataruka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mataruka", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "the reserve bank of zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rbz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reserve bank of z", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "zimbabwe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T12:45:03.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "87e71bf5df58fec821c800fc2aa4f9f0d8fba9eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqsxUkjV1Gvi6jERETdqPylwT8xhxZrtst3a6KUY.xFxeOZ7NgPmFyi1Ef7gRv2h8z8XPJpTjQmo83SpDJuzSVg58T6137rnTo-", "site_full": "blog.naver.com", "site": "naver.com", "site_section": "https://openapi.naver.com/v1/search/blog?query=i&start=17&sort=date&display=100", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "[twitter 검색 May-12, 23시] bitcoin", "title_full": "[twitter 검색 May-12, 23시] bitcoin : 네이버 블로그", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "KR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://blogimgs.naver.net/nblog/mylog/post/og_default_image_160610.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 89, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "87e71bf5df58fec821c800fc2aa4f9f0d8fba9eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCqsxUkjV1Gvi6jERETdqPylwT8xhxZrtst3a6KUY.xFxeOZ7NgPmFyi1Ef7gRv2h8z8XPJpTjQmo83SpDJuzSVg58T6137rnTo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "NORAZO", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "[twitter 검색 May-12, 23시] bitcoin", "text": "가상화폐 [twitter 검색 May-12, 23시] bitcoin 2시간 전 URL 복사 본문 기타 기능 번역보기 머신 러닝을 통한 분석 Google Blogger(개발중)\n2018-05-12 14:55:39 RT @omusubiTRX: ドイツオンラインバンクのニュース オンラインバンクでビットコイン建のローン貸出サービス開始。 世界中のどこに居てもローンが組めるし、swift送金じゃないからコストも超低額で済む。 顧客のBTC保有するの数秒から数分だからボラで顧客が糞喰ら…\n2018-05-12 14:55:38 Nouveau post Tumblr ZeTop : \"Initiation à la crypto-monnaie, au Bitcoin et à la Blockchain\" https://t.co/csZXILN5s2\n2018-05-12 14:55:37 RT @ChainberryNews: #Blockchain Boom #Neuerscheinung.

The case has been listed for further hearing on May 17, 2018.\n“Banking is an essential service. How can one deny access to an essential service when I’m not doing anything illegal? You have not declared VCs ( virtual currencies ) illegal in the country,” said one of the petitioners requesting anonymity.\nThe Reserve bank of India on April 6, 2018 mandated banks, e-wallets, and payment gateway providers to withdraw support for cryptocurrency exchanges and other businesses dealing with virtual currencies in India.\nThe writ petition filed by a group of eleven different representatives from various crypto related businesses challenges the constitutionality validity of the RBI’s decision.\nThe petition came up for hearing before the court of the Chief Justice of India on May 11, 2018. The Supreme Court issued notices to the RBI and Union of India after hearing the petition. The matter has been listed for further hearing on May 17, 2018.\nA writ petition is usually filed for the speedy review of an issue. The RBI’s circular mandates financial institutions to block services by July 5, 2018 putting crypto-related businesses in a spot. In this case, the writ is primarily to see if the government action is constitutionally sound.\nThe writ petition - Rajdeep Singh v. Reserve Bank of India - is the fourth in the series of writ petitions against the RBI for blocking off banking services to cryptocurrency exchanges in India.\nOn April 6, 2018, Kali Digital Eco-systems Pvt. Ltd. which runs the exchange CoinRecoil filed a writ in the Delhi High Court on the grounds that the RBI circular infringes on their right to trade, that is guaranteed in our constitution.\nA while after, another exchange moneytradecoin.com approached the High Court of Delhi challenging the RBI Circular. The Delhi High Court has clubbed these two cases that will come up for hearing on May 24, 2018.\nOn May 8, another joint writ petition was filed by four cryptocurrency exchanges in the Supreme Court against the RBI circular.\nThe Indian government has set up a committee under Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs that is currently working on a framework to regulate cryptocurrencies. The committee is yet to come out with its decision.\n“The RBI has given an affidavit saying that there is a committee at the highest level in the Finance Ministry examining virtual currencies.. Coming up with a circular while awaiting a decision has a chilling effect on any kind of business dealing with virtual currencies,” the petitioner said.\nThe move by RBI has already resulted in the flight of many Indian blockchain startups and cryptocurrency exchanges. Many more are mulling the move to crypto-friendly nations like Australia, Estonia, Cayman Islands, Australia and the like.\nThe newest petition was tagged with two pending writ petitions filed in public interest. The two pending writs filed last year pertain to deciding the legality/illegality of cryptocurrencies in India.\nSenior Advocate K.V.Viswanathan, and advocate Nakul Dewan, briefed by law firm TRA Law, appeared on behalf of the petitioners before a bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, and Justice D.Y. Chandrachud.\n0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/eleven-individuals-approach-supreme-court-challenging-rbi-circular-blocking-banking-services-for-bitcoin-businesses/articleshow/64144513.cms&title=11", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=11"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "union of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank of india", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-13T08:38:12.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d679130f2ef2961465d5143ef6d4cd99ad14834e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqazgbqv1Do_h3DD6obploBKdH2tuluwNWYNGpzWJeHX6YEcZi5IR0hpBt05Ll53KY3mZoAbNoLycneK7qMAm9qzA--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "", "title": "CBS Gives Cryptocurrency YouTuber His Own Bitcoin Show : CryptoCurrency", "title_full": "CBS Gives Cryptocurrency YouTuber His Own Bitcoin Show : CryptoCurrency", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.redditmedia.com/giXbYcWfnQ1gLlQ6jdlDsyNYnXSAS4gFev_hDj3-5X8.jpg?w=320&amp;s=afb406e466da713e9ad92a32e08c6d2b", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d679130f2ef2961465d5143ef6d4cd99ad14834e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSb6YSL21UuCC9QPfwa1nB9HlE2GRh2hqazgbqv1Do_h3DD6obploBKdH2tuluwNWYNGpzWJeHX6YEcZi5IR0hpBt05Ll53KY3mZoAbNoLycneK7qMAm9qzA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "CBS Gives Cryptocurrency YouTuber His Own Bitcoin Show : CryptoCurrency", "text": "\nr/Bitcoin r/Ethereum r/Ripple r/BitcoinCash r/Litecoin r/Cardano r/NEO r/Stellar r/EOS r/Iota Welcome\nWelcome to /r/CryptoCurrency .

Per Sputnik’s source:\n“It all began after Vinnik’s extradition to the United States was blocked. There people who are extremely interested in him not coming to Russia. The assassination was ordered by some unknown person from Russia.”\nThe murder plot, the source added, isn’t connected to any special services, as it is “linked to the criminal world.” It added that it all began when Vinnik’s extradition to the United States was blocked, as there are individuals who are “extremely interested in him not coming to Russia.” Per his words, the assassination plot was ordered by someone in Russia.\nNotably, Vinnik reportedly wrote an acknowledgement of guilt in Russia, and is set to testify in the country to assist investigators. This, after he admitted to knowing about crimes “committed in the sphere of financial technologies.”\nThe Russian national’s lawyers, in response to the situation, stated:\n“Such statement should be investigated via a proper procedure, rather than through public statements and discussions.”\nAs covered by CCN, Vinnik was arrested at the request of the US government. At the time, it was believed he was BTC-e’s chief executive, but the exchange soon denied he was even an employee there , while Vinnik claimed innocence .\nFor a time, Vinnik’s future was thrown into turmoil , as he and his lawyers argued he should stand trial in Russia, while a Greek court agreed to a US extradition request. His fate was in the hands of Greece’s Minister of Justice, Nikos Paraskevopoulos.\nAt the time of Vinnik’s arrest, BTC-e’s domain was seized and taken down. The embattled exchange managed to come back online , and rebranded to WEX. WEX has, as covered, seen its share of controversy as some of its users’ funds were stuck in limbo, while the company blamed a third party .

But he goes on to explain that he is familiar with the concept of “Bitcookie.”\n“Me know about Bitcookie. Me know that me have cookie and me do this. That me bit cookie.”\nCookie Monster then goes on to talk about self-regulation — a key topic of discussion within the nascent cryptocurrency indsutry. He confesses that he has an issue with regulating himself. He explains, if he sees a cookie he’s not supposed to eat, he takes a step back and looks away. Then, he would eventually eat it.\n“Me, OK, me do have issues with controlling meself. Fruit, cookie, fruit, cookie. Ah. This tough decision. So me got strategies me use to help me to control meself. Well, what me like to um, to control meself, me sometimes like to take deep breath. And it calm youself down. So like, if me saw a cookie right there, and me wanted to eat said cookie, me would just kind of take a little step back, maybe distract meself, maybe look away. No see cookie. Maybe sing a song.

Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.\"\nClients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally.\nAlbrecht's service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013. His office employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month.\nMost clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don't exceed 50,000 dollars. In 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since.\nAdoption of Bitcoin has been rapid in Germany. It trails only the U.S., according to Bitnodes, which tracks the location of all the Bitcoin nodes that transmit data about new transactions.\n(Writing by Laura Dubois,; Editing by Joseph Nasr and Matthew Mpoke Bigg) More From Technology ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "radoslav albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prenzlauer berg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters tv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de berlin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T14:58:13.069+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f52d976cdd09c37b11afa3db1f484ecf84d9bac8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Udv9x6MIntCZkUNaH0BDFRUvTlLvcZ1hbNuSqvSFFCIl16hkvv52QcxAt57w6f5Xye1V6huwNu1MATYCDReggHM2atA5Ppp_0GLQhWEjRs60p7r.5.anysEHKkxpU9D6oM-", "site_full": "deadline.com", "site": "deadline.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "television", "movies", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "Trailer For Blockchain Doc ‘Beyond Bitcoin’ About Cryptocurrency At Cannes | Deadline", "title_full": "Trailer For Blockchain Doc ‘Beyond Bitcoin’ About Cryptocurrency At Cannes | Deadline", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/blockchain.jpg?w=605", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3087, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 66, "comments": 0, "shares": 66}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f52d976cdd09c37b11afa3db1f484ecf84d9bac8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Udv9x6MIntCZkUNaH0BDFRUvTlLvcZ1hbNuSqvSFFCIl16hkvv52QcxAt57w6f5Xye1V6huwNu1MATYCDReggHM2atA5Ppp_0GLQhWEjRs60p7r.5.anysEHKkxpU9D6oM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Andreas Wiseman", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Trailer For Blockchain Doc ‘Beyond Bitcoin’ About Cryptocurrency At Cannes | Deadline", "text": "0 Fulwell 73\nEXCLUSIVE : Here’s the first teaser trailer for the documentary Beyond Bitcoin , which was acquired this week by new streaming platform Binge , owned by blockchain firm Slate Entertainment Group .

The film is set to be released on the Binge platform in March 2019.\nSEG is in Cannes looking to beef up its “B-VOD” roster and during the festival the firm announced a tie-up with the Sitges International Film Festival for the latter to become the first movie fest to accept cryptocurrency. The company has just released a promotional video fronted by The 100 and Okja actor Dylan Bostick about the firm, which looks like it wants to be the Netflix of cryptocurrency.\nBlockchain has been one of the watchwords of this year’s Cannes Film Festival. Entertainment companies looking to use virtual currency are springing up left right and center.

Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.\"\nClients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally.\nAlbrecht's service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013. His office employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month.\nMost clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don't exceed 50,000 dollars. In 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since.\nAdoption of Bitcoin has been rapid in Germany. It trails only the U.S., according to Bitnodes, which tracks the location of all the Bitcoin nodes that transmit data about new transactions.\n(Writing by Laura Dubois,; Editing by Joseph Nasr and Matthew Mpoke Bigg) More From Technology ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "radoslav albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prenzlauer berg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters tv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de berlin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T16:19:59.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a18df433698d111e23328839c5b1adbde6d9f002", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mRlktelIWA5BP_k_YHtoeI1iw4O4jxm2AQaB7LY.E2z46cqbzKU1P_Jgu5MrJbyW0OK7dvt0.pGNSgP0_oIRFLYgUTQROxz6dMOVKqhcbPzvkl9votlzsVX6gLbpyXfvzg-", "site_full": "1bitcoindaily.com", "site": "1bitcoindaily.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "‘Almost Irresponsible’ to Not Invest in Bitcoin: Billionaire Mike Novogratz – 1 Bitcoin daily", "title_full": "‘Almost Irresponsible’ to Not Invest in Bitcoin: Billionaire Mike Novogratz – 1 Bitcoin daily", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.006, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a18df433698d111e23328839c5b1adbde6d9f002", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/TaKCxb4j0mRlktelIWA5BP_k_YHtoeI1iw4O4jxm2AQaB7LY.E2z46cqbzKU1P_Jgu5MrJbyW0OK7dvt0.pGNSgP0_oIRFLYgUTQROxz6dMOVKqhcbPzvkl9votlzsVX6gLbpyXfvzg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "View All Posts", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "‘Almost Irresponsible’ to Not Invest in Bitcoin: Billionaire Mike Novogratz – 1 Bitcoin daily", "text": "1 Bitcoin daily ‘Almost Irresponsible’ to Not Invest in Bitcoin : Billionaire Mike Novogratz Billionaire bitcoin bull Michael Novogratz, founder and CEO of Galaxy Digital Capital Management, says every investor should have 1% to 2% of their ...

Bitmain’s Antminer Z9 Mini Designed to Mine Zcash, Threatens ASIC Resistance\nBitmain announced, via Twitter, the release of its new Antminer Z9 mini, an ASIC miner capable of mining any cryptocurrency running the Equihash proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm. This includes, most notably, Zcash , which is a decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency designed to offer users complete privacy in transactions. Zcash has always used the Equihash PoW mining algorithm to prevent the progress of Zcash ASIC miners and has predominantly been mined by general-purpose GPU chips.\nThe development of ASIC hardware is causing some cryptocurrencies to change their proof-of-work mining algorithm. Bitcoin Gold has a hard fork coming to defeat it and Monero has already modified their mining algorithm to counter ASIC hardware. GlobalData: South Korea Among the World’s Leading Markets for Blockchain Technology\nAccording to analytics firm GlobalData , South Korea has become a leader in the blockchain community. Businesses like Korea Telecom are already working to determine how the blockchain can be used to lessen production expenses and generate new types of revenue. Representatives of the South Korean telephone giant have already joined with Sprint and Japan’s SoftBank to launch a “blockchain-powered data roaming service” in the coming weeks. Executives say the company has big plans to use the blockchain to power “finance, IoT, smart energy and healthcare businesses.”\nSouth Korea is also attracting businesses from neighboring countries like Japan, whose social messaging platform Line is set to launch a blockchain subsidiary known as Unblock within South Korea’s borders. The purpose of the subsidiary will be to further study the blockchain and determine how it can best be applied to the company’s remaining divisions. As the nation leads the blockchain revolution, neighboring regions are also taking the bait and looking into how blockchain technology can best be utilized to further cement operational security and efficiency. NYT Report: Parent Company to NYSE Is Planning a Bitcoin Exchange\nIntercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), wants to establish its own cryptocurrency exchange. According to New York Times (NYT) sources, ICE has been in talks with legacy banks and financial institutions to facilitate swap contracts for potential bitcoin trading. These contracts would essentially allow banks to buy contracts for bitcoin, giving the exchange sure anchors of liquidity. Once an exchange user buys one of these contracts, cash changes hands and the corresponding bitcoin would appear in their wallet the next day. The report reveals that the exchange, which would be built with “large investors” in mind, would permit direct bitcoin trading, not futures contracts as we’ve seen with the CBOE and CME. CDX Brings Inaugural Blockchain Summit to New York\nThe latest installment of the Chief Digital Officer Global Forum (CDX) summit series will be held in New York on May 11, 2018. Established in 2013, the summit has set up shop in Chicago, San Francisco, Singapore and, most recently, Las Vegas, with focuses on emerging innovations in mobile, IoT and digital advertising technologies.\nThis latest installment will concentrate on advancements in blockchain technology and its application to traditional industries. To this end, the CDX Blockchain Brand Innovation Summit has an extensive list of speakers and panelists both from within and without the blockchain space, featuring representatives from the likes of Hulu, CNBC, IBM and BTC Media. Breaking Bitcoin Conference Heading for Lisbon This Summer as “Building on Bitcoin”\nThe Breaking Bitcoin conference, first organized last summer in Paris, is returning for its second edition under the name “ Building on Bitcoin ,” this time in Lisbon, July 3–4, 2018. While the event in the French capital was centered around security, the one in the Portuguese capital will focus on second-layer technologies and other creative uses of the Bitcoin protocol.\nBuilding on Bitcoin will focus on second-layer technologies in a broad sense. The best known and most popular of these is probably the Lightning Network , of which the first implementations entered their beta stage over the past couple of months. But other areas of research and development include different types of sidechains like Liquid , RSK or drivechains ; privacy technologies like TumbleBit ; smart contract solutions like MAST ; and more.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .

All over the world miners have set up operations, big and small, as they look to capitalize on dwindling Bitcoin rewards from processing transactions and validating the blockchain .\nWith plenty at stake, the costs of setting up even a small operation can be hefty, from the actual hardware to cooling systems and electricity consumption. However, those with enough capital to buy the best hardware, namely ASIC miners, put themselves in a commanding position.\nBut that also makes them a target for criminals. Whether these crooks want to hack your system and steal your valuable cryptocurrency or make off with your physical hardware, the potential dangers are real.\nThe latter scenario grabbed headlines this month, as over 600 computers used to mine Bitcoin have been seized in China, valued at over $2 mln alone. From Iceland to China?\nThe seized equipment is being linked to a series of thefts in Iceland late last year. Three separate incidents spanning from December to January led to a total of 600 computers being stolen by a number of culprits.\nThe Associated Press reported that eleven people were initially arrested, while two men were kept in custody for the burglaries — one of which took place in January at a data center that was housing computers used for Bitcoin mining.\nIcelandic IT firm Advania produced surveillance footage of thieves stealing computers from a data center in Reykjanesbær in January, which positively identified the two men that were in custody, according to local news outlet Visir.\nIn April, one of the culprits managed to escape from custody and fled to Sweden using a fake passport to board a flight to Stockholm. Sindri Þór Stefánsson later said he would return to Iceland in a statement. He claimed he had the right to travel at the time since his custody ruling had expired on April 16.\nTo date, Icelandic authorities have been unable to trace the stolen equipment. Police had asked IT service providers, electricians, and storage units in the country to report any unusual spikes in power use in the hopes they could track down the stolen mining computers.\nTwo months later, Chinese police seized 600 computers in Tianjin in what seems to be more than just a crazy coincidence. The operation caught the attention of Tianjin police after the local power grid operator reported abnormal electricity usage at the location where the equipment was being operated.\nGiven that the number of computers is exactly the same, there’s a good possibility they could be the PCs from Iceland. Icelandic police have reached out to Chinese authorities to try and link the two cases. Still need to be connected\nIcelandic authorities are still waiting on their Chinese counterparts to respond to their requests for collaboration. If and when they do, it shouldn’t be difficult to link the computer equipment at the very least. Given that the computers were stolen from Advania’s data center, it’s almost certain that the serial numbers of components will be available.\nThis could then be cross-checked with the computers seized in Tianjin to positively link the hardware. While the owners of the hardware will no doubt be pleased to recover their property, the investigation has the potential to uncover a nefarious crime syndicate.\nIcelandic police commissioner Olafur Helgi Kjartansson was quoted saying, “This is a grand theft on a scale unseen before,” adding that it was a “highly organized crime”. With numerous suspects being investigated in both China and Iceland, authorities have the chance to apprehend criminals that are preying on the cryptocurrency community.\nCoinCapPrice CoinCapPrice – Cryptocurrency Market Capitalizations, The latest Bitcoin price for today (up to the minute).

Now users on both platforms can upload pictures, video, and even torrent magnets found on the Pirate Bay.\nAlso Read: Trading Cryptocurrencies Like a Boss Takes Time and Research Memo and Blockpress\nSo far over the past couple of weeks, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) supporters have been utilizing two specific BCH-powered social media platforms — Blockpress and Memo. The Memo application arrived on the scene first during the second week of April offering BCH users the ability to write 77 character-long phrases using an on-chain method called an OP_Return transaction . Every action on Memo utilizes a transaction and an extremely small fraction of BCH and over the past few weeks; Memo has added a bunch of new features. The Memo app keeps adding features like topics, archived, personalized, and a new post feed.\nAt the end of April news.Bitcoin.com reported on Memo adding additional features like replies, emojis, and a counter for typing. The platform was getting a lot of use seeing more than 3,000 transactions in one day when the developers added the ‘reply’ feature. Now the Memo programmers have added a ‘ Topics ’ section a place where people can discuss specific subjects such as adding a dislike button to Memo, Christianity, BCH price predictions, flat earth conspiracies, and any topic that’s trending on the application. Memo Images, Video, and Pirate Bay Magnets\nMoreover, on May 10, the Memo development team added image and Youtube video support to the platform. This means Memo users can upload a picture or their favorite Youtube video utilizing an on-chain BCH transaction. The very next day a user implemented a live stream video over the BCH chain using Webtorrent, Memo.cash, and Blockpress . Another added a Pirate Bay torrent magnet using Memo as well in hopes the application can be used for an “uncensorable Pirate Bay.” Blockpress Also Adds Video and Images, and Says More Features to Come After the May 15 BCH Upgrade\nThen on May 2, another on-chain BCH powered social media application was launched called Blockpress . When Blockpress launched, news.Bitcoin.com spoke with the platform’s developer who calls himself ‘Attila’ and is a big believer in the future of BCH. At launch, Blockpress offered a similar Memo-like platform but looked like a Twitter UI and had the ability to add an avatar picture, and profile cover photo. Just like Memo, the Blockpress platform enables the ability to publish 77 characters via the Bitcoin Cash network. Blockpress provides the ability to add images and videos.\nThen three days ago the Blockpress developer added the ability to add images to posts, a notification feed, community topics , and a sidebar of your followed profiles on Blockpress. Just like the Memo application, a bunch of people are testing out the platform’s newest features. Further, Attila says after the May 15 BCH upgrade the Blockpress platform will have the ability to upload much longer content (Tumblr style — via IPFS and also a 220-byte OP_Return update on May 15). Blockpress feed and the developer has added a community section as well.\nSo far on both platforms, there’s a lot of users sharing their thoughts and content with Memo taking the lead on users since it was launched two weeks before Blockpress. Both BCH-based applications seem to be following a competitive path towards adding new features like images and videos. It will be interesting to see what kind of capabilities Memo and Blockpress get after the upgrade next week.\nWhat do you think about the new features on Memo and Blockpress? Have you tested any of these platforms yet? Let us know in the comments below.\nImages via Shutterstock, Blockpress, and Memo.\nHave you seen our new page, Satoshi Pulse ?

Bitmain’s Antminer Z9 Mini Designed to Mine Zcash, Threatens ASIC Resistance\nBitmain announced, via Twitter, the release of its new Antminer Z9 mini, an ASIC miner capable of mining any cryptocurrency running the Equihash proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm. This includes, most notably, Zcash , which is a decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency designed to offer users complete privacy in transactions. Zcash has always used the Equihash PoW mining algorithm to prevent the progress of Zcash ASIC miners and has predominantly been mined by general-purpose GPU chips.\nThe development of ASIC hardware is causing some cryptocurrencies to change their proof-of-work mining algorithm. Bitcoin Gold has a hard fork coming to defeat it and Monero has already modified their mining algorithm to counter ASIC hardware. GlobalData: South Korea Among the World’s Leading Markets for Blockchain Technology\nAccording to analytics firm GlobalData , South Korea has become a leader in the blockchain community. Businesses like Korea Telecom are already working to determine how the blockchain can be used to lessen production expenses and generate new types of revenue. Representatives of the South Korean telephone giant have already joined with Sprint and Japan’s SoftBank to launch a “blockchain-powered data roaming service” in the coming weeks. Executives say the company has big plans to use the blockchain to power “finance, IoT, smart energy and healthcare businesses.”\nSouth Korea is also attracting businesses from neighboring countries like Japan, whose social messaging platform Line is set to launch a blockchain subsidiary known as Unblock within South Korea’s borders. The purpose of the subsidiary will be to further study the blockchain and determine how it can best be applied to the company’s remaining divisions. As the nation leads the blockchain revolution, neighboring regions are also taking the bait and looking into how blockchain technology can best be utilized to further cement operational security and efficiency. NYT Report: Parent Company to NYSE Is Planning a Bitcoin Exchange\nIntercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), wants to establish its own cryptocurrency exchange. According to New York Times (NYT) sources, ICE has been in talks with legacy banks and financial institutions to facilitate swap contracts for potential bitcoin trading. These contracts would essentially allow banks to buy contracts for bitcoin, giving the exchange sure anchors of liquidity. Once an exchange user buys one of these contracts, cash changes hands and the corresponding bitcoin would appear in their wallet the next day. The report reveals that the exchange, which would be built with “large investors” in mind, would permit direct bitcoin trading, not futures contracts as we’ve seen with the CBOE and CME. CDX Brings Inaugural Blockchain Summit to New York\nThe latest installment of the Chief Digital Officer Global Forum (CDX) summit series will be held in New York on May 11, 2018. Established in 2013, the summit has set up shop in Chicago, San Francisco, Singapore and, most recently, Las Vegas, with focuses on emerging innovations in mobile, IoT and digital advertising technologies.\nThis latest installment will concentrate on advancements in blockchain technology and its application to traditional industries. To this end, the CDX Blockchain Brand Innovation Summit has an extensive list of speakers and panelists both from within and without the blockchain space, featuring representatives from the likes of Hulu, CNBC, IBM and BTC Media. Breaking Bitcoin Conference Heading for Lisbon This Summer as “Building on Bitcoin”\nThe Breaking Bitcoin conference, first organized last summer in Paris, is returning for its second edition under the name “ Building on Bitcoin ,” this time in Lisbon, July 3–4, 2018. While the event in the French capital was centered around security, the one in the Portuguese capital will focus on second-layer technologies and other creative uses of the Bitcoin protocol.\nBuilding on Bitcoin will focus on second-layer technologies in a broad sense. The best known and most popular of these is probably the Lightning Network , of which the first implementations entered their beta stage over the past couple of months. But other areas of research and development include different types of sidechains like Liquid , RSK or drivechains ; privacy technologies like TumbleBit ; smart contract solutions like MAST ; and more.

It is possible to digitize, code and insert practically any document into the blockchain. Doing so creates an indelible record that cannot be changed; furthermore, the record’s authenticity can be verified by the entire community using the blockchain instead of a single centralized authority.\nHow Blockchain works?\nA network of so-called computing nodes makes up the Blockchain. Let’s read how it works:-\n1. A transaction between two parties occur 2.The transaction is then added to the online transaction ledger encrypted with a digital security code. 3. The code is then sent to the large network where the authenticity of the code is confirmed without compromising private information and eliminating the need for a central authority to confirm the transaction. 4. Once the transaction is confirmed and validated by several parties, it exists on the ledger or each other as a permanent and immutable record of the transaction. 5. The transaction information is recorded in a public ledger and the transaction is completed. Blockchain & Bitcoin The blockchain is perhaps the main technological innovation of Bitcoin. Bitcoin isn’t regulated by a central authority. Instead, its users dictate and validate transactions when one person pays another for goods or services, eliminating the need for a third party to process or store payments. The completed transaction is publicly recorded into blocks and eventually into the blockchain, where it’s verified and relayed by other Bitcoin users. Benefits of Blockchain. The benefits of Blockchain are more than big enough to sustain its relevance for generations to come. Currently, Blockchain is majorly used by finance and banking sector but its going to spread its tentacles of blocks to almost all sectors in future. Let’s have a look at its benefits- Trustworthy System : Allows the user to verify the transaction without third party interruption. Transparency : The distributed ledger structure gives the control of all their information and transactions to the users. Faster Transactions : Blockchain transactions can reduce transaction times to minutes and are processed 24/7.

The plan is worth a mention, especially on the backdrop of the crypto ban imposed by the social media network. In Saturday’s Bitcoin in Brief, we also cover Telegram’s advance towards implementing its payment system using the Gram token. Some blockchain stories with beers and beamers complete today’s round-up.\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Friday: China Mulls Blockchain Standard, Zcash Fights Chinese ASICs\nFacebook Mulls Own Token, Reports Say\nFacebook is reportedly considering creating its own cryptocurrency. Sources familiar with the matter told the financial news outlet Cheddar that the social media giant is serious about the project to introduce global crypto payments on its platform. A digital token would allow its two billion users around the world to take advantage of crypto transactions and skip state-issued fiat currencies.\nFacebook announced recently that it had formed a team whose main task will be to explore the uses for blockchain technologies that the company can utilize to improve its business. The group is headed by David Marcus, former head of Facebook Messenger and ex-president of Paypal, who currently sits on the board of Coinbase.\nThe development of the payments system, however, is likely to take some time, possibly years. Marcus, who is a crypto enthusiast and an early investor, has been quoted as saying that crypto payments are still very slow and expensive. Facebook is not planning to hold an initial coin offering (ICO) to fund the project. In January, the social network banned crypto-related ads, including advertisements of token sales.\nTelegram Moving Forward with Crypto Payments\nTelegram , on the other hand, has already raised enough money to fund its own blockchain project and payment system. The messaging service, which is popular with the crypto community, has already attracted $1.7 billion dollars to finance its Telegram Open Network (TON). The company, founded by Russian entrepreneur Pavel Durov, has decided to call off a planned public ICO.\nAccording to Russian media reports, Telegram is now conducting closed tests of a new service designed to store users’ information and documents for verification purposes. Telegram Passport will be used to keep personal details and copies of IDs, banking statements, and utility bills which will be used to identify users on Telegram’s blockchain TON.\nThe identity verification feature is needed to facilitate payments using Telegram’s own crypto token called Gram. Once uploaded, the personal information can be potentially shared with partners within the platform, but also on their systems. Telegram Passport, which should be launched by the summer, is expected to prevent anonymous crypto payments.\nCrypto Beer Vending Machine to Check Age\nCivic, a San-Francisco-based startup, has recently announced plans to introduce a “crypto beer vending machine.” The project, which will be realized in partnership with a leading US beer producer, aims to also prove that blockchain can be used to verify if a thirsty guy or girl have 21 years of age to legally consume the alcoholic beverage. To get a cold can, one has to install Civic’s app on their smartphone, verify their ID, and then walk up to the machine, Futurism reports. The project’s success depends on the readiness of government authorities to accept identity verification performed on a blockchain. Civic’s beer vending machine is still a prototype.\nBMW Tracking Mileage on a Blockchain\nAnother blockchain partnership aims to track the mileage of cars. A team at BMW, the German automobile manufacturer, has been tasked with finding a way to better preserve the resale value of vehicles leased by the company.

Bears are baying for blood! Despite their May 15 hard fork, Bitcoin Cash isn’t finding any reprieve and so far it is down 20 percent week over week. In the last 24 hours alone, price erosion exceeds 15 percent. It might be a correction yes, but at the moment it a beautiful Picasso showing how Bitcoin Cash sellers are marauding, staking any attempts of bull pressure. From the News\nRoger Ver, the Crypto evangelist many Bitcoin Core supporters love to hate won’t stop pitching his beloved coin . He still insists that it’s a better currency and therefore a better store of value that Bitcoin Core. Now, if you have been tracking this guy for sometimes then you will realize that this is the umpteenth time he his saying so. Will repetition come to pass someday? Well, maybe, maybe not. What we know for sure is that Bitcoin Cash shall be forking once more .\nHowever, this time since it shall be done at MTP time, there is no need to track block height. We anticipate this upgrade to take place on Tuesday, May 15 and there, the block size would be hiked to 32 MB from 8MB making it that largest ever block size increment in the world. Besides, their protocol data carrier sizes shall be increased to 220 bytes.\nIf you are a Bitcoin Cash full node or miner, please update, if not then you better stay on the side line and watch. Before the fork begins, full nodes should upgrade their clients to the 32 MB supporting Bitcoin ABC 0.17.1 version.\nSo, while speculations are rife that this upgrade shall increase Bitcoin Cash transaction throughput and fees, will this boost prices after the fork? Or, will it even be successful in the first place regardless of Bitcoin Cash staunch following in Korea and Japan? Let’s wait and see! Bitcoin Cash (BCHUSD) Technical Analysis Weekly Chart Bitcoin Cash Weekly Chart by Trading View\nUnless a miracle happen, Bitcoin Cash shall end up with a conspicuous double bar bear reversal pattern right at the middle BB, a resistance line. That’s a fact! So, despite that stochastic buy signal turning from deep the oversold territory, the general sentiment is bearish.\nBitcoin Cash prices are down 18 percent in the last 24 hours and 20 percent in the last 7 days effectively reversing week ending May 7 gains. At this rate, we shall be aiming for take profit targets at $1000 and $800. Many didn’t expect this to happen and advised by this, we shall be looking for sells in lower time frames. Daily Chart Bitcoin Cash Daily Chart by Trading View\nLike the weekly chart, the depreciation is real but not as wholesome. Bears are stepping on the gas and the result has been that clear break below the middle BB. Inevitably, this means sellers are in charge and it means we shall be trading a bearish break out pattern.\nSo, building on to the bearish engulfing pattern we are seeing in the weekly chart, immediate targets is at $1200, there we might see a reaction and a bounce back to $1400 or so before bears resume their pressure with targets we mentioned earlier.

Via internet it is very, very quick and the fees are low.\"\nClients hold the loans in digital tokens like Bitcoin only for seconds or minutes until they are exchanged back into the currency of the country where they wish to receive the funds, avoiding the crypto currencies fluctuating exchange rates.\nBitcoin has been used as collateral for loans, but never as a way of transferring credit in currency internationally.\nAlbrecht's service has been growing in popularity among clients since he launched the company in 2013. His office employs 24 people from 12 countries who manage loans for 100 clients amounting to around $1 million each month.\nMost clients are small business owners or freelance workers, Albrecht says. Loans are relatively small and don't exceed 50,000 dollars. In 2016, Bitbond was officially licensed as a bank and has gained many investors since.\nAdoption of Bitcoin has been rapid in Germany. It trails only the U.S., according to Bitnodes, which tracks the location of all the Bitcoin nodes that transmit data about new transactions.\n(Writing by Laura Dubois,; Editing by Joseph Nasr and Matthew Mpoke Bigg) More From Technology ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "radoslav albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prenzlauer berg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albrecht", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters tv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de berlin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T14:55:49.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "125c627a605fea4403eb265576b6e17cee8eb793", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLuyhjDVP3TsueRW6CbM74Du6lUfsqe1Z0BofvqwMhEKxtcwUJH80fTjXwD_asvp_Jm2OYBEFNcWXGKoxRgXdwVyykhYTcI9VC0-", "site_full": "stackoverflow.com", "site": "stackoverflow.com", "site_section": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/json?page=1&sort=newest&pagesize=15&days=7", "site_categories": ["tech", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Newest 'json' Questions - Page 1 - Stack Overflow", "title": "arrays - How to remove double quotes from Bitcoin Address PHP JSON", "title_full": "arrays - How to remove double quotes from Bitcoin Address PHP JSON - Stack Overflow", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.093, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=73d79a89bded", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 51, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "125c627a605fea4403eb265576b6e17cee8eb793", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQtYqA5mgEa6HMVCndYR2zzrRBclXR3LLuyhjDVP3TsueRW6CbM74Du6lUfsqe1Z0BofvqwMhEKxtcwUJH80fTjXwD_asvp_Jm2OYBEFNcWXGKoxRgXdwVyykhYTcI9VC0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mehravish Temkar", "published": "2018-05-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "arrays - How to remove double quotes from Bitcoin Address PHP JSON", "text": "Guys Blockchain Api Working Fine Only One Problem\n\"1Dgyv8Qz1nkrJddoyLBepv1RUXSDqCBCdp\"\nHow To Remove Double Quote: s From Btc Address Beginning And From End \"NEWELYCREATEDBTCADDRESS\"\nCode:\n$resp = file_get_contents($blockchain_receive_root . \"v2/receive?key=\" . $my_api_key . \"&gap_limit=\".$gap_limit. \"&callback=\" . urlencode($callback_url) . \"&xpub=\" . $my_xpub);

Evelyn Cheng | @chengevelyn\nPublished 12:35 PM ET Tue, 8 May 2018 Updated 2:15 PM ET Tue, 8 May 2018 Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images Gary Cohn\nFormer Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn said Tuesday he thinks the world will have a global cryptocurrency that is not bitcoin.\n“I’m not a big believer in bitcoin. I am a believer in blockchain technology,” Cohn told CNBC’s Bob Pisani in a “Squawk on the Street” interview.\n“I do think we will have a global cryptocurrency at some point where the world understands it and it’s not based on mining costs or cost of electricity or things like that,” he said. Cohn resigned in early March from his role as chief economic advisor to the Trump administration.\nBitcoin is created through an energy-intensive “mining” process that has come to require specialized computer hardware. The cryptocurrency is also the first application of blockchain technology, which eliminates the need for a third-party intermediary by rapidly creating a secure, permanent record of transactions between two parties.

However, bitcoin has run into challenges such as handling high transaction volume.\nCohn expects the digital coin of the future will be simpler than bitcoin.\n“It will be a more easily understood cryptocurrency,” he said. “It will probably have some blockchain technology behind it, but it will be much more easily understood how it’s created, how it moves and how people can use it.”\nA surge of interest in bitcoin, and expectations for large-scale institutional investment, helped drive prices up more than 13 times last year. Bitcoin traded near $9,100 Tuesday morning.\nCohn’s former employer, Goldman Sachs, is one of a few Wall Street firms making a deliberate foray into cryptocurrencies. Last month, the investment bank hired former trader Justin Schmidt to be the first head of digital asset markets in Goldman’s securities division.

The accountant turned software engineer does feel, however, it’s hollow to call out bitcoin maximalists as “ignorant” to other currencies and disagrees with the fact that this group feels only one coin will exist. Bitcoin the New Standard\nThe French-born engineer compares bitcoin with the dollar. In economics, one currency is always held in standard, and other currencies are compared with it. According to Rochard, bitcoin has attained the value of a “standard currency” and believes other virtual currencies are heavily dependant on it. Sponsored Links Why I’m focused on Bitcoin:• Schelling point consensus• p2p network governance with full nodes• proof-of-work secure timestamping• Lindy effect / first mover advantage• fixed issuance schedule\n— Pierre Rochard (@pierre_rochard) April 23, 2018\nThe cryptocurrency sector has undeniably experienced a lucrative rise since 2014 onward, leading to the opening of hedge funds and raking in big money. Choosing an alternate path, though, Rochard has legally opted to launch a consultancy in New York, called Bitcoin Advisory LLC.\nAs per Rochard, his company is different than competitors as the clients would be charged only for his time and won’t be forced into investing into anything that the company sells or promotes. He believes that the biggest giveaway at his firm lies in a deep understanding of the infamously volatile digital asset class. As such, he aims to educate people so they can look after their investments.\nSpeaking to Coindesk , Rochard said:\n“I do want to also present the case against investing in bitcoin or at least being more cautious about its valuation or more rigorous about analyzing the risks of investing in bitcoin. I don’t want investors going all in on bitcoin.” Rising Demand for Crypto-Advisors\nAfter the changes suggested by the New York Agreement, which was put ahead by a group of crypto-organizations and miners to lower transaction fees, a stark need for independent advisors, who wouldn’t place personal interests above Bitcoin’s, was felt.\nRochard aims to educate interested parties, and that’s the primary task for him, but his engineering background can be of great use here.\nFor the uninitiated, running a full node can be both a tedious setup and a technologically challenging process. This is an area which requires a lot of expert advice, and Rochard aims to fill the gap with his company’s expertise on building and maintaining the Bitcoin protocol. Reportedly, Rochard has developed tools to tally and audit protocol contributions, which are readily accessible from GitHub.\n“What I want to see from my contributions to Bitcoin Core is to help accelerate the development of Bitcoin Core’s wallet.”\nBitcoin Advisory LLC is not Rochard’s first business in the cryptocurrency space, as the engineer also launched an educational Bitcoin product earlier in March 2014.\nNamed after Bitcoin’s unknown creator, Rochard co-founded the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute, along with his classmates Daniel Krawisz and Michael Goldstein. However, it is not a traditional institution and is much closer to Wikipedia, providing archives of digital currencies, smart contracts, and cryptography from the 1970s, for free viewing/download.

Less than 24 hours ago, the total market cap was sitting comfortably at levels of $440 Billion but now that figure has dropped to levels of $389 Billion at the moment of writing this. This has in-turn affected all the values of the coins and tokens in the markets with the top coins not being immune to the dip. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Tron (TRX) and other top coins have been affected with most showing decreased price values of between 7% to 25% in the last 24 hours. With regards to the Mt. Gox possible dump of over 8,200 BTC as reported by CCN.com , there are four alleged wallets of the Mt. Gox trustee that have moved around 2,000 BTC each. They have sent over 8,000 BTC in total in the past 24 hours. The Mt. Gox trustee had been ordered by Japanese authorities to sell off over 200,000 BTC and convert to Japanese Yen in a bid to reimburse creditors. This means that if the transactions are confirmed, the BTC funds are most likely being sold on cryptocurrency exchanges. Back in March, another selloff was orchestrated by Mt. Gox as they set out to reimburse the same Mt. Gox’s creditors. Being the trustee, Noboaki Kobayashi had this to say about the sell-off back in March: “I made efforts to sell BTC and BCC at as high a price as possible in light of the market price of BTC and BCC at the timing of the sale. I plan to consult with the court and determine further sale of BTC and BCC” When you add the Upbit news of South Korean officials raiding their headquarters and taking away books and hard-drives for audit purposes, you get the feeling that today was perhaps a not so good day in the Crypto-verse. The exchange is being accused of actually trading without having the actual cryptocurrencies at hand. Everything has been doctored and traders are not aware. What the exchange has been accused of doing, is carrying out fake balance sheets to deceive traders and investors. Many traders have probably withdrawn their funds from the exchange in a panic causing the current market dip.\nFor the latest cryptocurrency news, join our Telegram !\nDisclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

For Those Who HEDL\nThe company’s first watch, called the CRYPTOMAT (i.e. Crypto-diplomat), was born during the early years when the first “Bitcoin embassies” started popping up around the world. It reflected the spirit of individuals representing the crypto movement all over the globe and who could deal with skeptics and naysayers in an effective way.\n“It was intended to be humorous, but the word stuck and became the name of our first collection,” says Cryptomatic’s watch designer, Luis Rosende, whose team has been in business for over a decade, helping a number of fashion and watch brands design and manufacture their collections.\nHowever, when the Cryptomat launched in 2014 , the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market entered a prolonged bearish cycle that lasted through 2016.\n“It was a real winter for Bitcoin, it truly tested people’s faith in the idea,” he explains.\nThe belief didn’t die. Bitcoin came back stronger than ever as its price has skyrocketed in recent years while giving rise to a booming new industry in the process.\nRosende adds:\nAfter that roller coaster of a ride, it was quite clear that the second collection should be dedicated to those patient souls who HEDL through the hard times, and so, the HODLER was born. A Timeless Design\n‘Hodling’ is a term that has taken on a life of its own, evolving from a typo meme on an online forum to an entire subculture that believes in the long-term transformative power of Bitcoin technology.\nOn the surface, the Cryptomatic watch is a stark contrast. It’s fully mechanical, based on old-world watch technology that doesn’t use any batteries, digital dials, or electronics.\nUpon a second look, however, its metal gears, springs, and jewel bearings made of ruby to reduce friction are a testament to Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer design that eliminates the need to trust middlemen. The glass back reflects the transparency of its public ledger and proof-of-work backbone.\nHand-assembled in Japan, the country of pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, the watch’s binary hour markers is another unique design element that pays homage to digital currency.\nAnd like Bitcoin, which remains the indisputable king of cryptocurrencies despite an ever-increasing amount of novel altcoins, Cryptomatic believes that mechanical watches are the only type of timepieces that are here to stay in the long run as Rosende states:\nQuartz watches didn’t kill mechanicals and smartwatches won’t either, you can quote us on that now and ten years from now.\nAll the gadgety smartwatches will most likely stop being useful when the next technology cycle hits the market or when there’s no more support for firmware or replacement parts.\nThe build does feel incredibly solid when wearing it on your wrist. The watch comes with a lifetime warranty, for which you can register by scanning the QR code printed on the individual customer card. It also comes with either steel or genuine leather strap options. (I personally prefer the black leather strap after trying both.) Staying Crypto\nCryptomatic is a pretty unique company as it only takes payments in Bitcoin for their watches, which means no credit cards and no cash. The Holder collection watch currently costs around 0.09 BTC, or from $819 to $849 USD depending on the model.\n“About 98% of the watches have been sold for Bitcoin,” Rosende says. “The other ~ 2% are sales to clients who asked if they could pay in other cryptocurrencies, to which we have been mostly open.”\nTo date, Cryptomatic has produced a limited number of editions numbering a few hundred watches per collection. The most popular and fastest selling model has been the Silver & Black HODLER , while the original Silver and Rose Gold CRYPTOMAT was the favorite from the first collection, says Rosende.\nHe notes that Cryptomatic intends to remain a small and exclusive brand while continuing making small runs of high-quality, hand-assembled watch es but doesn’t rule out the addition of “smart” features in the future.\nSo will we ever see a price ticker or a Bitcoin wallet integrated into a Cryptomatic?\n“One thing we can say is that our watches will always have a mechanical heart even if we decide to add ‘smart’ elements to them,” he says.\nThe company does a lot of brainstorming when it comes to their designs, constantly thinking about new collections, though we probably won’t see a Litecoin-themed design in the near future.\n“What about putting in a moon rock if Bitcoin price breaks a new all-time high this year?” I asked Luis.\n“For now we will stick to Bitcoin as it is the origin of all cryptos,” Rosende says. “We’ll see what happens in the future. The moon rock idea is a really good idea by the way.”\n[Disclosure: Cryptomatic provided Bitcoinist with a free Cryptomatic watch for review purposes.]\nWhat do you think of the new Cryptomatic watch?

Gox isn’t done with bitcoiners just yet. Just as it appeared the world’s most popular cryptocurrency was ready to strike above the stubborn high nine thousands in price, Nobuaki Kobayashi, Tokyo-based, court appointed trustee of the remaining bitcoin to be distributed among creditors, seems ready to flood another 8,000 coins onto a fragile market struggling to recover.\nAlso read: Venezuela’s President Launches Crypto Funded Youth Bank, Encourages Mining Farms\nGox Trustee to Flood Market with Over 8,000 Bitcoin\nThe Tweets were unusually sure over the last three weeks. Luminaries who’ve seen it all wistfully claimed that, should the speculative price of bitcoin core (BTC) break above $10,000 again, and this was all but a foregone conclusion in their view, it would be the last time investors would ever see such a low. And then something happened along the way. The hot hand held by BTC enthusiasts was left cold: the price dropped to the low nine thousands. Then it broke below $9,000. It would finally settle very near $8,000 by press time.\nMt. Gox happened, again.\nThe exploded exchange from ancient history by crypto standards, 2014, is rearing its head in the form of trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi. Yet another flood of bitcoin selling appears to be poised, as Blockchain.info shows over 8,000 from the court ordered fund’s cold storage wallets (two) was recently shifted. As watchdog news of coin movement spread, the corresponding bitcoin core (BTC) price plummeted.\nIt is unclear whether Gox coins will be shed through mainstream markets or over-the-counter exchanges. Fear, doubt, uncertainty (FUD) has been heaped on the digital asset in particular this week not only surrounding a potential market dump but also through legacy business media incessantly quoting Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, and Bill Gates about the supposed inherent ills of crypto.\nNot First Rodeo\nSomething on the order of 137 thousand bitcoin remain in the Gox trust, according to various sources and wallet monitoring groups. The ecosystem has long accused institutional whales of shorting the market at the expense of overall prices. And as BTC goes, so do, historically, the rest of the cryptocurrency listings across the board.\nNot quite two months ago, Mr. Kobayashi dumped nearly half a billion dollars worth of BTC and bitcoin cash (BCH) onto markets. The response, which the Gox trustee denied, seemed to be an economic law: prices bottomed out under the mere weight of momentary over supply. Mr. Kobayashi insisted his flood back then had been orchestrated through OTC outlets rather than more mainstream markets.\nWhat is highly probable, however, is arbitrage of a sort. Keen OTCers could snap up discounted BTC and BCH, and then promptly unload them onto recognizable exchanges. The rub is always trying to avoid the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc, exuberantly asserting because X happened before Y, it caused Y. But price movement charts are pretty compelling, correlating well between Gox floods and price drops.\nDo you think the Gox trustee’s actions are influencing prices?

Now it is time to turn our attention to one of the most obvious things that went wrong in BTC — the centralization of protocol development.\nAlso read: How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid the Same Mistakes as Bitcoin Core, Part 2 How Bitcoin Cash Can Avoid Centralization\nDecentralization comes in many forms: decentralization of nodes, mining pools, wealth, and so on. One thing that was overlooked for a long time in Bitcoin BTC was that while many things were well distributed, there was only one main group of developers (Bitcoin Core).\nDecentralized Development Most of the BCH community is now well aware of this folly, and that is why we seek to have multiple independent teams of developers along with multiple full node implementations.\nMiners need established, robust software they can rely on, and its important to have several choices; otherwise it means that a single group of developers essentially controls the protocol.\nEntrenchment of “The Reference Implementation” Bitcoin Core became entrenched as “the” Bitcoin software, which led to stagnation. Although there were already several different implementations, the dominance of Bitcoin Core has been overwhelming.\nTechnically, it’s hash power that matters, not how many different nodes are running a certain software… But given the totally lopsided distribution, it was clear that anyone running a different version from Core would be a tiny minority. That means Bitcoin Core calls all the shots as far as BTC protocol rules.\nBCH is Doing Better Already We’re heading in the right direction but we’re not out of the woods yet. One interesting phenomenon is that the current level of BCH development decentralization is often either underestimated or overestimated.\nOn one extreme, some believe development is fully decentralized (since there’s, what, 6 node implementations now?). By contrast, others see the leading team (Bitcoin ABC) as having become the next reference implementation.\nThe truth is somewhere in the middle. Bitcoin ABC runs around 60–70% of the BCH nodes and Bitcoin Unlimited runs about a third of them. Essentially, instead of one main implementation, there’s now two.\nMaybe that sounds a bit disappointing, but that’s twice as many as BTC. Meritocracy\nA meritocracy is defined as “the holding of power by people selected on the basis of their ability.”\nThere’s often a misguided notion that the main development groups in BCH should have magically have equal influence, rather than acknowledging that influence must be earned.\nThose fearful of ABC having too much power might not understand this principle, or more likely, they haven’t seen all that ABC has accomplished to earn what is currently a majority “market share”.\nThe fact of the matter is that Bitcoin ABC has been the best in class when it comes to leading protocol development, producing timely releases of solid code, and solving problems.\nTo be specific, it was Bitcoin ABC that created the first node software for Bitcoin Cash, and spearheaded both hard fork upgrades along with the Cashaddr addresses.\nHealthy Competition is the Way Forward This is not to say that Bitcoin Cash wouldn’t benefit from an even more disbursed landscape, with several of the smaller implementations gaining more market share and influence.\nInstead of the misplaced idea that ABC should be reigned in, other teams should catch up to ABC by competing. That means they need to do as good a job as ABC has done at leading protocol development and delivering reliable software that serves the community.\nWhile its good to have a healthy fear of avoiding another “Core”, Bitcoin ABC actually has been extremely inclusive toward other teams. ABC organizes meetings with other BCH devs (both online and in real life), has created open work groups for various Bitcoin related topics, has invited developers from other groups into their private discussion channels, and has even written code for other teams.\nIt feels that we’re on the right track with decentralizing protocol development, and I expect it will continue to improve over time.\nIn the upcoming conclusion (Part 4), we’ll take a look at mining, development funding, and some big picture solutions.\nWritten by Jonald Fyookball Jonald Fyookball (pseudonym) is a cryptocurrency enthusiast, best known as the project leader of the Electron Cash wallet, and for a series of hard hitting articles on the Bitcoin scaling debate.

Not to do so, he told CNN , is “almost irresponsible.” Crypto To Disrupt Every Vertical On Wednesday, Novogratz’s firm and Bloomberg launched the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index , an index that tracks 10 cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and Ethereum. Investing in cryptocurrency is important not on account of expected gains, Novogratz said, but because in two to four years blockchain technology, which allows companies to make and record near instant transactions, will be challenging every vertical. While the decentralized version of Uber may not be Uber, it will be a challenge and it constitutes a “real value proposition,” he said. Novogratz, a former hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group and Goldman Sachs partner, said he has invested 10% of his net worth in cryptocurrencies. Traditional Institutions Testing The Waters Mainstream financial institutions, meanwhile, are finding ways to allow traditional investors to benefit from bitcoin. Nasdaq in April signed an agreement with Gemini Trust, a cryptocurrency exchange. One unknown, however, is how governments will regulate cryptocurrency. Novogratz predicted the New York Stock Exchange will be active in cryptocurrency trading in less than six months. Not everyone on Wall Street agrees with Novogratz. Warren Buffett, an investment icon, has been bearish on bitcoin, having most recently called bitcoin “probably rat poison squared” at Berkshire Hathaway ’s annual shareholder meeting on Saturday. Novogratz said the difference in opinion is age-related, with older players much more skeptical about cryptocurrency. Also read: Bitcoin bull Novogratz raises $250 million for cryptocurrency merchant bank Galaxy Digital Moves Forward Galaxy Digital , meanwhile, has announced plans to buy Canadian startup First Coin Capital and then merge with Bradmer Pharmaceuticals — which is publicly listed on the Toronto-based TSX Venture Exchange (TSX-V) — through a reverse takeover. Following the merger, Bradmer will be renamed to Galaxy Digital, allowing the company to trade publicly without having to undergo traditional financial disclosures associated with listing on an exchange. Galaxy Digital’s cryptocurrency merchant bank — which Novogratz reportedly hopes to make the “Goldman Sachs of Crypto” — will have a fourfold business model, according to public statements made by the firm. The bank will open a cryptocurrency trading desk and initially seek to capitalize on opportunities for cross-exchange arbitrage. It will also invest in blockchain startups and ICOs, much as Novogratz intended to do through his now-shelved cryptocurrency hedge fund. Finally, it will provide advisory and asset management services to wealthy clients.

From July 1, 2019, any business transaction over $10,000 has to be done using electronic payments. Handing over a hundred $100 notes or more will be illegal, as the government tries to flush out tax avoiders, drug dealers and the rest of the underground economy.\nBitcoiners and other cryptocurrency fans predicted this, and the government is playing into their greedy little hands.\nGRINDING ON UP\nBitcoin surged to $US20,000 last year and then quickly plunged back down to about $6700. Many thought it would continue back down close to zero. Instead, it has rebounded about 40 per cent in the past month to more than $9000, as this next graph shows.\nThe volatile Bitcoin has rebounded in the past month.\nThe recommendation of a ban on cash comes from the government's Black Economy Task Force. The head of the task force, Michael Andrew, described the reasons people use cash in a recent podcast, giving as an example a shopkeeper who runs two tills, keeping some money out of sight of the taxman.\n\"It's basically paying people cash who want to maintain their welfare, their visa status or avoid their child maintenance,\" Mr Andrew said. \"That is widespread in certain areas particularly … the services-based economy, security industry, hospitality, cleaning, couriers, personal trainers, hairdressing and nail salons for example.\"\nGovernments around the world are interested in cracking down on cash, and not just to get those dodgy nail salons paying tax, but also to kill off terrorist financing, to reduce money laundering, and even to let them reduce interest rates below zero. (If you make interest rates negative, people will just take cash out of the bank, but if you also make cash illegal, that's not possible.)\nANARCHY IN THE BLOCKCHAIN\nAll these anti-cash trends are giving life to Bitcoin, and other digital currencies that could serve as an alternative to cash. For some people, that's the whole point of cryptocurrencies. A big part of the early adopters of Bitcoin were people who are deeply worried about government. Many early Bitcoin adopters were libertarians and anarchists who feared an Orwellian world where government constantly monitored and controlled you.\nWhen Mr Morrison bans cash, those libertarians and anarchists get their \"I told you so!\" moment. But these days, as Bitcoin aims for mainstream acceptance, the industry is keen to distance itself from those people.\n2 LEGIT 2 BIT\n\"It is not about encouraging a black market economy,\" says Caleb Yeoh, the co-founder of Travel by Bit, which has made buying things with cryptocurrencies possible at about 150 Australian businesses, including mainstream outlets such as Red Rooster.\n\"We signed up over 150 businesses across Australia. Each one of them gets a tax reporting functionality on our platform, so they declare taxes even thought they take payment in Bitcoin.\"\nYeoh, whose business is part-funded by government grants, points out that Bitcoin maintains a record of every transaction in its Blockchain.\n\"People often have this impression that if you take payments in Bitcoin you're creating a cash economy, under the table, can't be monitored by government. That's not true at all. It is transparent on the Blockchain. If you are doing something bad with Bitcoin you should be able to be caught.\"\nWhile this is true of Bitcoin, it is not the case with every other cryptocurrency, some of which are designed to be anonymous.\nSo the big risk is not when businesses agree to take Bitcoin, like this labour hire firm has. (\"You could be forgiven for thinking that accepting Bitcoin payments is a publicity stunt,\" the firm's website says, insisting it will actually be efficient. However, you can check its Bitcoin address on the Blockchain and see that no customers have paid bitcoin to that address yet).\nThe big risk is when the guy who is installing your new kitchen asks if he can be paid in anonymous cryptocurrencies like Monero or Dash. That's when the government's cash ban could really backfire.

Who am I to judge?\nI was reminded of that classic exchange from Dr. Strange on Friday when, amid a painful lull in the normally manic news cycle, I ran across this headline from Bloomberg:\nBITCOIN SEEN HITTING $36,000 BY END OF 2019: DOCTOR Upon further inspection, that’s a reference to Fundstrat’s Sam Doctor who, in keeping with the over-the-top bullish Bitcoin bias of the firm he works for, was out with a note that purports to make the case for Bitcoin roughly quadrupling from where it was trading earlier this week.\nHere’s the actual “rationale” for anyone interested in driving themselves crazy:\nCRYPTO: Our quant/data scientist @fundstratQuant publishing #bitcoin mining white paper. Crypto mining economics lead/explain $BTC price—suggests $39,000 per bitcoin by YE19. key takeaways below… pic.twitter.com/f5ZQ4py3jS\n— Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) May 10, 2018\nHilariously, Bitcoin plunged some 15% on the heels of “Mister Doctor’s” $36,000 call, with a sizable portion of the losses coming on Friday:\nTo be clear, the financial world’s fascination with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally has waned this year, in part because folks tend to become disenchanted with something when it plunges by some 60% in the space of a couple of months, as Bitcoin did following the early December euphoric highs when folks were whipping out the old plastic to finance cryptocurrency purchases after falling for the hard sell over Thanksgiving dinner .\nIt’s also possible that after watching the short vol. trade blow up, people began to question the relative merits of sticking around in these high risk trades. You might recall Deutsche Bank suggesting that sometime late last year, Bitcoin replaced short vol. as the “new frontier of risk taking”.\nRegulatory concerns and (more) theft also conspired to dampen sentiment.\nOf course none of that means there’s not still appetite for crypto-related dip-buying. In fact, crypto assets were up some 75% for the month of April at one point, according to the MVIS CryptoCompare Digital Assets 10 Index, which I’m not even going to waste my time updating.\nThe most absurd thing about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally, is not that people are “investing” on the greater fool theory. That’s actually the only “rational” way to think about these things. The most absurd thing about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is that some people who are apparently devoid of anything that even approximates common sense actually view these non -assets as the exact opposite of risky vehicles for speculation; that is, some people actually view Bitcoin as “digital gold”, where that’s meant to confer some kind of “safe haven” status on this make-believe P.O.S.\nThere’s a sense in which that’s appropriate because after all, gold is only a “safe haven” in the context of a world that isn’t completely on fire. As I’m fond of reminding folks, if we ever end up living out Cormac McCarthy’s The Road , the only thing gold will be good for is as a blunt object for beating back the cannibals.\nSo to the extent gold is absolutely, positively useless as a hedge against the apocalypse, Bitcoin is indeed “digital gold” because in the event some catastrophe ushers in a post-apocalyptic hellscape, the only thing that’s going to be more useless than polished pieces of yellow metal are made-up digital tokens.\nHere’s how I put it the other day while talking about whether 3% on 10s is set to usher in the end times:\nThe implication there is that a rate shock is in the cards and that informs BofAML’s year-end forecast for 3.25% on 10Y Treasury yields, a number which, if you go by the shrieking panic crowd, would mean the Dow crashes to zero on the way to global famine, cannibalism and ultimately, the zombie apocalypse (which is why you need gold and Bitcoin, because there’s nothing like shiny metal and “assets” that rely on an internet connection to protect you when everyone is starving and there’s no infrastructure).\nBut not everyone understands this and for proof of how stupid people in fact are, look no further than Wences Casares and his startup Xapo which, as Bloomberg details in truly amusing new piece , “has built a network of underground vaults on five continents, including one in a decommissioned Swiss military bunker” in order to warehouse some $10 billion worth of Bitcoin.\nThe English language is not a sufficient tool to communicate the absurdity inherent in this story and the list of investors and advisors that Xapo boasts on its website is a testament to something, although I’m not entirely sure what.\nJust read this crazy shit:\nSecure bitcoin storage is what we do best. We’ve developed a new standard in bitcoin security that protects your assets by using man, machine and even a mountain to keep your money safe.\nOur Vaults are located deep underground in geographically dispersed locations on three continents. Confidential information like private keys and cryptographic materials are physically stored on offline servers that never have and never will have access to the internet or any other kind of network. The servers are guarded by intense human and automated security measures 24/7.\nTry to appreciate the sheer amount of nonsense they managed to cram into so few sentences. They are storing nothing. Bitcoin isn’t an “asset”. It isn’t anything at all. It has no intrinsic value, it has no rate of return, it isn’t backed by anything and at the end of the day, it simply doesn’t exist. It’s a “concept”. It’s not a “thing” that one can “store”.\nBut perhaps more germane to this particular discussion is the fact that this setup implicitly posits a scenario where the world is ablaze and the barbarians are at the gates, but where people are simultaneously still interested in transacting in digital currencies.\nI appreciate why Bitcoin needs to be stored offline. But I would love for someone to explain to me what series of events they imagine unfolding that would conspire to create a situation in which your Bitcoin is only safe buried in the side of an actual mountain like Thorin Oakenshield’s dwarf treasure, but in which people are still going to want Bitcoin.\nLet’s go back to Bloomberg’s piece on this for a minute:\nAt Xapo, retrieving Bitcoin from the vault takes about two days. The company verifies a client’s identity and authenticates the request before manually signing the transactions with private keys from multiple vault locations. Approval from three separate vaults is required for any transactions to be authorized.\nSo that’s the verification process, but just how secure are your digital non-assets in these underground bunkers? Well, not quite as secure as they would be if you stored them in the Lonely Mountain under the protection of Smaug, but pretty fucking close.\nHere’s Bloomberg again, quoting Sean Clark, founder of First Block, Canada’s first fully registered crypto firm, which picked Xapo as its custodian after what Bloomberg describes as “months of due diligence, including touring the Swiss vault”:\n“Every part of their DNA is geared to security,” said Clark, who noted the vault’s fingerprint scanners were equipped with a pulse reader to prevent amputated hands from being used.\nFor the life of me, I cannot reconcile the idea of a world where people are running around chopping off hands and carrying around amputated limbs with a world where people still care about Bitcoin prices.\nI mean I guess if you really wanted to, you could posit a situation where rogue intelligence operatives (or something) kidnap whoever is running the show for an institutional client, chop off his/her arm, stuff it into a duffle bag, then infiltrate one of these heavily guarded mountain fortresses before trying to use the severed hand to access the Bitcoin stash, only to be foiled by the pulse reader, but besides being exceedingly unlikely, it seems like that would be a one-off event.\nSo what is the purpose of this? Is this really necessary?\nIn a word, no. In two words, absolutely not.\nFirst of all, what they’re storing is going to zero because Bitcoin is a joke in the first place. So at some point in the future (presumably before some catastrophe creates the conditions where people actually do start chopping off each other’s hands, only to eat, not to access buried Bitcoin keys) Xapo is going to end up in a truly laughable predicament where they’re the proud owners of a global network of heavily fortified, underground bunkers housing a bunch of private keys to made-up digital “coins” the value of which has converged on their intrinsic value which is obviously zero.\nSecond of all, if you’re concerned about this, buy a damn thumb drive. Bloomberg goes on to explain what’s wrong with that:\nThe most popular alternative is called cold storage, keeping the key in an offline device such as a thumb drive. But risks remain.\n[…]\nTraditional criminals have committed home invasions and kidnappings. Some Bitcoin tycoons have resorted to hiding their identities, fortifying their homes and studying self-defense.\nSo just to be clear, when changing your name, barricading your house and becoming a karate expert collectively fail to assuage your paranoia, you can call up Wences Casares who will solve this problem for you by burying your keys underground.\nI appreciate that there’s security risk here, but I think once you’ve hidden your identity, bought a Purge -style home fortification system and turned yourself into Bruce Lee, you’ve done about all you can do.\nAnd don’t you tell me I’m the ridiculous one here, because remember, I’m not the guy building underground vaults equipped with pulse-reading fingerprint scanners explicitly designed to foil criminals who try and use amputated hands to access Bitcoin held in cold storage, Casares is.\nI guess it’s possible that there will be institutional demand for this and as if the whole thing needed to get any more cartoonish, it turns out that Xapo has enlisted Pete Najarian to bring in the money manager crowd. Here’s Bloomberg one more time:\nXapo is doubling down on its pursuit of institutional clients, with President Ted Rogers enlisting Peter Najarian, a veteran of emerging-market trading at UBS Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, to oversee outreach to investors including pension funds, private banks, assets managers, family offices and hedge funds.\nCan you imagine this sales pitch? This is Pete Najarian pitching a military-grade, mountainside cold storage solution for make-believe digital currencies complete with failsafes that include safe words for FaceTime interactions and pulse-reading fingerprint scanners to deter thieves who have dismembered clients.\nThat’s enough. I can’t fucking take it. It’s Friday night and I’m done.\nShares 5 postid=\"242722\" data-nonce=\"61b2e2959f\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/fundstrat/status/994566148007055361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/wences?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road", "https://t.co/f5ZQ4py3jS", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/bunkers-for-the-wealthy-are-said-to-hoard-10-billion-of-bitcoin", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1211837", "https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&src=ctag&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-10/bitcoin-to-the-moon-refrain-grows-louder-as-enthusiasts-gather", "https://twitter.com/fundstratQuant?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://xapo.com/about/", "http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml", "https://heisenbergreport.com/2017/11/25/bitcoin-explodes-through-8700-to-record-high-thanksgiving-table-discussion-was-all-about-bitcoin/", "https://heisenbergreport.com/2018/01/13/if-youre-not-buying-bitcoin-on-your-credit-card-then-wtf-are-you-actually-doing-to-boost-your-cool-factor/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stephen str", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "stephen strange", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fundstrat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam doctor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kamar-taj", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-12T02:55:32.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a87fe341b5415c863ec46c03204dd0cbd5fddf5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmY.6fzRfImwFSbFp9GAEy1E-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Why people afraid to invest in bitcoin?", "title_full": "Why people afraid to invest in bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-12T02:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 12, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8a87fe341b5415c863ec46c03204dd0cbd5fddf5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmY.6fzRfImwFSbFp9GAEy1E-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "monarchy", "published": "2018-05-12T02:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why people afraid to invest in bitcoin?", "text": "Some Of They Are Afraid To Invest In Bitcoin Because According To Them Bitcoin Is Very Unfavorable So They Do not Want To Invest In Bitcoin Because Of Its Unstable Value Every Day", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-11T22:24:09.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6296855e7bc2da8811461008117fb0b0009de129", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme05CzJaoRF7Hc..fCtQLBc-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "What will happen to bitcoin in the near future?", "title_full": "What will happen to bitcoin in the near future?", "published": "2018-05-12T02:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 2, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.207, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6296855e7bc2da8811461008117fb0b0009de129", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme05CzJaoRF7Hc..fCtQLBc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sarsha19", "published": "2018-05-12T02:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "What will happen to bitcoin in the near future?", "text": "I think in the near future Bitcoin will become more popular.

C2 is an international community that intends to bolster open standard development in order to provide long-term Bitcoin Cash growth.\nAlso read: Upgrade Time: Bitcoin Cash 32MB Fork Activates Tuesday The Cash Consortium: Open Standards for Bitcoin Cash\nMuch of the cryptocurrency community understands what open source or open standard development is, and most of them embrace the idea. Furthermore, organizations like the W3C and other believers of open standards welcome the sharing of open sourced code that allows anyone the rights to study, change, and distribute OSS protocol for any purpose. Open standards also allows other developers to review a protocol’s design in order to prevent flaws and bugs within the software by coming up with sets of development standards that everyone agrees to and uses. The Cash Consortium will have engineers from leading companies to work together to build Bitcoin Cash (BCH) development standards much like how developers build on the open web with shared concepts like HTML.\n“The C2’s mission is to lead Bitcoin Cash to its full potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the blockchain,” explains the C2 website.\nBitcoin Cash is the soundest money the world has ever known. It has scarcity, fungibility, divisibility, durability and transferability. It’s our intention that it remain the soundest money the world has ever known — Bitcoin Cash enables smart contracts/property, colored coins, tokens, ICOs and much more. We intend to standardize these emerging technologies in a way that plays to Bitcoin Cash’s strengths. A Formal Bitcoin Standards Body\nAt the moment organizations that are listed as members of C2 include Cointext , Atlantis Labs, Akari Global Foundation, the Bitcoin Cash Fund , Bitbox, Blockpress , Centbee, and the social network Yours . Last night news.Bitcoin.com spoke with the creator of the Cash Consortium, Carlos Cardona , who is also the lead developer of Bitbox , the open source development toolkit for Bitcoin Cash. Cardona tells us he is a firm believer in open standards and explains why he initiated the C2 organization.\n“When I was in college I was a member of the W3C’s HTML5 Working Group. There were engineers from Apple, Google (who I was with), Microsoft, Firefox and many more meeting up regularly in working groups to flesh out the next generation of technical specs for the web (HTML/CSS etc),” Cardona tells news.Bitcoin.com . “When the spec was nearing completion the teams would each implement it. Some open source like Firefox. Some closed source like Internet Explorer. But both implementing technical specs which were created together.”\nWhen I joined the blockchain space several years ago it surprised me that there was no formal Bitcoin standards body. The Cash Consortium will affirm and adhere to the Principles in support of The Modern Paradigm for Standards —cooperation, due process, broad consensus, transparency, balance, and openness. Huge Forces at Play Are About to Phase the Blockchain Industry\nThen Cardona says he started thinking about the upcoming Bitcoin Cash upgrade that will not only increase the block size by 4X but the fork will also add Satoshi OP_Codes that can enable the ability to create color coins and smart contract features on the BCH network.\n“With the new OP_Codes coming I had recently been thinking again about how to best standardize on new transaction types and then Memo/Blockpress happened,” Cardona emphasizes. “Having recently updated Bitbox’s block explorer to support both Memo and Blockpress I was struck with the same feeling I had during IE6/FF days — writing code twice with slightly different APIs because there was no standard. With OP_RETURN going from 80 bytes to 220 bytes we’re just seeing the start of OP_RETURN prefixed protocols — That got me thinking again about a standards body.”\nIn my opinion our industry spent many years fighting the Blockstream wars and became complacent — Things which I would expect in any other nearly decade old tech industry (such as a tech consortium) doesn’t exist in our space. The final part which caused me to move on it was when I found out Zuckerberg created a blockchain division last week. To me that is just a sign that HUGE forces are at play which are about to phase shift our entire industry. Cardona Believes the Opportunity to Move Quick and be Proactive is Now\nThe C2 website explains that if you work with a company that develops with Bitcoin Cash then they can feel free to fork this repo or reach out to Cardona to see how you can get involved.\n“I believe we have the opportunity to move quick, be proactive, build bridges and standardize or some much larger player will step in an do it for us,” Cardona adds.\nWhat do you think about the Cash Consortium (C2)? Do you think its a good idea for BCH developers to initiate open standards for protocol and application development? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments below.\nImages via Bitcoincash.org, Pixabay, The Cash Consortium, and Open Stand logos.\nGet our news feed on your site.
