People who track the zodiac say the movement of the planet Uranus — which represents revolution and change — from Aries into Taurus this week is a good sign for cryptocurrencies. Thomas and starry-eyed others say they’re moving money into crypto to get in on the potential action.\nAstrology, which holds that the position of planets rules our destinies, is of course not based on science. But to some, it sheds just as much light on how to invest in the unpredictable cryptocurrency sector as any market forecast for the notoriously erratic currency could. Many crypto investors are novices who are known to make decisions based on Reddit threads and gut instinct. So perhaps, it’s not such a surprise that something as contentious as horoscopes and something as risky as crypto would go hand-in-hand.\nThomas first started to buy into astrology during the 2008 financial crisis, when many horoscopes he read seemed to predict financial and social shifts. Uranus shifts every seven years, and its last shift into Aries (a sign known for individuality and activism) coincided with social movements like the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter — proof to him that there was a correlation. With a move into Taurus, which represents finances and resources, Uranus is marking a new era for crypto, he believes.\n“I knew then that astrology may not be an exact science but it has the ability to predict trends by casting a big net focusing on certain themes in present day,” he said. “Uranus in Taurus — until 2026 [represents] revolutionary innovations in areas of finance, climate, banking, farming and other earth-related things.”\nEx-NFL football player Ricky Williams made headlines earlier this month for the same reason: he bought cryptocurrencies because, he says, Uranus moving into Taurus means a financial shake-up is on the horizon. Raki Brown, a London-based cryptocurrency trader, said he invests based on significant zodiac changes as well as moves in his own chart.\n“My dad studied astrology and I’ve been learning about for roughly 20 years, working on my own theory behind why it works,” he said. “Astrology to me is like alchemy was before it became chemistry due to the scientific method being applied.”\nRaymond Merriman, president of Arizona-based Merriman Market Analyst — which bases market timing services for independent traders on astrological and other factors — said he expects bitcoin BTCUSD, -2.03% to fall to a new low before March 6, 2019, because Uranus will bounce back into Aries later this year before moving fully into Taurus on March 6. He told his clients they should not buy bitcoin unless it drops below 77% of its high of nearly $20,000 in December 2017. Bitcoin was worth $8,200 when this story was published, but Merriman expects it to drop to between $4,400 and $1,300 based astrology alone.\n“In the next few years, there are going to be major changes in currency valuations and leadership, and new forms of currency,” he told MarketWatch .\nMerriman believes planetary movements have predicted previous financial shifts in the past, noting that the last time Uranus was in Taurus coincided with the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement , which tied the dollar to the price of gold. During the dot-com boom of the late 90s and early 2000s, Uranus was in Aquarius — a sign of “new ideas and machines.” From 2003 to 2010, Uranus was in Pisces, bringing with it a boom in the oil industry, according to Merriman.\nThe astrologer-investor said he recognizes many people are skeptical of zodiac-inspired investments. But he said more traders rely on astrology to invest than many people realize. He estimated 20% of investors at large make decisions based on horoscopes — a figure based on his own hunches about human nature rather than a formal survey. More than half of young adults believe astrology is a science . Merriman himself has more than 1,000 clients and has been in the business for more than 40 years.\n“It doesn’t worry me that this is one of the best-kept secrets at this time,” he said. “If you look at correlation of planetary cycles with human activity, you’d be amazed.”\nAnnabel Gat, an International Society for Astrological Research-certified astrologer who writes for VICE media women’s website Broadly, recently encouraged readers to explore cryptocurrencies as Uranus moves into Taurus this week.\n“Uranus is the planet of innovation, invention, change and technology,” she said. “Whenever it does something big in the sky like change signs, we know something exciting and unexpected is about to happen.”\nGat did not go as far as suggesting people actually invest in cryptocurrencies. In fact, most astrologers don’t. Founders of popular astrology app Co-star told MarketWatch they shy away from any kind of financial advice because it can have major effects on people’s lives. Still, Gat noted, it’s a good a time as ever to learn more about cryptocurrencies.\n“Understanding and getting acquainted with cryptocurrency is great to do right now, because over the next seven years or so a lot is going to change,” she said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://mmacycles.com/index.php?route=information/information&information_id=4", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/09/astrology-is-telling-ex-nfl-star-ricky-williams-to-invest-in-bitcoin.html", "https://smartasset.com/snippet.js"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcus thomas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "aries", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T22:28:42.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1563f881868dda38d95998221f671437051ea49b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tf47TKoCV9yiJUZ7I5vezDwfqGFHjnQV1iCNDYZV0u7dhCeNwkVNe8lujIy_Ee8zmVW6qGdsZFeAfffTZ83WNhZqsCXIF8Ahd6480jqt7GzVo", "site_full": "www.ccn.com", "site": "ccn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["uncategorized"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Only Used for Money Laundering and Speculation: ‘Big Short’ Investor – XBT.MONEY", "title_full": "Bitcoin Only Used for Money Laundering and Speculation: ‘Big Short’ Investor – XBT.MONEY", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.232, "main_image": "http://www.xbt.money/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/steve-eisman-the-big-short-760x400-660x330.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1563f881868dda38d95998221f671437051ea49b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQJFBdIAa9Tf47TKoCV9yiJUZ7I5vezDwfqGFHjnQV1iCNDYZV0u7dhCeNwkVNe8lujIy_Ee8zmVW6qGdsZFeAfffTZ83WNhZqsCXIF8Ahd6480jqt7GzVo", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Only Used for Money Laundering and Speculation: ‘Big Short’ Investor – XBT.MONEY", "text": "Bitcoin Only Used for Money Laundering and Speculation: ‘Big Short’ Investor Advertisement Join our community of 10 000 traders on Hacked.com for just $39 per month.\nWall Street veteran Steve Eisman rose to fame by shorting the sub-prime mortgage market ahead of last decade’s financial crisis. Now, he’s similarly-bearish on a new asset class: cryptocurrency.\nEisman, whose career is chronicled in The Big Short , told CNBC that he has yet to meet anyone who can persuasively argue that cryptocurrencies have social utility.\nHe said:\n“I’m not an expert on cryptocurrency, but I have my doubts about it. My doubts center on the fact that, ‘What’s the social utility of cryptocurrency?’ I’m not talking about blockchain. The technology, I think, has real value. But currency markets are the most liquid, most efficient markets, probably of any markets that exist.”\nWhile conceding that there are a few exceptions to this rule — Venezuela, for instance — the Neuberger Berman portfolio manager argued that in developed countries the only use cases for cryptocurrency are speculative investing and money laundering.\n“I think the social utility, at least in developed countries, is extremely small. The only thing I can really figure out the usage of it is that it’s good for speculation, and it’s good for money laundering.\nThe interview marked the second time in this week alone that Eisman had bashed bitcoin. As CCN reported , he said at an industry convention in Hong Kong that he believes the asset class has no legitimate purpose and that he won’t touch it.\nEven so, Eisman reiterated that he has no plans to make bitcoin his next “big short,” both because he does not specialize in currency trading and because he does not believe it is possible to assign bitcoin a fair market value.\n“It’s like arguing how many angels can dance on the head of a pin,” he said. “I have no idea how to value it, and I don’t think anybody else does either.”\nFeatured Image from YouTube ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve eisman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eisman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neuberger berman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T01:42:43.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7735f96b993d17489a5a39bd85cb916b4aef790c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9cAvseD0_zUv6o6oPEy2DqLu1ICjs1NP1B3mhqhMCkEN8S0IValv85Z31AjDJwBYxadSKFX4f80fIlf6u_sIgmU73TwnZUdVXuj.JV36u1m6ac8_pJcQJmO8Y4k0iNeijB3ueqZe6Yg5pqTnm8SwKGcVr2WnkQSA-", "site_full": "btcmanager.com", "site": "btcmanager.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["tech", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "EEA Launches Cross-platform Client Specification Platform to Spearhead Growth of Ethereum Ecosystem | Bitcoin Insight", "title_full": "EEA Launches Cross-platform Client Specification Platform to Spearhead Growth of Ethereum Ecosystem | Bitcoin Insight", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.471, "main_image": "https://btcmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/EEA-Launches-Cross-Platform-Client-Specification-Platform.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7735f96b993d17489a5a39bd85cb916b4aef790c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS9cAvseD0_zUv6o6oPEy2DqLu1ICjs1NP1B3mhqhMCkEN8S0IValv85Z31AjDJwBYxadSKFX4f80fIlf6u_sIgmU73TwnZUdVXuj.JV36u1m6ac8_pJcQJmO8Y4k0iNeijB3ueqZe6Yg5pqTnm8SwKGcVr2WnkQSA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "EEA Launches Cross-platform Client Specification Platform to Spearhead Growth of Ethereum Ecosystem | Bitcoin Insight", "text": "EEA Launches Cross-platform Client Specification Platform to Spearhead Growth of Ethereum Ecosystem Date: in: Uncategorized 6 Views\nIn a major development, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) announced the release of the Enterprise Ethereum Client Specification 1.0, an open-source, cross-platform framework that ensures greater trust building in smart contract-based systems. Suited For Enterprise Purposes\nAnnounced on EEA’s official website on May 16, 2018, the release helps power enterprises to create highly efficient business models while speeding up network transactions. Until this announcement, organizations could only use a privately-permissioned, proprietary version of the framework. Sponsored Links\nThe released framework is available for free download and is allowed to be publically implemented. Additionally, it features tools developed by the Ethereum Foundation, omitting any concerns with regards to its credibility. Source: EEA\nAs per the release, the Client Specification (CS) 1.0 aims to eliminate ineffective and expensive multi-protocol implementations, in addition to empowering organizations to develop custom frameworks to fit a variety of markets such as law, healthcare, banking and even communications.\nOn May 4, 2018, BTCManager reported on EEA’s Architecture Stack launch, meant to support and streamline the development of Ethereum applications. Interestingly, the cross-platform distributed ledger CS 1.0 framework is based on the Architecture Stack, and aims to create a “decentralized internet era.”\nFurthermore, with a large number of developers working on Ethereum-based projects, the EEA specification targets a vast market. According to a report by Gartner, blockchain technology is poised to exceed a mammoth $3.1 trillion in business value by 2030, and Ethereum looks primed to dominate much of this market with developments such as these.\nAccording to Ron Resnick, EEA’s Executive Director:\n“This EEA open-source, cross-platform framework will enable the mass adoption at a depth and breadth otherwise unachievable in individual corporate silos. With over 500 organizations as members, we anticipate great things in 2018 as EEA members work with the global development community to build, test and certify solutions to grow the ecosystem.”\nResnick further adds that the project is the result of a year and a half of “intense collaboration between leading enterprise, technology and platform members within our technical committee.” Salient Features of EEA CS 1.0\nBased on a unified platform, developers can build systems which ensure interoperability, making the framework lucrative to a large number of enterprises. As stated on the site:\n“The EEA Specification provides insight into the future of scalability, privacy, and security – a single, interoperable, development framework for spanning both permissioned and public Ethereum networks.”\nFurthermore, specially appointed EEA Interest Groups have determined and implemented industry-specific protocol layers. This reduces costs pertaining to both transactions and contracts and maximizes incentives to build novel applications. Furthermore, to ensure developers follow strict standards, the EEA will issue certifications relating to framework conformity, increasing confidence in the system built over the CS 1.0\nBanco Santander, a Spanish Banking group, and founding EEA member, spoke warmly about the launch:\n“The EEA’s Specification and growing membership will accelerate the acceptance and deployment of Ethereum blockchain solutions in the global marketplace.” Category: Blockchain, Business, Ethereum, News, Tech Tags: adoption, blockchain technology, business, EEA, Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, Ethereum, Ethereum blockchain, fintech, open source", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T02:55:49.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "297f22b0e5d0be1044adfa64e3e9aaa8f8d7f330", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94ookHqsfvu8r1Sh.I1FNc0mXYrx5qOPfN4OLmlWgRBjpEIiaAUz1gvwM-", "site_full": "www.amazon.com", "site": "amazon.com", "site_section": "https://www.amazon.com/External-Hard-Drives-Storage-Add-Ons/b/ref=amb_link_372220462_2?ie=UTF8&node=595048&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=browse&pf_rd_r=0XZQRZ52NYRVQZ57E2PP&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=1501587602&pf_rd_i=2956536011", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "section_title": "External Hard Drives | Amazon.com", "title": "VICTONY 6-Pack PCI-E Riser for Bitcoin\\Litecoin\\ETH Coin PCIe VER 006C 4 PIN 16x to 1x GPU Riser Adapter, Mining Graphics Card Extension & MOLEX to SATA Power Cable", "title_full": "Amazon.com: Customer reviews: VICTONY 6-Pack PCI-E Riser for Bitcoin\\Litecoin\\ETH Coin PCIe VER 006C 4 PIN 16x to 1x GPU Riser Adapter, Mining Graphics Card USB 3.0 Extension & MOLEX to SATA Power Cable", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 7, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "297f22b0e5d0be1044adfa64e3e9aaa8f8d7f330", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSknjLeMG94ookHqsfvu8r1Sh.I1FNc0mXYrx5qOPfN4OLmlWgRBjpEIiaAUz1gvwM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Amazon Customer", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "VICTONY 6-Pack PCI-E Riser for Bitcoin\\Litecoin\\ETH Coin PCIe VER 006C 4 PIN 16x to 1x GPU Riser Adapter, Mining Graphics Card Extension & MOLEX to SATA Power Cable", "text": "Helped me get my miner off the ground and the company was great to work with on one issue I ran into.

These 'currencies' operate independently of a central bank like the RBI, \"rendering it immune from government interference.\" Updated: May 17, 2018, 7:53 PM IST Cryptocurrencies in the US (Representative Image | Source: Reuters) New Delhi: The Supreme Court today barred all high courts from entertaining any plea relating to an RBI circular prohibiting dealings in virtual currencies like the Bitcoin. The apex court, which was hearing pleas seeking direction to the Centre to take emergent steps to restrain the sale and purchase of cryptocurrency or virtual currency like Bitcoins, also sought the assistance of Attorney General K K Venugopal in the matter. Crypto currencies are \"a stateless digital currency\" in which encryption techniques are used for trading. These 'currencies' operate independently of a central bank like the RBI, \"rendering it immune from government interference.\" A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud was informed by the counsel for petitioners, Siddharth Dalmia and Vijay Pal Dalmia, that the Reserve Bank of India had issued a circular on April 6 on the issue. The lawyer said the RBI, through the circular, had directed the banks and financial institutions to freeze the bank accounts of those individuals and companies dealing in the illegal trade of virtual currencies. \"It is further directed that no High Court shall entertain any petition relating to the circular....dated April 6, 2018 issued by the Reserve Bank of India on 'Prohibition on dealing in virtual currencies',\" the bench said and posted the matter for hearing on July 20. The bench also granted liberty to one of the petitioners to submit a representation to the competent authorityinRBI withintwoweeksso that it could be dealt with in accordance with law. The court also dealt with two petitions seeking transfer of pleas pending before the high courts of Delhi and Calcutta. Dalmia, in his plea, has sought a direction to the Centre to take steps to restrain sale and purchase of illegal crypto currencies like Bitcoins, which were being traded openly for \"illegal activities\" like funding terrorism and insurgency. The petitioners said the RBI had in 2013 issued a cautionary advisory to the users, holders and traders of virtual currency about the \"potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks that they are exposing themselves to\". Again on February 1 last year, the RBI, through a press release, had advised that it had not given any licence or authorisation to any entity or company to operate such schemes or deal with Bitcoins or any other virtual currency. The plea said the Ministry of Finance has constituted an inter-disciplinary committee under the chairmanship of Special Secretary (Economic Affairs) to examine the regulatory framework with regard to virtual currency. It alleged that the RBI \"has shrugged aside its duty to conclusively take a stand either in favour or against the illegal virtual currencies like Bitcoins in the interest of people of India\". \"A virtual currency like Bitcoin is a stateless digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank like the RBI, rendering it immune from government interference,\" it said. The plea has sought direction to the Centre to declare as illegal and ban all illegal virtual currencies, crypto currencies or decentralised digital such as Bitcoins, litecoins, bbqcoins, dogecoins etc. and investigate and fix accountability on the sale and purchase of virtual currencies till date and prosecute the offenders. It has also sought to declare as illegal and ban all websites, web links and mobile applications which were being used to buy, sell or deal in any manner with illegal virtual currencies. It also sought a direction to the government to give advertisements and wide publicity through media informing and educating the public in India about the illegalities involved in sale, purchase and dealing of illegal virtual currencies.

So far, the EOS price has managed to increase by 4.52% over the past 24 hours, which is a better result compared to most other currencies in the top 10. Thanks to this gain, the EOS price is now back above $13.2, although it may not remain there for much longer. The EOS Price Rises Temporarily\nAnyone can see today and the next few days will not be easy going for the cryptocurrency industry. With bearish pressure still intensifying and the overall trading volume dropping below $19bn once again, the demand for cryptocurrencies simple isn’t there. This not much of a surprise, as the same pattern has been visible throughout most of 2018 so far. After last year’s crazy bull run, it is only to be expected the coming six to twelve months will be incredibly volatile. So far, that has proven to be exactly the case.\nDespite this negative pressure, the EOS price successfully managed to note a small increase in the past 24 hours. It is rather remarkable, considering how most of the markets are still in the dirt and seemingly stuck in sideways trading momentum. Something will need to change fairly soon to overcome this dreadful trading momentum, as things seemingly won’t get any better until that happens.\nWith this 4.52% EOS price increase, the value is sitting comfortably above $13 once again. It is not necessarily the price point people are looking for, considering how the EOS price hit $18.4 not that long ago. Unfortunately, volatility s the name of the game in the cryptocurrency world, and that situation will remain in place for quite some time to come. EOS also gained 5.34$ over Bitcoin, which is an interesting development when looking at the bigger picture.\nWith $1.595bn in 24-hour trading volume , EOS remains one of the more popular cryptocurrency markets as of right now. Considering how the overall cryptocurrency trading volume has taken a sharp dip in the past few days, it is all the more remarkable to see EOS remain at this level during this time. There’s no real reason for a dip to speak of, though, but it is still intriguing regardless.\nAs one would come to expect, there is plenty of trading volume originating from the OKEx exchange. Bithumb and Huobi are also in the top three, which makes for a rather interesting collection. Upbit and Bitfinex round out the top five. This means there are three fiat currency pairs and two SUDT pairs in the top five for EOS. Plenty of capital entering the market right now, which could explain the EOS price rise over the past 24 hours.\nWhether or not the EOS price cna remain above $13, remains to be determined. So far, things look somewhat promising but things can always turn around in the world of cryptocurrency. So far, the weekend is not looking all that great when gauging the overall health of the cryptocurrency trading industry, but the day is not over just yet.

During the discussion, Srinivasan and Wilson were asked for their opinions on recent comments made by Warren Buffett, Nouriel Roubini and other notable bitcoin skeptics who have been quoted in the media recently.\nIn their responses, the pair of tech investors (but mostly Wilson) pointed out the differences between Buffett’s approach to investing and how the crypto asset market works. It is these fundamental differences between crypto assets and traditional stocks that may explain why the “Oracle of Omaha” has a general distaste for bitcoin.\nFor those who missed it, Buffett recently referred to bitcoin as “rat poison squared” at Berkshire Hathaway’s 2018 annual shareholder meeting. The Right Way to Look at Crypto Assets\nOne of the key counterarguments to Buffett’s assessment of bitcoin made during the chat at Consensus 2018 was articulated by Wilson right after the topic was first brought up by Vigna.\n“Calling it rat poison, to me, suggests that they haven’t taken the time to really understand what’s going on here,” said Wilson. “If all you think of it as is some new asset class and some new thing that you can trade, then I think you’ll come to that conclusion. But if you really understand that this is a fundamental innovation in foundational technology for the internet that provides a bunch of new functionality that didn’t exist before this, then what I see it as is like the LAMP stack or something. This is an entirely new stack that we’re going to get to build new applications on top of, and the tokens are just the fuel that lights up that stack.”\nThe LAMP stack referenced by Wilson is an open-source platform and set of tools (Linux, Apache, MySQL and Python or some other scripting language) that has been used to build dynamic websites and applications during the “Web 2.0” phase of the internet. Some view blockchain technology, of which bitcoin was the first implementation, as a key component of a new, decentralized internet, which has been dubbed “Web 3.0.” This Is Very Different From Buffett’s World\nWilson would later add that his work in venture capital is quite different from Warren Buffett’s approach to the investment world. While Buffett searches for cash-producing assets that will grow in value over time, Wilson is making a large number of moonshot bets in anticipation that a handful of them will lead to hundredfold gains.\nTalking more specifically about the world of crypto assets, Wilson explained that this market is more about picking the networks that will win rather than the businesses built on top of them.\n“The value is going to ultimately, I think, accrue to the token, not necessarily to the operating business that you build on top of these networks,” said Wilson.\nIn short, the ways in which the tokens native to these networks are valued are quite different from a normal business that Buffett would purchase. How to fundamentally value these crypto assets is still an open question, which adds even more difficulty and specialization to the emerging market.\n“There are some things about this sector that are unlike any other asset class we’ve ever seen,” Wilson would later add during a digression regarding forks in the crypto asset ecosystem.\nWhile Wilson admitted there are some crypto tokens that have inflated valuations right now, Srinivasan added that bitcoin and blockchain technology in general have already reached a point at which people like Buffett are frequently asked to comment on the topic, which points to a level of success that has already been achieved.\nAdditionally, Srinivasan mentioned that other institutional figures, such as IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde and Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, have had more positive things to say about the future of crypto assets.\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .

Hollywood has come knocking in significant ways. Alec Baldwin (The Boss Baby, SNL, Mission Impossible), Antonio Banderas (Shrek, Zorro, Spy Kids), and Oscar-winning filmmaker Bobby Moresco (Crash, Million Dollar Baby) are presently filming Lamborghini . It’s a biographical movie about Ferruccio Lamborghini, namesake behind the ecosystem’s favorite icon for crypto wealth. Fittingly, it’s also co-produced by Tatatu, a social entertainment company run on blockchain tech.\nAlso read: Ver’s Sci-Fi Novel Life, Voorhees Buys Tucker’s Tie for $27k Alec Baldwin’s New Lambo Movie Is Fittingly Crypto Backed\nHollywood heavy producer Andrea Iervolino explained , “Social networks and entertainment platforms are making huge profits by gathering data from their users and selling it to other corporations without rewarding their users. There is a need for a platform that provides higher levels of transparency to their users, brands, and rights holders about the revenues generated and monetization of users. Audiences need free, legal and quality content with a simple user experience.” Antonio Banderas\nMr. Iervolino, a dashing 30 year-old Italian, was speaking of his latest venture, Tatatu, a social media company which he implies will run on a variation on the technology currently causing fainting spells in the corporate world, blockchain. Though these pages have given voice to severe skepticism about distributed ledgers’ real-world use cases, Tatatu claims it can use an immutable ledger to record transactions in an open setting, which could allow for fairer remuneration for content providers. They insist this will mitigate against piracy, a lingering concern for mainstream media. Ferruccio Lamborghini\nThe nascent project has landed a co-producer credit, however, backing the major motion picture tentatively titled Lamborghini . Antonio Banderas stars as Ferruccio Lamborghini, while co-star Alec Baldwin plays antagonist and professional rival Ezno Ferrari. It was written by Oscar-winner Bobby Moresco, and is currently being filmed as of this writing. It will tell the story of Mr. Lamborghini from World War II through his creation of what the crypto community widely considers the ultimate sign of success, the vaunted Lambo. Should it eventually come to market, it will be the first major release to have a direct connection to crypto tech. Beyond Bitcoin\nSlate Entertainment Group (SEG) purchased the forthcoming (Spring 2019) documentary Beyond Bitcoin (Fulwell 73). SEG plans to run the doc on Binge , its blockchain-based, video on demand platform.\nLeo Pearlman of Fulwell 73 explains, “As a company, we are always looking for new and innovative distribution platforms, new ways to reach and engage with our audience and for the ideal partners for our content. Binge is the perfect fit for our film and is the natural place for viewers to find and engage with this content. The excitement for us as content creators is that they offer unprecedented transparency, cutting-edge analytics, and guaranteed payment terms, all of which empower producers like ourselves and offer a very different distribution option than those currently on the market.” Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver in Beyond Bitcoin\nJake Witzenfeld directs, and the doc’s focus is on three principals: Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver, blockchainer Perianne Boring, and investor Ryan Radloff. For a calendar year, viewers follow the three as they attempt to foment financial revolution: scaling debate wars, ICOs, regulation, and whether blockchain or bitcoin is the real innovation.\n“We are thrilled to have Beyond Bitcoin on the Binge platform,” Michael Moyal of SEG detailed. “The film provides an objective look at the potential for blockchain to disrupt numerous industries including entertainment. We at SEG share the filmmakers’ conviction that blockchain technology will help to facilitate our goal of adding fairness and accountability to the production and distribution of documentaries, feature films and series.”\nIs blockchain technology the future of movie-making?

Authorities in China banned domestic initial coin offerings (ICOs) and crypto trading in September, and subsequently cracked down on crypto mining . In the meantime, China’s central bank is among the world’s first to look into sovereign cryptocurrencies , and the nation’s tech giants are now mulling using blockchain tech in areas from supply chains to gaming . Last year, more than half of the world’s blockchain-related patent applications came from China.\nEric Zhao, a Shanghai-based engineer at the Chinese Academy of Sciences who operates the widely followed CNLedger Twitter account , said he won’t take the official crypto ratings very seriously because “most old-school experts haven’t followed the crypto space long enough to grasp some of the traits of [the] tech and community that can’t be found elsewhere.”\nHe added, “I believe at least it’s a sign that the officials are starting to treat crypto projects more like a neutral endeavour towards better technology and innovations, rather than just challenging the power and authority of banks and government.” Most Popular ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "weiss", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ccid research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of industry & information technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china center for information industry development", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T14:06:56.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "23ba77c3120595a8e68c7c8206ddbe037b31e8e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS_laUrwaR3Vj4xPS69Jjn0g-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin TX Accelerator - FREE", "title_full": "Bitcoin TX Accelerator - FREE", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "23ba77c3120595a8e68c7c8206ddbe037b31e8e6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS_laUrwaR3Vj4xPS69Jjn0g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin TX Accelerator - FREE", "text": "Bitcoin TX accelerator...\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3885905.msg37517294#msg37517294\nGot a BTC transaction stuck?

However two main differences are the the blocksize limits, as of August 2017 Bitcoin has a 1MB blocksize limit whereas BCH proposes 8MB blocks. Also BCH will adjust the difficulty every 6 blocks as opposed to 2016 blocks as with Bitcoin.\nBitcoin Cash is a proposal from the viaBTC mining pool and the Bitmain mining group to carry out a UAHF (User Activated Hard Fork) on August 1st 12:20 pm UTC. They rejected the agreed consensus (aka BIP-91 or SegWit2x) and have decided to fork the original Bitcoin blockchain and create this new version called “Bitcoin Cash”.

People who track the zodiac say the movement of the planet Uranus -- which represents revolution and change -- from Aries into Taurus this week is a good sign for cryptocurrencies. Thomas and starry-eyed others say they're moving money into crypto to get in on the potential action.\nAstrology, which holds that the position of planets rules our destinies, is of course not based on science. But to some, it sheds just as much light on how to invest in the unpredictable cryptocurrency sector as any market forecast for the notoriously erratic currency could. Many crypto investors are novices who are known to make decisions based on Reddit threads and gut instinct. So perhaps, it's not such a surprise that something as contentious as horoscopes and something as risky as crypto would go hand-in-hand.\nThomas first started to buy into astrology during the 2008 financial crisis, when many horoscopes he read seemed to predict financial and social shifts. Uranus shifts every seven years, and its last shift into Aries (a sign known for individuality and activism) coincided with social movements like the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter -- proof to him that there was a correlation. With a move into Taurus, which represents finances and resources, Uranus is marking a new era for crypto, he believes.\n\"I knew then that astrology may not be an exact science but it has the ability to predict trends by casting a big net focusing on certain themes in present day,\" he said. \"Uranus in Taurus -- until 2026 [represents] revolutionary innovations in areas of finance, climate, banking, farming and other earth-related things.\"\nEx-NFL football player Ricky Williams made headlines (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/09/astrology-is-telling-ex-nfl-star-ricky-williams-to-invest-in-bitcoin.html) earlier this month for the same reason: he bought cryptocurrencies because, he says, Uranus moving into Taurus means a financial shake-up is on the horizon. Raki Brown, a London-based cryptocurrency trader, said he invests based on significant zodiac changes as well as moves in his own chart.\n\"My dad studied astrology and I've been learning about for roughly 20 years, working on my own theory behind why it works,\" he said. \"Astrology to me is like alchemy was before it became chemistry due to the scientific method being applied.\"\nRaymond Merriman, president of Arizona-based Merriman Market Analyst -- which bases market timing services for independent traders on astrological and other factors -- said he expects bitcoin to fall to a new low before March 6, 2019, because Uranus will bounce back into Aries later this year before moving fully into Taurus on March 6. He told his clients they should not buy bitcoin unless it drops below 77% of its high of nearly $20,000 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-advent-of-bitcoin-futures-sparked-the-selloff-from-20000-says-san-francisco-fed-2018-05-07) in December 2017. Bitcoin was worth $8,200 when this story was published, but Merriman expects it to drop to between $4,400 and $1,300 based astrology alone.\n\"In the next few years, there are going to be major changes in currency valuations and leadership, and new forms of currency,\" he told MarketWatch (https://mmacycles.com/index.php?route=information/information&information_id=4).\nMerriman believes planetary movements have predicted previous financial shifts in the past, noting that the last time Uranus was in Taurus coincided with the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bring-back-the-gold-standard-this-is-what-happened-the-last-time-the-world-tried-it-2016-08-10), which tied the dollar to the price of gold. During the dot-com boom of the late 90s and early 2000s, Uranus was in Aquarius -- a sign of \"new ideas and machines.\" From 2003 to 2010, Uranus was in Pisces, bringing with it a boom in the oil industry, according to Merriman.\nThe astrologer-investor said he recognizes many people are skeptical of zodiac-inspired investments. But he said more traders rely on astrology to invest than many people realize. He estimated 20% of investors at large make decisions based on horoscopes -- a figure based on his own hunches about human nature rather than a formal survey. More than half of young adults believe astrology is a science (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-millennials-are-ditching-religion-for-witchcraft-and-astrology-2017-10-20). Merriman himself has more than 1,000 clients and has been in the business for more than 40 years.\n\"It doesn't worry me that this is one of the best-kept secrets at this time,\" he said. \"If you look at correlation of planetary cycles with human activity, you'd be amazed.\"\nAnnabel Gat, an International Society for Astrological Research-certified astrologer who writes for VICE media women's website Broadly, recently encouraged readers to explore cryptocurrencies as Uranus moves into Taurus this week.\n\"Uranus is the planet of innovation, invention, change and technology,\" she said. \"Whenever it does something big in the sky like change signs, we know something exciting and unexpected is about to happen.\"\nGat did not go as far as suggesting people actually invest in cryptocurrencies. In fact, most astrologers don't. Founders of popular astrology app (https://www.costarastrology.com) Co-star told MarketWatch they shy away from any kind of financial advice because it can have major effects on people's lives. Still, Gat noted, it's a good a time as ever to learn more about cryptocurrencies.\n\"Understanding and getting acquainted with cryptocurrency is great to do right now, because over the next seven years or so a lot is going to change,\" she said.\n-Kari Paul;\n 1514ET\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-advent-of-bitcoin-futures-sparked-the-selloff-from-20000-says-san-francisco-fed-2018-05-07)", "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bring-back-the-gold-standard-this-is-what-happened-the-last-time-the-world-tried-it-2016-08-10),", "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-millennials-are-ditching-religion-for-witchcraft-and-astrology-2017-10-20).", "https://mmacycles.com/index.php?route=information/information&information_id=4).", "http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250", "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/09/astrology-is-telling-ex-nfl-star-ricky-williams-to-invest-in-bitcoin.html)"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kari paul", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "marketwatch", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcus thomas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "aries", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T00:28:44.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "771ddcb5dd392eb33f4330969c141330dbe1fab6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtfcycYqfsuDclPWaKWHnOeNUrzb6ygxVxTCVUEBazBrEuL2dT9BnjyWxSndpHmKmTfYG_dSxvBEwgrMb.vd64Vlo4KNpoAE5XezfKnYI5.d8unj.19Xz3fUhBqHODI0Ael7nUHEhS4QnPIpzo1jUK0e0VFMBDCiXgw--", "site_full": "reviewcoin.me", "site": "reviewcoin.me", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Best New - Music Industry Modernized With Blockchain - Younk Is an Upcoming and Promising Startup for Investors - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "title_full": "Best New - Music Industry Modernized With Blockchain - Younk Is an Upcoming and Promising Startup for Investors - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "ME", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "https://reviewcoin.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/younk-image.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "771ddcb5dd392eb33f4330969c141330dbe1fab6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZ.X.pJ_5vtfcycYqfsuDclPWaKWHnOeNUrzb6ygxVxTCVUEBazBrEuL2dT9BnjyWxSndpHmKmTfYG_dSxvBEwgrMb.vd64Vlo4KNpoAE5XezfKnYI5.d8unj.19Xz3fUhBqHODI0Ael7nUHEhS4QnPIpzo1jUK0e0VFMBDCiXgw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Best New - Music Industry Modernized With Blockchain - Younk Is an Upcoming and Promising Startup for Investors - how earn Bitcoin, skill Bitcoin mining , Ethereum, Litecoin", "text": "/ Best New – Music Industry Modernized With Blockchain – Younk Is an Upcoming and Promising Startup for Investors Best New – Music Industry Modernized With Blockchain – Younk Is an Upcoming and Promising Startup for Investors Best New Cryptocurrency By root / May 17, 2018\nYounk is a blockchain platform that modernizes the way the music industry works!

Although the block size increase is quite a feat, BCH developers have also expanded the network’s default data-carrier-size to 220 Bytes and re-enabled some old Satoshi OP_Codes that were previously removed from earlier codebases. Now over the past 24-hours, lots of people have been playing around with the new BCH features.\nAlso Read: Bitcoin Cash Upgrade Milestone Complete: 32MB and New Features Experimenting With the New Bitcoin Cash OP_Codes\nLots of BCH community members have been discussing the new OP_Code features and the additional space added to the network’s default data-carrier-size. The first signs of people messing around with the new features came from the Memo and Blockpress developers as both platform’s increased posting character limit from 79 to 217. Both Memo and Blockpress (featured above) now have 217 characters.\nThis means users of both social media applications can now post more content and everything is saved on-chain. Then shortly after the fork, another OP_Code feature was shown to the community by Openbazaar developer Chris Pacia. The First Tree Signature on the Bitcoin Cash Blockchain\nPacia built the first tree signature on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain by utilizing the OP_CAT functionality — which creates a more efficient multi-signature combination. The Openbazaar programmer explains for addresses with a large number of keys, a tree signature can use less data. “For addresses with a large number of keys a tree signature can use less data. And unlike normal OP_CHECKMULTISIG, it doesn’t require you to expose the keys that were not used in the signing,” Pacia explains to the BCH community on May 15. Moreover, Pacia shows his demonstration via a block explorer URL which indicates it was a 1 of 8 multi-sig tree signature. Chris Pacia’s multi-sig tree.\nMany individuals were very impressed with the new multi-sig operation that shows innovation in multi-signature technology, and one that could add more BCH privacy in the future. Pacia details his example is a subset of MAST — which stands for ‘Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees.’ MAST could improve BCH privacy because certain multi-sig scripts could be kept hidden.\n“This is like a subset of MAST,” Pacia explains.\nMAST is more general but can’t be done with the current opcodes as far as I know — If we had OP_EVAL then we could I think. An OP_Code Puzzle With a Message in the Script\nAfter the tree signature our Chief Technology Officer, Emil Oldenburg, also experimented with the Satoshi OP_Codes and created a ‘transaction puzzle.’ When the puzzle is solved it contains a secret message within the hashed script.\n“I made a fun little transaction puzzle with one of the new OP_Codes,” Oldenburg explains .\nThe puzzle is solved with the string “BCH is the best Bitcoin”. The script is <String1><String2> OP_XOR OP_HASH256 <hash1> OP_EQUAL. It’s solved by finding the secret String1 that when XORed with String2, after hashing should be equal to hash1. Etching the Bible’s 23,000 Verses Into the Bitcoin Cash Blockchain\nLastly, another anonymous user is pushing the ‘arbitrary data spam debate’ to the ultimate level. The Twitter handle UK Cryptocurrency showed the cryptocurrency community that a BCH address is currently writing the first testament of the King James Bible to the Bitcoin Cash blockchain at 1sat/Byte. Looking at the Bitcoin Cash transaction ID its Memo states:\n1 In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth.\nTransactions following this continue to be written in the BCH chain with each verse that’s found in the King James Bible. This address is etching the entire Bible into the blockchain.\nUK Cryptocurrency estimates that the entire Bible may cost around $100 USD (0.08 BCH) and add around 8MB to the BCH chain. Of course, many Bitcoin Cash fans were excited to see the many OP_Code developments unfold so fast and expect more innovative ideas will sprout down the line.\nWhat do you think about all the OP_Code experimentation over the past day?

But bitcoin has under-performed, down 5 percent since Monday.\nMasters pointed out that three years ago, the market and number of people interested in cryptocurrencies was very small.

It would work like overnight money-market sweep accounts.\n“Every dollar you have that’s not paper gets swept into an overnight rate somewhere,” said Robert Leshner, founder and chief executive at Compound. “That’s exactly what we’re trying to create.”\nSo, first of all, what is your numéraire? Money-market funds aim to achieve a stable value, but in what currency? One assumes it is whatever gets swept: If you have 100 Bitcoins that get swept overnight on Monday, you’d hope that they’d come back worth like 100.01 Bitcoins on Tuesday, even if those 100.01 Tuesday Bitcoins are worth twice, or half, as many dollars as the 100 Monday ones. Leshner explains by email:\nYou have 100 bitcoins, and you send them to Compound's smart contract.\nThey get loaned to traders who want to buy even more volatile investments (like other tokens) using the bitcoin, or to short-sellers who hate bitcoin, and want to sell it for dollars. Those borrowers have to maintain an excess of collateral (any other tokenized asset) at Compound.\nThe next day you have … 100.01 bitcoins inside Compound.\nOkay sure but … “even more volatile” is … pretty volatile? Like, if I borrow $100 from you to buy three magic beans, and I overcollateralize that loan by leaving six magic beans with you, you are still exposed to the vagaries of the magic-bean market, you know? I worry that a Bitcoin money-market fund that makes its money by, like, margin lending to initial-coin-offering speculators might run the risk of breaking the buck (the Bitcoin) with some frequency.\nBut there is a deeper conceptual strangeness to this. I used to design derivatives for a living at an investment bank. Occasionally in derivatives design you need to put a pot of cash somewhere, and it was a dumb slow revelation to me how hard it is to … just … have ... a pot of cash. You can keep $20 in your wallet, but if you want to hold $20 million, then you will face a series of agonizing choices. You can keep it all in literal cash—in boxes of $20 bills in the corner of your office—but that is not very secure and not very convenient; if you want to send it to someone you have to put the boxes on a plane with a security guard. And there is no convenient electronic form of just, in the strictest sense, cash . You can put your dollars in a bank account, but the bank could go bust. (Deposit insurance has limits.) You can buy Treasury bills, but those mature, and meanwhile can lose (a tiny bit of) value as interest rates change. You can put your money into a money-market fund, but that could, however improbably, lose value too . None of these risks are all that material over an overnight time horizon. But if you have a lot of dollars, and your quite modest goal is “I want to have always exactly this amount of dollars on every day in the future, accessible anywhere, with absolutely no credit or market risk of any kind,” you can’t do it .\nIt is a little boggling, honestly. The reason all of everyone’s dollars are always getting swept up into an overnight rate somewhere—it’s not just because people have a deep desire to get paid interest; it’s also because those dollars have to go somewhere . They can never rest; even your most idle savings-account dollar is constantly being blasted through the economy, being put to use by someone else while you sleep. The interest compensates you for the uncanniness of having to hold your dollars through someone, some not-perfectly-riskless entity. It tells you something about the nature of dollars: that they are not pure entities that you can just conveniently own, that they are instead always somehow obligations of someone else, that they exist only as some form of debt.\nThat is the thing that Bitcoin is solving . Bitcoin is a form of cash that can be held directly by anyone in purely electronic portable transferable form without a bank. (Or a money-market sweep account.) “A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.” The reason the cash in your brokerage account gets swept into money-market funds every night is that it’d be idiotic for your broker to keep a bunch of $20 bills in an envelope with your name on it. The reason the Bitcoins in your Bitcoin-exchange account don’t get swept into money-market funds every night is that it’s easy for a Bitcoin exchange to hold onto those Bitcoins electronically, because that is the whole point of Bitcoin.\nI mean, that is one reason; the other reason is that no one thought of a crypto-money-market sweep account yet. Now they have! Now instead of just directly owning Bitcoins in decentralized form, you can own them through an exchange, and it can own them through a Compound smart contract, and the contract can lend them to some ICO speculator or Bitcoin short-seller, and your Bitcoins can bop off around the blockchain doing productive work in weird places while you sleep, and the whole regular financial system can be recreated in a slightly skewed way.\nHoweyCoin.\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, to demonstrate the risk of unregistered initial coin offerings, launched its own fake ICO for “HoweyCoins.” I mean, they were not especially committed to the premise; as far as I can tell they put up a website for HoweyCoins and also simultaneously a different and better publicized website explaining that “If You Responded To An Investment Offer Like This, You Could Have Been Scammed – HoweyCoins Are Completely Fake!” Anyway like 20 of you sent me this story; I don’t think I’ve ever had more readers mention anything to me. It does make sense that the audience for Money Stuff and the audience for SEC pranks would overlap perfectly.\nThe prank is, I don’t know, fine I guess? The white paper has some good parody blather like “By undercutting the monopoly role of the national governments in creating currency, savings that you may not realize are being kept by the elite and the government will flow to you—the consumer.” But it is missing all the … like … crypto -blather? There are no incomprehensible sections on technical implementation, no funny diagrams explaining how the coin works, no bios of the technical team. The word “blockchain” appears only four times in eight pages; the words “hash” and “ERC-20” don’t appear at all. It’s just a little thin. We talked a while back about a prank that the Alberta Securities Commission pulled, in which they ran a fake investment seminar “to educate Albertans about the realities of investment fraud.”“Everything about the fake investment opportunity – from the company's name and logo, to Jonathan Fisher's bio and the colour of his tie – was extensively researched,” read the story, and I mentioned that running prank investment frauds for a securities regulator would be a dream job. Next time the SEC wants a prank ICO I’d be happy to help!\nAlso guys the name. I get it. SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. is the Supreme Court case that created the modern test—widely referred to as the “Howey Test”—for what counts as a “security,” a question of significant interest to people trying to figure out which ICOs need to be registered with the SEC. If you are a securities lawyer who works on ICOs, you probably got a teeny grim chuckle out of that. But it doesn’t make sense within the world the SEC is building . HoweyCoin’s pitch is vaguely about travel benefits. It should be called TravelCoin or TripBit or CryptoVoyage, something that makes the reader think “oh yes this was named by someone who thought it was a coin for travel benefits,” not, like, “oh yes this was named by securities lawyers playing a prank.”\nOops!\nThere is a common but erroneous belief that securities fraud is only securities fraud when it involves publicly traded companies. “If a public company did this, it would be securities fraud,” people sometimes say about stuff that private companies do that is in fact securities fraud. There is nothing particularly in the law to support this view, but there is an understandable intuition behind it. Regular people buy shares of public companies based on information provided by the companies: Mom-and-pop investors can read a company’s securities filings and decide to buy its stock on the stock exchange, and if those filings are full of lies then the company is entirely to blame and the investors are innocent victims.\nBut private transactions are a little different. Private companies, of course, disclose less information publicly than public ones do. But when venture capitalists buy stakes in private tech companies, or when private-equity firms do leveraged buyouts, they tend to get a lot more information about the companies than regular public investors do when they buy stock on the stock exchange. This is called “due diligence,” and the idea is that sophisticated private investors who are writing very large checks are supposed to be able to ask good questions, and get satisfying answers to those questions, before writing those checks.\nIn practice this often isn’t true—big sexy tech unicorns can raise money with essentially no financial information—but it actually matters that it is true in theory. If you are a sophisticated private-equity investor writing a $100-million check to buy a company, and you have the opportunity to do due diligence and interview company management and review the financial statements and talk to the auditors and examine the customer lists and so forth, and the company sends you a pack of lies, and you don’t catch them and buy the company anyway, then yes, of course, that is the company’s fault, and the company did a bad thing, but it is also your fault too, in a way that it isn’t a public investor’s fault. Your job is to notice that stuff!\nAnd so for instance massive fraud ,” get quite unsympathetic press : They were rich and sophisticated and had every opportunity to do due diligence, and if they got hoodwinked then that reflects almost as badly on them as it does on the hoodwinkers. It is embarrassing to be the victim of securities fraud when you are a sophisticated large investor who had the opportunity to do due diligence, which means that these frauds are less likely to be pursued than frauds against public investors. Who would want to report them?\nYesterday the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice brought civil and criminal securities-fraud cases against three former executives of Constellation Healthcare Technologies Inc. Constellation was actually a publicly traded company, but the fraud charges are not about its public trading—which occurred on the London Stock Exchange’s AIM market and is therefore none of the SEC’s business—but about a going-private transaction that it completed in early 2017.

There is a major bearish trend line formed with resistance at $1,250 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair is currently correcting higher, but it may face many barriers on the upside near $1,240-50. Bitcoin cash price is under pressure below $1,300 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD is likely to extend declines further if it fails to move above $1,250. Bitcoin Cash Price Decline Recently, there was a minor upside correction above $1,300 in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price traded towards $1,340 where sellers appeared and protected more upsides. As a result, the price started a fresh downside move and declined back below $1,300. Sellers gained momentum, which pushed the price even below the $1,240 and $1,220 support levels. The decline was such that the price almost tested the $1,150 level. A low was formed at $1,156 from where an upside correction is currently underway. It is currently testing the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,339 high to $1,156 low. However, there are many hurdles on the upside for buyers near $1,220-50. There is also a major bearish trend line formed with resistance at $1,250 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair. Moreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $1,339 high to $1,156 low is near $1,248 to act as a resistance. Looking at the chart , the price is clearly under bearish pressure below $1,250. A break above $1,240-50 is needed for a bounce back, else there is a risk of more declines towards $1,100 in the near term. Looking at the technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is mostly moving in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is currently recovering from the 30 level. Major Support Level – $1,150 Major Resistance Level – $1,250\nFull details at www.newsbtc.com/2018/05/18/bitcoin-cash-price-analysis-bch-usd-extends-decline/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "key points bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-18T08:22:58.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3edc963fb9c8d5efe0bd974b0af7fcbf84936dc8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS2PJGhGgNa6uU.zfL5xstlM-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "How to Earn Free Bitcoin", "title_full": "How to Earn Free Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3edc963fb9c8d5efe0bd974b0af7fcbf84936dc8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS2PJGhGgNa6uU.zfL5xstlM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-05-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to Earn Free Bitcoin", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nEarn Bitcoins while using Mozilla Firefox!

books. After falling to $8,500 yesterday from its previous mark of $8,800, bitcoin is once again stumbling down the staircase and is now trading for $8,300 – just a sliver above last week’s low of $8,250. The Coindesk Consensus Conference – which potentially gave bitcoin a boost over the last 72 hours – ends today, and it appears the hype it garnered for cryptocurrency is ending with it. No doubt, most investors are annoyed with bitcoin’s lack of strength against its newfound resistance. Many analysts now wonder if the currency will drop back down to the $7,000 range, which it last skimmed in March. One of the alleged reasons for the recent drop may be Bing’s recent ban of cryptocurrency ads. Powered by Microsoft, Bing is the world’s second-largest search engine behind Google, and apparently doesn’t see safety in cryptocurrency usage. The platform made the announcement on its Bing Ads blog, and expects the ban to be fully integrated by either late June or early July. Advertising policy manager for Microsoft Melissa Alsoszatai-Petheo explained: “Because cryptocurrency and related products are not regulated, we have found them to present a possible elevated risk to our users, with the potential for bad actors participating in predatory behaviors or scamming consumers. To help protect our users from this risk, we have made the decision to disallow advertising. We are always evaluating our policies to ensure a safe and engaging experience for our Bing users and the digital advertising ecosystem.” Facebook made a similar ban last January. Representatives explained that they could no longer promote unregulated financial options as they potentially put investors and their money through unsafe conditions. Company product management director Rob Leathern later commented, “We want people to continue to discover and learn about new products and services through Facebook ads without fear of scams or deception. That said, there are many companies who are advertising binary options, ICOs, and cryptocurrencies that are not currently operating in good faith.” Google took a similar route in March, explaining that all cryptocurrencies would be banned from its AdWords platform given that they were not regulated, and investors were offered no guarantees that digital currencies or ICOs operated in a clean or decipherable manner. According to one source , bitcoin is the victim of weak “technical setup.” It’s explained that bitcoin is back to the diamond formation it had escaped last week, and the price could potentially fall as low as $7,850 or $7,800 in the coming days. The source did say, however, that if bitcoin broke above $8,500, it could develop newfound resistance levels. Perhaps $9,000 isn’t far off the mark after all… And still, many analysts remain bullish towards the coin. Jeremy Liew and Peter Smith – a Snap venture capitalist and the CEO of Blockchain, respectively – believe that the currency could hit the half-a-million mark by the end of 2030. Granted we still have 12 years to wait, but both men believe bitcoin adoption will explode in the coming years, and that bitcoin transactions will account for roughly half of the world’s non-cash transactions, pushing the price to new heights. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "melissa al", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bing", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T00:44:31.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b8bf5ce19bb8b740403de784775894ae7133d02f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCFEPymJoNdWZrds0.oaK6WvpptTxLodfDhL7ubPnxI5..LihqrbgBt_S02bzfjX3P3NoE4UdTc62TvCwVQUnhSP18o8H1Zs3s6IKV1QMhyzE-", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "Forget Bitcoin, These Altcoins Are Leading the Way in Merchant Adoption", "title_full": "Forget Bitcoin, These Altcoins Are Leading the Way in Merchant Adoption", "published": "2018-05-17T02:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1526501302_65969020.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b8bf5ce19bb8b740403de784775894ae7133d02f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fCFEPymJoNdWZrds0.oaK6WvpptTxLodfDhL7ubPnxI5..LihqrbgBt_S02bzfjX3P3NoE4UdTc62TvCwVQUnhSP18o8H1Zs3s6IKV1QMhyzE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-17T02:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Forget Bitcoin, These Altcoins Are Leading the Way in Merchant Adoption", "text": "1 hour ago Crypto World News The Merkle 52 Since its inception, one of the major goals of the cryptocurrency community has been the adoption of Bitcoin as a payment method for goods and services. As it stands now, consumers can use Bitcoin across a number of industries to purchase everything from real estate, to PCs, to pizza. However, Bitcoin’s high transaction costs, deflationary nature, and full transparency represent some of the shortcomings that prevent Bitcoin from seeing widespread merchant adoption. As such, enthusiasts, consumers, and producers alike have gotten behind a number of altcoins as mediums of exchange for a variety of uses. While Bitcoin acted as the catalyst for the first wave of crypto-merchant integration, these emerging altcoins are the pioneers for the interactions between the consumers and merchants of tomorrow. Privacy Coins One cryptocurrency niche seeing steady and increasing consumer activity is privacy coins. There exist a number of situations where anonymous transactions are optimal for the consumer or producer. The obvious example is the use of Monero (XMR) to power darknet markets – allowing buyers and sellers to agree upon the sale of drugs and other illicit goods in a completely anonymous, untraceable manner. However, black market sales do not wholly represent usage of privacy coins. Consumers have also flocked to privacy coins for usage in the adult industry . Monero has seen integration on sites selling sex toys. A number of privacy coins have also been integrated across various porn sites. With privacy coins, there is no paper trail – alleviating the risk of embarrassing or scandalous credit card statements being viewed by other parties. The nature of cryptocurrency also ensures that payments to any merchant will not jeopardize the information or payment details of the consumer. Of course, the recent Verge partnership represents the most prominent instance of adoption of privacy coins in the adult industry. Last month, Verge (XVG) unveiled a partnership with porn giant Pornhub.com, which will allow payments to the site to be made via XVG. Although much controversy has ensued, this partnership pins Verge as a pioneer for privacy coin adoption. Other Instances Outside of privacy coins, a number of other altcoins have also begun to see meaningful integrations. OmiseGo (OMG), a platform seeking to empower the unbanked and create an inclusive, massively scalable financial ecosystem, earned the spotlight when OMG was integrated by McDonald’s Thailand. As OmiseGo continues to expand its network, it’s predicted that other large corporations will integrate the cryptocurrency down the road. Beloved meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE) has also seen significant adoption. As the lighthearted and far-reaching community drove the joke coin to a powerhouse with a market cap of over US$500 million, community members and converted fans have driven Doge to be picked up by numerous merchants worldwide. One example that encapsulates the spirit of DOGE is this site for trendy pet accessories. One upcoming project with a lot of potential is flogmall . Flogmall seeks to become a one-stop online shopping destination that accepts all cryptocurrencies. Of course, this will include KickCoin (KICK), the native token of the platform that’s responsible for crowdfunding the flogmall project, KICKICO. Of course, with the ever-increasing popularity and information surrounding cryptocurrency, it’s only logical that merchants and consumers worldwide will continue to make new transactions and relationships through cryptocurrency. The future of cryptocurrency in consumer settings is wildly exciting. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "these altcoins are leading the way", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "monero", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T00:44:31.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1c353534ef7ace3603b8804ca61a6908ea62a308", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fC04QMi2GLCYh3WKyNKccYsCwB7Um5mvMamt.8598MYCC2bfPcSsMjqj3_G7o757EoIG8rNP0lPJGED79REMmiBQ--", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "LedgerX Introduces CFTC Licensed Bitcoin Savings Accounts", "title_full": "LedgerX Introduces CFTC Licensed Bitcoin Savings Accounts", "published": "2018-05-17T02:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1526494100_46621653.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1c353534ef7ace3603b8804ca61a6908ea62a308", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fC04QMi2GLCYh3WKyNKccYsCwB7Um5mvMamt.8598MYCC2bfPcSsMjqj3_G7o757EoIG8rNP0lPJGED79REMmiBQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-17T02:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "LedgerX Introduces CFTC Licensed Bitcoin Savings Accounts", "text": "3 hours ago Crypto and Laws Bitcoinist 41 LedgerX has introduced a Bitcoin savings product licensed by the CFTC. The Bitcoin asset management platform has designed this new product to cater to long-term hodlers. The LedgerX Bitcoin ‘Call Overwrite’ Launched on May 15th, the LedgerX Bitcoin savings account enables investors to earn a fiat-based yield on their Bitcoin holdings. Instead of hodling in the hope of a significant price increase, savers can now earn revenue from a call overwrite. Usually, overwrite contracts are for assets that are deemed to be undervalued or overvalued. The trader overwrites calls if the latter is the case and overwrites puts if the former is the case. With this investment technique, traders deposit Bitcoin in their LedgerX accounts. The trader then sets a call option sold at a longer date with an accompanying slightly higher strike call option. LedgerX already offers similar trading techniques, but this new product makes the process a lot less complicated. The new Bitcoin savings account will enable less finance-savvy investors to earn USD premiums on their Bitcoin holdings. Traders have the freedom to select both the number of bitcoins and the premium rate. Options contracts on the new account will be offered in both three months and six months duration. LedgerX will also charge a transaction fee for the product. CFTC Regulations LedgerX’s new Bitcoin savings account is provided under license from the CFTC. The company has both the CFTC derivatives clearing organization (DCO) and the swap execution facility (SEF) licenses . In an interview with Forbes , Juthica Chou spoke about the importance of being a licensed Bitcoin company. The LedgerX co-founder and CTO said that the company’s products are all in compliance with statutory regulations. She also said LedgerX takes a deliberate approach to ensuring that it stays within the confines of the law. Commenting on the new product, Chou expressed optimism that it would become a favorite of the company’s customers. The LedgerX CTO based her confidence on the current trading pattern already established in the company. According to Chou, more than 70 percent of LedgerX’s trading volume comes from similar Bitcoin options contracts. Last quarter, the company also recorded a notional transaction average of $30 million per month. Another reason for Chou’s optimism is the Bitcoin volatility which makes call overwrites an attractive investment strategy.

I have no doubt that in one way or another, the technology will play a role,” he responded when asked about trading Bitcoin-based products.\n“If we need to clear futures of bitcoin, can we do it? Yes. Have we done it? No.”\nPinto’s neutral stance continues the investment banking giant’s somewhat mixed signals about Bitcoin in 2018.\nDespite banning customers from purchasing cryptocurrency using its credit cards, senior executives — including the once infamously bearish Dimon — have variously spoken out about the beneficial aspects of both Bitcoin and blockchain technology.\nPinto, too, sees the future of the economy incorporating aspects which were born with the mainstream entry of cryptocurrency.\n“The tokenization of the economy, for me, is real,” he continued. “Cryptocurrencies are real but not in the current form.”\nJPMorgan is working on blockchain integration, Cointelegraph reported earlier this month, filing a patent for real-time p2p interbank transfers using the technology.\nThis post first appeared at CoinTelegraph, the authority on global cryptocurrency markets.

Legitimizing Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency in the EU\nBoth cryptocurrency exchanges and online wallets operating in the European Union’s jurisdiction are now required to carry out the exact same know-your-customer (KYC) checks as traditional banks.\nThe regulatory move comes as the European Union continues its widespread attack — which also sees changes and regulation affecting areas of finance and traditional banking — on money laundering and terrorist financing.\nAs noted by Reuters , the increased transparency in regards to cryptocurrency trading and storage will almost certainly detract from major cryptocurrencies being used for illicit means, as KYC regulations will make it significantly easier for law enforcement to catch money launderers and terrorist financiers. As an added benefit, it should also make hackers’ lives more difficult should they target said exchanges and wallets.\nOf course, nothing is stopping European citizens from using cryptocurrency exchanges outside the reach of EU authority. Nevertheless, the world’s major cryptocurrency markets are moving in the same direction, with South Korea having already imposed KYC regulations on its exchanges and the United States expected to follow suit eventually.\nThough many in the cryptocurrency space aren’t particularly fond of KYC barriers, such data collection undoubtedly lends significantly more legitimacy to cryptocurrency than previously existed.\nOne should also not take the EU’s new KYC requirements as an indication that the political and economic union is negative towards cryptocurrency. Rather, the continent’s alliance has been pushing to legitimize cryptocurrencies’ underlying technology in recent months.\nOn April 10th, 22 countries in the European Union signed a Declaration on the Establishment of a European Blockchain Partnership , which is aimed at cementing Europe as a world leader in the development and launch of blockchain technologies.\nThe international partnership claims to be “a vehicle for cooperation amongst Member States to exchange experience and expertise in technical and regulatory fields and prepare for the launch of EU-wide blockchain applications across the Digital Single Market for the benefit of the public and private sectors.”\nWhat do you think about KYC requirements?

The executive tweeted in 2016 that he would “love to see a digital currency thrive.” In his role at Square, he has helped promote cryptocurrency. In 2014, the payments company started letting merchants accept Bitcoin. Since then, San Francisco-based Square has said it’s introducing Bitcoin trading for almost all users of its Cash App, which lets users send money to friends and family.\nNot everyone at Square was as enthusiastic as Dorsey was about the move.\n“I’ll be frank, this was a pretty contentious move in the company,” he said. A number of people at Square were skeptical about the technology and making access to digital currencies much easier. Even today, Dorsey added, there are debates and even fights over the topic, and some of the company’s board members are resistant to cryptocurrencies.\nSquare reported earlier this month that it reaped $34.1 million in first-quarter revenue from selling Bitcoin, but it cost the company $33.9 million to buy the tokens, meaning Square only made about $200,000.\n“This technology is a fundamental shift to our world and can have so many positive outcomes,” Dorsey said at the Consensus conference, the biggest of about two dozen events during New York’s “Blockchain Week.” “We have to do the work to educate regulators and educate the SEC why this technology is important.”\n© 2018 Bloomberg", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text="], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "twitter and square", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco-based square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T10:09:07.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3ff6679676863c55392ea6b9398c9d3a118684af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY1yfFtVd3J8ShUXgeF4Jx5SRHMlJOigRa2Yys7hRET8Cqv7XifFerfchrcHJMYNbRxnGUh79KKnynTyJuACRy6vCJik2kwpQ0-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "Checkout the CoolWallet S, the world's first wireless Bitcoin hardware wallet.

He said that he doesn’t know whether it will be Bitcoin (BTC), but “I hope it will be.” Dorsey said: “This technology is a fundamental shift to our world and can have so many positive outcomes. We have to do the work to educate regulators and educate the SEC why this technology is important.” Square, a developer of payment and financial services solutions, allowed merchants to accept BTC in 2014 and made BTC trading available for almost all users of its Cash App in February of this year. Not everyone at Square shares Dorsey’s enthusiasm however. He said that “this was a pretty contentious move in the company,” adding that there are still debates and fights over the topic. According to Dorsey, some of the company’s board of directors are also resistant to the idea of cryptocurrency. In the beginning of May, Square reported low profits from BTC trading in the first quarter, which only amounted to around $200,000. While BTC trading constituted a 5 percent overall revenue of $34.1 mln, the company spent $33.9 mln to purchase the tokens. Dorsey’s recent speech reaffirms previous comments that Bitcoin will become the world’s “single currency” within a decade. He said: “The world ultimately will have a single currency, the Internet will have a single currency. I personally believe that it will be Bitcoin.” Dorsey noted that, at the moment, Bitcoin is “slow and costly,” which makes it difficult to use as a medium of exchange. He added that “as more and more people have it, those things go away.”\nCointelegraph.com is author of this content, TheBitcoinNews.com is is not responsible for the content of external sites.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/square", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/payments-company-square-unveils-low-returns-from-bitcoin-business-last-quarter", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/square-cash-app-releases-bitcoin-buysell-option-to-almost-all-users", "https://cointelegraph.com/tags/twitter", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-16/square-s-dorsey-is-all-in-on-bitcoin-as-currency-of-the-future", "https://cointelegraph.com/news/twitter-ceo-says-bitcoin-will-become-worlds-single-currency-within-a-decad"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dorsey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter and square inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T03:41:06.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "af6cdf4b394b881682ef93288d987381e14a30c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWAkegs2rOArBn75MeybF8c-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=240.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Tokens (Altcoins)", "title": "🔥🚀🚀[ANN][Pre-ICO] Bitcoin Crown - Cryptocurrency for online game lovers🔥🚀🚀", "title_full": "🔥🚀🚀[ANN][Pre-ICO] Bitcoin Crown - Cryptocurrency for online game lovers🔥🚀🚀", "published": "2018-05-17T01:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "af6cdf4b394b881682ef93288d987381e14a30c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmWAkegs2rOArBn75MeybF8c-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "syeril", "published": "2018-05-17T01:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "🔥🚀🚀[ANN][Pre-ICO] Bitcoin Crown - Cryptocurrency for online game lovers🔥🚀🚀", "text": "Impossible became possible with Bitcoin Crown.

Additionally Ver explained his current bullishness on Bitcoin Cash (BCH) the exact same reasons applied to his bullishness on Bitcoin (BTC) back in 2011.

You know, like Bitcoin .\nAccording to the ethics committee of the S.C. House of Representatives, state law does not currently include digital currency within its definition of a campaign “contribution.” As a result, candidates cannot legally accept such donations.\nDo we agree with that ruling? No …\nMore on that in a moment, though …\nThe issue of whether candidates could accept Bitcoin was first raised by Britton Wolf , a 23-year-old conservative activist and high school lacrosse coach who is running against veteran South Carolina lawmaker Nathan Ballentine in this spring’s GOP primary election. Wolf and Ballentine are vying to represent S.C. House District 71 ( map ) – which encompasses parts of Lexington and Richland counties in the northwestern suburbs of Columbia, S.C.\n“A gentleman asked me if he could contribute Bitcoin to my campaign, because he is paid and makes purchases primarily in Bitcoin,” Wolf said in a statement. “So, we asked the ethics committee how to go about properly reporting it before we accepted it.”\nThe answer? Wolf was told he couldn’t accept the contribution.\n“South Carolina law defines a contribution as ‘money or anything of value’ ‘for the purpose of influencing an election,’ and bitcoins are ‘money or anything of value,’” Wolf said. “But beyond monetary value, this is a free speech issue. The Supreme Court has ruled that the ability of people to speak freely and engage in the political process includes the ability to donate money to campaigns.

One of many digital currencies untethered to any national monetary system or bank, it uses peer-to-peer technology to facilitate transactions – with its price rising or falling based on supply and demand (like gold or silver).\nAs of this writing, one Bitcoin is worth approximately $8,300 – well above the maximum contribution for a state legislative race ($1,000) or a statewide race ($3,500). However Bitcoin allows for fractional transactions, meaning those looking to trade or purchase with it can splice it as they see fit.\nShould they be allowed to do so in political races (in South Carolina or anywhere else)?

(VRCP) Speeds Up Bitcoin eCommerce Transactions", "text": "Virtual Crypto Technologies Inc. (VRCP) Speeds Up Bitcoin eCommerce Transactions Cryptocurrencies gain in acceptance, but… High transaction fees and lengthy processing times delay implementation Bit4Sure cuts bitcoin transaction times\nNow that some marquee names – Microsoft, Expedia, Overstock – have begun accepting bitcoin, it looks as if cryptocurrencies have entered the mainstream of commerce. Notice from Japanese retailer Rakuten appears to confirm that. The ecommerce giant, which has been called Japan’s Amazon, has announced plans to launch its own “Rakuten Coin” in the near future ( http://ibn.fm/ld2I7 ). Not so fast, however. Ironically, Satoshi Nakamoto’s peer-to-peer payment system, which held out the promise of no intermediaries charging transaction costs, is plagued by high transaction costs. Other frictions also exist, one of which is tardy speed of execution. Nevertheless, getting bitcoin payments up to speed may be just around the corner.\nVirtual Crypto Technologies Inc. (OTCQB: VRCP) has launched Bit4Sure, a proprietary cryptocurrency transaction confirmation solution. Virtual Crypto Technologies is a technology company dedicated to making cryptocurrencies accessible to the public, specifically by creating payment solutions for businesses and consumers, which combine application programming interfaces and mobile applications for implementation across ATMs, PCs, tablets and other mobile devices.\nAs useful as blockchain technology is turning out to be, its employment in payment transactions is running into unanticipated problems that result in high transaction fees and delayed processing. One major issue with blockchain processing is the limit on the number of transactions that can be “confirmed” in each block and the time it may take to “fully” verify a transaction. Authenticating a bitcoin transaction can be quite lengthy because of the confirmation steps involved.\nThe process begins when a bitcoin payment is made, an event that broadcasts to the bitcoin network that the transaction is now in the “unconfirmed transactions” pool. Bitcoin miners will access this unconfirmed transactions pool and attempt to verify the transactions they find there by solving complex algorithms. If they do, they group the transactions into a “block”, which is set at the end of the existing blockchain, extending it. Every time a new block is verified, the older, existing blocks are re-verified. Thus, older blocks carry more trust than newer ones. However, this going over old ground can drag out transaction time. Moreover, only a limited number of transactions can be confirmed in one block, which means that, typically, a new bitcoin block only appears after about 10 minutes.\nSometimes (especially when the price spikes), bitcoin transactions surge, resulting in increased competition for limited block space; this drives up fees. Bitcoin fees are computed according to system rules that take into account the coins someone plans to spend, their size, their age, and the transaction size. The bitcoin system does not add coins; every coin is kept separately in a wallet. When a payment is made, the wallet will attempt to select coins to match the amount. It’s very similar to paying $0.65 with traditional coins, where a consumer could select two quarters, a dime and a nickel. This increases transaction size and fees. If, instead, a user were making a 0.65-bitcoin payment and happened to have a 0.65 bitcoin, transaction size and fees, and possibly time as well, would be less.\nFortunately, the Virtual Crypto Bit4Sure solution is sure to cut transaction time ( http://ibn.fm/b3yoM ). It bridges the time gap from when a transaction is published on the bitcoin network to the moment it joins the blockchain, essentially confirming a transaction before it reaches the blockchain for inclusion in a mined block. The Bit4Sure API also provides subscribers with direct access to Virtual Crypto’s proprietary algorithm model, giving them real-time confirmation of cryptocurrency transactions, as well as the ability to monitor the trading market of any cryptocurrency, protecting subscribers from delay, double spending and fraud. Virtual Crypto anticipates that the Bit4Sure API will be particularly attractive to crypto exchanges, payment processors, crypto wallets and other direct participants in the industry. The platform incorporates a mobile app for consumers.\n the company’s website at www.Virtual-Crypto.com\nAbout QualityStocks\n We offer several ways for investors to learn more about investing in these companies as well as find and evaluate them.\nQualityStocks (QS)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.qualitystocks.net/", "http://ibn.fm/b3yoM", "http://ibn.fm/ld2I7", "http://www.virtual-crypto.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "satoshi nakamoto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "overstock", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bitcoin ecommerce transactions virtual crypto technologies inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virtual crypto technologies inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "expedia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rakuten", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T02:56:48.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d8a04e0d439f465d4c2e4cd96a10d70bd9c389c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmR7X_npZic00XIkAc_bnBNs-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=74.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Legal", "title": "A big problem in bitcoin ???", "title_full": "A big problem in bitcoin ???", "published": "2018-05-17T01:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d8a04e0d439f465d4c2e4cd96a10d70bd9c389c5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmR7X_npZic00XIkAc_bnBNs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Magic Sarap", "published": "2018-05-17T01:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "A big problem in bitcoin ???", "text": "Quote: from: Magic Sarap on May 16, 2018, 05:22:42 PM Quote: from: AgentofCoin on March 22, 2017, 03:22:35 PM Quote: from: pawanjain on March 22, 2017, 04:50:25 AM I am not sure that this section is right to post my thread .\nmy question is :\nsince it was already fixed by the bitcoin owner network that 21 millions bitcoin can exist in the whole internet\nBut now I heard that now the mining of the bitcoin will be unlimited , I mean unlimited bitcoin will generate by the bitcoin network .\nIf this is real news then the value of the bitcoin will go down speedly\nIt is because the supply is unlimited so it is simple to say that bitcoin price will no more increase rapidly ., so no more profit\nwhat's your thought guys\nBitcoin Unlimited does not increase the number of coins.\nUnder this new client, there will only be 21 million coins. The reason why it is\ncalled unlimited is because it allows the potential to create a block that has more\ntransactions in it. Current protocol has a limit of 1MB.

In 2017, more than $5,3 million worth of Bitcoin – the benchmark cryptocurrency – was traded on the country’s biggest digital currency exchange Golix.\nAnd as the price of Bitcoin peaked at $33 000 on the exchange late last year, from just $1 000 in January, more people joined in what has become the modern day “gold rush”.\nAltogether, Golix has traded $20 million Bitcoin’s worth since it started operations in September 2015.\nBut it is the exchange’s latest plans to raise $35,8 million through a special token sale that has forced the hand of authorities at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe to ban cryptocurrencies.\nSo what exactly is Bitcoin, and what’s behind the investors’ mania, and the regulators’ fears?\nWhat is Bitcoin? To illustrate our case, we use Bitcoin to represent the rest of the smaller cryptocurrencies, which number more than 1 500.\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be created in 2009 by shadowy Japanese developer Satoshi Nakamoto, and has become the most valuable and most popular digital asset.\nIt is not your everyday currency, the kind that one can hold in the hand like bond notes or US dollars.\nIt is stored virtually – on smartphones, computers and tablets etc – more or less like your Ecocash and Telecash, but without the central regulatory authority.\nUnlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not issued by a central bank or government – although Venezuelan authorities have issued their own cryptocurrency – with only 3 600 coins created through a process called mining each day.\nAbout 16,5 million Bitcoins are in circulation today, and only 21 million can ever be issued, a situation that has led some into predicting a growth of unhindered proportions for the digital currency.\nThe technology behind Bitcoin is a complex one. Put simply, the system rounds up transactions by investors into what are known as “blocks”, to be solved by math – the blockchain.\nTo do this, one needs very powerful computers to work out a solution whether the transaction was possible.\nThis is what is called mining. Once the other “miners” confirm the solution, the transaction goes through, with “miners” earning Bitcoin.\nWhere can I buy Bitcoin in Zimbabwe? There are two main digital currency trading platforms in Zimbabwe, Harare-based Golix, and Styx24 in Gweru. With more than 50 000 investors actively trading on its exchange, Golix is the bigger of the two.\nThe currency can also be bought on Local Bitcoins.com, a much bigger platform that connects thousands of people from all over the world.\nThe price of Bitcoin, like other currencies, is typically decided by those willing to buy or sell it.\nTo receive a Bitcoin, the buyer must have a Bitcoin address – a long list of alphanumeric characters.\nThe system is built to protect privacy, so investors often get off without their identities being revealed.\nBut once the address is lost, the Bitcoins are lost with it.\nI have got Bitcoin, so what? While there is no shop known to accept Bitcoin as a means of payment here, a small number of Zimbabweans have become active trading in cryptocurrencies. Some are using Bitcoin to pay for goods and services like university fees and health bills abroad easily, without having to queue up at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe for it.\nAnd those overseas to send money back home.\nLast year, Golix processed about $1,8 million of such payments.\nLargely though, cryptos are now being looked at as an investment, buoyed by the 1 400 percent growth in the price of Bitcoin last year.\nThose with the coin are now unwilling to sale, hoping it will gain more value in future. It is not clear what will happen when the 21 million maximum Bitcoins are fully issued.\nOn account of this, a number of optimistic experts have predicted the price to shoot to between $100,000 and $250 000 per coin in the next few years.\nHere, Golix has gone a step further. It launched a Bitcoin ATM in Harare last month, allowing investors to withdraw hard US dollars from the sale of their cryptocurrencies, a novelty in an economy where traditional ATM no longer dispense cash.\nBut the biggest challenge remains a lack of liquidity and high demand, which have forced Bitcoin to trade a premium of about 40 to 60 percent to the global average price. For example, the international price of one Bitcoin was quoted at around $8 253 early morning on May 16. On Golix it was about $13 000.\nWhat are regulators saying? Regulation of digital money still remains as obscure as the virtual currencies debate itself. Bitcoin represents an era in financial technology that at best remains speculative, seldom understood by both citizens and by Government, though, in its current state, open to criminal abuse.\nThere is no law that specifically supports or criminalises trading of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Zimbabwe, registered or not.\nThe currency is neither defined as a security, commodity nor currency.\nThough somewhere the Securities and Exchange Act could help form the basis for future digital currencies regulation, should Securities Exchange Commission of Zimbabwe, which is mandated to regulate all securities, decides to do so.\nLooking at the stricter definition of a security, how it relates as any financial asset that can be bought, held or sold like shares, Bitcoin is in that sense a tradable security. And, therefore, subject to supervision by the SecZim, just like common stocks on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange.\nWhen the regulation eventually comes, it may not necessarily directly apply to investors, rather to the cryptocurrency exchanges that support the trading of digital currencies.\nBut the Reserve Bank has recently come down hard on crypto, directing commercial banks to stop dealing in, or with exchanges and people trading virtual money.\nThis is by far the biggest blow yet to the development of digital assets in the country.\nClearly, Zimbabwe’s financial laws had not anticipated a situation when trusted bank notes and other value storers like gold risked losing style to a currency that’s not even physical, only tangible to computers or smartphones – and one that is turning into a hit with those investors taken to risk.

Cash is gaining traction quicker than Venmo\nSquare Cash, the mobile payments app operated by San Francisco-based financial services company Square, has seen faster growth than their fiercest competitor, PayPal’s Venmo app, according to new analysis from Nomura’s Instinet. A report sent to Instinet clients from analyst Dan Dolev concludes that Square Cash is quickly catching up to Venmo’s install base, with nearly 28 million cumulative downloads of the Square Cash app, a mere $1 million behind Venmo, despite releasing 4 years later. Square Cash’s downloads have averaged a strong 128 percent year-over-year growth since 2016, with Venmo only managing 74% year-over-year growth comparatively. Dolev says that historically Venmo has received more downloads than Square Cash, but the gap peaked in July 2017 and has shifted in favor of Square Cash. While it’s been widely reported that Square only earned $200,000 from bitcoin transactions in Q1 2018 since its January launch, Dolev believes that offering bitcoin may have helped spark the app’s accelerated growth, comparing Square Cash app downloads to Coinbase’s app.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dolev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan dolev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venmo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "paypal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nomura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square cash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venmo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instinet", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "venmo square cash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dolev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco-based", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venmo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-17T02:12:30.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "56751768b252d752ca58e2184de00bac6acd8d02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme5o6Zk1uuCvWLZZxGix.hg-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=7.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Economics", "title": "bitcoin in developing countries", "title_full": "bitcoin in developing countries", "published": "2018-05-17T00:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.169, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "56751768b252d752ca58e2184de00bac6acd8d02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdme5o6Zk1uuCvWLZZxGix.hg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Saldom12", "published": "2018-05-17T00:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "bitcoin in developing countries", "text": "yes of course bitcoin is currently in a developing country, but I am sure bitcoin will continue to grow until the whole in the world will accept it.
