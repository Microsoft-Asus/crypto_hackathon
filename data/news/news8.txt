CCN has been unable to independently verify the news, as neither had published an announcement or responded to our request for comment by the time of writing.\nAccording to data from CoinDance, ViaBTC is the largest of the three mining operations — and the second largest bitcoin cash mining pool overall — with 12.7 percent of the BCH hashrate. Bitcoin.com — which is owned by former bitcoin evangelist Roger Ver — and CoinGeek add another 7.7 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively. The size of nChain’s mining operation was not immediately available. Bitcoin Cash Hashrate Distribution | Source: CoinDance\nIn any case, Miner’s Choice now has support from more than a quarter of the total bitcoin cash hashrate, indicating that significant changes could soon be coming to the BCH network — the long-term effects of which remain to be seen.\nAs CCN reported , the proposal aims to spur mass adoption of bitcoin cash by allowing users to make transactions as small as 1 satoshi (0. 1 BCH, roughly $0.00001) by removing the 546 satoshi “dust limit.” Additionally, it urges miners to process a set number of zero-fee transactions in every block.\nThe adoption of this proposal will inevitably increase spam in the BCH network — which is why the dust limit and mandatory fees were added to Bitcoin clients in the first place (and inherited by Bitcoin Cash) — but the plan’s backers believe it will also make bitcoin cash the cryptocurrency of choice for businesses seeking to implement microtransactions.\nAdditionally, proponents say that it will hasten the development of BCH-based tokens — called “ colored coins ” — which users will be able to send at almost no cost using 1 satoshi BCH transactions with zero fees.\nFinally, they say that by processing a wider range of transactions, miners will create a more competitive fee marketplace that will benefit the ecosystem as a whole.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://coingeek.com/bitcoin-com-viabtc-join-miners-choice-initiative-bitcoin-cash-miners/", "https://hacked.com/continue-reading"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roger ver", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T08:48:10.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b3051d2b30f01be5290ed5e45179b4beb59ddfe3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRrMTCDy6ddiue4RFGyU8ReJc_mVqS8wkGNWhnyFZlB_CiyxANuqMMlCgAG7zvVA9oRoW9CylL27Q--", "site_full": "www.acorndomains.co.uk", "site": "acorndomains.co.uk", "site_section": "https://www.acorndomains.co.uk/forums/mini-sites.101/", "site_categories": ["under_construction", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Mini Sites | Acorn Domains Forum - .UK Domain Name &amp;

Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Forex (or FX or off-exchange foreign currency futures and options) trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor.

Risks also include, but are not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price and/or liquidity of a currency. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices.

(NYSE American: DPW) (\" DPW \" or the \" Company \"), a diversified holding company, announced today that it has used Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency its subsidiary Super Crypto Mining, Inc., or SCM, has mined through its operations, to reduce the Company’s debt, marking a milestone for the Company and possibly the use of Bitcoin on a commercial basis. SCM actively mines the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, and, since late 2017 has held its inventory of Bitcoin as one of its long term operational and investment strategies. DPW incurred new debt recently to support the purchase of Enertec Systems 2001 Ltd. (\"Enertec\"), a 22-year-old private company, by another of its subsidiaries, Coolisys Technologies, Inc. Enertec is Israel’s largest private developer and manufacturer of specialized electronic systems for the aerospace and defense markets. Enertec generated over $8 million in annual revenue for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. DPW has made a payment of $500,000 towards this new debt today thus leveraging the mined Bitcoin through a non-dilutive transaction to shareholders. The Company believes this transaction is significant for both its shareholders as well as the cryptocurrency community worldwide.\n“We believe this transaction of reducing the debt incurred from the purchase of Enertec with the cryptocurrency we have mined validates Bitcoin’s value as a commodity and the use of cryptocurrencies as an alternative to fiat currency. DPW will expand its cryptocurrency mining operations as well as explore other paths to further advance the use of Bitcoin,” said Milton “Todd” Ault, III, the Company’s CEO and Chairman. Mr. Ault emphasized, “Having a lender provide capital for our acquisitions while our company is able to mine and use cryptocurrency to reduce debt that is used to purchase an asset, marks an important moment in the transactional use of Bitcoin for both the Company as well as the crypto community.”\nABOUT DPW HOLDINGS, INC.

CME’s bitcoin futures derive their final value from prices at four bitcoin exchanges: Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Kraken. Manipulative trading in those markets could skew the price of bitcoin futures that the government directly regulates.\nCME, which launched bitcoin futures in December, asked the four exchanges to share reams of trading data after its first contract settled in January, people familiar with the matter said. But several of the exchanges declined to comply, arguing the request was intrusive, the people said. The exchanges ultimately provided some data, but only after CME limited its request to a few hours of activity, instead of a full day, and restricted to a few market participants, the people added.\nThe dispute frustrated CME’s regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, these people said. In response, the commission subpoenaed the exchanges for the data. CFTC officials backed the launch of bitcoin futures, saying they viewed it as a risky but worthwhile project.\nThe CFTC was upset CME didn’t have in place agreements that would compel bitcoin markets to share trading data tied to futures contracts, these people said. Such agreements would detail what information the cryptocurrency venues would have to provide to CME, including the time of trades, unfilled or canceled orders, the size of orders, and traders’ identities.

The Tokyo-based startup has been running on a gateway known as Connectome, promising to design a “smart space” by means of seamlessly linking other units and applied sciences. The mission must pave the method for extra inventions. The Virtual Human Agent has been created as a part of the effort to increase Connectome. Couger stresses the significance of linking two applied sciences in specific – synthetic intelligence and blockchain, the dispensed ledger underpinning cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. AI learns by means of combing via large volumes of information, figuring out patterns and assessing new data. Couger needs to retailer the finding out information on a blockchain.

Bitcoin has previously indeed started rising after hitting the USD 7,000 mark, and Sluymer believes this to be the first step in price recovery.\n“Bitcoin is stuck in purgatory,” Melissa Lee of CNBC begins, while Bob Pisani of the New York Stock Exchange says that the current narrow range of around USD 600 is unusual for Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. Bitcoin futures trading volume fell since May, with Asian markets less intimidated than the US ones. The US Securities and Exchange Commission regulatory issues are also considered one of the constraints for cryptocurrency prices recently.\nGrowing numbers of trading desks for cryptocurrencies are also a surprising turn of events, as this may be the only area where those are rising. Guy Adami, an American trader, TV personality, and professional investor, considers this healthy, as it speaks of the marketplace maturing.\nSluymer, meanwhile, points out that the long-term trend is still technically up when considering the graph of price fluctuation since 2016. All lows were a series of high lows compared to the previous ones. In his opinion, Bitcoin is currently in the bottoming phase, and now it’s at the point where it’s challenging its downtrend, but that it needs to get through USD 7,800 to prove its trend reversal.\nAs previously reported , according to a popular crypto analyst, Willy Woo, the USD 8,000 support was bound to give up.

(NYSE American: DPW) (\" DPW \" or the \" Company \"), a diversified holding company, announced today that it has used Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency its subsidiary Super Crypto Mining, Inc., or SCM, has mined through its operations, to reduce the Company’s debt, marking a milestone for the Company and possibly the use of Bitcoin on a commercial basis. SCM actively mines the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, and, since late 2017 has held its inventory of Bitcoin as one of its long term operational and investment strategies. DPW incurred new debt recently to support the purchase of Enertec Systems 2001 Ltd. (\"Enertec\"), a 22-year-old private company, by another of its subsidiaries, Coolisys Technologies, Inc. Enertec is Israel’s largest private developer and manufacturer of specialized electronic systems for the aerospace and defense markets. Enertec generated over $8 million in annual revenue for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. DPW has made a payment of $500,000 towards this new debt today thus leveraging the mined Bitcoin through a non-dilutive transaction to shareholders. The Company believes this transaction is significant for both its shareholders as well as the cryptocurrency community worldwide.\n“We believe this transaction of reducing the debt incurred from the purchase of Enertec with the cryptocurrency we have mined validates Bitcoin’s value as a commodity and the use of cryptocurrencies as an alternative to fiat currency. DPW will expand its cryptocurrency mining operations as well as explore other paths to further advance the use of Bitcoin,” said Milton “Todd” Ault, III, the Company’s CEO and Chairman. Mr. Ault emphasized, “Having a lender provide capital for our acquisitions while our company is able to mine and use cryptocurrency to reduce debt that is used to purchase an asset, marks an important moment in the transactional use of Bitcoin for both the Company as well as the crypto community.”\nABOUT DPW HOLDINGS, INC.

Currently, the price per BCH is around $1,120 after dropping below the $1K range the week prior. Moreover, since the fork this past May the BCH-ecosystem has seen all types of application development and community projects launched with a new announcement nearly every day.\nAlso Read: IMF Says Bitcoin Could Create Less Demand for Regular Debt-based Fiat Money Today’s Bitcoin Cash Statistics\nIt’s been over 10 months since the August 1 fork and today the BCH chain is roughly 7201 blocks ahead of the Bitcoin Core (BTC) chain. Since then, the decentralized cryptocurrency ecosystem has performed two successful hard forks, one of which changed the currency’s difficulty algorithm, while the other fork added new OP_Codes, and raised the base block size to 32 MB. Over the past year, the BCH hashrate has grown exponentially and this week the hashrate is averaging close to 5 exahash per second between roughly 12 different mining pools. This Friday, June 8, the Bitcoin Cash chain is 1.5% more profitable to mine according to Coin Dance statistics. Further Coin Dance data details that it is 5.95x more expensive to transact on the BTC network today.\nMarket data shows that BCH is down 2 percent today but has gained 13 percent over the last seven days. The market has a lot more trade volume today than a few days prior with $516Mn BCH swapped over the past 24-hours. The top exchanges trading the most BCH liquidity include Okex, Binance, L Bank, EXX, and Huobi. Bitcoin Cash is the fourth highest market capitalization still but also holds the fourth highest trade volume for June 8, 2018. The strongest currency pair with BCH is BTC which captures 41 percent of trades. This is followed by tether (USDT 30.8%), USD (15.1%), KRW (7.9%), and ETH (1.3%). New Platform Announcements, the Miners Choice Initiative, and Development Funding\nOverall, the sentiment within the BCH community has been very positive, as there have been lots of announcements over the past couple of weeks. For instance, this past week 100+ coders met in China to develop BCH-based applications and organizers detail the event was a huge success. The Cryptonize.it team announced the launch of a new BCH-centric wallet called Cash Pay that allows anyone to purchase anything online. A few days later, the Cryptonize.it founder Ari explained to news.Bitcoin.com about how his team helped an anonymous developer create a new decentralized fundraising platform called Lighthouse.cash .\nEarlier this week, we reported on a “Miners Choice” initiative started by the mining pools operated by Nchain, and Coingeek which aims to remove the BCH dust limit if 546 satoshis, alongside allowing some free transactions per block. Nchain’s Dr. Craig Wright spoke with news.Bitcoin.com about the initiative and he encouraged other mining pools to join the cause. So far since we reported on the topic, the mining pools Bitcoin.com and Viabtc have pledged to support the initiative. In addition to this, the Bitcoin.com pool has started to donate a fraction of block rewards to BCH development and has donated funds to the Bitcoin ABC development team this week. Bitcoin Cash Community Energy Still at Full Throttle\nOther BCH announcements include the popular streaming gaming platform Twitch now allows BCH tips by utilizing the Streamlabs app tethered to their Coinbase accounts. An encrypted messaging service was launched this week that’s tethered to the BCH network called Keyport . Bitcoin Cash was featured in the UK’s popular financial magazine Moneyweek two days ago in an editorial detailing why investors should invest in BCH. Last but not least, the trading platform Boaexchange has added BCH as their base currency and default values. The Coinex exchange is another trading platform that also offers BCH trading pairs with other popular cryptocurrencies. The trading platform Boaexchange offers BCH pairs.\nOverall, the BCH community is optimistic about the future and pleased with the latest developments and announcements concerning the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem. One unique headline this week came from the Philippines, as there’s a decked out customized BCH Jeepney that drives between Philcoa in Quezon City and T.M. Kalaw in Manila every day. The BCH Jeepney project was initiated by 20 BCH community members who donated 0.5 BCH each, and the bus plans to accept bitcoin cash in the near future. The customized BCH Jeepney that drives throughout Manila.\nThere’s been a lot going on which has invoked a positive energy around the entire community, so far this fervor has been at full throttle.\nWhat do you think about the BCH market and infrastructure the past few weeks?

My worry is getting stronger and stronger because I could really fell that this is it.. This is a scam.

There is a major bearish trend line formed with current resistance at $0.2100 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data feed via Bittrex). The pair could decline further if sellers succeed in pushing the price below the $0.2000 handle.\nCardano price is at risk of a downside break against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. ADA/USD may perhaps break the $0.2000 level to initiate further declines. Cardano Price Analysis\nAfter a decent upside move, ADA price faced a strong resistance near the $0.2350 level against the US Dollar. The price formed a top around $0.2360 and started a downside correction. It declined and moved below the $0.2200 and $0.2100 support levels. It almost tested the $0.2000 handle a low was formed at $0.2020. Later, the price recovered, but upsides were capped by the $0.2200 resistance.\nMoreover, the 100 hourly simple moving average also prevented upsides above $0.2200. A fresh downside wave was initiated and the price declined below the $0.2100 level. There was also a break below the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $0.2030 low to $0.2220 high. If the price continues to move down, it could break the $0.2020 low and the $0.2000 support. The next support sits around the 1.236 Fib extension level of the last wave from the $0.2030 low to $0.2220 high at $0.1987. Below this, the price may perhaps trade towards the $0.1800 level.\nThe chart indicates that there is a major bearish trend line formed with current resistance at $0.2100 on the hourly timeframe of the ADA/USD pair. A break and close above the trend line and $0.2110 is needed to avoid further declines in the near term.\nHourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD has moved back in a bearish zone.\nHourly RSI – The RSI for ADA/USD is now well below the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $0.2000 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cardano", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cardano price analysis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ada", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bittrex", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T13:26:43.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a6cf610f1704356a94b8967741cccaa0f1c83dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSU6Cl2S3wnr3E01sor7XgXRF_WncbuXn6cBUIbkBZd2v8KWXUS1vtby4i.Zd2YSYlRTycyR7BbdYd.7mFZcxxM2q7Uhfcd73ynuuQBHhMcddx7iUDCQN2E", "site_full": "www.mcfloogle.com", "site": "mcfloogle.com", "site_section": "https://www.mcfloogle.com/feed", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Inside McFloogle's Mind", "title": "Bad libertarian marketing tactics in the bitcoin world", "title_full": "Bad libertarian marketing tactics in the bitcoin world", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.mcfloogle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/salesman_1.jpg?fit=1000%2C525&ssl=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3a6cf610f1704356a94b8967741cccaa0f1c83dd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSU6Cl2S3wnr3E01sor7XgXRF_WncbuXn6cBUIbkBZd2v8KWXUS1vtby4i.Zd2YSYlRTycyR7BbdYd.7mFZcxxM2q7Uhfcd73ynuuQBHhMcddx7iUDCQN2E", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rollo McFloogle", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bad libertarian marketing tactics in the bitcoin world", "text": "Bad libertarian marketing tactics in the bitcoin world By 0\nWhen I was in the process of buying my car about eight years ago, I went to a few different dealerships to compare different cars and prices. One salesman in particular sticks out in my memory. As we were outside looking at a car, he leans into my 22-year-old self and says, “I just sold a car just like this to a really cute girl your age.”\nI remember thinking to myself, “Unless you have her somewhere here for me to meet, what does that have to do with me deciding whether I’m going to buy this car?”\nThat salesman was using a typical marketing tactic. He wanted me to envision myself being able to meet pretty girls because I had this car. This is very often the theme of many (especially light) beer commercials: young, fit, attractive people are together having the time of their lives and you’ll be in that group if you buy and drink this beer.\nThere’s nothing necessarily wrong with that type of marketing and the car and beer markets are established well enough that a consumer has a pretty good idea of what he’s going to get when he makes a purchase.\nBut in the bitcoin and larger cryptocurrency movement, these tactics are not exactly exciting to witness especially when it comes to libertarian communities.\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are an interesting product. Their hopefully decentralized and trustless nature depends on the software and resulting network structure as a whole. You don’t purchase bitcoin like you purchase a beer. When you purchase a beer, its fate is up to you. In cryptocurrency, the consensus of the network determines the coin’s fate. To me, that makes it important to have some understanding of what the software does before you get involved if you’re interested in being an endorser for it.\nIf someone’s trying to sell you on a cryptocurrency or a service for a cryptocurrency, make sure they sell you on what it actually does. There has been a trend in the libertarian community to instead promote a project by suggesting that a main reason for supporting it is because either principled libertarians are the builders or are major supporters of it (or both). While it would be great that a project would fit well with libertarian ideals, the fact that certain libertarians may like some project is not the cause of why it will be successful. The code is what matters.\nIf I’m selling you my services as a plumber, do you really care if I’m a libertarian? Would you feel good about the transaction if I left your pipes leaky because a libertarian fitted them? While all else equal, it may be nice to support fellow libertarians, but if my selling points for my plumbing are about my libertarian qualities, you should question why I’m not focusing the attention on the plumbing.\nWhat’s worse is when libertarians appeal to economic arguments as opposed to how the project or product is supposed to work and benefit you. I’ve seen people responding to questions about security issues with “Well, it’s not in their economic interest to cause you any harm.” That may be true, but that doesn’t guarantee any outcomes. Just look at Mt. Gox or Bitconnect as two major examples of people losing a lot of money in the bitcoin world.\nDon’t be fooled: there have and will continue to be scams in the bitcoin world. There are plenty of incentives out there.\nBut my point is not to say that these people have nefarious intentions. They may have the best intentions, but being a principled libertarian does not predict how well you write code. This is especially important for projects that are custodial in nature.

Currently, the price per BCH is around $1,120 after dropping below the $1K range the week prior. Moreover, since the fork this past May the BCH-ecosystem has seen all types of application development and community projects launched with a new announcement nearly every day.\nAlso Read: IMF Says Bitcoin Could Create Less Demand for Regular Debt-based Fiat Money Today’s Bitcoin Cash Statistics\nIt’s been over 10 months since the August 1 fork and today the BCH chain is roughly 7201 blocks ahead of the Bitcoin Core (BTC) chain. Since then, the decentralized cryptocurrency ecosystem has performed two successful hard forks, one of which changed the currency’s difficulty algorithm, while the other fork added new OP_Codes, and raised the base block size to 32 MB. Over the past year, the BCH hashrate has grown exponentially and this week the hashrate is averaging close to 5 exahash per second between roughly 12 different mining pools. This Friday, June 8, the Bitcoin Cash chain is 1.5% more profitable to mine according to Coin Dance statistics. Further Coin Dance data details that it is 5.95x more expensive to transact on the BTC network today.\nMarket data shows that BCH is down 2 percent today but has gained 13 percent over the last seven days. The market has a lot more trade volume today than a few days prior with $516Mn BCH swapped over the past 24-hours. The top exchanges trading the most BCH liquidity include Okex, Binance, L Bank, EXX, and Huobi. Bitcoin Cash is the fourth highest market capitalization still but also holds the fourth highest trade volume for June 8, 2018. The strongest currency pair with BCH is BTC which captures 41 percent of trades. This is followed by tether (USDT 30.8%), USD (15.1%), KRW (7.9%), and ETH (1.3%). New Platform Announcements, the Miners Choice Initiative, and Development Funding\nOverall, the sentiment within the BCH community has been very positive, as there have been lots of announcements over the past couple of weeks. For instance, this past week 100+ coders met in China to develop BCH-based applications and organizers detail the event was a huge success. The Cryptonize.it team announced the launch of a new BCH-centric wallet called Cash Pay that allows anyone to purchase anything online. A few days later, the Cryptonize.it founder Ari explained to news.Bitcoin.com about how his team helped an anonymous developer create a new decentralized fundraising platform called Lighthouse.cash .\nEarlier this week, we reported on a “Miners Choice” initiative started by the mining pools operated by Nchain, and Coingeek which aims to remove the BCH dust limit if 546 satoshis, alongside allowing some free transactions per block. Nchain’s Dr. Craig Wright spoke with news.Bitcoin.com about the initiative and he encouraged other mining pools to join the cause. So far since we reported on the topic, the mining pools Bitcoin.com and Viabtc have pledged to support the initiative. In addition to this, the Bitcoin.com pool has started to donate a fraction of block rewards to BCH development and has donated the funds to the Bitcoin ABC development team this week. Bitcoin Cash Community Energy Still at Full Throttle\nOther BCH announcements include the popular streaming gaming platform Twitch now allows BCH tips by utilizing the Streamlabs app tethered to their Coinbase accounts. An encrypted messaging service was launched this week that’s tethered to the BCH network called Keyport . Bitcoin Cash was featured in the UK’s popular financial magazine Moneyweek two days ago in an editorial detailing why investors should invest in BCH. Last but not least, the trading platform Boaexchange has added BCH as their base currency and default values. The Coinex exchange is another trading platform that also offers BCH trading pairs with other popular cryptocurrencies. The trading platform Boaexchange offers BCH pairs.\nOverall, the BCH community is optimistic about the future and pleased with the latest developments and announcements concerning the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem. One unique headline this week came from the Philippines, as there’s a decked out customized BCH Jeepney that drives between Philcoa in Quezon City and T.M. Kalaw in Manila every day. The BCH Jeepney project was initiated by 20 BCH community members who donated 0.5 BCH each, and the bus plans to accept bitcoin cash in the near future. The customized BCH Jeepney that drives throughout Manila.\nThere’s been a lot going on which has invoked a positive energy around the entire community, so far this fervor has been at full throttle.\nWhat do you think about the BCH market and infrastructure the past few weeks?

While on the Old Continent, Microsoft has immersed a whole data center off the coast of Scotland. And in Japan, a startup uses artificial intelligence, augmented reality and blockchain technology to create a “virtual human agent.”\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: New Tech and a Quick Way to Make a Fortune in Crypto Bitpanda Lists IOTA and Komodo\nBitpanda , one of Europe’s established cryptocurrency exchanges, is adding two new coins – IOTA (MIOTA) and Komodo (KMD). The announcement comes after the successful launch of Bitpanda 2.0 and the team is promising new listings on a regular basis. Initially, both cryptocurrencies will be offered through a trade only, buy and sell option.\n“Our Integration Team has been working hard the past few months and we are now happy to announce that Komodo will be added on June 12, 2018 to the Bitpanda platform, and IOTA will follow on June 14, 2018. To speed things further up, we will offer new cryptocurrencies on a regular basis to our users,” Bitpanda said.\nThe trading platform noted that the integration of IOTA comes in response to popular demand within the Bitpanda community. The listing has been confirmed by the IOTA team, too. Bitpanda and the IOTA Foundation are working closely to set up an IOTA wallet on the exchange, which will be supporting withdrawal and send functions.\nKomodo, which is also among Bitpanda’s partners, will be one of the platforms for the Pantos meta token (PAN). The project aims to provide instant transfers between supported blockchains. The exchange plans to offer KMD wallet in the near future. Microsoft Experiments with an Underwater Data Center\nOne of Microsoft’s data centers is now operating at about 100 ft (~30 m) below the surface of the North Sea, not far from the British Orkney Islands . Project Natick is powered by renewable energy generated by wind, solar, and tidal installations which meet completely the energy needs of the archipelago situated close to the Scottish shore.\nThe data center is made up of 864 servers in a container that sits on the sea bottom about 14 miles (~22 km) from the coast. Its electricity is supplied through an undersea cable using the green energy produced on the islands. The data center is designed to fit into a standard shipping container and can be easily relocated. May be that’s an idea crypto miners should consider.\nNatick is a pilot project and Microsoft will operate the data center for a period of 12 months, Quartz reported. The company says bringing data centers close to hubs of computing power benefits customers by cutting down the back-and-forth between users and servers. The software giant points out that nearly half the world’s population lives within 120 miles (~150 km) of the ocean.\nAnother strong argument in favor of the project is the opportunity to bring cooling costs down, as deep sea waters maintain lower temperatures which help the cooling of the hardware. “It’s our belief that this type of data center could lead to reduced costs and simpler structures that incorporate fewer materials, requiring less maintenance and electricity,” a Microsoft representative commented.\nInitially, the servers will be put through a series of tests aimed at evaluating power consumption, humidity, noise creation, and temperature levels. On the second stage, customers will be allowed to use the data center. If the project is successful, Microsoft plans to keep operating the servers and continue to provide access to users.

The company is using artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR) and blockchain technology to realize the project. According to CEO Atsushi Ishii, this is the first tech combination of this kind.\nA video released by Cougar shows how the VHA can momentarily jump from one device to another, from a PC to a smartphone in this case, when asked to do so. “That’s a nice chair,” the female character also says, demonstrating her abilities to use AI-driven image recognition to assess the surroundings.\nCouger is a small business, with fewer than 15 employees, according to a report by the Nikkei Asian Review . Its team of engineers is involved in game consoles development. The company, however, has pans in many other fields, including robotics and the internet of things. Its management dreams of creating “a world where devices act autonomously,” an ambition which requires the confluence of multiple technologies.\nThe Tokyo-based startup has been working on a gateway called Connectome, promising to design a “smart space” by seamlessly linking different devices and technologies. The project should pave the way for more innovations. The Virtual Human Agent has been created as part of the effort to develop Connectome.\nCouger stresses the importance of linking two technologies in particular – artificial intelligence and blockchain, the distributed ledger underpinning cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. AI learns by combing through huge volumes of data, identifying patterns and assessing new information. Couger wants to store the learning records on a blockchain. Knowing what data has been used to teach the AI would allow developers to trust its judgments.\nWhat are your thoughts on the topics in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief?

According to cybersecurity firm Carbon Black, the illicit, dark web economy for cryptocurrency-related malware development and sales now represents a US$6.7 million economy.\nA research conducted by the firm found that an estimated 12,000 dark web marketplaces are selling approximately 34,000 offerings related to crypto theft. These malware offerings range widely in price, from as low as US$1.04, to as high as US$1,000 per offering.\n“It’s surprising just how easy it is without any tech skill to commit cybercrimes like ransomware,” Carbon Black Security strategist Rick McElroy told CNBC. “It’s not always these large nefarious groups, it’s in anybody’s hands.”\nCryptocurrency-stealer malware is the preferred method among crypto-targeting cybercriminals, the research found. These exploit a target’s endpoint and drains the targeted cryptocurrency wallet. Funds are quickly and covertly redirected to the criminal’s wallet, leaving the original owner with nothing.\nAnother popular method is covert-mining malware which uses a user’s Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to mine cryptocurrency on behalf of the cybercriminal. Similar to stealer malware offerings, mined cryptocurrencies are directed to the wallets of the malign actors.\nCarbon Black claims that cryptocurrency exchanges are the most vulnerable target for cybercriminals, representing 27% of all reported incidents. This is followed by cryptocurrency attacks targeting businesses with 21%, cryptocurrency attacks targeting users with 14%, then finally cryptocurrency attacks targeting government resources with 7%.\nAlthough Bitcoin is still the lead cryptocurrency for legitimate cyber transactions, cybercriminals are moving to alternative and more profitable currencies, such as Monero, which is used in 44% of all attacks.\nSecond on the list for popular cryptocurrencies among cybercriminals is Ethereum, which comes in at a little more than 11%. Rounding out the top three is Bitcoin, accounting for about 10%. The remaining targeted cryptocurrencies are NEM, Bitcoin Gold and Tether, among others.\n“Decentralized cryptocurrencies are likely to increase in sheer quantity and in value in the short-to-mid term … cybercriminals will attempt to exploit the ever-increasing attack surface,” the report says.\n“Unfortunately, new investors and traders looking to jump on the crypto bandwagon will exacerbate the opportunity for exploitation. We expect to see cryptocurrency theft and illicit mining activity expand in the mid-to-long term as security mechanisms and user awareness slowly catch up to the evolving threat.”\nAbout US$1.1 billion worth of cryptocurrencies was stolen in the first half of the 2018. The most notable heists so far this year include Japanese Coincheck’s US$350 million hack in January 2018 , Italian cryptocurrency exchange BitGrail’s US$170 million hack in February, and Vietnam’s US$660 million exit scam in April .

While on the Old Continent, Microsoft has immersed a whole data center off the coast of Scotland. And in Japan, a startup uses artificial intelligence, augmented reality and blockchain technology to create a “virtual human agent.”\nAlso read: Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: New Tech and a Quick Way to Make a Fortune in Crypto Bitpanda Lists IOTA and Komodo\nBitpanda, one of Europe’s established cryptocurrency exchanges, is adding two new coins – IOTA (MIOTA) and Komodo (KMD). The announcement comes after the successful launch of Bitpanda 2.0 and the team is promising new listings on a regular basis. Initially, both cryptocurrencies will be offered through a trade only, buy and sell option.\n“Our Integration Team has been working hard the past few months and we are now happy to announce that Komodo will be added on June 12, 2018 to the Bitpanda platform, and IOTA will follow on June 14, 2018. To speed things further up, we will offer new cryptocurrencies on a regular basis to our users,” Bitpanda said.\nThe trading platform noted that the integration of IOTA comes in response to popular demand within the Bitpanda community. The listing has been confirmed by the IOTA team, too. Bitpanda and the IOTA Foundation are working closely to set up an IOTA wallet on the exchange, which will be supporting withdrawal and send functions.\nKomodo, which is also among Bitpanda’s partners, will be one of the platforms for the Pantos meta token (PAN). The project aims to provide instant transfers between supported blockchains. The exchange plans to offer KMD wallet in the near future. Microsoft Experiments with an Underwater Data Center\nOne of Microsoft’s data centers is now operating at about 100 ft (~30 m) below the surface of the North Sea, not far from the British Orkney Islands. Project Natick is powered by renewable energy generated by wind, solar, and tidal installations which meet completely the energy needs of the archipelago situated close to the Scottish shore.\nThe data center is made up of 864 servers in a container that sits on the sea bottom about 14 miles (~22 km) from the coast. Its electricity is supplied through an undersea cable using the green energy produced on the islands. The data center is designed to fit into a standard shipping container and can be easily relocated. May be that’s an idea crypto miners should consider.\nNatick is a pilot project and Microsoft will operate the data center for a period of 12 months, Quartz reported. The company says bringing data centers close to hubs of computing power benefits customers by cutting down the back-and-forth between users and servers. The software giant points out that nearly half the world’s population lives within 120 miles (~150 km) of the ocean.\nAnother strong argument in favor of the project is the opportunity to bring cooling costs down, as deep sea waters maintain lower temperatures which help the cooling of the hardware. “It’s our belief that this type of data center could lead to reduced costs and simpler structures that incorporate fewer materials, requiring less maintenance and electricity,” a Microsoft representative commented.\nInitially, the servers will be put through a series of tests aimed at evaluating power consumption, humidity, noise creation, and temperature levels. On the second stage, customers will be allowed to use the data center. If the project is successful, Microsoft plans to keep operating the servers and continue to provide access to users. Tokyo Company Creates Virtual Human Using AI, AR and Blockchain\nA Japanese startup called Cougar is working on a project to create a “Virtual Human Agent” (VHA). The company is using artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR) and blockchain technology to realize the project. According to CEO Atsushi Ishii, this is the first tech combination of this kind.\nA video released by Cougar shows how the VHA can momentarily jump from one device to another, from a PC to a smartphone in this case, when asked to do so. “That’s a nice chair,” the female character also says, demonstrating her abilities to use AI-driven image recognition to assess the surroundings.\nCouger is a small business, with fewer than 15 employees, according to a report by the Nikkei Asian Review . Its team of engineers is involved in game consoles development. The company, however, has pans in many other fields, including robotics and the internet of things. Its management dreams of creating “a world where devices act autonomously,” an ambition which requires the confluence of multiple technologies.\nThe Tokyo-based startup has been working on a gateway called Connectome, promising to design a “smart space” by seamlessly linking different devices and technologies. The project should pave the way for more innovations. The Virtual Human Agent has been created as part of the effort to develop Connectome.\nCouger stresses the importance of linking two technologies in particular – artificial intelligence and blockchain, the distributed ledger underpinning cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. AI learns by combing through huge volumes of data, identifying patterns and assessing new information. Couger wants to store the learning records on a blockchain. Knowing what data has been used to teach the AI would allow developers to trust its judgments.\nWhat are your thoughts on the topics in today’s edition of Bitcoin in Brief?

He just needs to do their taxes.\nBenson is following the ’49er model -- as in 1849. Like industrious shopkeepers during the California Gold Rush , he’s offering the digital equivalent of picks and shovels. In his case, accounting services.\nThe world of digital currency is poised to draw billions of dollars from institutional investors if it can provide boring back-office services like custody banking and trading systems along with tax accounting. While the functions are essentially the same as in traditional businesses, crypto presents unique challenges.\n“Just to name one difference, the number of decimal places in a crypto asset can be up to 18-plus digits,” said Benson, whose Libra back-office firm caters exclusively to the crypto crowd. “That fact alone actually breaks a lot of accounting systems.”\nHundreds of firms like Benson’s are competing to sell the nuts and bolts of the burgeoning market. Startups financed by venture capital and token sales are fighting for advantage as the field begins to get crowded. Like the sellers of mining implements during the Gold Rush, they plan to profit whether or not Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies turn out to be digital treasure.\nTraditional Solutions\n“What really excites me is this whole picks-and-shovels approach,” said David Wills, chief operating officer of Caspian, a Hong Kong-based provider of crypto trading systems and related technologies for hedge funds. “As long as the asset class has a pulse, those companies will be the ones to succeed.”\nIf established firms such as State Street Inc. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. decide to do business with the virtual-currency world, it would lend credibility to the industry even if the firms aren’t that knowledgeable about crypto, said Morgan Hill, a partner at the $30 million Turing Funds in New York.\n“There are no off-the-shelf solutions from traditional finance,” Hill said. “Everything is still getting pieced together. The expertise in this space are people who got in early and have learned the pitfalls.”\nAt a trio of crypto conferences in New York last month, hundreds of companies clamored for one of two things, Hill said: investors in their initial coin offerings or customers for their back-office businesses.\nAlmost all the companies are startups, and most have yet to create what Hill calls an “MVP” -- a minimum viable product. A few, like Libra, Benson’s firm, have been around a few years and are adding clients and staff as demand surges. The trick is to get customers to stay, said Caspian’s Wills.\nCreatures of Habit\n“Human beings are creatures of habit,” Wills said. “Once a trading system is built into your operational workflow, it’s hard to remove it. In crypto, there are many different levels of workflow that need to be in place.”\nWills said Caspian is planning to sell a so-called utility token that can be used to pay trading fees. It will also be used to compensate developers of applications available through Caspian’s system.\nSince money managers are required to keep customer assets secure, a pressing need is a custodial bank. Custody banks such as BNY Mellon and State Street would fit the bill, but they haven’t committed to crypto.\nJob Opening\nThat leaves the job open for digital-money companies. Omega One, an agency brokerage for cryptocurrencies that’s opening an office in Bermuda, says it will work with insurers and the island’s government to set up a custody business there.\n“Bermuda has an incredibly strong legal, technical, reputational jurisdiction for financial services in general, but particularly for custody of assets and reinsurance,” said Alex Gordon-Brander, Omega One’s chief executive officer.\nToday’s crypto scene looks a lot like the birth of the dot-com boom in the mid-1990s, Gordon-Brander said.\n“Obviously, not everybody survives the cut,” he said. “But it’s clear that the revolution is happening and the leaders are emerging.”\n0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=You", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/you-dont-have-to-own-crypto-to-make-money-off-of-it/articleshow/64511089.cms&title=You"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rob", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jake benson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "libra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T17:34:09.231+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5404c6dc1642ab89658783a2576a295c2080c35c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSzT.pyQhw0LPGgagC4oKlhY-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin in a second.", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin in a second.", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5404c6dc1642ab89658783a2576a295c2080c35c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gSzT.pyQhw0LPGgagC4oKlhY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin in a second.", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nInvite your friends now to grow your network rapidly.

In Indonesia, there has been a lot of confusion regarding the future of Bitcoin and similar currencies. The Trade Ministry’s Futures Exchange Supervisory Board has finally rendered a verdict in this regard. Cryptocurrencies are commodities, regardless of what the country’s central bank may think. Indonesia Finally Recognizes Bitcoin\nMost countries around the world have seemingly no interest in legalizing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. That in itself is not surprising, as this new form of money may pose quite a few challenges. For one thing, it is a form of money most people have never seen or experienced before.\nIn Indonesia, there is finally a verdict on the legality of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. To be more specific, Bitcoin and similar currencies will now be labeled as commodities, which is a big step in the right direction. This news comes at a rather interesting time, though, as the Indonesian central bank has made it clear it does not want to recognize Bitcoin and similar currencies as a payment instrument.\nSeeing how the Trade Ministry’s Futures Exchange Supervisory Board directly contradicts the central bank, an interesting situation is created. For the time being, a decree has been signed to make cryptocurrency a commodity which can be traded at the bourse. If approved, it will give Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies legal status in the country, which will allow for new and innovative business models.\nIt is also expected that the Indonesian government will issue a new form of regulation to support cryptocurrencies and all associated services. There will be a strong focus on taxation, although it remains a bit unclear how that will play out exactly. Taxing cryptocurrency capital gains is always a bit controversial, but it will mainly depend on what percentage the government has in mind exactly. As long as the rate is competitive, no immediate issues should be expected.\nSome changes will be introduced to local cryptocurrency exchanges and trading platforms as well. The country’s biggest platforms will need to clarify a few things for the government and may need to introduce small changes to their underlying business models. No further specifics have been announced at this point, but further clarification is expected in the weeks to come.\nAll things considered, this is an extremely bullish signal for all cryptocurrencies. Experts feared the Indonesian government would ban all cryptocurrency activity, rather than attempt to regulate it in a somewhat positive manner. It seems things will turn out all right in the end, even though a lot of specifics have yet to be unveiled. Giving Bitcoin any legal status in Indonesia can only be considered a good thing at this stage.

Mysterious ‘Asian Whale’ Begins Funneling Bitcoins Back to Huobi\nA mysterious “Asian whale” accumulated more than 94,000 bitcoins during the first half of 2018, and now they have begun to move them back to one of the cryptocurrency exchanges from which they originated, sparking fears of a new selloff.\nBlockchain data shows that bitcoin address 1KAt6STtisWMMVo5XGdos9P7DBNNsFfjx7 accumulated more than 93,947 BTC — at one point worth more than $700 million — during a two-month period between March 25 and May 27.\nSince then, the wallet owner has reduced their balance by 8,000 BTC. The address sent 4,000 BTC directly to Huobi in two equally-sized transactions. They have sent another 4,000 BTC during that same timeframe, with the majority of those funds ending up at Huobi as well after being funneled through other addresses.\nEven after this reduction, the address still ranks as the sixth-richest in the bitcoin ecosystem, with a current value of approximately $650 million. Source: BitInfoCharts\nSo to whom does this address belong? The answer is not immediately clear.\nMost of the largest bitcoin addresses belong to cryptocurrency exchanges. Indeed, the five addresses holding more funds belong to Bitfinex, Binance, Bittrex, Huobi, and Bitstamp, respectively. Private keys to exchange-controlled addresses are generally stored in “ cold wallets ,” which are more secure since they are not connected to the internet and thus not at risk if a hacker breaches the exchange.\nMany of these addresses are also P2SH addresses, which begin with the leading symbol “3” and are often multisignature addresses, which require multiple keys to sign a payment before it can be sent.

There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,160 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might dip a few points, but the overall bias is positive above the $1,100 support level.\nBitcoin cash price remains in an uptrend above $1,100 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD has to move past $1,160 and $1,180 to gain upside momentum. Bitcoin Cash Price Resistance\nThere were mostly ranging moves above the $1,100 support area in bitcoin cash price against the US Dollar. The price traded towards the $1,170 level, but it failed to move further higher. A high was formed near $1,168 before the price started a downside correction. At the moment, it seems like there is a strong resistance area forming near $1,160, which may act as a pivot zone.\nA downward correction is underway, and the price recently broke the 23.6% fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,048 low to $1,168 high. However, the decline is finding bids near the $1,130 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Further below the 100 hourly SMA, there is a key support around the $1,100 level. Moreover, the 50% fib retracement level of the last wave from the $1,048 low to $1,168 high is also around the stated support. On the upside, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,160 on the hourly chart of the BCH/USD pair.\nLooking at the chart , the pair has to settle above the $1,160 resistance area to gain upside momentum. The next hurdles above $1,160 are seen near $1,180 and $1,200.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BCH/USD is slowly moving in the bearish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BCH/USD is currently just above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $1,100 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "ethereum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litecoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-06-08T09:49:55.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ff08ffef7fc5b0201c6c9c955649e3d39672acd9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS4RydMphwb.BRbaWnaQ1p64-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["paste"], "section_title": "", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "title_full": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ff08ffef7fc5b0201c6c9c955649e3d39672acd9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS4RydMphwb.BRbaWnaQ1p64-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EvyScrape", "published": "2018-06-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Earn Free Bitcoin", "text": "███████╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██╗████████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗███╗ ██╗\n██╔════╝██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝ ██╔══██╗██║╚══██╔══╝██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██║████╗ ██║\n█████╗ ██████╔╝█████╗ █████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██╔██╗ ██║\n██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██╔══╝ ██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║██║██║╚██╗██║\n██║ ██║ ██║███████╗███████╗ ██████╔╝██║ ██║ ╚██████╗╚██████╔╝██║██║ ╚████║\n╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚══════╝╚══════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nWe are going to pay you 15% of your friends earnings from our own mining capacities as soon as they will install CryptoTab by your personal link.Also, we are going to pay you 10% bonus from our own funds when your friends will lead their friends by their own links.Referral network includes payments for up to 10 levels of friends.

The culprits behind the attack demanded a $51,000 ransom in Bitcoin for each system that was locked and the city still needs another $9.5 million to complete its recovery.\nThis puts the local government of one of the most prosperous cities in the American South in a difficult situation. If it pays the ransom, it sends a message to hackers that their methods truly are effective and would encourage them to continue infecting government computers.\nThe thing is that refusing to pay the ransom might even be more expensive than simply paying it. There’s no ballpark figure, but the amount of data that a large local government like Atlanta keeps in its data centers could be worth more than the ransom the hackers want.\nIn this situation, there’s also the question of prevention. What could Atlanta do to make sure that its systems won’t fall victim to another attack of this magnitude?\n“I think that the true problem is not ransomware. The problem is unreliable, overcomplicated and insecure-by-design IT architecture. Segregation of duties, data and network access control, proper segmentation, daily backup, desktop hardening, anomaly detection are, de facto, a must-have in any modern company or governmental entity. Apparently, none were in place,” said Ilia Kolochenko, High-Tech Bridge’s CEO.\nThe silver lining in all of this is that hackers are beginning to shift to cryptocurrency mining malware, reaching higher potential earnings from individuals and companies than they would with ransomware.\nEven the most recent reports we are getting point to a migration from ransomware to “cryptomining malware” as an attack vehicle.\nAlthough this is true, however, there’s still reason to believe that some hackers will try their luck trying to demand ransom from governments as they’re the most vulnerable to this kind of attack. × Stay up to date with market trends and exclusive crypto news!

The new rules are a bit stricter and apply to cryptocurrency wallets, exchanges, and platforms that facilitate Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).\nAlso Read: Three Luxury Apartments Sold for 420 BTC in the Coastal Region of Montenegro Apple’s App Store Revises Cryptocurrency Rules\nThe Apple App Store is a popular application marketplace that provides over 783,000 gaming apps, and 2.3 million non-gaming apps. Just recently the App Store changed its guidelines concerning cryptocurrency applications that can be downloaded using the marketplace. The news follows the recent ‘ Developers Union ’ in which a large group of software developers pushed to get their free apps published and had succeeded in convincing Apple.\nThe new rules detail that cryptocurrency applications must adhere to the following description criteria which include wallets, ICOs, exchanges, and cloud mining platforms. Mining applications using an iPhone’s chipset to mine digital currencies are strictly prohibited and are only allowed if the software is performing the mining off the device (e.g. cloud-based mining).\n“Wallet Apps may facilitate virtual currency storage, provided they are offered by developers enrolled as an organization,” explains Apple’s revised rules. “Exchange Apps may facilitate transactions or transmissions of cryptocurrency on an approved exchange, provided they are offered by the exchange itself.”\nInitial Coin Offering Apps facilitating Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”), cryptocurrency futures trading, and other crypto-securities or quasi-securities trading must come from established banks, securities firms, futures commission merchants (“FCM”), or other approved financial institutions and must comply with all applicable law. Apple’s Long History of Being Strict Towards Cryptocurrency Apps\nLastly, the fifth revised rule may affect some applications that are already on the App Store currently. The guideline says it prohibits applications that offer currency for completing tasks.\n“Cryptocurrency apps may not offer currency for completing tasks, such as downloading other apps, encouraging other users to download, posting to social networks, etc.,” the last rule emphasizes.\nIt is well known that Apple’s App Store rules concerning cryptocurrencies are far stricter than other marketplaces like Google Play. Four years ago the company removed all Bitcoin-related applications, and two years ago it was quite firm towards altcoins when it asked companies to remove digital assets like dash off their apps.
