Failure to do so, the letter claimed, would result in a trademark infringement lawsuit.\n“I didn’t believe it at first since I knew that bitcoin and the bitcoin logo are public domain, and even a similar trademark application in the US failed,” the user wrote.\nHowever, as the business owner soon found out, a company called A.B.C. IPHoldings South West LLC successfully obtained a trademark for “Bitcoin” last month after initially submitting the application on Dec. 27, 2017.\nA.B.C. IPHoldings South West LLC is listed as a subsidiary of Monolip LTD, whose mailing address appears to be a rented mailbox at a London branch of Mail Boxes Etc.\nThe firm has only applied for one other trademark, “Westworld,” presumably due to its association with the HBO show of the same name. The application for this trademark has been published, but it has not yet been examined by the IP office.\nContact information for the company was not immediately available, so CCN was unable to reach them for comment. The user who claimed to have received the letter did not immediately reply to an inquiry about how they intended to respond.\nIt’s unclear whether the threat-sender (presumably A.B.C. IPHoldings South West or Monolip LTD) will carry out its threat, and whether the threat would hold up in court remains to be seen as well.\nIn any case, it’s surprising that a company was able to successfully trademark the term, particularly since the flagship cryptocurrency has more or less achieved mainstream recognition over the past several years.\nAs CCN reported , a Moscow-based company unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a Russian trademark for “Bitcoin” in 2016. Previously, the US Patent and Trademark Office rejected a California company’s attempt to obtain a “Bitcoin” trademark, though US firms can register longer trademarks that include the word.\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto news lab uk company acquires ‘bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "etsy store", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T10:44:01.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "387534d02edb21fadeac115e2fd1cae241d3fdca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54AXOpKkqWDE36KjES3WYBV9QyzwD00ILdMQqOIWGa9aWmY7eW7Th6iox0LiFk7q1YbvDhTZnlmWC5bUjkeXVxao-", "site_full": "bitcoinist.com", "site": "bitcoinist.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "John McAfee Says Bitcoin Will Surpass $15,000 in June - Bitcoinist.com", "title_full": "John McAfee Says Bitcoin Will Surpass $15,000 in June - Bitcoinist.com", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.224, "main_image": "http://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/flickr-john-mcafee-27920583266_4a88bca76f_k.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "387534d02edb21fadeac115e2fd1cae241d3fdca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpu2xhlqzh54AXOpKkqWDE36KjES3WYBV9QyzwD00ILdMQqOIWGa9aWmY7eW7Th6iox0LiFk7q1YbvDhTZnlmWC5bUjkeXVxao-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Osato Avan-Nomayo", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "John McAfee Says Bitcoin Will Surpass $15,000 in June - Bitcoinist.com", "text": "John McAfee Says Bitcoin Will Surpass $15,000 in June Osato Avan-Nomayo · May 25, 2018 · 3:00 pm · Views: 4,028 News teaser\nJohn McAfee is back again with another flurry of bold cryptocurrency predictions. In a tweet on May 24th, the tech activist and internet security expert listed five cryptos that will experience huge gains in the summer. The tweet also contained some political predictions on U.S. foreign relations. Bitcoin Will Rise in June and Dip in July\nAccording to McAfee, “Bitcoin will surpass $15,000 in June.” The controversial crypto proponent, however, predicts that the spike will be short-lived as he said the number one crypto would dip in July. My short term price predictions: in a major dip, with nearly everything dropping, the price of Docademic doubled since my prediction. The market will turn before June 12th and my predictions will hit. My algorithms predicted Trump's June 12th date. They have never been wrong. pic.twitter.com/IGAzWPtOV4\n— John McAfee (@officialmcafee) May 24, 2018\nBitcoin wasn’t the only digital currency whose price McAfee predicted. He also said that both Docademic (MTC) and Bezop (BEZ) would reach new highs by the middle of July. McAfee said that MTC, the healthcare platform token recently listed on a few exchanges like HitBTC, would climb to $0.73 in July. Docademic is currently trading at $0.13 .\nAs for BEZ, McAfee predicts that the e-commerce token will reach $0.52 in July, which represents a 300 percent increase from its present pric e of $0.13. Other short-term price tips provided by the ubiquitous crypto loudmouth include Bitcoin Private (BTCP) surpassing $200 before August and EOS rising to $32 by the end of July. McAfee also tipped GNT to rise above the $5 mark before the end of July.\nEOS is currently trading at just under $12. According to a recent Weiss rating report, it is one of the top altcoins on the market. Tom Lee of Fundstrat recently revealed that EOS was the highest rated currency on the misery index. If these predictions are accurate, then EOS will spike by more than 200 percent while GNT and BTCP will surge by 900 percent and 700 percent, respectively, within the next two months. McAfee: A History of Bold Crypto Declarations\nJohn McAfee is no stranger to cryptocurrency predictions. He once famously declared that Bitcoin will be worth $500,000 in 2020, a position that he still defends. Earlier in the week, he tweeted about an impending crypto bull rally , urging traders to pay attention to events in the news and “use their heads.”\nThere have been some notable developments in the crypto market so far in May. Both cryptocurrency startups like Coinbase and mainstream finance behemoths like Goldman Sachs have launched products targeted at institutional investors. Some experts agree that the influx of mainstream investors into the market will be the catalyst for a crypto bull rally.\nDo you think McAfee’s predictions are accurate? Will you be making any significant crypto investments based on these predictions?

'Scent or Payment Method'\nDeodorant maker Schmidt's Naturals is the latest company to let online shoppers buy its products with Bitcoin. Co-founder and CEO Michael Cammarata claims Bitcoin has accounted for 5 to 10 percent of online sales since they started accepting the cryptocurrency on May 14.\n\"It's starting to be a percent of sales more than we expected,\" he said in an interview with Cheddar .\nThe all-natural deodorant comes in scents like lavender, tea tree, bergamot, and cedar and will set you back about $9, or 0.0011 BTC, a stick. Schmidt's is the first company owned by hygiene giant Unilever to accept cryptocurrency as a payment method.\nCammarata said:\nIt kind of was actually a last minute surprise. We got a lot of consumers that are like, 'Can we pay with Bitcoin'? We were playing around with the idea a little bit and our tech team was like, 'Should we do this should not do it?'\nBut he admitted they \"weren't that shocked\" when the company's social media savvy consumers asked to pay with Bitcoin.\n\"We have a lot of millennials and highly socially active consumers,\" he said. Shopping with Bitcoin\nYou can make purchases on Schmidt's Natural's site using Bitpay, a widely available Bitcoin payments provider found on Shopify and in popular mobile games by Zynga. When it comes to e-commerce and online shopping, Bitpay is the most ubiquitous.\nBut the service has had its fair share of controversy. Newegg is a Canada-based online computer and electronics seller that uses Bitpay. The payment provider came under fire last month when a Newegg shopper accused Bitpay of taking more than their share when it comes to network costs.\nRegardless, Bitcoin is becoming more widespread as a way to shop online. And as Schmidt's Naturals co-founder said, it will take consumers demanding more payment options to see it more commonly accepted.\n\"Whether it be a scent or a payment method, we are very highly engaged with our consumer,\" Cammarata said.\nWhat do you think about paying for goods like deodorant with Bitcoin?

He still fully expects that the Bitcoin price will reach $25,000 by the end of the year. Crypto Market Unexpectedly Slips, Falls By Over 7%\nTom Lee, known as a “chronic” bull in the cryptocurrency community, reiterated his belief that Bitcoin will hit $25,000 by the end of the year. He has long been the face of the industry as he regularly appears on CNBC segments regarding this growing market, showing up on a weekly basis.\nHis recent announcement during the CNBC Futures Now segment came after a 1% decrease in the price of Bitcoin.\nHowever, not even 24 hours after Tom’s Futures Now appearance, Bitcoin dropped by over five percent to under $7,600. This negative price action has wiped out the majority of price gains seen pre-Consensus.\nHowever, Bitcoin did not fall as much as altcoins and actually gained market dominance, moving from 37% to 38%.\nThis has been a common theme as altcoin investors tend to jump ship when waters turn murky for the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, the most established cryptocurrency, has further proven itself to be a store of value and a so-called “shelter in the storm” in this emerging market. Battered but Positive, Tom Lee Stands by Price Prediction\nWhile Lee was quick to call this surprising drop “typical crypto volatility” in an email sent to CNBC, during his appearance on Futures Now , he recognized three aspects which have assured his bullish price predictions.\nThe first aspect that he mentioned was the cost of the creation of Bitcoin, or in more simple terms, mining. He highlighted the fact that the electricity, equipment, and other assorted costs of mining a Bitcoin is approximately $8,000.\nHowever, after yesterday’s drop, he noted that the cost of mining a Bitcoin had dropped to $6,000. Taking into account that the current price of Bitcoin versus the newly lowered cost of mining one, many still see Bitcoin as an undervalued asset.\nHe also noted that he expects an even higher level of institutional involvement to arrive later this year, saying:\nI think institutional investors have gained a lot of interest, and they haven’t really come into crypto yet because there is still some regulatory uncertainty.\nDespite the regulatory uncertainty, Lee still expressed his positive attitude, stating:\nBut that sort of ultimate allocation into crypto as an asset class is going to be a powerful reason why Bitcoin rallies.\nWhen looking at market statistics, it is clear to see why he still holds positive sentiment despite the over 60% price decrease in Bitcoin since its December highs. In the past 5 months, venture capitalist firms have poured over $1.3 billion dollars into cryptocurrency startups.\nTake the example of the heavily publicized announcement of Goldman Sachs’ entry into the cryptocurrency industry. The announcement made earlier this year saw the Sachs-backed Circle purchase the Poloniex crypto exchange, with the end result of Circle reaching a valuation of $3 billion.\nOn the surface, a three billion dollar company in a $350 billion industry may seem irrelevant. However, this is just one of the major examples which show that institutional investors and companies are willing to get invested in this industry.\nIf Tom Lee’s expectations become reality, there will be a countless number of investments made in this industry.\nFinally, to put a cherry on the Bitcoin’s metaphorical top, Tom recognized statistics put together by his market analysis firm, Fundstrat, stating:\nHistorically, 10 days comprise all the performance in any single year of Bitcoin’s price.\nIf history is any indication, that means a run for Bitcoin will happen fast, possibly skyrocketing within a matter of a few days or weeks.\nTom Lee put it best saying:\nSo as miserable as it feels holding Bitcoin at $8,000, the move from $8,000 to $25,000 will happen in a handful of days.\nWhat do you think of Tom Lee’s expectations and analysis? Do you think he is too hopeful, has just the right amount, or is he actually underestimating the price of cryptocurrencies in the future? We would love to hear what you are thinking, so please let us know in the comments below.\nImages Courtesy of Shutterstock and Bitcoinist archives.

BTC fell below $8,000 on May 22 for the first time since April 18 and hit a low of $7,272 yesterday, as per CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).\nMeanwhile, other major names like ethereum (ETH) and bitcoin cash (BCH) are reporting 14 percent weekly declines in price. EOS (EOS), meanwhile, is down 6 percent and Ripple has shed 8.5 percent over the same period.\nAt press time, all the top-25 cryptocurrencies are reporting weekly losses, except TRON (TRX), which is reporting minor gains, possibly on the back of positive news flow.\nThe cryptocurrency markets could remain on the defensive next week too, as the odds are stacked in favor of a drop in bitcoin prices to below $7,000.\nFurther, the ethereum-bitcoin exchange rate (ETH/BTC) has rolled over in favor of the bears, having breached a key ascending trendline earlier this month. The ETH/BTC pair is widely considered an advance indicator for alternative cryptocurrencies, as many of them are built based on the ethereum blockchain. So, alternative cryptocurrencies may remain drop sharply if BTC extends the decline.\nLooking more widely, the combined market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies dropped to $322.5 billion on May 24 – the lowest level since April 16, according to CoinMarketCap . At time of writing, the total market value stands at $336 billion – down 14 percent week-on-week.

Yesterday, it was stated that the end of price decline could be determined by the use of a bearish trend line. However, price of the asset is currently trading at $120.10.\nToday, from the weekly chart, Litecoin actually fell to $116 but the price made a pullback above the $120 price level. A bearish trend line has been drawn across the cryptocurrency’s chart to determine the bearish trend. Litecoin is now ranging above the $120 level against the bearish movement. The asset has broken the bearish trend line and the candlestick closed on the opposite side of the trend line.\nWith this development, it is assumed that the bearish trend is over. Traders can initiate long positions above the $120 price level. Also, a stop loss should be placed below the price at $115. LTCUSD Short-term Trend: Ranging\nOn the daily chart, Litecoin is in a bullish movement. The asset fell from $120 to a low of $116. At a price of $116, the asset made a bullish movement to $122.

While the price falls have been small over the last two days (about $100 each), bitcoin remains on shaky ground, and the bears have not yet given up the reins.\nAnalyst John Navin from Forbes says that for bitcoin to really enter an “uptrend,” it would have to strike the $18,500 mark. At press time, the currency cannot be labeled as a spiking coin, particularly because its December range was so high ($19,000+), so either way one looks at it, bitcoin will always be in a slump unless it surpasses that level.\nHe further states that the next support position for bitcoin is $6,500, which is where it stood during early April. This suggests that bitcoin has the potential to fall even further before it incurs future spikes.\nMichael Sonnenshein is the managing director of Grayscale Investments, as well as one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency asset managers and a sponsor of eight digital currency trusts for investors. He believes there’s no middle ground for bitcoin, and that people will either go big or go broke with it. There’s no in-between to be had, here…\n“As we begin to look at assets like bitcoin and the unbelievable adversity it has faced over the last ten years, every day that bitcoin doesn’t go away, every day that bitcoin overcomes a new challenge – for me, that makes me feel that bitcoin will do either one of two things,” he comments. “It will either survive and become all these amazing things that we think it can be, which will cause its price to be a lot higher, or it is possible something else may come along that will displace it, and bitcoin will go to zero. It likely will have a binary outcome.”\nWhile he refuses to offer any predictions regarding future prices, he did mention that if developers can continue to make advancements and changes to its technology, thus making it more desired and useful in the financial space, its value will continue to rise. If developers fail, bitcoin could sink into oblivion faster than one might anticipate.\n“You have to think about bitcoin, again, as an open source protocol,” he explains. “Any other currency that comes along that allows for another feature – another attribute that maybe bitcoin does not have – as an open source protocol, [bitcoin] is able to accommodate, to integrate, to add that aspect, into it. I hope and continue to believe that as new features are added into bitcoin and other digital currencies, they can continue to thrive and grow and not be displaced.”\nThis, to a degree, is something we can still look forward to. Institutional capital is starting to make its way into the bitcoin and cryptocurrency space, and players from Wall Street and other financial hubs are now making their marks on digital currencies. We are witnessing solid, albeit slow, pushes towards mainstream acceptance, which could potentially lead to further technological adaptions. Granted we continue to see trends like this expand, bitcoin could potentially hold its ground in the immediate future.

FILE PHOTO: Representation of the Bitcoin virtual currency standing on the PC motherboard is seen in this illustration picture, February 3, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\nThe fraud investigation involves a company named BTC Global, which told clients they would earn 2 percent per day, 14 percent a week and 50 percent in a month, the police said.\nA search for the company on the internet showed its services had been suspended.\nThe website lists Steven Twain as the “primary trader”. A request for comment by Reuters sent to an email address listed on the website as belonging to Twain received no response.\n“Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by agents of BTC Global,” the police said in a statement.\n“Some of the investors got paid in terms of the agreement. However, the payments suddenly stopped.”\nLocal technology news website mybroadband.co.za had reported in March that more than $50 million was lost by investors in BTC Global.\n“This may prove to be the tip of the iceberg with potentially thousands more yet to discover they’ve lost money,” police investigator Yolisa Matakata said.\nThe investigation follows a case this week where kidnappers demanded a ransom in bitcoin of nearly $120,000 to release a South African teenage boy.\nOn Thursday South Africa’s central bank said it was in the process of determining whether cryptocurrencies complied with its financial surveillance and exchange control regulations.

The Reserve Bank of South Africa has decided rather to label them as “Cyber Tokens.”\nThe reason for this categorization is because the bank does not believe that digital currencies meet the requirements of traditional currencies and thus should not be labeled as such. Not classified as money\nReserve Bank deputy Governor Francois Groepe explained that the Reserve Bank, essentially the Central Bank, has scrutinized Bitcoin and seen it fall flat on a few requirements.\n“We don’t use the term ‘cryptocurrency’ because it doesn’t meet the requirements of money in the economic sense of the stable means of exchange, a unit of measure and a stable unit of value,” Groepe said . “We prefer to use the word ‘cyber-token.’”\nThis does not necessarily mean that the Reserve Bank is cracking down or trying to make the cryptocurrency ecosystem in South Africa more difficult, but it does point towards where the regulators in South Africa are heading in terms of regulation. Understanding the space\nThe South African government has in the past set up Sandboxes and other structures in which cryptocurrencies can operate freely in order to determine their use and effect.\nBitcoin and Ethereum are becoming increasingly popular in the African country and globally, with regulators in struggling to move fast enough to manage them.\nThe Reserve Bank has established a financial technology unit to review its position on private cryptocurrencies and to help draw up an appropriate policy framework and regulatory regime.\n“We want to ensure or establish whether there is still compliance with the relevant financial surveillance or exchange-control regulations,” Groepe added .

Whereas most of the illegal activity takes place online, that is not always the case. In South Africa, a kidnapping of a 12-year-old child is making headlines. This is mainly because the kidnappers have demanded a 15 Bitcoin ransom prior to releasing the child. Another Bitcoin-related Kidnapping\nIn the world of criminal activity, covering one’s tracks is not all that easy. This is especially true when dealing with payment methods which are far too easy to trace these days. For criminals, this means that using traditional payment methods is pretty much out of the question. That is why Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are so appealing these days, as they seemingly provide a more anonymous option.\nIn South Africa, a very worrisome trend has begun to emerge over the past few years. It seems there has been a major increase in kidnappings involving a Bitcoin ransom. Given the perceived anonymity of Bitcoin, criminals consider this payment method far more appealing than other solutions. Even so, it doesn’t mean they will be successful in their attempts to obtain the world’s leading cryptocurrency.\nAn ongoing kidnapping in South Africa is making headlines right now. Three individuals have been taken into custody for their alleged involvement in the kidnapping of a twelve-year-old child. This abduction took place several days ago, yet the matter has not been resolved as of yet. It is unclear if these three individuals have any connection to the kidnapping or are innocent bystanders at this point.\nSo far, no official arrests have been made, and no charges have been filed, according to local sources. Additionally, the kidnappers have not been in contact with the child’s parent ever since making the 15 Bitcoin ransom demand. According to the kidnappers, failure to comply with their request will result in the child being hung and decapitated.\nNo further instructions regarding the Bitcoin ransom have been provided at this point. While the parents received this ransom note personally, it remains unclear if they will buy the cryptocurrency amount required to satisfy the kidnappers’ needs. Even so, paying 15 BTC is not a guarantee that the kidnappers will release the child.\nAll of this shows that criminals continue to favor cryptocurrency, even though it won’t serve their purposes whatsoever. That’s because various blockchain analysis firms keep close tabs on the Bitcoin network to monitor suspicious transactions. As such, they can identify senders and recipients of money. Bitcoin is not an anonymous payment method by any means, yet stories like these continue to give the world’s leading cryptocurrency a bad name.\nFull article at themerkle.com/south-african-kidnappers-demand-a-15-bitcoin-ransom/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T09:08:28.021+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a1b290e67685336b0f2242f25de9a780b44cef3f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQP1BbhB3rSExt2l7rX.o2drSOOxaRXDavlvjioNju9pymt7bCIceCN3uCiRsjnsJDZXMLwxEva_kWWTzL6_qAQTvIa8o28erq.9WuAHt5SP7x.gZtLy8Y2wRpbpqQOikMESuzUg_5a6T5lonmEBEx.", "site_full": "bitcoin-notes.com", "site": "bitcoin-notes.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Ethereum Classic 51% Attack Would Cost Just $55 Mln, Result in $1 Bln Profit: Research – Bitcoin Notes", "title_full": "Ethereum Classic 51% Attack Would Cost Just $55 Mln, Result in $1 Bln Profit: Research – Bitcoin Notes", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.311, "main_image": "https://bitcoin-notes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/528_Ly9jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8wMzRhZWZjYmVhMmFmOTkzMmIwMmRhMTU0NmY0NTMyNS5qcGc3D.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a1b290e67685336b0f2242f25de9a780b44cef3f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQP1BbhB3rSExt2l7rX.o2drSOOxaRXDavlvjioNju9pymt7bCIceCN3uCiRsjnsJDZXMLwxEva_kWWTzL6_qAQTvIa8o28erq.9WuAHt5SP7x.gZtLy8Y2wRpbpqQOikMESuzUg_5a6T5lonmEBEx.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ethereum Classic 51% Attack Would Cost Just $55 Mln, Result in $1 Bln Profit: Research – Bitcoin Notes", "text": "\nBitcoin Notes © 2018.

Bitcoin recently broke down past $8000 and is struggling to find support around $7800, the same level where Bitcoin broke out in early April in an attempt to break above $10000. The overall market capitalization is also in a steady decline breaking $400 billion from its all-time highs of over $830 billion.\nThe market capitalization has been nearly cut in half resulting in major price declines in Bitcoin and nearly every Altcoin on the market. Aside from the declines in price action and market capitalization, there is one area where we are seeing growth and that is in hash rate . This may lead us to believe that miners know something we don’t.\nLooking at the chart on Blockchain.info, we see a very steady increase in hash rate during the months leading up to and after the market sell-off. Looking at a chart of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization and hash rate side by side will show a clear divergence. Why is it that hash rate is increasing while prices are still in a continuing decline?\nIt is a fact that as more miners join the network, the higher the network hash rate is. This tells us that even though Bitcoin prices are falling at a steady pace, miners are still very much interested in mining Bitcoin. Bitcoin has rate is increasing while the price is dropping\nFrom the data presented we can draw the conclusion that the overall outlook on Bitcoin is bullish, at least in the eyes of the miners. After all, miners would not want to allocate their resources mining a digital asset they believe to be worthless. Miners are in the business to make money and perhaps the downturn in this market will allow them to accumulate more bitcoin at lower prices in preparation for the next Bull Run.\nMany traders focus only on the technical outlook and can overlook solid fundamentals and clues such as an increasing hash rate. If the hash rate were to be falling in congruence with price, then there would be cause for concern. That would tell us that miners are less interested in mining Bitcoin and could be turning their focus to mining other cryptocurrencies or not mining at all. It seems to me that miners are taking a longer-term view on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, ignoring short-term downtrends in the market. This fact alone should give investors confidence that there is still a lot of interest in Bitcoin and in mining specifically. Network support is very strong and should continue to grow.\nMiners are arguably the most important asset to the Bitcoin ecosystem because they work to create new blocks as well as verify all transactions to ensure the network is secure. A strong group of miners who are willing to support the network creates the image that Bitcoin is very strong and well positioned going forward. As we move closer to the end of Q2 and into Q3 fundamentals will continue to improve and my bet is that price action will surely catch up to the strong fundamentals. Without a strong group of miners to support the network, Bitcoin would surely be headed for a grim future. That is not the case judging by the data. Miners are still bullish long term as are we.\nHere at Dollar Destruction, we endeavour to bring to you the latest, most important news from around the globe.

U.S. DoJ Building . Source: gCaptain According to authorities, fraud is possible due to a variety of reasons, including nascency of the market (which makes it easier to influence), lack of action on the exchanges' behalf, and a lack of regulations.\nThe authorities note that despite these factors, the digital asset market remains lucrative as ever, and continues to attract institutional players such as banks and hedge funds, industry figures, celebrities, and even Wall Street loyalists. Bloomberg's Sources Echo Bitfinex'ed's Warnings\nThe DoJ is explicitly looking into wash trading and market spoofing , types of fraudulent market activities which authorities took decades to eradicate from the futures and equities markets.\nThe risky 'wash trading' involves a person buying and selling assets to himself in a short time period, to effectively create an illusion of heightened market activity, attracting unsuspecting traders to dive in.\nIn contrast to this, spoofing is a relatively simple method and involves a trader to simply place a large buy/sell order of assets, and cancel the order once price moves closer to the desired direction.\nAccording to Bloomberg' s sources, the DoJ is investigating the very same practices that cryptocurrency blogger and commentator Bitfinex'ed /BitCrypto'ed documented and scrutinized in 2017. Effortless Manipulation\nUndoubtedly, the limited regulatory scope makes the market a hotbed of fraud and scams, with several Initial Coin Offerings making away with millions of dollars in investors' funds in 2018 alone.\nEchoing the thought is John Griffin, a University of Texas finance professor, who has studied manipulation in cryptoasset markets:\n\"There's very little monitoring of manipulative trading, spoofing and wash trading. It would be easy to spoof this market.\"\nThe regulatory crackdowns are being felt by several cryptocurrency exchanges, who have in some cases, requested authorities to regulate them.\nTo this effect, digital asset exchanges Gemini and Coinbase have cautiously treaded the cryptocurrency sector, placing a high emphasis on regulatory and internal fraud control. Additionally, these exchanges selectively list coins, usually after an elaborate vetting process.\nThe Winklevoss brothers-owned Gemini partnered with Nasdaq Inc. in April 2018 to conduct surveillance of digital coins trading on their exchange, and have publically appealed for their counterparts to set up a self-regulating body.\nBitcoin is currently trading near $7,577 at the time of writing on the Bitstamp exchange, up one percent on May 24's open. The digital currency hit a 42-day low of $7,267.24 on May 24.

London police seize bitcoin worth $667,000 from hacker By The Associated Press LONDON  May 25, 2018, 9:28 AM ET 0 Shares Email London police have seized half a million pounds ($667,000) worth of bitcoin from a prolific computer hacker in a case described as the first of its kind for the 188-year-old department. Cybercrime detectives seized the bitcoin from Grant West, 26, who was sentenced to 10 years and 8 months in prison Friday for attacking some 100 companies worldwide, largely using 'phishing' email scams to obtain the financial data. Once he obtained the data, West would then sell the material to market places on the dark web and convert his profits into bitcoin. The London Metropolitan police discovered evidence of cyberattacks on 17 major firms including Sainsbury's, Asda, the British Cardiovascular Society and the Finnish bitcoin exchange. Officers also recovered a memory card containing approximately 78 million individual usernames and passwords. 0 Shares", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://s.abcnews.com/assets/js/min/merlin-news.min.js?v=3.63", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/email/offer?url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/london-police-seize-bitcoin-worth-667000-hacker-55434025?cid=share_addthis_widget&title=London+police+seize+bitcoin+worth+%24667%2C000+from+hacker", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fabcnews.go.com%2FTechnology%2FwireStory%2Flondon-police-seize-bitcoin-worth-667000-hacker-55434025%3Fcid%3Dshare_facebook_widget", "https://abcnewsplayer-a.akamaihd.net/player/2.88.8/amp.premier/amp.premier.min.js?v=2", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/beta/js/custom/pages/trident_story.js?v=280", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/beta/js/abcn.js?v=280", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=London+police+seize+bitcoin+worth+%24667%2C000+from+hacker+-+ABC+News+-+https%3A%2F%2Fabcn.ws%2F2IOt8ty&via=ABC", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/js/s_code_15.js?v=5"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "grant west", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "asda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sainsbury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "british cardiovascular society", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london metropolitan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:51:57.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "87837bcc2d0ec4f4cc2233f8b147d9c95f089e4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSwO8CZSl7pv_VM.ppS9NkGNr6k1NJMtrWD3RarKIGOKmnlhb7c0Xb8XS7W_iLsgQ_BkhaWCqsFoqme9kULpJlfkRHW_8QSKT_tHeVYr8FiluJpSXjLkQ2a", "site_full": "everythingbtc.com", "site": "everythingbtc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "CryptoKitties Charity Auction Raises $15K for Children's Hospital - Everything Bitcoin", "title_full": "CryptoKitties Charity Auction Raises $15K for Children's Hospital - Everything Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.004, "main_image": "https://everythingbtc.com/wp-content/plugins/rss-post-importer/app/classes/front/app/assets/img/03-04-feedsapi-api.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "87837bcc2d0ec4f4cc2233f8b147d9c95f089e4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSwO8CZSl7pv_VM.ppS9NkGNr6k1NJMtrWD3RarKIGOKmnlhb7c0Xb8XS7W_iLsgQ_BkhaWCqsFoqme9kULpJlfkRHW_8QSKT_tHeVYr8FiluJpSXjLkQ2a", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "CryptoKitties Charity Auction Raises $15K for Children's Hospital - Everything Bitcoin", "text": "Notify me of follow-up comments by email.

The BTC/USD pair is currently attempting a close above a crucial bearish trend line with resistance at $7,650 on the hourly chart (data feed from Kraken). A successful close above the trend line and $7,700 may perhaps open the doors for more gains.\nBitcoin price is showing positive signs above $7,400 against the US Dollar. BTC/USD must break the $7,650 and $7,700 resistance levels to recover further. Bitcoin Price Analysis\nThere were further bearish moves below $7,500 in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair traded close to the $7,200 support level before buyers appeared. A low was formed at $7,258 from where the price started an upside correction. Buyers succeeded in pushing the price back above the $7,400 resistance, which is a positive sign.\nDuring the recent upside move, the price also crawled above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $8,593 high to $7,258 low. More important, there was a break above a key connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $7,600 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. However, the pair is currently struggling to move above another bearish trend line with resistance near $7,650 on the same chart. A close above $7,650 and $7,700 is required for buyers to gain control. The next major hurdle is near $8,000 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $8,593 high to $7,258 low.\nLooking at the chart , the price is forming a bullish pattern, but it won’t be easy the bulls to clear the $7,700 resistance. Should they fail to move the price above $7,700, BTC/USD could drop back towards the $7,300 and $7,200 in the near term.\nLooking at the technical indicators:\nHourly MACD – The MACD for BTC/USD is back in the bullish zone.\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI is now well above the 50 level.\nMajor Support Level – $7,200 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T16:36:12.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "58af6fb4e25ce3b34362fbfb5d384ae25620e211", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQP1BbhB3rSE0GRLXsdxom2jjW1k1KrOjOZDFREeaw4P7IxbQrq1k76tuQ6eLrQDl3aJZhIiI9aTQC2VlWVcRAkitXOvxRrn_qjIH_kSOgM8GeK.8FPvV6u", "site_full": "bitcoin-infochain.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Bitcoin Infochain: Bitcoin Gold Network Still Suffering Over a Week After Attack", "title_full": "Bitcoin Infochain: Bitcoin Gold Network Still Suffering Over a Week After Attack", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IL", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "58af6fb4e25ce3b34362fbfb5d384ae25620e211", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQP1BbhB3rSE0GRLXsdxom2jjW1k1KrOjOZDFREeaw4P7IxbQrq1k76tuQ6eLrQDl3aJZhIiI9aTQC2VlWVcRAkitXOvxRrn_qjIH_kSOgM8GeK.8FPvV6u", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Infochain: Bitcoin Gold Network Still Suffering Over a Week After Attack", "text": "Friday, May 25, 2018 Bitcoin Gold Network Still Suffering Over a Week After Attack\nBitcoin Gold has been an interesting social experiment. This hard fork of Bitcoin had some high ambitions at first. Several months down the line, it seems things look a lot worse for wear. With one individual controlling most of the network, the ecosystem is facing a serious threat. Solving this matter has proven to be rather difficult. The Bitcoin Gold Network Issues\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, several key issues can affect any network. The so-called 51% attack is perhaps one of the worst scenarios for developers to deal with. It effectively means someone controls the majority of the blockchain’s processing power. As such, transactions, payments, and day-to-day operations are all severely affected.\nIn the case of Bitcoin Gold, the person controlling the network has nefarious intentions. Being able to tamper with transactions can cause all sorts of problems. This is especially true for mining pools, exchanges, and wallet providers dealing with Bitcoin Gold. So far, it remains unclear how much damage has been done in the process.\nThe end result is how all BTG users are at risk during this time. Any transaction broadcast over the network can be tampered with. In the worst case, the transfer will not even be accepted by the network. This would immediately make it impossible to sue Bitcoin Gold, potentially crashing the price in the process. Whether or not that is the objective of the assailant(s), remains unclear at this time. Not The First Major Problem\nAlthough this recent issue is of grave concern, it is not the only one. Ever since the release of BTG, there have been numerous concerns and technical issues. Double-spending attacks go back almost a full week, and things are not looking up. In the past, there have been issues with the mining difficult adjustments as well. Despite hard forking Bitcoin, BTG has not inherited the robustness of Bitcoin in this regard.\nFor the time being, exchanges need to be very careful. Any platform accepting Bitcoin Gold deposits without additional verification will be targeted by these criminals in the coming days. Ensuring all deposits are accounted for and legitimate is the only course of action. Unfortunately, it may also lead to trading platform suspending BTG trading until further notice.\nIt is not the first time smaller cryptocurrencies are affected by such attacks. Verge has been dealing with multiple attacks in recent months. Monacoin and Electroneum have seen their fair share of issues as well. Bitcoin and Ethereum are unlikely to suffer from issues like these anytime soon. Their networks have a lot more mining support, making it nearly impossible for one entity to control the majority of processing power.\nImage from Shutterstock ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-25T17:46:49.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "08c241852296b245f009a3145b643a5d6b5f16c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRexV0kG3lozdzozQnuJtquQP_pA.uSCOA..ggD1HXA38IZ3OdYGqBYIBCZXU9galR2XHvnAW1T42pBxdfkM.8_", "site_full": "www.4aproduct.net", "site": "4aproduct.net", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "", "title": "Tweet from Bitcoins_for_u – Cryptocurrency News", "title_full": "Tweet from Bitcoins_for_u – Cryptocurrency News", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.115, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "08c241852296b245f009a3145b643a5d6b5f16c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRexV0kG3lozdzozQnuJtquQP_pA.uSCOA..ggD1HXA38IZ3OdYGqBYIBCZXU9galR2XHvnAW1T42pBxdfkM.8_", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dragonirresources Gmail.Com", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Tweet from Bitcoins_for_u – Cryptocurrency News", "text": "Get the latest updates in the Cryptocurrency World Tweet from Bitcoins_for_u “Stablecoin” Trueusd Pumps After Binance Listing !

Speaking at an industry event in London on May 23, 2018, Jeffrey Tessler, head of clients, products and core markets for Deutsche Boerse, said they are considering offering cryptocurrency products: \"We are deep at work with it.\"\nTessler is quoted in Bloomberg confirming that Deutsche Boerse is “not at the same stage” as CME and that they want to make sure that they understand the underlying transaction “which isn’t the easiest thing to do.”\nTwo months ago, Deutsche Boerse announced a plan to work with the financial management firm HQLAX and R3’s Corda blockchain platform to implement a system that can offer more efficient securities settlement via a blockchain. HQLAX and R3 already have a solution for securities lending with a number of large banks, such as ING and Credit Suisse.\nTessler added, “Before moving forwards with anything like bitcoin, we want to understand the volatility and make sure clients are in line and make sure regulators are in line.”\nThis article originally appeared on Bitcoin Magazine .

Ponzi Scheme Head Vanishes A statement on the BTC Global website said: “The admin team cannot locate him. If anyone has ANY information on how we can get in contact with him please get in touch and let us know. Until Steven Twain resurfaces or is found there is nothing the admin team can do.”\nThe statement included a request for threats towards the leaders and admins to stop, suggesting legal proceedings as an alternative. It said that all of the admin staff had funded him independently and that they were missing a week’s worth of pay. It does also acknowledge that the staff had only two ways of contacting him.\nIn an email statement, the police said:\n“Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by BTC Global agents to invest with promises of 2 percent interest per day, 14 percent per week and ultimately 50 percent per month.”\nA ponzi , or pyramid, scheme is a business model that requires a constantly expanding supply of new members. They are illegal in many countries because while they can result in big profits for the founding members, the high numbers of new members lose out when the scheme collapses. Investigation Supports Sceptical Reviews\nMany outside observers were worried about the company after trying to research Steven Twain. Marketing agency SEO Spark reviewed BTC Global and concluded that although the funds manager sounded ‘impressive,’ there was no concrete evidence to back up a single claim.\nThe review predicted: “This turns BTC Global Team into a Ponzi scheme, and as the story goes, the company will shut down and collapse once investment activity inevitably dies down. Once this happens, the anonymous admin(s) will make off with the majority of the earnings, most all [sic] affiliates will lose out, and that’ll be the end of it.” The Hawks have launched an investigation into alleged fraud totalling more than one-billion rand by Bitcaw Trading Company, commonly known as BTC Global, after close to 30-thousand investors suffered losses. #sabcnews pic.twitter.com/xXxNMWq0qo\n— SAfm news (@SAfmnews) May 25, 2018\nIn February, security specialist Mike Bolhuis posted on Facebook a report on South African BTC Global that stated: “These guys have not been trading since there is no evidence of trading activities at all.” It continues that: “They have been running a full blown pyramid scheme where payment is accepted in Bitcoin and members are promised revenue that they will never earn.”\nSouth Africa has recently been in the news after a ransom request was demanded in Bitcoin for the kidnapping of Katlego Marite. On Wednesday, NewsBTC reported that three suspects were taken into custody over the kidnapping. The demand was made for 15 Bitcoin, worth around $123,000 at the time it was requested on Sunday.\nSouth Africa’s central bank has also announced they are setting up a self-regulatory organisation for the cryptocurrency space. The aim would be to reduce the risk of scams and malpractice while encouraging innovation. Bridget King, Director of Banking Practice, also expressed her concerns over the anonymity involved in the crypto space even though the majority of projects use public ledgers.

Its price has now gone down by over 10% over the past seven days.\nFurther to this week’s cryptocurrency selloff, another factor that might have contributed to Bitcoin’s decline is the Justice Department’s decision to open a criminal probe into whether traders are manipulating the price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies. This has added fuel to fire to what is already a crumbling market on the surface. BTC/USD Holds New Support\nFollowing the latest price drop, Bitcoin is now holding down a support at $7,300. However, the currency is now on another short-term bullish run looking to retest the $7,500 level once again. Should it manage to break above that, the next move could see BTC/USD approach $7,800 and then $8,000 heading into next week.\nOn the downside, a close around $7,300 may indicate that further declines are on the horizon. That would take BTC/USD further down toward the next critical point of $7,000.\nSource: Tradingview\nAs shown in the technicals chart, the MACD line is sending a strong bearish signal.

While the price falls have been small over the last two days (about $100 each), bitcoin remains on shaky ground, and the bears have not yet given up the reins.\nAnalyst John Navin from Forbes says that for bitcoin to really enter an “uptrend,” it would have to strike the $18,500 mark. At press time, the currency cannot be labeled as a spiking coin, particularly because its December range was so high ($19,000+), so either way one looks at it, bitcoin will always be in a slump unless it surpasses that level.\nHe further states that the next support position for bitcoin is $6,500, which is where it stood during early April. This suggests that bitcoin has the potential to fall even further before it incurs future spikes.\nMichael Sonnenshein is the managing director of Grayscale Investments, as well as one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency asset managers and a sponsor of eight digital currency trusts for investors. He believes there’s no middle ground for bitcoin, and that people will either go big or go broke with it. There’s no in-between to be had, here…\n“As we begin to look at assets like bitcoin and the unbelievable adversity it has faced over the last ten years, every day that bitcoin doesn’t go away, every day that bitcoin overcomes a new challenge – for me, that makes me feel that bitcoin will do either one of two things,” he comments. “It will either survive and become all these amazing things that we think it can be, which will cause its price to be a lot higher, or it is possible something else may come along that will displace it, and bitcoin will go to zero. It likely will have a binary outcome.”\nWhile he refuses to offer any predictions regarding future prices, he did mention that if developers can continue to make advancements and changes to its technology, thus making it more desired and useful in the financial space, its value will continue to rise. If developers fail, bitcoin could sink into oblivion faster than one might anticipate.\n“You have to think about bitcoin, again, as an open source protocol,” he explains. “Any other currency that comes along that allows for another feature – another attribute that maybe bitcoin does not have – as an open source protocol, [bitcoin] is able to accommodate, to integrate, to add that aspect, into it. I hope and continue to believe that as new features are added into bitcoin and other digital currencies, they can continue to thrive and grow and not be displaced.”\nThis, to a degree, is something we can still look forward to. Institutional capital is starting to make its way into the bitcoin and cryptocurrency space, and players from Wall Street and other financial hubs are now making their marks on digital currencies. We are witnessing solid, albeit slow, pushes towards mainstream acceptance, which could potentially lead to further technological adaptions. Granted we continue to see trends like this expand, bitcoin could potentially hold its ground in the immediate future.\nFull article at themerkle.com/bitcoin-price-watch-currency-sits-at-7400/ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john navin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forbes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael sonnenshein", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "grayscale investments", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-26T04:55:46.023+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee4c3ed38306b148bb29e840891fefa3c3b1631a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVIoHUBYrJXDA_VIALGU9USmZlIsrYK7aIgrylzt1QF3C3ae7gb_RovNNLaDfpn7klUF4r_tWOGFEJdbhtUAbCBITk4rTeSEckplvtGnNTSYc-", "site_full": "news.bitcoin.com", "site": "bitcoin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["finance"], "section_title": "", "title": "Alleged BTC-e Mastermind Confesses to Russian Money Laundering Charges - Bitcoin News", "title_full": "Alleged BTC-e Mastermind Confesses to Russian Money Laundering Charges - Bitcoin News", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/JrtConfess.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 34757, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ee4c3ed38306b148bb29e840891fefa3c3b1631a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ0vCC5VJNRw5HUnAy0VhmVIoHUBYrJXDA_VIALGU9USmZlIsrYK7aIgrylzt1QF3C3ae7gb_RovNNLaDfpn7klUF4r_tWOGFEJdbhtUAbCBITk4rTeSEckplvtGnNTSYc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jamie Redman", "published": "2018-05-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Alleged BTC-e Mastermind Confesses to Russian Money Laundering Charges - Bitcoin News", "text": "2560 Alleged BTC-e Mastermind Confesses to Russian Money Laundering Charges\nAccording to regional publications in Russia, the alleged BTC-e mastermind and prisoner in Greece, Alexander Vinnik, has allegedly confessed to charges of fraud and money laundering on May 24, 2018. Reports reveal a signed document details that Vinnik admits to committing financial fraud between 2011-2017 through the BTC-e cryptocurrency exchange.\nAlso read: This Week in Bitcoin: Ghost Scares Markets, Facebook Mulls Coin Russian Federation Receives an Admission of Guilt from the Alleged BTC-e Mastermind Alexander Vinnik\nRussian media sources such as Interfax and Vinnik’s lawyer, Ilias Spirliadis, have reported that Alexander Vinnik has signed a paper that admits to wrongdoing, in regard to money laundering and other cyber crimes. The publication Crime Russia explains that the Russian Federation’s Prosecutor General’s Office received the admission document and passed it on to higher law enforcement officials in Moscow.\nThe document appears to be a “full confession” to financial fraud using the BTC-e exchange between 2011-2017. The fraudulent activities had caused Russian residents to lose upwards of 750 million rubles ($12.4Mn USD) the document details. Further regional media sources report that Vinnik also confessed to other crimes tethered to computer hacking. Sources say this document may give the Russian Federation the means to extradite Vinnik. The United States government had previously attempted to extradite Vinnik to the U.S. but the motion was challenged. Photo of the accused BTC-e administrator Alexander Vinnik. The Russian citizen has been dubbed the ‘Russian Cryptocurrency King’ by the media. Vinnik’s Lawyer Ilias Spirliadis: The Russian Federation Will Likely Follow Up With Another Extradition Attempt\nLast week officials from the Greek prison where Vinnik is locked up, uncovered a plot that aimed to kill Vinnik. The suspect now has “special security measures,” including not eating and drinking products given to him from unfamiliar individuals. It’s still uncertain at the moment what Greek court officials will do if Russia attempts to extradite Vinnik again after his admission. The document is now in the hands of officials from the police department in the Ostankino district of Moscow.\nVinnik’s lawyer Ilias Spirliadis confirmed the admission document was legitimate and also emphasized that the Russian Federation will likely submit another request for extradition.\nWhat do you think about Alexander Vinnik Confessing to Money Laundering Crimes?

Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Police Mining Farm Discovered\nEmployees of the National Police of Ukraine reportedly set up a cryptocurrency mining farm in their workplace and mined cryptocurrencies for four months before they were caught, local media reported this week. The employees work at the Rivne Oblast regional police headquarters’ Communications Department. This information was revealed in the Rivne City Court document number No. 569/8710/18, Finclub reported.\nUkrainian news agency Glavcom elaborated, “In April of this year, employees of the Department of Homeland Security of the Police Headquarters in Rivne Oblast identified the [crypto mining] equipment at the office of the Communications Department,” adding:\nThe same day, the investigator of the regional administration removed from his colleagues two wooden frames, which featured eight graphics cards, six power units, two hard drives, a motherboard and a complete system unit.

The employees unilaterally used the electricity of the region “for their own purposes, for the proper functioning of the equipment for the extraction of cryptocurrencies, which caused significant damage to the interests of the State Enterprise of the Rivne region,” the court document details.\n368.media described:\nThe policemen are charged with the theft of electricity belonging to the management of the National Police in the Rivne region, which they used to extract cryptocurrency, but it is not known how much electricity they used.\nIn Ukraine, there is currently no regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies despite having multiple proposals. However, Deputy Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine, Oleg Churiy, recently revealed that the central bank is working on a bill to regulate them.\nWhat do you think of these police officers mining cryptocurrencies at work?

Ponzi Scheme Head Vanishes A statement on the BTC Global website said: “The admin team cannot locate him. If anyone has ANY information on how we can get in contact with him please get in touch and let us know. Until Steven Twain resurfaces or is found there is nothing the admin team can do.”\nThe statement included a request for threats towards the leaders and admins to stop, suggesting legal proceedings as an alternative. It said that all of the admin staff had funded him independently and that they were missing a week’s worth of pay. It does also acknowledge that the staff had only two ways of contacting him.\nIn an email statement, the police said:\n“Members of the public are believed to have been targeted as part of the scam and encouraged by BTC Global agents to invest with promises of 2 percent interest per day, 14 percent per week and ultimately 50 percent per month.”\nA ponzi , or pyramid, scheme is a business model that requires a constantly expanding supply of new members. They are illegal in many countries because while they can result in big profits for the founding members, the high numbers of new members lose out when the scheme collapses. Investigation Supports Sceptical Reviews\nMany outside observers were worried about the company after trying to research Steven Twain. Marketing agency SEO Spark reviewed BTC Global and concluded that although the funds manager sounded ‘impressive,’ there was no concrete evidence to back up a single claim.\nThe review predicted: “This turns BTC Global Team into a Ponzi scheme, and as the story goes, the company will shut down and collapse once investment activity inevitably dies down. Once this happens, the anonymous admin(s) will make off with the majority of the earnings, most all [sic] affiliates will lose out, and that’ll be the end of it.” The Hawks have launched an investigation into alleged fraud totalling more than one-billion rand by Bitcaw Trading Company, commonly known as BTC Global, after close to 30-thousand investors suffered losses. #sabcnews pic.twitter.com/xXxNMWq0qo\n— SAfm news (@SAfmnews) May 25, 2018\nIn February, security specialist Mike Bolhuis posted on Facebook a report on South African BTC Global that stated: “These guys have not been trading since there is no evidence of trading activities at all.” It continues that: “They have been running a full blown pyramid scheme where payment is accepted in Bitcoin and members are promised revenue that they will never earn.”\nSouth Africa has recently been in the news after a ransom request was demanded in Bitcoin for the kidnapping of Katlego Marite. On Wednesday, NewsBTC reported that three suspects were taken into custody over the kidnapping. The demand was made for 15 Bitcoin, worth around $123,000 at the time it was requested on Sunday.\nSouth Africa’s central bank has also announced they are setting up a self-regulatory organisation for the cryptocurrency space. The aim would be to reduce the risk of scams and malpractice while encouraging innovation. Bridget King, Director of Banking Practice, also expressed her concerns over the anonymity involved in the crypto space even though the majority of projects use public ledgers.

Liquidity moves markets!\nTheorists of all kinds and persuasions agree: We’re almost certainly hurtling toward a cashless, digital currency-using society at some point in the not-too-distant future.\nThe question is, what is it going to look like?\nRealistically, it will be nowhere near the original vision laid out for Bitcoin, much to the chagrin of crypto-enthusiasts and real-money libertarians everywhere.\nAs I’m going to show you, the path being taken is a tale of national, international, and even supranational intrigue that you might never have imagined.\nIt’s filled with so many contradictions, it’s become laughable.\nYet the central planners behind it all have so much to gain, it’s a near certainty that soon we’ll all be using the same virtual global cryptocurrency – like it or not.\nAnd if you think your freedom and privacy are threatened now… well you ain’t seen nothin’ yet. Governments Will Crack Down on Anarchic Bitcoin\nWhen bitcoin caught fire last year and entered full-blown “tulip mania” territory, many of its supporters got one thing wrong: They assumed governments and big banks would allow the cryptocurrency to flourish.\nBut the power to issue fiat money is so valuable to those who control it that there was no way they were going to let a private, anonymous, and relatively scarce virtual currency move in on their territory.\nMost People Don’t Know This About Bitcoin: A systems upgrade expected any day now could send Bitcoin to $100,000. Go here to see why Bitcoin’s not dead… and how it could make you millions.\nIt simply isn’t going to happen.\nThat said, blockchain technology is revolutionary and enormously valuable, especially to governments or institutions who might use it to control a currency and its transactions.\nSo blockchain is here to stay and improve, but currencies will remain fiat and under the thumbs of central planners. You can bet on that, since they can use blockchain to eventually tax, regulate, and track any and every transaction… period.\nConsider that without physical cash, bank runs become an impossibility. Consider, too, that a negative-interest rate regime would be a snap to initiate.\nAnd it gets more insidious than that.\nIf a central planner decides you’re not eating the “right foods” according to your health condition, that you’re drinking too much, or that you’re simply not a “good citizen,” it would be all too easy to block all kinds of transactions you might attempt until you “see the light.”\nAnd lest you think I’m just blowing a lot of hot air, consider that China’s massive, ongoing “social credit” experiment is already drifting in this terrifying, authoritarian direction.\nRead on and you’ll see how all of this may lie nearer in the future than you ever thought possible… Government’s Sinister Involvement in Crypto\nMultiple government- and institutionally sponsored cryptocurrency projects, all at varying degrees of advancement, are in the works. Some are even international in scale.\nGoldman Sachs alumnus and former White House Economic Advisor Gary Cohn recently told CNBC that he believed in blockchain technology, but that the world will have a simple cryptocurrency.\nSee Why Bitcoin Is Far from Dead: Cryptocurrency legend Michael Robinson just revealed why Bitcoin could be poised for a record-breaking rebound. Before the mainstream public gets any wiser, you need to see this now .\nHe said, “I do think we will have a global cryptocurrency at some point where the world understands it and it’s not based on mining costs or cost of electricity or things like that. It will be a more easily understood cryptocurrency.”\nLast year a group of highly influential, highly regulated financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase & Co . (NYSE: JPM ), State Street Corp. (NYSE: STT ), Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC ), Cisco Systems Inc. (Nasdaq: CSCO ), Accenture Plc. (NYSE: ACN ), Swift Networks Group (ASX: SW1), Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (TYO: 8306) and the London Stock Exchange, announced a joint push to develop an open-source standard blockchain application.\nEven International Monetary Fund (IMF) Director Christine Lagarde has sung the praises of digital currencies, but with an IMF twist.\nYou see, the IMF has its own Special Drawing Rights (SDR) currency, which is essentially a basket of major currencies that includes the U.S. dollar, euro, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, and British pound sterling.\nMany feel the U.S. dollar has too big a place as a reserve currency. They want some of the other SDR components, or perhaps more readily the SDR itself, to become the world’s reserve currency.\nSome see an “IMFCoin,” a cryptocurrency backed by the SDR, as a way to rejuvenate that currency basket in international finance and possibly dethrone the dollar’s reserve status.\nAnd now policy thinktanks are shoring up support. This Dangerous Idea Is Getting an Academic Boost\nA recent article in Project Syndicate by Andrew Sheng and Xiao Geng was entitled “From Dollar to e-SDR.”\nReally, that title pretty much says it all.\nAs Sheng and Geng propose, “The private sector can work directly with central banks to create a digital SDR to use as a unit of account and store of value. Such an ‘e-SDR’ would, in a sense, be the quintessential reserve asset, because it would be fully backed by reserve currencies in the IMF-determined ratio… A politically neutral body, owned by the private sector or central banks, should be established to issue the asset. Participating central banks and asset managers would then have to swap their reserve currency holdings for e-SDRs…”\nBut U.S. dollar supporters already have a serious horse in this race, and aren’t backing down.\nAlready in 2015, St. Louis Fed Vice-President David Andolfatto suggested a “Fedcoin” could provide the Fed with an “added tool.”\nThat’s terrifying, when you think about the mayhem the Fed causes with the “tools” they already have at their disposal.\nFast forward to 2018, and Goldman Sachs-backed fintech startup Circle is introducing a cryptocurrency pegged to the dollar, called the USD Coin.\nThe company said in a blogpost that “a price-stable currency, such as a token pegged to the U.S. dollar, is critical for enabling mainstream adoption of blockchain technology for payments as well as for supporting maturation in financial contracts built on smart contract platforms, such as tokenized securities, loans, and property.”\nVying for dominance of this enormously valuable market has the SDR camp on full throttle.\nOne project is already aiming to create a world fiat cryptocurrency, one meant to be used by everyone everyday, not just central banks or large financial institutions.\nIts name is Saga, and it’s being developed by Swiss non-profit The Saga Foundation, whose stated purpose is to develop new technologies in open and decentralized software.\nThe Foundation’s board reads like a who’s who of finance: Nobel Laureate Myron Scholes, the man who put the “Scholes” in the Black-Scholes model for pricing options and derivatives; Dan Galai, who co-developed the VIX market volatility measure; and former Governor of the Bank of Israel and chair of JPMorgan Chase International, Jacob Frenkel.\nOh, and don’t forget that board member Myron Scholes is, yes, the same Myron Scholes who was principal and limited partner at the infamous Long-Term Capital Management. When that hedge fund collapsed, the debacle required a $3.6 billion bailout from the world’s biggest banks under supervision from the U.S. Federal Reserve.\nNot exactly reassuring.\nAnyways, Saga’s slight resemblance to Bitcoin ends at the blockchain-type “distributed ledger technology” (DLT).\nBecause unlike Bitcoin, whose volatility has become legendary, Saga is supposed to hold a stable value so it can gain acceptance as a unit of account and a means of exchange. Apparently, Saga will be pegged to the IMF’s SDR and function on a fractional reserve method as reserves are deposited in everyday banks.\nSee how far we’re getting from Bitcoin? Hang on, there’s more.\nSupposedly, algorithms will adjust the supply of reserves underlying Saga’s economy, including a price band to limit volatility.\nAnd finally, Bitcoin-like anonymity? Not for Saga. Holders of the currency will have to fill out the usual “know your customer” and anti-money laundering information requirements demanded by Swiss law.\nCome to think of it, this sounds a whole lot like what the IMF’s Lagarde was suggesting. As Always, the Best Way to Protect Yourself Is…\nIn any case, as you may already have figured out, a global fiat cryptocurrency is not the altruistic answer to money for you and me.\nIt is, on the other hand, an extremely powerful tool for central planners to gain even more control.\nYour best antidote to these shenanigans is physical gold. If you don’t own any, I suggest you go out and buy some non-numismatic coins. If you do already own some, re-evaluate your holdings, and consider whether you need more.\nYou probably do.\nWhile not perfect, you can also contemplate a basic physical gold-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF).\nOne worth considering is the Sprott Physical Gold Trust (NYSE Arca: PHYS ). It holds gold bullion that is fully allocated and stored at a secure third-party location in Canada, subject to periodic inspections and audits.\nWhat’s more, U.S. investors holding for at least 12 months can benefit from a 15% capital gains tax versus the 28% rate with most precious metals ETFs.\nJust remember that most if not all banks or quasi-government institutions looking to roll out a global fiat cryptocurrency do not have your best interest at heart over theirs.\nYou need to look out for Number One. And owning some physical gold is the best way I know.\n5,000 years of history prove it.\nTo get full access to all Money Morning content, click here\nAbout Money Morning: Money Morning gives you access to a team of ten market experts with more than 250 years of combined investing experience – for free .

He also told Kim in the letter, “ You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used .”\nBears say, that Donald Trump has called off the meeting, but if he meets with Kim Jong-un would John McAfee’s prediction be correct? and what would be the fundamental impact on the cryptocurrency market be?\nIts right that political stability always has a positive impact on investment markets, so the meeting between the head of the two countries could have the potential to create a 100% rally in price.\nOn the other hand, the stock markets, for instance, plunged only 1% after Donald Trump refused to meet with North Korean President.

Now, according to numerous regional reports, the Zimbabwe High Court has ruled in favor of the trading platform’s argument because the RBZ failed to show up to the trial.\nAlso read : I ndia’s Supreme Court Keeps Ban on Banks’ Crypto Services, For Now Harare High Court Reverses RBZ Cryptocurrency Ban\nMultiple regional news outlets and individuals on social media have reported that the Zimbabwe High Court has lifted the RBZ ban against cryptocurrency activities taking place within the country. The local digital asset exchange Golix decided to take the case to the High Court stating the RBZ had no right to enforce such laws and only the country’s parliament can issue a financial ban.\nAfter the bank issued its Circular to Banking Institutions No. 2/2018: Virtual Currencies , many people thought the central bank effectively banned all cryptocurrency activities. Today, Golix and its legal team managed to get High Court judge Justice Alphas Chitakunye to overturn the ban.\nOn May 24 one of the legal team members, and a constitutional lawyer, Fadzayi Mahere , announced the victory to her Twitter followers stating :\nRBZ ban on cryptos lifted by the High Court. Administrative justice is alive and well in this jurisdiction. Section 68 of the Constitution is our best friend. The legal team fighting against the recent RBZ ruling in Zimbabwe. Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Representatives Fail to Attend Harare High Court Trial\nAlongside Fadzayi Mahere, the Golix team was represented by another attorney named Hopewell Chitima. The legal team used Section 68 of the country’s constitution but no representatives from the RBZ showed up to the trial. Regional reports state that because of this action, the Harare High Court justice ruled in favor of the Golix team. High Court judge Alphas Chitakunye’s ruling states:\nThe ban issued by the Respondents [RBZ] through letter dated 15 May 2018 against Applicant directing it to cease operations, shut down its virtual currency exchange business and ordering the closure of its bank account with its banks is hereby reversed and set aside.\nAt the time of publication, there have been no statements made by the RBZ, the central bank’s registrar Norman Mataruke, or the RBZ governor, John Mangudya.\nWhat do you think about the High Court lifting the RBZ ban?

This brings the total loss of Bitcoin close to 18% over the past 30 days.\nLong Term –\nConsidering the markets are trading within a bearish trajectory it is important to keep the big picture in mind to remain rational within falling markets.\nAfter experiencing such a bullish run in late 2017 it is understandable why Bitcoin may be consolidating for a short period of time. Although Bitcoin may have fallen significantly in price from the highs of 2018, at the $17230 handle set in early January, it is important to emphasize that the market is in a period of consolidation where neither higher highs or lower lows are being created. This characterised by the formation of a long term symmetrical triangle shown in the chart below.\nFrom the chart, we can see that Bitcoin has remained in this long term triangle for a period of almost 5 months after its formation in mid January.\nThis series of lower highs and higher lows shows that Bitcoin is neither in a bullish or bearish market. Instead, Bitcoin is trading within a consolidating market. For the market, in the long-term, to be considered bearish, Bitcoin would need to break below this years low, set out in February, at around the $6000 handle.\nTypically, symmetrical triangles resolve themselves in the direction of the previous trend. In Bitcoins case, this would mean a strong break to the upside. From the analysis on the market we could expect to see the resolution of this triangle during the trading period of either June or early July.\nNear Term\nMay has been a bearish month for Bitcoin, dropping from the highs of $9985 to todays low of $7251 (at the time of writing).\nFrom the chart above we can see that Bitcoin has found support at a significant .786 Fibonacci retracement level. The Fibonacci retracement is a retracement of the previous bullish move experienced in April up until early May. The .786 retracement is located around the $7251 handle and price has already experienced some rejection at this level. However, it is important to note that this fibonacci retracement level is not expected to hold and is to be only viewed as an area where the market can pause momentarily before continuing its downward trajectory.\nIf price action manages to close below this level on the Daily timeframe then we will expect Bitcoin to continue trading lower until it reaches the lower confinement of the long term triangle previously discussed at a price range of $6900-$7000.\nThis lower confinement of the triangle also confluences with major Fibonacci extension levels taken from the declines in December and January. More specifically, the 1.414 extension at a price of $6908, taken from December 12th high to December 22nd low and the 1.272 extension at a price of $6915, taken from high of January 6th to the low set on January 17th. This confluence of technical indicators increases the validity in the hopes that Bitcoin may find some significant support at price area.\nOther technical indicators are also showing signs that the bearish momentum may be waining. RSI is fast approaching extreme oversold conditions as it finds some level of support around the 20 handle, indicating that selling pressure has reached an extreme and could be due a reversal. However, the moving averages are all pointing in the downward direction and are pulling away from one another indicating that there may be some more decline in price before a reversal can occur. Conclusion\nBitcoin is experiencing another tough month in terms of price action with it’s short term bearish momentum.

But only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist, according to the design of the cryptocurrency’s anonymous founder known as “Satoshi Nakamoto.”\n“It’s an event that makes the market more aware of the scarcity of bitcoin. It will eventually turn into higher prices,” said Ansel Lindner, a bitcoin investor and host of the “Bitcoin & Markets” podcast. He expects this year, bitcoin could surpass its record high of more than $19,000 hit in December.\nBitcoin traded near $8,900 midday Thursday, down roughly 35 percent for the year so far. The cryptocurrency is created through an energy intensive process in which miners use high computing power to solve complex mathematical equations. They then receive the bitcoins as a reward, whose amount is halved over time. As a result, the bitcoin creation process is generally slowing down, although it can vary with the number of miners participating.\nThe first bitcoins were mined in January 2009. Blockchain.info data shows it took about 200 days to reach the first 1 million coins, but the run to 17 million has taken more than 500 days — the number of bitcoins topped 16 million in November 2016. The remaining 4 million coins aren’t expected to be mined completely for another 122 years.\nThe 17 millionth bitcoin “serves as a timely reminder that despite bitcoin’s volatility the fundamentals have never been stronger!” Brandon Williams of cryptocurrency trading firm Cosima Capital, said in an email.\n“Not only have there been improvements in scaling and lowering transaction fees (i.e. SegWit and Lightning Network), but bitcoin is finite!” he said. And against limited supply, Williams expects demand from institutional investors to increase, which should send prices higher.\nA significant number of bitcoins are also not in circulation. An estimated 980,000 coins, or 4.7 percent of all bitcoins that will ever exist, belong to Satoshi, according to widely accepted analysis by Sergio Demian Lerner.

A single bitcoin last traded at $7,485.63, down 0.9% since 5 p.m. Thursday, Eastern U.S. levels on the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange.\nHaving opened Monday above $8,500, the worlds No. 1 digital currency is on track to lose 10% this week and record it's third consecutive weekly drop, a dubious feat that it hasn't managed since September 2017.\nRead:Opinion: This is all it would take for bitcoin to become a worthless cryptocurrency (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-all-it-would-take-for-bitcoin-to-become-a-worthless-cryptocurrency-2018-04-12)\nCan miners save bitcoin?\nAs the price of bitcoin continues to slide, some participants are looking to the miners to save the day. Despite the falling price, the hash rate, which reflects the amount of computing effort expended by those who digitally mine for bitcoin, continues to rise. That rise rate suggests that interest in bitcoin remains elevated, even as prices slump.\n\"If the hash rate were to be falling in congruence with price, then there would be cause for concern. That would tell us that miners are less interested in mining bitcoin and could be turning their focus to mining other cryptocurrencies or not mining at all,\" wrote Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets.\n\"It seems to me that miners are taking a longer-term view on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, ignoring short-term downtrends in the market.\"\nAltcoins and futures on track for another losing day\nAltcoins, or alternatives to bitcoin, also saw a rough trading patch. Ether is the only one showing gains, climbing 1% to $595.90, Bitcoin Cash has lost 2.4% to $1,025.60, Litecoin is off 2.9% at $119.44 and Ripple's XRP coinlast traded at 60 cents, down 4.5% on the day.\nFutures markets are trading lower Friday.
