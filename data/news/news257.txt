While the price of Bitcoin dipped to $8,500 Tuesday after nearly going back to $9,000 on Friday, the price of cryptocurrency Zcash surged.\nThe jump came after cryptocurrency bulls Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss gave Zcash a thumbs up Monday, adding that their Bitcoin exchange, Gemini, had gained regulatory approval to list Zcash on its platform. The price of Zcash has surged 47% to $364 since then, adding about $462.8 million to Zcash’s now $1.5 billion market capitalization. Gemini, now the first licensed Zcash exchange, plans to allow Zcash trading starting Tuesday, May 22 at 9:30 a.m. ET.\nIn Gemini’s press release announcing the approvals, the Winklevoss twins focused on Zcash and how it can co-exist alongside Bitcoin. While Bitcoin is often billed as highly private, it still broadcasts from where and to where funds are moving—allowing those with basic computer skills to track it. Zcash, on the other hand, was created as a more private cryptocurrency, encrypting those transactions.\nAnd while Zcash may sound ripe for the criminal underground, average Joes may also have legitimate reasons to hide payments from p rying eyes . Consider a doctor’s visit or a surprise anniversary gift.\n“Zcash picks up where Bitcoin left off,” Tyler Winklevoss, Gemini CEO, said in a statement Monday. “Bitcoin has many strengths, but privacy is not one of them.”\nThe Winkelvoss twins together own an estimated 120,000 Bitcoins as of January . It’s unclear if the brothers own Zcash.\n“Bitcoin and Zcash are two revolutionary technologies vying for different mantles, Bitcoin being digital gold and Zcash being digital cash,” Cameron Winklevoss, president of Gemini, added.\nIn the past, cryptocurrency exchanges have faced allegations of insider trading after launching the trade of a new digital coin on their platform. Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based exchange for instance, faced a class action lawsuit after the price of Bitcoin Cash rose in the hours before Coinbase announced that trading would commence.\nSnubbing that trend, Zcash founding member and CEO Bryce “Zooko” Wilcox posted a photo of Zcash’s price as it surged on the Gemini announcement.\n“Proud of my team for once again publicly demonstrating that we don’t leak information and we don’t take advantage of our privileged access to information by trading on it,” he wrote.

Libertarians, Business Owners, and Financial institutions are coming together in the greatest numbers we've ever seen.\nIn addition to the Libertarians, Coders, Crypto Businesses/Exchanges the roll call has some high profile industry leaders from outside the Cryptosphere, including:\n-President of the St. Louis FED\n-Twitter CEO\n-FedEx CEO\nRepresentatives from:\n-Microsoft\n-IBM\n-SEC\n-CFTC\n-World Economic Forum\n-Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency(HSARPA)\nBitcoin is being taken more seriously than ever before. Just a few years ago we were laughed at for suggesting Bitcoin would compete with the FED. Now we have presidents of FED banks speaking at the annual preeminent Bitcoin conference.\nBitcoin is turning institutions inside out. Individuals act principally in their best interests ; even if their behavior harms the gr oup as a whole. This is called \"Tragedy of the commons\" ; when a resource is overutilized to the point where it is unusable for everyone.\nBitcoin turns this on its head. Bitcoins properties attracts speculators looking out for their best interests. These speculators then have an interest in seeing Bitcoin succeed and use the leverage at their disposal to do so.\nSo while Bitcoin is a threat to the power and sovereignty of every government and bank on Earth ; it is individuals who make up those institutions.\nIndividuals within governments and banks adopt Bitcoin for (hopeful) personal profit. These people aren't trying to overthrow governments and banks; but they will do what they can to soften their institutions stance on their investment.\nAs Bitcoin continues going through its growth cycles it attracts more and more individuals. More and more people in more institutions that have a vested interest in seeing Bitcoin grow. These people support proje cts and initiatives that increase Bitcoins usefulness and therefore adds to its overall value proposition; which helps create a positive feedback loop.\nThat is the genius of the Bitcoin revolution. No bloodshed required. No protesting. Bitcoin is as much applied computer science and cryptography as it is a global psychological operation. We are re-inventing the concept of value.\nInstead of fighting the old system we are building a better system. Instead of forcing people to change with threats of violence; people willingly change to chase profits.\nThe end-game for this revolution is the end of central banks. Global Value/Currency Standard. Peoples savings will grow in value over time at the pace of productivity increases. People will no longer lose value to inflation. Governments will not be able to spend money they do not have. Unprofitable businesses supported by subsidies will fail. Defense spending will fall dramatically around the globe.\nBitc oin can solve most of the problems whose root cause is \"money\". Bitcoin cannot fix greed and human nature; but it can mitigate the damage done by greedy and power hungry individuals.\nsubmitted by /u/45sbvad\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "business owners", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "homeland security advanced research projects agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "st. louis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cryptosphere", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T20:47:47.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3b47bc11dfe0016222968e09d1724033616686ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfuu3sqpBtPg3POkmsFnFKg-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=128.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Новости", "title": "Штат Флорида разрешит утплату налогов в Bitcoin", "title_full": "Штат Флорида разрешит утплату налогов в Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-15T20:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 19, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3b47bc11dfe0016222968e09d1724033616686ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmfuu3sqpBtPg3POkmsFnFKg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Papanister", "published": "2018-05-15T20:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Штат Флорида разрешит утплату налогов в Bitcoin", "text": "Америка  удивительная страна.

Resolving an Expensive Issue In an official announcement dated May 14 th , Joel M. Greenberg, Seminole County’s Tax Collector, disclosed that his office will be accepting both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash as means for payment of different services beginning this summer. For a long time, users who chose to pay their taxes with a credit or debit card were charged with hefty fees. This was because they were using a third-party payment processor such as Visa or Mastercard. Now, as the agency will begin accepting cryptocurrencies, these days will be no more. Thanks to Bitcoin technology, the Seminole County Tax Collector will reduce transactions fees and improve payment accuracy, efficiency, and transparency. Greenberg: We live in a world where technology has made access to services on demand, with same-day delivery and the expectation of highly efficient customer service and we should expect the same from our government, […] The aim of my tenure in office is to make our customer experience faster, smarter, and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st century and one way is the addition of cryptocurrency to our payment options. Saving on Fees The agency subtly states that by allowing its taxpayers to use Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, the heavy fees which are associated with using third-party payment processors will be eliminated. That’s great, but who’s the one who has to pay those fees in the first place? “Interchange is a small fee paid by a merchant’s bank (acquirer) to a cardholder’s bank (issuer) to compensate the issuer for the value and benefits that merchants receive when they accept electronic payments,” MasterCard’s official website reads. Thus, Seminole County’s Tax Collector claims that the main premise of the new payments option is to reduce the costs paid by the government. The more money saved on fees, the more tax money for spending for social benefits. Though, the words used in the announcement may lead taxpayers to believe that they will be saving money. But Why Pay Taxes in Bitcoin? It goes without saying that an official tax agency recognizing cryptocurrencies as an official payments method is significant. But how necessary is it really? There are two types of taxpayers: those who own cryptocurrencies and those who don’t. In order for the latter to take advantage of the implanted change, one would have to jump through various hoops: research and learn how to use a Bitcoin wallet, register on an exchange and go through the KYC process to buy BTC or BCH, and only then can they send it to the Tax Collector’s receiving address. This is quite bothersome and there doesn’t seem to be much incentive for the layman to use cryptocurrency to pay taxes compared to existing methods. The former group however is more likely to take advantage of the new payment option since they already have cryptocurrency and are familiar with how it works. But let’s stop for a moment and think about this. One of the biggest advantages of Bitcoin is its pseudonymous privacy.

NYDFS Approves Expanded Crypto Portfolio New York State Department of Financial Services Superintendent Maria T. Vullo has announced on Monday that Gemini Trust Company LLC has been authorized to offer the custody services and trading of Zcash, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash on its exchange based in NYC. She said: “This action continues New York’s longstanding commitment to innovation and leadership in the global marketplace. With smart and thorough regulatory oversight, the development and long-term growth of the industry will remain thriving.” The addition of Zcash especially seems to have taken the market by surprise, leading to its price jumping over 40% in the last twenty-four hours. Back in March, the founders of the trading venue revealed that adding new cryptocurrency options are high on the company’s agenda this year, with BCH and LTC at the top of the list. Tyler Winklevoss, CEO of Gemini, commented on Monday: “We are proud to be the first licensed exchange in the world to offer Zcash trading and custody services and look forward to providing customers with a safe, secure, and regulated place to buy, sell, and store Zcash, an incredible new form of digital cash.” Surprise CEO Resignation Chris Lee, Chief Executive Officer at Chinese-run cryptocurrency exchange Okex , has reportedly left his position with the Hong Kong based company. Lee cited personal reasons for his departure, seeking to “start a new life,” the exchange stated on Monday. According to his spokeswoman, Lee added it had been the “greatest pleasure and an honor” to work at Okex and that he will return to the blockchain community after a short break to spend time with his family. The surprising move raised some speculations online as for the reasons. $1 Million Bitcoin Heist Foiled According to media reports from the state of Georgia, the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office found that five young men had conspired to break into a local home and steal nearly $1 million in bitcoin. Their robbery investigation has reportedly been ongoing since January, following a drug bust. The five young men, Justin Ellison, Trivette Adams, Matthew Schwartz, Jacob South, and Michael McDermont, have been charged with residential strong arm robbery and are being held in a detention center without bond. Australian Sexual Health Provider Held for Ransom Family Planning New South Wales, one of Australia’s largest reproductive and sexual health service providers, has sent out an email to its clients on Monday notifying them that it reported a cyber attack on its website to Australian Federal Police. “I want to stress to people that this has absolutely nothing to do with, and has no impact on our clinical medical records, they’ve always been secure,” the organization’s chief executive Ann Brassil said at a press conference on Monday. “There’s no evidence that this cyberattack was on Family Planning NSW itself;…and it appears it was an attack for ransom, so it was financial. The ransom said we are shutting down your website and you pay us $15,000 in Bitcoin for us to release the website, and it had a clock ticking down.” Polish Propaganda Polish financial authorities have again been found to spend taxpayers’ money on a smear campaign on social media against investing in cryptocurrencies. Poland’s Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) has issued a new tender order to plan and conduct a campaign aimed at “building awareness” among the public for the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies, pyramid schemes and forex activities unsupervised by the KNF. Earlier this year it was reveled that the Central Bank of Poland and KNF had paid over 90,000 PLN (złoty) to, among others, a Polish Youtube content network which represents many popular young local content creators to produce anti-crypto videos .

Greenberg. Bitcoin core (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH) can now both be used for tax payments, beginning this summer. County residents can pay in crypto for driver licenses, ID cards, and even property taxes. Also read: Coinbase Remains the Most Successful and Important Company in the Crypto Industry Bitpay Allows Enthusiasts in Seminole County, Florida to Pay Taxes in Crypto File under: bitter sweet. Joel M. Greenberg, Seminole County Tax Collector, explained, “We live in a world where technology has made access to services on demand, with same-day delivery and the expectation of highly efficient customer service and we should expect the same from our government. The aim of my tenure in office is to make our customer experience faster, smarter, and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st century and one way is the addition of cryptocurrency to our payment options.” Mr. Greenberg Cryptocurrency isn’t necessarily moral nor immoral. It is an amoral technology, a tool. It can be used for terrorism, vacation getaways, housing, and, now, taxes. As governments are wont, they’re usually immune from innovation. But when it comes to revenue collection they’re surprisingly spry, alert, on it. Paying taxes by credit or debit has been a thing for a while, but always involved processors taking a heavy cut. The advent of crypto and the Bitpay Visa does away with a great many previous frictions, making the expropriation experience win-win: enthusiasts don’t have to do yet another conversion, and governments save in fees. Holding Noses, Simplified Head of Compliance at Bitpay, Jeremie Beaudry, detailed, “Bitpay was started because we recognized the potential for blockchain to revolutionize the financial industry, making payments faster, more secure, and less expensive on a global scale. With the Seminole County Tax Collector’s office, we have engaged our first government agency to accept bitcoin and bitcoin cash by making it easy and seamless for them.” And though the broader crypto community has its issues with funding governments, making paying them shouldn’t be any more cumbersome than need be. Bitpay and Seminole County teamed to allow bitcoin cash and bitcoin core for pretty much everything: car tags and titles, licenses, even property tax. The county tax collector gets their money settled by the following business day, paid directly to the account in fiat. The local government is spared notorious price volatility and the usual risk associated with crypto. As Bitpay’s press release insists, through a “push transaction, the user sends the exact amount of bitcoin or bitcoin cash needed to pay the bill. This eliminates traditional credit card fraud and identity theft risks associated with credit cards.” The company’s fees are also better than merely competitive, as 1% per approval is way below market rate. And for those wishing to pay their taxes, the processor can be accessed through traditional computers or smartphones. Is the ability to pay taxes with crypto a good way to increase overall adoption?

However, most of the discourse surrounding the currency revolves around the question of whether it will rise or fall? Many new investors see the rise of crypto currencies and buy whatever comes with or without fees, logic, fundamental analysis or previous investing background. Speculation, like any other field of expertise, requires skill, discipline, and tools for market analysis . When so much money is at stake one needs to know how to moderate the excitement, and before running with cash on the streets, examination is needed to determine what stands behind these coins and whether their price reflects their value. Following unprecedented media exposure over the last year, we have seen the biggest onrush yet to be seen in crypto-markets around the world. However, some investors have discovered what the Bitcoiners have long known. The world’s financial system is trying to control the crypto gates, even though this is a legitimate activity and it is our natural right to invest our money in whatever we desire. The uncompromising authority of the banking system demonstrates how “our” money is not in our hands to do as we please. In fact, we are subject to the whims of policymakers who decide what we can do with it. This is only a reminder of how a central decision-making authority can determine and enforce policies according to its own interests while disregarding the desire of the individuals it is supposed to serve. Bitcoin changes the rules of the game. Bitcoin is a mutation that originates in the genome of a free economy found in a fast-developing techno-global liberal environment. Unlike the classical financial system, where a board of directors is subject to political pressure and allows corruption, Bitcoin is not controlled by a central entity but by all the network players (developers, miners, money changers, wallets, and users). Each player in the network has the right to decide whether he is willing to accept the rules of a known and transparent protocol and no one can impose new laws without the broad consent of the rest of the users. Bitcoin’s consensus algorithm is based on neutral, interest-free mathematics which assumes that each of the network players wants to maximize their profits in the harshest manner. This assumption is based on the mathematical study of game theory, according to which Bitcoin created a restrictive organic model that requires all players to reach an agreement at the interests balance point of the various players. It can be thought of as a social contract backed by a mathematical constitution that is determined by all the players in the network, and all those who wish to can take part, and not only an unelected minority. A constitutional amendment (changing protocol rules) requires a very difficult and broad consensus that cannot be imposed from above. Although this model is slower than a dictatorial decision-making model, it ensures the practical use of professional knowledge that is carefully screened and prioritizes the wisdom of the network as a whole over the limited knowledge of individuals. Also, the rules are defined in such a way that players are maximized when playing accordingly. When network players choose not to play according to these rules, the entire network can reject their “contribution,” and the rule-breakers then have the right to split into a separate network with different rules. If you were looking for an alternative to modern democracy, Bitcoin is here to inspire. Winston Churchill once said, “Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others that have been tried.” Democracy fits small communities. However, the exponential expansion of human beings on the planet alongside the explosion of information left the world with a bureaucracy with a “top” decision-making center that cannot cope with the amount of knowledge required to make informed decisions. The nature of the decision makers in large organizations is to be cut off from the roots of the organization and its demands, and to gain more power and authority, thereby opening a hatch to organizational corruption. Bitcoin’s decision-making model presents an alternative to governance in the modern world. However, there is a deliberate attempt to sweep the Bitcoin gospel under the stairs and reduce it to Blockchain technology. This attempt is led by interest groups, and it misses out the essence of the ideology that Bitcoin came to serve. The Blockchain is only one of the building blocks that enables the decentralization of the currency, and private control of a private Blockchain is less valuable than the aura surrounding it. Therefore, the spotlight on Blockchain technology dazzles the audience and prevents it from seeing the other factors that make Bitcoin unique in the digital currency landscape, enabling it to maintain the consensus algorithm on which it is based and the resulting decentralization of power. New investors entering the crypto field should ask themselves whether the currency they are investing in brings value to the table that does not exist in Bitcoin or that Bitcoin cannot assimilate at a later stage. In conclusion, although Bitcoin makes it impossible to prepare a golden calf, and although it is impossible to print the portrait of the king of Thailand or of the statesman Benjamin Franklin, the intellectual-technological value of Bitcoin is invaluable. What began as an economic experiment in late 2008 has become the biggest threat the banking system has known since its inception. Revolutions in the modern era no longer occur by a proletariat that rattles the streets of the city, but by elite technologies that are two steps ahead of the old world. Banks and legislators who do not internalize the new reality and are not able to assimilate the currency will simply remain behind and may drag with them the population they are supposed to serve. Bitcoin’s price does not matter now – Bitcoin comes to limit government intervention in the economy.

A lot of people value those individuals’ opinions more than anything else. John McAfee is quickly making a name for himself in the cryptocurrency industry. One of his most recent comments will irk a lot of people, though. Calling Bitcoin Private superior to Monero is a very interesting opinion. McAfee Favors Bitcoin Private No one will deny there have been many hard forks of Bitcoin in the past few months. All of these forks attempt to do something different at this stage, but it has become apparent most of these new creations are lacking in one key aspect. More specifically, there are virtually no Bitcoin forks focusing on the features people have been asking for. The main feature Bitcoin lacks at this stage is privacy. Although it offers pseudonymity, there is no privacy to speak of. That is, unless users decide to rely on third-party services such as coin mixers and instant exchanges to convert to and from altcoins. By default, Bitcoin has no privacy or anonymity features, nor will it have such traits anytime soon. Developers are working on potentially implementing such tools, but it is not a big priority at this stage. John McAfee is a very bullish individual when it comes to specific cryptocurrencies. Despite Bitcoin’s apparent flaws, he expects the world’s leading cryptocurrency to hit a value of $500,000 pretty soon. He is also keeping close tabs on all of the Bitcoin hard forks to determine if any of them have any long-term potential. So far, he hasn’t jumped on board the Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, or Bitcore bandwagons just yet. Instead, McAfee does what he is best known for: throwing a curveball. In a recent interview, he stated that Bitcoin Private is the “best hard fork of Bitcoin” to date. That is a very peculiar statement, as very few use cases for BTCP exist at this time. Then again, cryptocurrency speculation has nothing to do with use cases, but rather with hyping up projects. That is not all, though. In the same interview , McAfee said he is confident Bitcoin Private has the potential to ultimately replace Monero. That’s a very peculiar statement, considering that Monero and Bitcoin Private are nothing alike. They both provide privacy, but Monero is mainly focused on anonymity through proper technology. It is a bit unclear how Bitcoin Private plans to handle that aspect in the future. This comment by John McAfee will undoubtedly trigger another major Bitcoin Private price pump. It won’t be the first, as this particular altcoin has seen its value fluctuate quite often. Major gains lead to heavy losses until the cycle repeats itself. Until there is any real use case for Bitcoin Private, it will have no advantage over Monero whatsoever. - - - - -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john mcafee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crypto world news the merkle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcafee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "monero", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T18:45:20.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c3258fccdf0dc0c7e2d129c73ccf44ad0fcbdba8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fC6iNbpb_RjWbaEeYGCo.dYP8rGBbSJVk1WYjIB3CM3BXY6pEZquDkSQ--", "site_full": "bitrss.com", "site": "bitrss.com", "site_section": "https://bitrss.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BITRSS Crypto and Bitcoin World News", "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis May.15", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Analysis May.15", "published": "2018-05-15T20:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bitrss.com/upload/news/image_1526382538_10942722.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c3258fccdf0dc0c7e2d129c73ccf44ad0fcbdba8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSdb.6bkG7_6.mi5yYTQ8fC6iNbpb_RjWbaEeYGCo.dYP8rGBbSJVk1WYjIB3CM3BXY6pEZquDkSQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-15T20:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Analysis May.15", "text": "4 hours ago Blogs and more CryptoPotato.com 70 The past days just show how hard is to day trade. Huge candles, huge volatility. Not a good time for short moves. As of now Bitcoin is facing very tough resistance where the moving averages 50 and 200 days meet, and a descending trend line. If it overcomes the $8,900 – $9,000, the next obstacle will be $9,400 resistance. Consensus conference had started in New York, and the positive effect on the markets, so far, can be seen. From the bear side, Stochastic RSI had crossed down in the overbought zone – might indicate that the market needs some air before trying to continue up.

Bitcoin ‘The Real Innovation’ Speaking during a panel at Consensus 2018 , which has since become infamous as a frank discussion of Bitcoin vs. Blockchain, Song made the bet with Ethereum cofounder Joseph Lubin. “I don’t really see much of this stuff gaining much traction,” he said referencing blockchain solutions for global enterprise arguing Bitcoin is “the real innovation here.” “I’ll bet you any amount of bitcoin that you’re wrong,” Lubin retorted, the pair adding the exact nature of the bet will be confirmed on social media. The exchange had come about as an offshoot of a panel involving Song, Lubin and Amber Baldet, former blockchain program lead at JPMorgan, who had just presented her new blockchain project Clovyr. Asked what he thought of it, Song “shocked” the audience by saying: I don’t see anything other than buzzwords. JPMorgan’s Lack Of ‘Substance’ “What I said wasn’t anything special,” he subsequently summarized on Twitter. I verbalized what probably a large amount of the people in the audience were thinking and much of the reaction in the room was indicating that they, too, didn’t get anything of substance from the presentation. The mood appeared friendly, Song also thanking for Baldet and Lubin for being “good sports” but nonetheless underscoring the frustration shared by many technical experts in the cryptocurrency industry about blockchain – that commercial parties can present the technology and rely on a lack of understanding to give their solutions free passage. “Giving voice to something that you know is true often results in shock and laughter. That’s what I saw,” Song continued. The entire crowd had been eating non-stop stories about how everything was going to change for the better because of the new tech, usually sponsored by a panelist. 5/ What I said wasn't anything special. I verbalized what probably a large amount of the people in the audience were thinking and much of the reaction in the room was indicating that they, too, didn't get anything of substance from the presentation. — Jimmy Song (송재준) (@jimmysong) May 15, 2018 Reacting to the episode, Saifedean Ammous, author of ‘The Bitcoin Standard,’ agreed with Song, using Lubin’s sarcastic forecast that “Bitcoin 1.0” will be the sole innovation by 2023 in his favor. “BITCOIN 1.0: STILL the only game in town,” he tweeted.

Libertarians, Business Owners, and Financial institutions are coming together in the greatest numbers we've ever seen.\nIn addition to the Libertarians, Coders, Crypto Businesses/Exchanges the roll call has some high profile industry leaders from outside the Cryptosphere, including:\n-President of the St. Louis FED\n-Twitter CEO\n-FedEx CEO\nRepresentatives from:\n-Microsoft\n-IBM\n-SEC\n-CFTC\n-World Economic Forum\n-Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency(HSARPA)\nBitcoin is being taken more seriously than ever before. Just a few years ago we were laughed at for suggesting Bitcoin would compete with the FED. Now we have presidents of FED banks speaking at the annual preeminent Bitcoin conference.\nBitcoin is turning institutions inside out. Individuals act principally in their best interests ; even if their behavior harms the gr oup as a whole. This is called \"Tragedy of the commons\" ; when a resource is overutilized to the point where it is unusable for everyone.\nBitcoin turns this on its head. Bitcoins properties attracts speculators looking out for their best interests. These speculators then have an interest in seeing Bitcoin succeed and use the leverage at their disposal to do so.\nSo while Bitcoin is a threat to the power and sovereignty of every government and bank on Earth ; it is individuals who make up those institutions.\nIndividuals within governments and banks adopt Bitcoin for (hopeful) personal profit. These people aren't trying to overthrow governments and banks; but they will do what they can to soften their institutions stance on their investment.\nAs Bitcoin continues going through its growth cycles it attracts more and more individuals. More and more people in more institutions that have a vested interest in seeing Bitcoin grow. These people support proje cts and initiatives that increase Bitcoins usefulness and therefore adds to its overall value proposition; which helps create a positive feedback loop.\nThat is the genius of the Bitcoin revolution. No bloodshed required. No protesting. Bitcoin is as much applied computer science and cryptography as it is a global psychological operation. We are re-inventing the concept of value.\nInstead of fighting the old system we are building a better system. Instead of forcing people to change with threats of violence; people willingly change to chase profits.\nThe end-game for this revolution is the end of central banks. Global Value/Currency Standard. Peoples savings will grow in value over time at the pace of productivity increases. People will no longer lose value to inflation. Governments will not be able to spend money they do not have. Unprofitable businesses supported by subsidies will fail. Defense spending will fall dramatically around the globe.\nBitc oin can solve most of the problems whose root cause is \"money\". Bitcoin cannot fix greed and human nature; but it can mitigate the damage done by greedy and power hungry individuals.\nsubmitted by /u/45sbvad\n[link] [comments] Reddit ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitcoi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "business owners", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crypto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "homeland security advanced research projects agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "st. louis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cryptosphere", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T20:41:51.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5eea5302c42a6d40e8b13550cc39050bef35bcee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeG5anP062U0e1QQmEq6Sk0-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Can you wait to prove them wrong about Bitcoin?", "title_full": "Can you wait to prove them wrong about Bitcoin?", "published": "2018-05-15T20:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.13, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5eea5302c42a6d40e8b13550cc39050bef35bcee", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmeG5anP062U0e1QQmEq6Sk0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Oppang Inamo", "published": "2018-05-15T20:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can you wait to prove them wrong about Bitcoin?", "text": "Quote: from: Kprawn on March 26, 2018, 03:23:44 PM I think a lot of people around us has told us that Bitcoin is a FAD or a SCAM or a Ponzi scheme .\nSome of our closest relatives have told us to SELL before the BUBBLE will burst. {guess we hear that enough?}\nThe media is telling everyone that Bitcoin is the tool of criminals and terrorists and child pornographers and paedophiles .\nMost of these people are not invested in Bitcoin, but it looks like they are looking for reasons to attack it.\nHow many of you want to prove them wrong?

The satoshi client is set up to just include the extra small amount as a fee to miners instead of creating change for a small amount. – Brian Armstrong Jul 9 '13 at 0:24 up vote 22 down vote\nThe definition of dust is client-specific and not a network rule. Bitcoin Core considers a transaction output to be dust, when its value is lower than the cost of spending it at the dustRelayFee rate. The default value for dustRelayFee is 3,000 satoshi per kilobyte, which results in the same dust values as the dust definition used before Bitcoin Core 0.15.0. The previous dust definition tied the dust limit to the minRelayTxFee rate and the spending cost of an output exceeding 1/3 of its value.\nAt the default dustRelayFee of 3,000 satoshi per kilobyte, the size of a P2PKH input being 148 bytes, and the size of a P2PKH output being 34 bytes, P2PKH outputs of 546 satoshis or smaller are being considered dust by Bitcoin Core. For P2WPKH (native segwit) outputs, the default dust limit computes to 294 satoshis as outputs are about 31 vbytes and inputs are about 67 vbytes.\nThe dustRelayFee can be set with the hidden command line option -dustrelayfee .\nAdditionally, Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 added a discard_rate . The discard_rate matches the longest target fee rate estimate (currently the 1,000 block fee rate estimate), but is bounded to be between at least dustRelayFee and at most 10,000 satoshi/kB.

Bitfury has hired Michael DuBose, the former head of the Computer Crime unit at the U.S. Department of Justice, to roll out its bitcoin blockchain tracking product, Crystal.\nDuBose said in a statement :\n\"Crystal makes it much easier to identify and track criminal activities on the blockchain, thereby providing a vital service to law enforcement agencies, financial institutions, and other groups.\"\nDuBose, an attorney who graduated from Harvard Law School, added, \"I look forward to helping those groups identify bad actors and build a more secure bitcoin blockchain.\"\n'Risk-Scoring System' Bitfury, a provider of bitcoin mining hardware, launched Crystal in January 2018, as BTCManager previously reported.\nCrystal tracks and scores transactions on the bitcoin blockchain to identify suspicious transactions that could be associated with illegal activities such as illicit drug sales or money-laundering.\nThe company said:\n\"Crystal was designed to be used by law enforcement agencies to track suspicious bitcoin transactions to real-world entities and determine relationships between criminal actors.\"\n( YouTube )\nBitfury CEO Valery Vavilov said the cryptocurrency industry needs a user-friendly way to track bitcoin transactions and to determine if a bitcoin address is legit.\nVavilov said:\n\"Public blockchains have the potential to fundamentally improve our day-to-day lives and be strong forces for social good.Unfortunately, there are people who exploit public blockchains and take advantage of their pseudonymity to commit crimes.\"\nBitfury, which launched in 2011 as a bitcoin mining operation, has since expanded into a full-service blockchain company. The aggressive rollout of its blockchain analytical tool comes amid escalating regulatory scrutiny of the virtual currency industry around the world.\nWinklevoss Twins Target Market Manipulators Bitfury is not the only cryptocurrency group that is enhancing its security measures. The Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron, have teamed up with Nasdaq to crack down on fraudulent bitcoin and ether trading on their cryptocurrency exchange, the Gemini Trust Company.\nThe move is part of an effort to stem price manipulation amid volcanic criticism of the erratic price fluctuations of bitcoin and other virtual currencies.\n( YouTube )\nThe cryptocurrency market's head-spinning volatility is part of the reason why avowed skeptics like billionaire Warren Buffett have dismissed crypto trading as reckless gambling .\nBuffett's observations semi-echoed the sentiments of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who mocked the crypto nouveau riche for thinking they are smarter than \"the masses\" for buying crypto before it became trendy.\nButerin underscored that no one could have foreseen the bitcoin bubble and ensuing riches it bestowed on early adopters. \"It's the luck of the draw, where everyone who won the draw seems to feel like they deserved it for being smarter,\" he laughed.\nHacks And Scams Under Microscope As bitcoin's profile has skyrocketed amid heavy media coverage, hacks and scams within the digital currency space have also climbed, underscoring the need for structured government regulation and/or better industry-wide deterrence mechanisms.\nOn May 10, 2018, authorities raided the offices of Upbit, South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchange, as BTCManager has reported.\nWhile the exact reason for the raid is unknown, there are rumors that Upbit is being investigated for illegally moving crypto from the wallets of its clients without their consent. Upbit is also accused of doctoring its accounting books to cover up mass-wrongdoing.\nThis latest news had a dampening trickle-down effect on bitcoin prices, which plunged below $8,300 following a two-week rally. But never fear: The price will rise again soon. Why? Because bitcoin is extremely volatile.\nThe post Blockchain Firm Fights Bitcoin Fraud With Justice Department Cybercrime Chief appeared first on BTCMANAGER .\n[ Telegram Channel | Original Article: ]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bitfury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael dubose", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "justice department cybercrime chief blockchain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bitfury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "computer crime", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard law school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T20:14:45.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "325e9bc84d3364ad8c8846a8a469d519c4351e9d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQMUofBDFisNygwC463uLQk-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Avoid Bitcoin ban", "title_full": "Avoid Bitcoin ban", "published": "2018-05-15T20:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 14, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "325e9bc84d3364ad8c8846a8a469d519c4351e9d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmQMUofBDFisNygwC463uLQk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jetcrypto", "published": "2018-05-15T20:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Avoid Bitcoin ban", "text": "Is it possible to block Bitcoin protocol completely in a single country or network?

Libertarians, Business Owners, and Financial institutions are coming together in the greatest numbers we've ever seen.\nIn addition to the Libertarians, Coders, Crypto Businesses/Exchanges the roll call has some high profile industry leaders from outside the Cryptosphere, including:\n-President of the St. Louis FED\n-Twitter CEO\n-FedEx CEO\nRepresentatives from:\n-Microsoft\n-IBM\n-SEC\n-CFTC\n-World Economic Forum\n-Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency(HSARPA)\nBitcoin is being taken more seriously than ever before. Just a few years ago we were laughed at for suggesting Bitcoin would compete with the FED. Now we have presidents of FED banks speaking at the annual preeminent Bitcoin conference.\nBitcoin is turning institutions inside out. Individuals act principally in their best interests ; even if their behavior harms the group as a whole. This is called \"Tragedy of the commons\" ; when a resource is overutilized to the point where it is unusable for everyone.\nBitcoin turns this on its head. Bitcoins properties attracts speculators looking out for their best interests. These speculators then have an interest in seeing Bitcoin succeed and use the leverage at their disposal to do so.\nSo while Bitcoin is a threat to the power and sovereignty of every government and bank on Earth ; it is individuals who make up those institutions.\nIndividuals within governments and banks adopt Bitcoin for (hopeful) personal profit. These people aren't trying to overthrow governments and banks; but they will do what they can to soften their institutions stance on their investment.\nAs Bitcoin continues going through its growth cycles it attracts more and more individuals. More and more people in more institutions that have a vested interest in seeing Bitcoin grow. These people support projects and initiatives that increase Bitcoins usefulness and therefore adds to its overall value proposition; which helps create a positive feedback loop.\nThat is the genius of the Bitcoin revolution. No bloodshed required. No protesting. Bitcoin is as much applied computer science and cryptography as it is a global psychological operation. We are re-inventing the concept of value.\nInstead of fighting the old system we are building a better system. Instead of forcing people to change with threats of violence; people willingly change to chase profits.\nThe end-game for this revolution is the end of central banks. Global Value/Currency Standard. Peoples savings will grow in value over time at the pace of productivity increases. People will no longer lose value to inflation. Governments will not be able to spend money they do not have. Unprofitable businesses supported by subsidies will fail. Defense spending will fall dramatically around the globe.\nBitcoin can solve most of the problems whose root cause is \"money\". Bitcoin cannot fix greed and human nature; but it can mitigate the damage done by greedy and power hungry individuals.\n submitted by /u/45sbvad\n[link] [comments]", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T16:24:09.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b07ae27c91c6e0f294f7c825700d3eec1cc03c11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmV0B5orY8lWoM9H0TqGoXys-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "You can buy KFC chicken by Bitcoin", "title_full": "You can buy KFC chicken by Bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-15T20:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 4, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b07ae27c91c6e0f294f7c825700d3eec1cc03c11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmV0B5orY8lWoM9H0TqGoXys-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Firefox07", "published": "2018-05-15T20:07:00.000+03:00", "title": "You can buy KFC chicken by Bitcoin", "text": "This is really a good thing in Canada.

Also I am new to Crypto trading fielding as well. While I was talking to one of my friends about Crypto Market. He doubted this new currency trend. As He said There is Illuminati behind this project. He submitted me some facts exacting some one's article that It is a scam and that could cause to loose everything one day. I will list them here below one by one.\n1. Bitcoin is not a company, It has no corporate entity..\n (You can't sue bitcoin, inc. If the promises you were made about bitcoin price valuations don't pan. There is no bitcoin, inc)\n2. Bitcoin doesn't have any earnings, revenues, profits, profits or P/E ratios.\n3. Bitcoin trading isn't regulated by any one.\n4. If the internet goes down, Bitcoins cease to exit.\n5. Very few accept bitcoins as form of payment. ( although this could grow)\n6. Bitcoins transactions are not free and fee getting increased time to time.\n7. You can't sue anything if you loose your bitcoins,\n8. Nearly all bitcoins promoters have a conflict of interest in attracting more buyers in to bitcoins.\n9. Bitcoin isn't very liquid market compare to stock market, Transactions can days to clear\n10. Because of bitcoin isn't regulated by the SEC, Bitcoin promoters can claim any forward - looking estimates for future\n ( the government cannot take any legal action against them )\nI would like to know you people's views regarding above facts, Really Appreciate your participation, Looking forward to learn many things from you as a newbie. Thanks in advance.\nIn my personal view, bitcoin is definitely not an illuminati scam. You may heard from someone or others that they have been scam in bitcoin but it doesn't mean that bitcoin is a scam. The scam in that situation is the person behind the account that you have interact in bitcoin. It is not illuminati I guarantee you.

A Wharton School of Business graduate, Arthur Hayes has built a reputation on his ability to trade traditional financial instruments.\nSoon after graduation, Hayes moved to Hong Kong and became a top trader at Citigroup and Deutsche Bank – establishing himself as an expert market maker and trader of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and other financial derivatives. Making the transition from traditional to digital assets, Hayes is now the acting CEO of BitMEX, the world’s largest bitcoin trading platform.\nBased out of Hong Kong, BitMEX offers 100x leveraged trading of Bitcoin, Bitcoin futures, and swaps, along with altcoin futures for Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ripple. The exchange is the world’s largest by trading volume and currently holds the record for most bitcoin traded in a single day (140 BTC).\nHayes showed up in an orange Lamborghini Huracan to the Consensus 2018 summit in New York City on Monday. In a recent interview on CNBC’s “Fast Money,” Melissa Lee asked Hayes why he chose to base BitMEX out of Hong Kong rather than the U.S. or other western countries.\nHayes explained that the state and familiarity of trading digital assets in Asia is much more established than in western societies: “Asia dominates cryptos because they’re very used to trading digital assets. South Korea has been trading digital goods related to gaming for two decades.

And while digital currency is still not widely used or understood by many average consumers, Chicago’s two main exchanges, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, became the first traditional exchanges to trade the financial products late last year, lending credibility to bitcoin and its lesser-known digital brethren.\nCoinbase is already one of the largest digital currency exchanges around the world. Coinbase’s Chicago office will serve as a central hub for some back-office technology behind the company’s products, said Paul Bauerschmidt, a former CME executive, who is leading the Chicago office.\n“It’s similar to an exchange that you’d see with ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) or CME or CBOE,” he said.\nRecruiting people who are able to build and maintain these complicated systems, especially with financial experience, is difficult in other cities, Bauerschmidt said.\n“The talent that’s here in Chicago, you can’t find anywhere else,” he said. “And especially getting as many of the key staff as we need. It’s really exciting to be able to build it here.”\nThe Chicago office also will focus on courting institutional investors, which manage assets on others’ behalf, like banks, hedge funds, mutual funds or pension funds, Bauerschmidt said.\nJohny Roumanidakis, a masters of finance student at DePaul University's Driehaus College of Business, wrote his final paper on bitcoin.

The products make it easier for these large investors to start trading and manage sophisticated trading systems, Bauerschmidt said.\nThe Chicago office currently has just six employees, but it plans to get that number up to 30 this year and reach 100 within three years.\nBitcoin’s initial trading value was just pennies in 2010, surging to more than $17,000 at one point in late 2017. It’s now trading at just under $9,000. At this point last year, a single bitcoin was worth about $1,800; two years ago it was $445.\nBitcoin was created in 2009 as an alternative to government-issued currency. A number of big companies accept it, from travel website Expedia.com to Subway sandwich shops and even online dating site OkCupid. But because it isn’t regulated by a country or other single entity like traditional currency, the price can be volatile.\nsbomkamp@chicagotribune.com\nTwitter @SamWillTravel\nRELATED STORIES\nBitcoin 101: Cryptocurrency classes are cropping up at area colleges »\nThe buzz of bitcoin: Cryptocurrency for sale at vape shops, bars and gas stations »\nIllinois House panel to study how bitcoin's underlying technology can aid government »\n Bitcoin", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5afa0408/turbine/ct-biz-coinbase-office-20180515"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bauerschmidt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul bauerschmidt", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "intercontinental exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago mercantile exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago board options exchange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cboe", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T15:15:50.066+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c3538ae911e3cd67f59fb1141e49e984a1b79769", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisaGDq2UlHqrZpCpXL61UWvvcjFgSjAr1C2NsCvlotPnSWhUFq8PCdGs-", "site_full": "www.forexfactory.com", "site": "forexfactory.com", "site_section": "http://rss.forexfactory.net/forums/interactivetrading.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FF Forums: Interactive Trading", "title": "Not-KPMG replies to: The rise of CRYPTO - Bitcoin, LTC, Ether, Dash, Monero", "title_full": "Not-KPMG replies to: The rise of CRYPTO - Bitcoin, LTC, Ether, Dash, Monero", "published": "2018-05-15T19:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn-assets.forexfactory.net/images/misc/ff_fb_logo.gif", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2596, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c3538ae911e3cd67f59fb1141e49e984a1b79769", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR59MpUR3MisaGDq2UlHqrZpCpXL61UWvvcjFgSjAr1C2NsCvlotPnSWhUFq8PCdGs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2018-05-15T19:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Not-KPMG replies to: The rise of CRYPTO - Bitcoin, LTC, Ether, Dash, Monero", "text": "| Joined Sep 2007 | Status: Member | 85 Posts | Invisible Ethereum maintains bullish bias by Fawad Razaqzada The technical outlook on Ethereum hasn’t changed much since our last update on it at the start of the month (see \" Ethereum leads crypto upsurge as stocks slump \" for more). As mentioned then, ETH/USD was showing relative strength among the major cryptos, which still remains the case. Although last week’s pullback saw Ethereum go below the $700 support level, it has now risen back above it and price never broke below the invalidation level of $627 to tilt the bias back to bearish. With Ethereum also back above the 200-day average, the bullish bias thus remains intact for the time being. We had also identified the area between $800 and $835, which was formerly support, as the next resistance zone. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Source: TradingView and FOREX.com UK* As it turned out, this area did in fact turn into resistance. However, the resulting sell-off from this area has been mild thus far, pointing to modest profit-taking there. Going forward, the bulls will be hoping that it clears this $800-$835 resistance range in order to confirm that the buyers are well and truly in control again. If this happens to be the case then the next bullish objective would be the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $1016/7. Alternatively, if Ethereum goes back below the aforementioned $700 support level and holds below it for a while then this would increase the likelihood of a breakdown below that $627 level. In this potential scenario, Ethereum’s next stop could very well be around the next support at $535 or lower. *Please note, this product is not available to US clients. 1", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://on.forex.com/2Im83lA"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T20:20:06.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cfa9ca8c09489b4cff4e4e04722f7c3da83be0bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jdc_.vC256dNeL25q5clyxQileOJ8ULUsdKZnWqZiauqa0DqFq7XQY1aZygqV5nDAtwJCBrxBPWw7c2OEYbPs9qYUxKxnom2kE.YQIRv9pejSQ2Uqtkdm0vAbj5NA5kX51Mi.DcSPtD1jPHUhV76KgQ2GujbqlmHIz3K6Phfxdr0Q--", "site_full": "canadianstocktrader.ca", "site": "canadianstocktrader.ca", "site_section": "http://canadianstocktrader.ca/feed", "site_categories": ["stocks", "finance"], "section_title": "Canadian Stock Trader", "title": "WWIII Has Been Postponed For Now!

The price of bitcoin has rallied this week, as the world's most valuable cryptocurrency continues its recovery from its worst ever start to a year (Reuters)\nBitcoin has already hit its lowest price point of the year, according to Mr Lee, having fallen to around $6,500 in early February.\n“In general, we see 2018 being a strong year, but we see the larger and more established blockchains growing in dominance in 2018,” the research note said, highlighting ethereum as one of the other cryptocurrencies set to benefit.\n“Bottom line: We expect bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to behave similarly to prior years and rally during Consensus.”\nThe turn-around in fortunes has been reflected across cryptocurrency markets, with ethereum, bitcoin cash and ripple all seeing significant gains since early April.

Since then, bitcoin has suffered from its worst ever start to a year — fitting with some analyst theories that the world's most valuable cryptocurrency was experiencing a bubble. The rapid decline was followed by a relative period of stability that many cryptocurrency experts predicted would precede more gains. How high could the price of bitcoin go? Cryptocurrency analysts vary dramatically in their predictions for bitcoin's price. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin said in February that cryptocurrencies \"could drop to near-zero at any time,\" telling his Twitter followers to not put in more money than they can afford to lose. Since then, ethereum's price has fluctuated between $950 and $350 and currently hovers around $800. May 2018 will be the last time we ever see #bitcoin under $10,000 — Charlie Shrem (@CharlieShrem) 3 May 2018 Others have been far more optimistic, with bitcoin expert Michael Jackson telling The Independent that he believed bitcoin would recover to its heights of last year, and even go well beyond. As bitcoin's price approached $10,000 this week, one Twitter user noted that its average daily growth rate since 2009 is around 0.5 per cent. If it continues this growth, the Twitter user speculated , one bitcoin would be worth $5.6 million by 2021.

Seminole becomes the first county to accept payments in bitcoin cash and bitcoin in the United States.\nJoel Greenberg, the State tax collector, announced the County would begin using BitPay, a cryptocurrency payment processor, to receive payments starting June 2018. Sponsored Links Source: SeminoleTax\nSeminole residents will be able to make an array of payments using virtual currencies including property taxes as well as fees relating to tags, driver’s license, titles and ID cards. Digital Currencies: Ideal Choice\nFrom his statement, Greenberg seemed to appreciate cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology, the blockchain, as appropriate tech innovations for driving efficient service delivery in the County.\nAcknowledging the need to shift to cryptocurrencies, Greenberg highlighted features such as transparency, efficiency, fraud resistance and accuracy that make digital currencies an ideal choice for his office.\n“We live in a world where technology has made access to services on demand, and we should expect the same from our government,” his statement read in part.\n“The aim of my tenure in office is to make our customer experience faster, smarter, and more efficient, and to bring government services from the 18th century into the 21st century and one way is the addition of cryptocurrency to our payment options.”\nEven so, Greenberg’s move to accept cryptocurrency payments seems to be aligned to the commitment he made to his voters in 2016. During the campaigns, he promised the people of Seminole county that he would introduce new technologies. Growing Interest\nFor BitPay, the partnership with Seminole County is highly significant because it is the first of its kind for the company.\nJeremie Beaudry, Head of Compliance at BitPay said, “With the Seminole County Tax Collector’s office, we have engaged our first government agency to accept bitcoin and bitcoin cash by making it easy and seamless for them.”\nHowever, Seminole County isn’t the only government office that has taken steps to integrate cryptocurrencies into its payment system.\nEarlier in 2018, legislators in states such as Georgia and Arizona proposed laws aimed at allowing payment of state taxes using virtual currencies like bitcoin. Is the Juice Worth the Squeeze?\nEven as Seminole County hopes to utilize BitPay to facilitate fast and cheaper payments for its residents, there are concerns that transactions on the Bitcoin network might be too expensive, even impractical for small amounts.\nAt the peak of cryptocurrency popularity and price in December 2017, bitcoin transaction costs hit a high of $37 for a single transaction which forced BitPay to disallow purchases below $100.\nCurrently, a single bitcoin transaction costs about $1.26. In addition to this, Seminole County residents will be expected to cater for a one percent transaction fee payable to BitPay.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Will Bitcoin Be the Digital Coin of the Future? Goldman's former President says he wants a more mainstream digital-currency alternative. May 15, 2018 WSP\nGary Cohn, the former chief economic adviser to the Trump administration, commented Tuesday on Bitcoin (BTC) and the crypto’s limited utility as a currency, saying the world will have a global digital coin that is not bitcoin.\n“I’m not a big believer in bitcoin. I am a believer in blockchain technology,” Cohn told CNBC’s Bob Pisani in an interview ; his first since leaving the White House.\n“I do think we will have a global cryptocurrency at some point where the world understands it and it’s not based on mining costs or cost of electricity or things like that,” the former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) executive said.\nBitcoins are created via an energy-intensive system called “mining”. Through this process records of a new transaction are added to the Blockchain-an incorruptible public digital ledger of financial transactions between two parties in the bitcoin network that eliminates the need for a third-party intermediary.\nWhile the blockchain technology is an obvious breakthrough, the tech – which again here, has shown many remarkable uses – has run into challenges such as handling high transaction volume. In fact, bitcoin network transactions that should take minutes are taking days or not going through at all. Even more troubling is the fact that fees remain high. In December of last year, the transaction fee for sending $1 from one bitcoin wallet to another was 19 bucks. Cohn, whose comments reflect growing doubts about the real world applications for bitcoin, expects the digital coin of the future will be simpler than bitcoin.\n“It will be a more easily understood cryptocurrency,” he said. “It will probably have some blockchain technology behind it, but it will be much more easily understood how it’s created, how it moves and how people can use it.”\nCohn is not the first top finance guy to pour cold water on bitcoin. J.P. Morgan’s (NYSE:JPM) Jamie Dimon has called the crypto a “fraud”, while billionaire Warren Buffett has said that the craze over the digital currency and other cryptocurrencies won’t end well.\nObviously, only time will tell if bitcoin despite its unpredictable fluctuations – the world’s largest crypto by market cap (currently printing $155 Billion) spiked from about a dollar in 2011 to as high as $20,000 in late 2017 – will be able to weather the imperfections and suspicions and become not only a major market player but also a valid alternative to fiat currencies.\nAt last check, BTC was trading a little over the $9K per coin level.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gary cohn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cohn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob pisani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-16T01:01:02.061+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "89bd0fedd634cd2304598fc6a4da2f1385395fac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9qqruij56f9OMicHPdRxcW__jByKzpfMwjwPlDvERYIJ9jR3h_enErWPb_jJ1RNVohoFG1.mc0jN6WoVnkII99_jxlaNT_haAHeCx5RlMSEcU42E95y5sMRrD7976b3UNxi41bAnLSO6z6At4Ijp4Cx8XL_ovaTv2fRttK0kpErh8PvF8mxHrG", "site_full": "www.pressat.co.uk", "site": "pressat.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.pressat.co.uk/rss/", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "Pressat Main Newswire", "title": "Bitcoin Foundation Founder Charlie Shrem Joins XYO Network Advisory Board", "title_full": "Bitcoin Foundation Founder Charlie Shrem Joins XYO Network Advisory Board", "published": "2018-05-15T19:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.pressat.co.uk/media/cache/0x60-72427fc2a2f553e97b04f4da760c80ef.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "89bd0fedd634cd2304598fc6a4da2f1385395fac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9qqruij56f9OMicHPdRxcW__jByKzpfMwjwPlDvERYIJ9jR3h_enErWPb_jJ1RNVohoFG1.mc0jN6WoVnkII99_jxlaNT_haAHeCx5RlMSEcU42E95y5sMRrD7976b3UNxi41bAnLSO6z6At4Ijp4Cx8XL_ovaTv2fRttK0kpErh8PvF8mxHrG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Pressat", "published": "2018-05-15T19:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Foundation Founder Charlie Shrem Joins XYO Network Advisory Board", "text": "Bitcoin Foundation Founder Charlie Shrem Joins XYO Network Advisory Board News provided by XYO Network\nThe XYO Network announces today that Charlie Shrem has joined the Board of Advisors. Shrem is a bitcoin pioneer, social economist, digital currency trader and is currently the founder of Crypto.IQ. His work in this field is legendary.\nIn 2011, at the dawn of the crypto era, Shrem founded BitInstant, the first and largest Bitcoin company. In 2013, he founded the Bitcoin Foundation and served as its Vice Chairman. Since then, Charlie has advised more than a dozen digital currency companies, launched and managed numerous partnerships between crypto and non-crypto companies, and is the go-to guy for some of the world’s wealthiest entrepreneurs. He recently started Crypto.IQ, a premier advisory firm providing expert research, education and advice in the world of crypto assets. In short, he is the ultimate insider at the epicenter.\nShrem was an early change-maker for bitcoin, identifying some of the initial challenges and quickly working to overcome them so that it could be adopted on a mass scale. His company BitInstant was born out of the frustration of losing bitcoins due to long transaction times. At one time, it processed 30% of all bitcoin transactions. Shrem is responsible for bringing cryptocurrency to the masses by partnering with MoneyGram to allow cash deposits for bitcoin at over 700,000 US locations.\n“Shrem’s first hand experience with both the actual and perceived limitations of digital currency, followed by rapid innovation to overcome them, is exactly what we need to introduce a new cryptolocation technology on a massive and global scale,” said XYO Network co-founder Markus Levin.\nThe XYO Network is the next generation of GPS technology as it provides an efficient and foolproof way to deliver trustworthy location through cryptolocation technology that protects privacy while providing greater accuracy. With a platform of over one million connected beacon devices already in circulation, the blockchain technology can jump from the online realm into the real world with precise physical coordinates.\nAs the world leader in blockchain location technology, the XYO Network can serve as an Internet of Things (IoT) backbone for smart cities of the future. It can power everything from automated parking payments to traffic flow optimization, self-driving cars, autonomous drone delivery, airline luggage tracking, e-commerce, and many additional applications. It can even extend beyond the Earth to vehicle and equipment location services on the Moon or even Mars.\nFor additional information, visit xyo.network .\nAbout XYO Network:\nXYO Network built the world’s first decentralized location verification system with more than one million location tracking devices in circulation around the world. After years of investment and breakthroughs in crypto-location technology, XYO is poised to help bring the promise and the benefits of blockchain technology to the real world on a massive and global scale. This can have a profound impact on businesses that rely on the delivery of goods and services requiring non-forgeable and verifiable location data. It can power current applications like eCommerce as well as the backbone for smart cities of the future including the Internet of Things (IoT), self-driving vehicles, autonomous delivery drones, and even location tracking on the Moon and Mars.

Investors can then use their newly-acquired Bitcoin or Ethereum to buy United Bitcoin using one of the exchanges listed above.\nnew TradingView.widget({ “height”: 400, “width”: 650, “symbol”: “UBTCUSD”, “interval”: “D”, “timezone”: “Etc/UTC”, “theme”: “White”, “style”: “1”, “locale”: “en”, “toolbar_bg”: “#f1f3f6”, “enable_publishing”: false, “hideideas”: true, “referral_id”: “2588”}); Receive News & Updates for United Bitcoin updates for United Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies CryptoBeat newsletter .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.marketbeat.com/cryptocurrencies/newsletter/?symbol=CURRENCY:UBTC&utm_source=MarketBeatPopup&utm_medium=MarketBeatPopup", "https://www.marketbeat.com/cryptocurrencies/united-bitcoin/", "http://ub.com/", "http://twitter.com/share", "https://www.coinbase.com/join/52afc5ac562b15091600001d", "https://www.twitter.com/United_Bitcoin", "https://www.marketbeat.com/newsletter/default.aspx"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joulecoin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "united bitcoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubtc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fsn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tgc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coinnest", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T19:43:07.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a9bd642d5ec01ec46cb78d0adb9bf04e7591aa4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va76FOLyT9V2LbUHbb5S.MqdW8q97iXwyQMUBDJjYIjU1ZqSSKZjlDalY-", "site_full": "bitcoin.stackexchange.com", "site": "stackexchange.com", "site_section": "http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/feeds", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Recent Questions - Bitcoin Stack Exchange", "title": "How can Bitcoin be stolen?", "title_full": "How can Bitcoin be stolen?", "published": "2018-05-15T19:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/bitcoin/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=462e8b9b382b", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 179, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4, "comments": 0, "shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3a9bd642d5ec01ec46cb78d0adb9bf04e7591aa4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1NQAGPcL4XNKxUSONLhho4nD9EN9YzYw_Lv5wX5Va76FOLyT9V2LbUHbb5S.MqdW8q97iXwyQMUBDJjYIjU1ZqSSKZjlDalY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "user71922", "published": "2018-05-15T19:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "How can Bitcoin be stolen?", "text": "up vote 0 down vote\nFirstly, there is no \"each Bitcoin\".

If you are, LedgerX is launching a Bitcoin savings account that might be right up your alley. The LedgerX Bitcoin Savings Account\nThe cryptocurrency asset management platform, LedgerX, is launching the first Bitcoin (BTC) savings account that will be regulated by the Commodities Future Trading Commission (CFTC), reports Forbes. The goal of the Bitcoin savings account is to provide investors with a fiat-based yield on their Bitcoin holdings. This is done through a simplified version of a call overwrite.\nAll an investor needs to do is choose the implied rate they want to earn and the number of Bitcoins the yield will be applied to. Then, they just need to submit these choices to the LedgerX engine that is already powering their Bitcoin options product.\nThe LedgerX Bitcoin savings account has two CFTC licenses. One is the derivatives clearing organization (DCO) license, and the other is a swap execution facility (SEF) license.\nThe Bitcoin savings account was designed based on LedgerX’s customer use patterns – but it isn’t for everyone. The product was designed to appeal to long-term Bitcoin investors, those who prefer to HODL than to sell. The point of the accounts is to earn interest off of the Bitcoin that is deposited into them – much in the way a regular savings account works.\n>> Consensus 2018: NYC Blockchain Week Brings in $17 Million Bitcoin (BTC) Price\nBitcoin (BTC) is currently selling for $8,534.98, which puts the coin down 2.90% in the past 24 hours. To put that a little more into perspective, this time last year, Bitcoin was selling for $1,728.04, according to data from CoinMarketCap . Those are the kinds of gains that HODLers HODL for.\nThe Bitcoin savings account offered by LedgerX won’t be for everyone. Bitcoin’s volatility is what makes the product work, but the coin’s unpredictability is also what makes it a risky move.\nWould you be willing to try a Bitcoin savings account?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://cryptocurrencynews.com/daily-news/blockchain/consensus-2018-nyc-blockchain-week-2/", "https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2018/05/15/ledgerx-launches-first-cftc-regulated-bitcoin-savings-accounts/#540b4b718094"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "samara malkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ledgerx", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forbes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "btc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commodities future trading commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cftc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T19:41:11.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "24e3f4c63d86f6b97a190f48581a824164622133", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSKlBCa5SRpBY1yfFtVd3J8YJUWVi2MeOn7Aj8CmzzIQbtncyEMv9J8ACuGflFdyeXcGIe9HngfZb8yVxcjYB0AC49RKhget9R9.2qmY0KFlE-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/new/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Bitcoin - The Internet of Money ", "title": "First talk of The London Bitcoin Cash Conference is now available on Youtube!

They are mining ‘digital gold’, or cryptocurrencies, and helping them succeed (think ‘moon’ and ‘lambo’) is the newly launched mining program, VCloud Mining . VCloud Mining is a bitcoin mining program based on hosted technology, and unlike competition, has introduced just the features that both new and experienced miners would love.\nDigital currencies such as Bitcoin are ‘mined’, not physically, but by using computing power (called hash rate) to solve complex mathematical problems. Bitcoin cloud mining is a legal activity, and is the other alternative to buying and trading cryptocurrencies. Since it is practically worthless today to use desktops and graphics cards to mine Bitcoin, investors and crypto fans use hosted mining services such as VCloud Mining, where they can buy hash power, rent equipment and see their dollars convert into digital gold.\nVCloud Mining has introduced some novel features to make bitcoin mining even more enticing and profitable. Instead of renting, investors actually own the mining hardware and chips, thus keeping full control. The mining platform is open 24/7, and offers a life-time contract, unlike one or two year contracts offered elsewhere. All hardware is maintained and kept in the US in optimal working conditions for maximum performance.\n“ The profitability of mining depends on hash power, and VCloud Mining offers a global mining pool that works on more power so as to mine more Bitcoins at a faster rate. All Bitcoin rewards are distributed daily into the investor’s wallet ,” said a spokesperson for VCloud Mining.\nThe lifetime, open ended contract offered by VCloud Mining gives investors ownership of ASIC chips at a specified hash rate.

BCH\\/USD must stay above the $1,400 and $1,360 support levels to remain in a bullish zone. \\n Bitcoin Cash Price Upside Hurdle \\n\nThere were a couple of swing moves in bitcoin cash price above the $1,360 support level against the US Dollar. The price attempted to move above the $1,500 resistance on a couple of occasions. However, buyers failed to gain upside momentum above $1,500. It seems like the price is struggling to clear a strong sell wall near $1,500 and is currently following the 100 hourly simple moving average. \\n\nIt recently traded as high as $1,493 before starting a downside correction. It moved down below the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $1,331 low to $1,493 high. However, the downside move was limited by the $1,400 support area. There is also a short-term bullish trend line forming with support at $1,400 on the hourly chart of the BCH\\/USD pair. Moreover, the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last leg from the $1,331 low to $1,493 high also acted as a support during the recent slide. \\n\n\\n\nLooking at the chart , the price must settle above the $1,440 resistance and the 100 hourly SMA to gain momentum. A successful close above 100 hourly SMA could open the doors for a break above the $1,500 resistance in the near term. \\n\nLooking at the technical indicators: \\n\nHourly MACD \\u2013 The MACD for BCH\\/USD is currently flat in the bearish zone. \\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \\u2013 The RSI for BCH\\/USD is still below the 50 level. \\n\nMajor Support Level \\u2013 $1,400 \\n\nMajor Resistance Level \\u2013 $1,500 \\n\nThe post Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis: BCH\\/USD Consolidating Below $1,500 appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "kraken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T11:10:19.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "86ade4ff9ca2dc3bfb342579405b979eec7458ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNA7jBMAJH4yJHTuhBo_ot9v4W12MTl6aHS.S9n7ZxXeXvxR_XPD0DlBN1FmXyLy1_2qYhA1i4zJy", "site_full": "www.barchart.com", "site": "barchart.com", "site_section": "https://www.barchart.com/news/news-btc", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "NewsBTC - Barchart.com", "title": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights \\n \\n Bitcoin price", "title_full": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights \\n \\n Bitcoin price", "published": "2018-05-15T19:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 10026, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "86ade4ff9ca2dc3bfb342579405b979eec7458ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQcnBTGAebPurKZB8rimTynJm3RwRZz2XUr3QnGYnPkNA7jBMAJH4yJHTuhBo_ot9v4W12MTl6aHS.S9n7ZxXeXvxR_XPD0DlBN1FmXyLy1_2qYhA1i4zJy", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sarah Jenn", "published": "2018-05-15T19:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights \\n \\n Bitcoin price", "text": "Bitcoin Price Key Highlights \\n \\n Bitcoin price has bounced off the area of interest previously highlighted to signal that the selloff would resume. \\n Applying the Fibonacci extension tool shows how low bitcoin could go from here. \\n Technical indicators are showing mixed signals, with the oscillators reflecting more bearish pressure. \\n \\n\nBitcoin price is bouncing off the downtrend line and looks ready to resume the drop to new lows. \\n\nTechnical Indicators Signals \\n\nThe 100 SMA is below the longer-term 200 SMA to confirm that the path of least resistance is to the downside or that the selloff is more likely to continue than to reverse. The 200 SMA also lines up with the downtrend line to add to its strength as a ceiling. \\n\nHowever, the gap between the moving averages is narrowing to signal a potential upward crossover or return in bullish momentum. The 100 SMA might also be able to hold as dynamic support. If so, a move past the trend line, swing high and $9000 mark could confirm that an uptrend is taking place. \\n\nRSI is turning lower to show that sellers have the upper hand. Stochastic has also made its way out of the overbought zone and is heading south, so bitcoin price might follow suit. The 38.2% extension is at the $8400 area and the 50% level is close to the swing low. Stronger selling momentum could take bitcoin price to the 78.6% extension at $7913 or the full extension at $7650. \\n\n \\n BTC\\/USD 1-hour Chart from TradingView \\n\nMarket Factors \\n\nBitcoin price seems to be off to another shaky start for the week as another failed attempt at breaking past $9,000 has drawn more selling pressure and spooked some bulls. However, positive updates in the industry are still popping up and could ultimately allow the climb to resume. \\n\nAt the moment, what’s keeping investors on edge is the possibility that Mt. Gox will short another set of bitcoin to pay off its creditors. An estimated 8,000 coins are still up for selling, so this could have a huge weight on price. \\n\nThe post Bitcoin Price Watch: How Low Can BTC Go? appeared first on NewsBTC .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2018-05-15T11:10:45.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a91ffdcbdd76bc0247edea89b9520d7ba05b66a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS2nFkDEHzqIxQs3pfua1to-", "site_full": "bitcointalk.org", "site": "bitcointalk.org", "site_section": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Bitcoin Discussion", "title": "Opportunity to sell for bitcoin", "title_full": "Opportunity to sell for bitcoin", "published": "2018-05-15T19:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 19, "participants_count": 20, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.047, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 8386, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a91ffdcbdd76bc0247edea89b9520d7ba05b66a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSZGj5mhv0fFiIUVTjK1hOj6lg4EugRIADcz5gbRltdmS2nFkDEHzqIxQs3pfua1to-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "coinluisa", "published": "2018-05-15T19:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Opportunity to sell for bitcoin", "text": "Quote: from: IllumTSC on March 06, 2018, 10:35:32 AM I was wondering, if you had an opportunity to sell your stuff alike cars, pc, homethings and etc., would you sell it for bitcoin (or maybe other altcoin)?
